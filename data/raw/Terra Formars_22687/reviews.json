            "content": "Every now and then there's an anime that's released that walks the delicate line of being called absolute garbage and absolute FUCKING garbage. These shows tend to focus heavily on shock factor deaths as a one trick pony, which in turn removes any integrity it may have. Some notable cases include Elfen Lied, Gantz, Mirai Nikki, Deadman Wonderland and now the next anime to carry the torch Terra Formars, has stepped up for the challenge. \r\nStory: 2/10\r\nStory? What story? Government conspiracies, the mission of Bug II and anything else the show brought up remains unresolved. Plot points that go nowhere and simply end abruptly. It'slike slowly going up the rails of a roller coaster and getting ready for the ride but the ride never happens. The show treats the material as more of a glorified add to read the manga than a stand alone work. This co-dependence on the source material to make a cohesive story is just lazy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nYou'd think by now that CGI will be used in better effect in complimenting a show, right? Well, Terra Formars spits on the face of innovation, giving us hoards of horrid CGI cockroaches that rival that of Gonzo's track record. And to top it all off, it's simply the same design copied and pasted. The character designs, also deserve special mention for looking rather stiff. It feels like no effort or love was placed into this series. The only noteworthy mention should be about the grim backgrounds of the Mars environment. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe same tracks were played continuously, showing no variation at all. Nothing worth listening to on its own and nothing that really grabs your attention. They simply serve to follow the scenes, but does nothing to heighten them. Voice performances were fine. Each character's voice actor matched their given traits, standouts being Michelle K. Davis. Of course, it will all be forgotten almost as soon as you're finished with the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not even sure this cast can even be considered \"characters\". They didn't even manage to make them 2 dimensional. There's more depth in your run of the mill shounen  protagonist than any of these \"characters\". They mostly follow the lines of common fodder or OP roach killer. \\n\r\nThrowing in a depressing backstory doesn't qualify as proper characterization. Especially if we don't even remember them by the time the 20min run time is up.  It seems like characters were only introduced to be killed by the next episode. Not only giving you no time to even care about them, but it also broke immersion when death is treated with no tension. Just a fodder fest of people we don't give a fuck about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm a completionist, the only reason I even finished this nonsense was because of the short run time. Unlike other nonsensical series like Elfen Lied, Terra Formars became more of a chore to watch. I'd rather take my chances watching another Michael Bay film that sitting through this again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nTerra Formars was simply another rushed adaptation that felt more like an eyegasm for the fans than an actual show. If you're a fan of excessive gore or the manga then this might be for you.",

            "content": "Notes\r\n-I haven\u2019t read the manga.\r\n-I watched the uncensored release of the anime.\r\nTerraformars, an anime about a bunch of genetically modified humans with animal powers that get sent to Mars to exterminate a race of hyper evolved humanoid cockroaches called Johj. Sounds radical, right? Unfortunately it isn\u2019t and here i\u2019ll explain why.\r\nStory: \r\nReally, there\u2019s not a whole lot to talk about in terms of story. The entire plot is just an excuse to get the characters to Mars as quickly as possible and make them fight a whole lot and i suppose it does achieve that just fine.\r\nThe main problem with the storytelling in Terraformars isthe pacing. \\n\r\nFor a series that prides itself on being nothing but dumb action and violent fights, it\u2019s actually painfully slow. We get shots that linger forever for no good reason, characters standing around doing and saying nothing for extended periods of time, tons of narrator delivered exposition and a ludicrous amount of flashbacks that sometimes take up the entire duration of an episode, while not really adding anything substantial. The best moments of the show are when it throws away any pretense of storytelling and just goes into full-on hot-blooded action-mode. Unfortunately these moments are rarer than you might assume and usually over quite quickly. \\n\r\nSpecial shout-out to the shitty worldbuilding of this series. \\n\r\nTerraformars is apparently set 600 years in the future, yet aside from space travel, genetic manipulation and terraforming i guess, no technological advancements were made by the human race. The people back on earth still drive the same cars, dress in the same clothes and use the same fucking smartphones as we do today. Why even set the series this far in the future, if you\u2019re not gonna use it for some interesting worldbuilding? \\n\r\nThe lightning fast evolution of the humanoid cockroaches is ridiculous anyway, may as well have set it fifty years in the future and not expose your complete lack of imagination. \\n\r\nOh yeah, there\u2019s also some government conspiracy subplot, but no one cares.\\n\r\nThe series doesnt\u2019t even have  any conclusion at all, it\u2019s set up for a sequel  that will undoubtedly happen considering the popularity of it\u2019s manga counterpart. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters of Terraformars are about as boring and one dimensional as they come. The series utilizes constant long-ass flashbacks with sappy background stories to flesh out the characters, but it never works out, the characters remain uninteresting and all the flashbacks achieve is to kill any feeling of momentum this action series might have had. \\n\r\nI shit you not, there\u2019s one character whose entire backstory involves people in his life telling him what a boring person he is. \\n\r\nHowever, this fleshing out only applies to a handful of the surprisingly large cast of Terraformars. The rest? Nameless cannon fodder that is absolutely and utterly useless and usually spend their time sitting around waiting to be killed. \\n\r\nAlso, holy fuck Terraformars, your only important German character is named Adolf, are you fucking shitting me? Would it have killed the writers to spend five seconds to google more appropriate German names?\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe OP is a generic fast paced buttrock track and it\u2019s just kinda eh, but i can\u2019t shake the feeling that it doesn\u2019t really fit the series. I suppose i expected something a bit darker and more atmospheric. \\n\r\nThe ED i don\u2018t even really remember to be honest, the music of the series in general is fairly forgettable. \\n\r\nAs far as voice acting goes, it\u2019s all fitting for the characters, but no one in the cast really delivers a standout performance. \\n\\n\r\nVisuals:\\n\r\nThe character designs are one of the few things in Terraformars i can praise. As someone who appreciates semi realistic human designs in anime, this stuff is right up my alleyway. The animal transformations of the humans also look pretty cool.\\n\r\nThe same thing can\u2019t be said of the primary antagonists of the series, unfortunately. The designs of the humanoid cockroaches or Johj have gained some notoriety for being 'racist', as they look almost like caricatures of large muscular black guys. I looked into it and apparently they are based on the homo erectus and not black people. \\n\r\nLooking at it that way, the design makes some sense, but is still not a great choice, as the Johj look silly and not particularly threatening. I feel like this is a wasted opportunity, the creators of the series could have created something truly horrifying, considering the creatures are based on fucking cockroaches of all things. The Johj could have been some serious nightmare fuel, instead they are silly cavemen. \\n\r\nAnimation in the series is fine when it counts, the fight scenes namely. It\u2019s fairly consistent and the battles feel impactful, violent and on occasion even well choreographed. Too bad the color palette is so ugly, as all the colors in Terraformars look washed out and muddy. \\n\r\nI suppose this was to give the series a darker and gritty look, but it ends up just being unappealing. \\n\r\nThere\u2019s also this distracting noise filter that they kept using seemingly at random. What was the point of that? It just made the already so-so visuals of the series look shittier whenever it was active. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI\u2019m not gonna lie, as much as i shit on this series, there were some pretty kickass moments hidden in there, namely  whenever the action was in full effect, but they are few and far between and get marred by all the problems plagueing this series. If nothing else, at least Terraformars is not particularly long and won\u2019t waste a whole lot of your time.\\n\r\nAnd this may sound unbelievable, but the educational value of Terraformars is actually surprisingly high (that is, more than nothing). You will pick up a lot of weird animal facts in this series, so there\u2019s that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nTerraformars is a series with a whole buttload of problems. Even if you are looking for a short, violent, action series, which is exactly what Terraformars is, there\u2019s a lot of better stuff out there that you should check out instead.\\n\r\nI give it a final rating of 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, please excuse any grammatical mistakes, as English is not my first language. And please feel free to leave me some feedback, i really want to improve.\\n",

            "content": "You know something no one wants to see at a lunch or dinner table? Cockroaches. Those little critters stalks around with their creepy legs and spreads disgusting odor near your delicious food. Worst yet, they want your food. But do you know what\u2019s even more disgusting or perhaps terrifying? It\u2019s when you become the food. No lie. Terra Formars reverses the situation when humans are the prey as cockroaches (also known as Terra Formars) hunt down humans to eliminate them from existence. There\u2019s something to think about\u2026\r\nFor a series based off of the same name, adaptation pacing becomes a chore to handle. I don\u2019t givemuch credit for the studio or director when they do a sloppy job as the first few episodes can really make people wonder if this is all worth it. Forget the word \u2018all\u2019, but it\u2019s more like partial considering the first few episodes broadcasted on TV were obstructed by arsine censorship. (they do fix it later though) But beyond that technical point, Terra Formars isn\u2019t really a groundbreaking show. \\n\\n\r\nTaking for face value, the show is actually pretty simple to understand. It takes place in a futuristic setting far beyond our present year. We also get alien species known as the Terra Formars, creatures who look like cockroaches but are many times its size with irregular body structure and abnormal thirst for destruction. Then, there are the humans that fights them on planet Mars. Actually, their original goal is to collect research examples as a deadly virus has taken hold on the human population but now they are playing a case of survival game against these creatures. As unoriginal as the premise sounds, the show has plenty of reasons to why viewers might be interested. The idea of fighting against alien species is thought provoking as it opens many opportunities to explore the show\u2019s gimmicks, mechanics, and characters. The problem is that the first episode leaves open a gap that needs to be filled when in terms of getting everything started. It launches the characters on full scale towards their mission and skips their background and origins. That\u2019s not the main problem though as the show accelerates fast into outer space for the main course. There\u2019s not much time for preparation either as the crew gets ambushed on their way to space.\\n\\n\r\nThis season covers the Annex I arc detailing the stories of a group of crew members including lead protagonist Komachi Shokichi. Made up of members of many different countries of origins, the series\u2019 characterization is shallow at best for the first half of the season. We don\u2019t\u2019 find out too much about much of the main characters except a select few such as Komachi. The case of death flags are also raised high for certain characters as flashbacks are played and their actions are recorded as last wills. However, the show does give more sympathy and depth for other characters later on. A prominent example is Adolf who is highlighted by flashbacks to characterize his motives and roles in the series. And as such, the reality can easily be realized of the cruelty on the frontlines. After all, the show is clearly violent, gory, and obviously isn\u2019t afraid to kill anyone in the show. Whether you\u2019re a badass action girl like Michelle or a first year newbie, Terra Formars preys on humans as if they are helpless drones. And to be honest, this show doesn\u2019t stray far from that as humans are portrayed as the underdog. However, action does contradict this later on as we see humans fight back in a tale that can be described as \u201cbug war\u201d. I label it as such because humans who have experimented on themselves are able to adapt insect-like attributes and possesses their abilities to fight on par with the Terra Formars. For the action itself though, this show can only be watchable when it\u2019s not obstructed the black censors of death. The original TV broadcasted aired the first three episodes that made itself look like a comedy. When you get scenes blocked by black bars or basketball shaped ovals, it really makes itself look like a joke. (example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzmOsvCCIAARgDt.jpg) Luckily, the show eventually got uncensored versions although the gore is still not as explicit as the manga. While shock value may sometimes be looked down upon as trying to sell its product, I think it\u2019s necessary for this show to adapt that with justice. This is because the show is violent. It is explicitly gory that needs to get the message across of what a sci-fi horror should be like. Although certain scenes are left out from the manga, the uncensored action is tolerable with sensible OST. \\n\\n\r\nOn the scientific side of the story, the show falls apart with the explanation. In retrospect, it is vague and hard to take in all at once. We don\u2019t know much about the origins of the Terra Formars besides their basic attributes and we can make from their evolution. Speaking of which, the show actually adapts more of that as we find out how well the cockroaches adapt to their environment. Still, the generational concept weakens itself and tries way too hard when it comes to its elements. It\u2019s lazy when it comes to crafting the story by skipping certain parts while lauding viewers to experience what the \u2018bug war\u2019 is like. But to experience that, the show also needs to make us feel attached to the characters. Unfortunately, it\u2019s far from achieving that with the certain deaths of various key characters. I do give some credit for the daring risks this show takes though as well as some unpredictable twists that comes by a few times. However, Terra Formars is more like a sci-fi horror that is treated as an action flick rather than a creative story. It has this engaging premise but is over-egged with saturated action with not enough context. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of artwork, the show is crude on most parts but not in terms of actual quality. It simply creates a mature atmosphere with the main characters in this futuristic setting. Speaking of which, the series hardly has any world building so don\u2019t expect the setting to steer its engine towards that direction. What you do have are adult characters, in contrast to the teenagers we often see trying to save the world. This is actually a positive and refreshing to see as we can tell the series has a more serious feeling. The characters are designed to look like troops ready to go to war. Their face expressions tells of a tale of horror just by looking at them. Besides some oddball fan service on occasions, the series has decent artwork and fitting character designs. However, the Terra Formars are crafted in a way that can spark some controversy because they resemble Homo Erectus. It\u2019s also hard to take them seriously with their ridiculously shaped eyes, overly enhanced muscle structure, or just in general of what they look like that seemingly resemble humans.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack has a moderate coordination with some suitable OST supplemented by the OP and ED songs. The background music is fitting but repetitively used on certain episodes. Not only that but emotional scenes sometimes lack the atmosphere that it tracks to convey. As for the character voice mannerism, I can hardly remember any of them besides a few climatic moments. Almost none of them stand out much since they are screaming most of the time while fighting for their lives. The Terra Formars are probably only memorable for their actions and occasional groans. Most of the time, your headphones will be filled with screams of terror. No intelligence. No credible humor. Just a of bucket load of hellish cries.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this shows is a glorification of a mixed bag adaptation. While it reasonably adapts some of the core elements, its main problems lies with the world building and weak story. Its unoriginality and generic tropes with invasion and sci-fi horrors themes may makes it seem like it can be interesting. However, its lack of charisma and it\u2019s hard to fathom what the show is trying to even achieve. Fighting against the Terra Formars, saving mankind, or just showing us some sci-fi adventure with shock and cruelty. This show is like a callous cash-in with an attempt to adapt an engaging premise but never able to make the cut.\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nOne of the most frightening organisms on the planet is so miniscule that it's a wonder that it exists in the first place, let alone causes massive harm. This organism is, of course, the virus. A tiny, technically lifeless thing whose only function is to replicate to keep its existence going. In biology, it's a rather fascinating phenomenon that has been in place for millions, if not billions, of years. While human technology has improved by leaps and bounds in an immensely shorter time span, there are still questions and unknowns we have yet to answer. Among theminclude nearly incurable diseases. With this premise in mind, Terra Formars takes shape. That shape being a crooked and jagged mess.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nTerra Formars starts with a man named Akari, whose fighting prowess has given him the opportunity to join a select group of people aimed at finding a cure to a deadly disease that has plagued the Earth. Him and many others undergo an operation to mutate their bodies and board a spaceship destined for Mars and the supposed answers they seek.\\n\\n\r\nThe story telling within the anime follows a rather inconsistent style. It begins by following a majority of the groups confined to the ship, providing us with a glimpse into who is on board, the countries involved, and the gravity of the situation. Once on Mars, the focus shifts from a group mentality to an individual one. At this point, characters are singled out and, for usually less than a full episode, he or she is given a small amount of background. The idea here is to give us a sense of connection. That the people we're watching risk their lives on a distant planet are more than just fodder to the cause. But it never comes off this way (save for one character, more later). The show tried to focus on the characters over the story because the story itself isn't compelling enough to engage the audience. They attempt to mix in some plot elements, such as parallel stories and espionage, but it isn't executed nearly as well as it could be.\\n\\n\r\nThis execution is unquestionably the result of the core of Terra Formars: the fighting. Instead of attempting to showcase more of what the world has to offer or how the mission is more meaningful than it at first seems, it instead highlights the fighting between the humans and the cockroaches. This prominent focus therefore defers to gore and violence instead of actual narrative balance.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the nature (if you will) of the show, part of the \"allure\" is in the powers of the characters at play. The problem is that, in order for the viewers to understand the mutations, a considerable amount of literal narration and time is spent on discussing what animals the humans are using. More often than not, it occurs during the fights themselves. Meaning, besides the story telling already being as choppy as it is, what the anime puts on a pedestal also succumbs to the same choppy issues. The mutations may have ties to the characters' pasts, but the inelegance of their incorporation within the story leaves much to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nTerra Formars maintains a rather mature look throughout the season. The characters themselves are usually well defined, with sharp lines and contours for the faces and throwbacks to the actual animals they are portraying. The same can't be said for the environments. The vast majority of the locations are usually just rocky terrain and boring to look at, with almost zero variety. As for the enemies, CG is used for the cockroaches when a large amount of them are on screen at once. It can be a little off-putting at first, but over time one gets used to seeing them in that state.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation suffers a bit, unfortunately. Not only do there exist a lot of still frames and only mouth movements for many of the characters during dialogue, but many of the fights contain little choreography. Coupled with the fact that the majority of the battles contain zoomed in shots or little animation, the core element of the anime is a major letdown across the board.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime can be watched either censored or uncensored, but it is not worth it to see with the former in place. The censorship present when active makes many of the scenes completely impossible to watch, once again impeding the anime's shtick (very violent killings).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nPutting it rather bluntly, the entire cast is unmistakably bad. It's only saving grace is that there exists a single character who, without him, would render everyone as forgettable. I'll start with the bad and work towards the (only) good.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the first characters introduced is Akari, a rough and tumble dude dead set on saving the girl he loves from the disease gripping her. His motivations are clear, yet his underlying strength is not. Taking the chance to create a better tomorrow for the ones he loves, he accepts the task presented to him, hoping to do everything in his power to bring peace back home, even if said power consumes him. He sounds rather intriguing on paper, but beyond the first episode or so, we never really learn much more about him. That is to say, he never again takes the spotlight long enough to make him relevant to the story at hand. It's a shame, considering he is one of the cast members who we learn a little bit about. His underutilization sets the precedent for everyone else involved.\\n\\n\r\nSheila embodies kindness. Free spirited and filled with generosity, she tags along with the rest of the squad not as a fighter but more as a cheerleader. Unable to mask her fear of the mission at hand, she clings to a romance that she most likely knows deep down can never be. Her friendship with Alex and Marcos shows that, despite her ladylike demeanor, she isn't afraid of helping those in need. The precedent set earlier is used once more; she is shown, talked about, then subsequently put to the side for the rest of anime. It's a little more forgivable this time, since her overall purpose was to give Marcos a reason to fight. The justification is there, but not executed well enough simply because her character feels just as useless as the rest of the people on board.\\n\\n\r\nThe only (seriously, the only) good character found within Terra Formars is Adolph. The byproduct of a terrible experiment, his broken spirit and reason for fighting feel the most human, despite the beast within him. His dedication to the position of captain and composed behavior in the face of an incomprehensible scenario make him a sight to behold both on and off the battlefield. He's a great character not just for being bad-ass, which he most certainly is, but because he actually contains some semblance of depth. Where he begins and where he ultimately ends help to showcase the futility of getting one's hopes up. A tragic character, his inclusion gave this one a small light in the sea of darkness.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nSuffering \"Mirai Nikki Syndrome\", arguably the best part of the show is the OP. The back-and-forth vocals coupled with the fast guitar make it extremely catchy and great fun to listen to, even outside of the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is at least okay. The drums bring about the tempo, the piano adds to its gracefulness, and the vocals are slow and simple to follow.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is largely forgettable, save for the signature, six-note, up-and-down piece that plays when a battle is about to begin. The sound effects involved at least add to the brutality of the aforementioned fighting.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to voice acting, there were no standout performances to be had. The only notable voices were the cockroaches and their \"Jo Ji\" which is the extent of their vocabulary, yet the meaning of varies wildly.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhen the anime first started, the censorship was quite unbearable. Black shading and polka-dots filled the screen, making much of the on-screen action hidden to the viewer. If the entire point of the anime is to show grotesque ways of murdering humans and \"cockroaches,\" then it should be quite obvious that any form of censorship would ruin the intended goal. It was eventually alleviated, but the damage was done.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime doesn't focus on much else. Some attempts at humor are made, but it never tries too hard at it. Same for the drama; outside of Adolf, the rest feels lackluster and completely falls flat. Watching the good guys use their animal abilities should be really fun to watch. And at times, it is. Watching Alex hurl metallic spheres at incredible speeds, seeing Michelle crushing a foe to smithereens, or witnessing Adolf's almost god-like powers can be quite cool. But these moments are too few and far between to make the show compelling enough to keep one interested.\\n\\n\r\nTerra Formars wasn't trying to do much. But even for what it set out to do, the execution just wasn't there. The story is bland, the characters are bad, and the rest is boring. Perhaps in the future, when missions to Mars are actually feasible, we can send this anime to where it belongs: anywhere but here.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, inconsistent, too much focus on the fights, poorly placed explanations\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, lame art style, little animation even for the battles, too much censorship\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Adolf saves the day\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, okay ED, bad soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, literally just humans squashing bugs\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "Warning: this review is written for the average anime fan and not other critics since that wouldnt help anyone and would just be me ranting\r\nSo I began watching terra formars mid airing, i had always wanted to check it out (since seeing it on anichart) and i did so. to be honest i had high expectations, out of all the anime this season this looked the most unique. after finishing the first episode my expectations took a huge hit (this was one of those slow beginnings of introducing characters and backgrounds). i almost dropped it but i didnt and im glad i didnt because onep 2 is where the real meat of the show started. \\n\\n\r\nnow if you cant tell already this anime has gore and i started watching this on crunchyroll (god the censoring was terrible), luckily though i found a sight that had it fully uncensored and was able to take in the full experience.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nnow theres not much of a story besides people going to mars to collect samples of a virus to create a vaccine, but (tiny spoiler, kinda) twist is \"terra formars\" attack the ship and now theyre stuck on mars surrounded by hordes of creepy humanoid roaches (very attack on titanish). however there is a rescue ship coming to mars to save them and the story becomes how they survive until then (which is really interesting since ive never seen any other any that say \"you have 1 month dont die until then\")\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\ni still have no idea how there were able to do the cockroaches right, even if it was cgi how were they able to make it so unnoticeable, this i really dont know. all the characters were all animated decently well, you can tell there was no lazy work ... except maybe in some of the first fight scenes. most of the fight scenes were great you see a fist then the fist smashing into the exoskeleton of a roach but in the first fight there were one or two attacks that were set on a black background. then if you look at the last battlefield (the one that had nukes fired upon) it looks stunning, maybe it was the flames or maybe just the gradience (them gradience)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nsound is not something i can say much about, the voice actors all did their jobs well and the series wasnt really reliant on the soundtrack even in the fights scenes and when there is it's in the background to keeps your heart pumping. the op and ending doesnt stand out that much either, it wasnt anything bad, it was semi good and fitted the series and thats what i think is important\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6\\n\r\ni would like to mention that on the ship to mars there were 99  people on board, luckily most of them were slaughtered before ep 3. yes, the show does kill off many people, but most the characters that dies arnt that important, in fact i think in the entire show only 3 important characters dies and i only say important is because they had backstories and screen time. Still the characters arnt that deep especially the main character whom i can only say is main character because he was introduced first (most characters gets equal screen time after the first episodes). i wont say the characters are stereotypes since all characters fall under a stereotype but they do have certain traits such as the happy go lucky one (that obviously dies), the heartless commanding one, or/and the charismatic cheif. many of the characters also get episodes for themselves with backstories on why they chose to come to mars and how they became who they are. a type of character development you could say since any other kind would be kinda difficult while fighting cockroach after cockroach. also, having an attention span of 5 seconds i skip most of the backstories besides adolf's whos backstory was a great buildup to the climax for the character and story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nok, i gotta admit it i did get sucked into continually watching this week after week, what can say i just like how mindless and fun it is. one major reasons i kept watching was to see the powers of the next character and what species theyre based on. each character in the show fight with an ability based solely on a species on earth, for example if your based on an alpheid shrimp (which can fire jets of air) then your ability would be that, stick your hand in front of a cockroaches face and blow it off.\\n\\n\r\ni enjoyed Terra Formars the same way i enjoyed Attack on Titan, seeing characters put in a situation where everything is against them and seeing what happens next\\n\\n\r\nIt should be worth mentioning that the show will be finished in another season (if it comes out), the last scene scene is actually really similar to the last scene of btooom they even have the same helicopter\\n\\n\r\ni cant guaranty youll enjoy this but its definitely worth taking a look and if you do want to watch this then watch till episode 2/3 then decide to continue or stop watching since episode 1 has stopped alot of people\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.2\\n\\n\r\ntips\\n\r\n1:sit back an relax\\n\r\n2:watch the anime for the reason of enjoying it and nothing else like how your suppose to watch anime\\n",

            "content": "I would not even have known about Terra Formars if I had not seen a short YouTube clip months back. And right now, I am so glad I clicked on that video. \r\nStory: \r\nFuturistic setting on Mars where people with animal powers (mostly insects) fight humanoid cockroaches. Interesting premise to say the least. At first, I had low expectations for the show. Reviews for the first few episodes had been very low for the extreme censorship when it was originally airing. However, I had watched the series after all those black screens were taken down and must say that the show surprised me. I foundthe story to be exciting and interesting at the same time through every episode. The scientific facts scattered through the whole thing show a great amount of research was done by the creator. Terra Formars is a smart show for sure, and if you get distracted during the scientific outbursts by the narrator, confusion will likely set in. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe environments, character models, and animation all look fantastic. I love the darker theme to the colors shown. The fighting and gore is well done for both the roaches and humans, making the show feel more mature. Blood isn't splattering all over the place in every fight unrealistically like in other shows, which is a relief.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nGreat soundtrack overall. Whether it be for tragic, action-packed, or horrific moments, there are songs to match each. The opening and ending are also well done. Voices match their characters, and the sound effects go with what is happening on screen. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI like how there is no central main character in Terra Formars. This is the story of Annex 1 and all its divisions, so multiple characters in various divisions get different amounts of character development and back-story, which really makes it unpredictable when trying to guess who will die in the near or far future. There is not a single character on the human side I was hoping would get killed off, and I love the charm some of them have. There were more than a few unexpected funny moments, and they didn't feel childish in execution. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis was not only a fun show, but a great one, and these 13 episodes were the best time I have ever had with an anime thus far. The end of the final episode did leave off on a cliffhanger, but the manga has not even finished yet, so hopefully there will be a season 2 soon enough. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n-Interesting/exciting story\\n\r\n-Fantastic art for environments, characters, fight scenes, and gore.\\n\r\n-Amazing soundtrack, good voices\\n\r\n-Likable characters, lengths of development provide unpredictability for who dies.\\n\r\n-Not only a fun show, but a great one",

            "content": "Every year theres allways those anime wich generally are deemed has \"bad\" or \"mediocre\" because of their inconsistent nature and their unpopularity, they strive to get a certain fanbase however this \"try hard\" factor usually winds up becoming their very downfall.. However if theres a show that despite being unpopular and mediocre  manages to be a hell of a ride, that would be Terra Formars.. At first glance, naturally, terra formars looks like your survival horror show that it takes itself so serious its laughable.. and thats exactly what it is.. the best part of Terra Formars is the fun you get from it..The art is really messy and misguided, the antagonists are crazy stupid and the characters are there to either get killed or to support the non-existent drama.. I do have to acknowledge Terra formars for their story telling wich isnt bad.. actualy its quite fair however this loses all of its impact due to the small lenght of the show and weak character development, i also have to point out the fact that they explain really well every \"power\" and insect characteristics  in a fast and efficient way.. It is true and i cannot deny that Terra Formars is nothing but a popcorn flic, and that is enough to make this show superior to various other shows of its kind.. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was actually fair.. I loved the opening and the ending, the background music was fitting and reasonable.. The real factor of this show is  the enjoyment you get from its mindless fun every episode.. Its far from being good but it certainly isnt bad.. I give this show medium-low priority its the kind of show you watch after a long tiring day of work something to laugh at and relax without thinking to much. \\n\\n\r\nPs: Turn off your brains while  watching this.. It will enchance your experience",

            "content": "Seeing so many negative reviews for Terra Formars, I decided to offer a positive view instead. Note that I would probably give an 8 for this anime, but because of it's pure enjoyment factor, I'm jacking it up to a 9.\r\nWhat I like about Terra Formars is that the universe is much more...developed, than the typical fare that action anime gives us. It's not a bunch of teenagers running around saving the world, but a people who have been chosen from a diversity of backgrounds tasked with collecting samples to cure a virus that has surfaced on Earth. Questionable scientific methods aside (i'm going tochalk it up to 500 years worth of scientific research). The premise itself is interesting enough: cockroaches were sent to Mars to Terra Form (hence the name), to perhaps make it suitable for human habitation in the future. But fast forward 500 hundred years and these cockroaches are some bigas$ humanoid mutations each with the strength of an army. The irony of becoming to the cockroaches on Mars what they are to humans on Earth seems to be presented again and again as the narrative switches between Earth and Mars.\\n\\n\r\nTo combat these the humans hybrid themselves with various animals, taking on the fighting ability of various dangerous animals from all over the world. I really enjoyed the exposition on the different kinds of animals and how their abilities would fare in human combat. It kept me interested. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime also had political elements which are always lacking in the genre. Subversion, typical politicking and allied blocs of nations with their own agendas provide a nice overarching story to complement the straight up massacre (on both sides) that constantly seems to be happening on Mars. \\n\\n\r\nWhat seems to lack though is the presence of interesting characters. I only seem to be attached to one, and that is Michelle (and perhaps Adolf) - the others simply blur into the background for me. They aren't exactly original or well thought-out, and I've found myself feeling nothing in many of the 'character development' scenes. However, I will put that aside because Terra Formars isn't trying to be something it's not. And for that, I won't nitpick at the lack of compelling characterisation.\\n\\n\r\nTerra Formars makes me wonder at what will happen next, and though not necessarily original, is highly enjoyable and unpredictable. The plot is enough for me to continue watching definitely, and the themes on extinction and survival are palpable throughout the show. More than that though, it is action-packed, with a decent soundtrack and gets my blood pumping when I watch it, and that in itself is worth the watch.",

            "content": "A few weeks ago a friend of mine dared me to embark on a dangerous mission - one which could subject me to emotional turmoil even if I emerged alive. Turns out a bunch of no-name idiots were waltzing off to Mars to gather samples and research a cure for some lethal virus, while trying not to be ripped apart by giant mutant body builders with cockroach heads.\r\nMy mission? To sit around watching these idiots pretend to actually be doing something for 13 episodes while my senses are senselessly abused! I accepted, on the condition that this unnamed friend watch \u201cBtooom!\u201d in exchange. After completingmy mission, I can safely say I\u2019d rather re-watch that twice over than tune in to this clueless \u201cperformance\u201d again.\\n\\n\r\nSaid performance is Terra Formars; the \u201caction\u201d survival \u201chorror\u201d anime that doesn\u2019t care about either itself or its viewers; the show that feebly pretends to offer everything while offering absolutely nothing. Well, nothing except a few ridiculous, laughably edgy \u201cdeath and gore\u201d scenes in the first few episodes, which are so over the top at times that they transcend being horrifying and become plain silly. A certain head-severing spinal cord whip comes to mind.\\n\\n\r\nIf you really must watch this show (and I strongly advise against it), at least make it the uncensored version, otherwise you\u2019re stripping out what little enjoyment there is to be gained from this animated fecal matter, be it for s(c)h(l)ock factor or simply laughing at the show\u2019s tryhard nature. But I\u2019m sorry to say that even such ironic enjoyment from the biology-defying bloodbaths is in short supply here, since both the comical absurdity and the actual shock value quickly dissipate as such scenes get toned down after the first several episodes. This leaves the show to rely on its actual substance and merit.\\n\\n\r\nHah, I wish. Terrible Formars goes to great lengths to muck up everything it tries to accomplish (...well, \u201ctries\u201d is pushing it), and to even greater lengths to ensure it\u2019s as crushingly devoid of ANY substance whatsoever as a 5-hour season can be.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t be fooled by its promises of a sci-fi survival story. There isn\u2019t one. It literally sets up the basic premise, sticks the idiots on mars and then a bunch of said idiots and some roaches drop dead with no meaningful progress in sight. Plot threads vanish as quickly as they appear to never be brought up again. None of it leads anywhere and none of it ends up mattering as far as the viewer is concerned. Even if I wanted to make this a spoiler review, I\u2019m not even sure there\u2019s anything I could say about the plot that could spoil the viewing\u2026 \u201cexperience\u201d. It\u2019s like dangling a fish hook, waiting for a bite, then immediately cutting the line - on purpose.\\n\\n\r\nRinse and repeat until the writers get bored of it and stop casting out any hooks to begin with, and you\u2019re just left with bugs and stick figures gawking at each other, occasionally interjected by a narrator gushing long-windedly about insects, lightning, the stages of suffocation and so forth. Honestly, these science lessons to pad out the episode or try to make some one-time bug transformation ability seem meaningful were the closest things to interesting material in the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nSo, without any notable plot progression the show is left to leverage another strength, like a sharp script or a solid cast of characters. To be honest, the latter quality is the one single area where Terra Formars succeeds most.\\n\\n\r\nSucceeds at what? Being entirely incompetent on every level!\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the cast have NO defining personality. They barely qualify as one-dimensional. You could have any two of them swap places and nothing of note would change. Several of them get some lengthy, drawn-out \u201csad backstories\u201d, but evidently the show forgot to make the backstories even remotely define the character, explain their personality or tie meaningfully into current events, so you\u2019re still left with non-characters with either one or no defining personality traits!\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is driven by the loss of a loved one to fight off the roaches and gather the virus samples, which is an acceptable motivation, but like most things in the show, NOTHING comes out of this - it\u2019s just explaining why this caricature is on the mission and leaving it at that! There\u2019s NOTHING else that defines him. He\u2019s so bland and unremarkable that in any other show he would feel like a one-off side character, but there\u2019s no competition here.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a woman who\u2019s a jerk to her lover! What a complex character! And another was a famous boxer and - whoa, look! His bug transformation involves punching things! LOOK, IT WAS RELEVANT! What a miracle. Too bad that\u2019s about all we know. These are some of the show's \"better\" attempts at making a character. With most, you\u2019d be lucky to remember any of their names.\\n\\n\r\nThese aren\u2019t characters; they\u2019re just cutouts made from tree bark! And no matter how gratuitously violent the show tries to make some of their deaths, I don\u2019t care, because why would I? It\u2019s just tree bark!\\n\\n\r\nEven the dialogue fails to add any flavour to them. In fact, it\u2019s all quite dull. Its serves only to either blurt out exposition, fill time in a scene, or occasionally force in some awful comic relief. Are you tired of boob or perversion jokes? Well, these are just about the least-creative, most lifeless perversion jokes I\u2019ve ever seen, or even comedy as a whole that isn\u2019t set in a high school club room. Not to mention that in a supposedly serious story of survival, this forced style of humour comes across as out-of-place.\\n\\n\r\nWithout anything of interest in the dialogue, characters, their backstories, and no plot threads that go anywhere, all of the above just comes off like awful filler in practice. Yes, the plot and characters themselves are on the level of bad filler, dragging out the show, going nowhere, lacking direction, and existing only to waste the viewer\u2019s time between any semblance of action. For a show whose first selling point was over-the-top violence, it seems intent on diluting it as much as possible, and this problem only gets progressively worse as the show goes on. Frankly, the pacing of everything after the first third is unacceptable, and what was already at best mildly ironically amusing becomes a downright agonizing viewing experience as episode after episode goes by without an interesting moment in sight.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the production also tends to fall short, so these moments of \u201caction\u201d that should be something to look forward to are more like drops of dirty water in a desert. But I was so dehydrated that I was willing to take anything. I cheered out loud when, after several episodes of NOTHING, there was a brief sort-of-edgy scene with some character whose name I\u2019ve all but erased from my memory. Then it was straight back to the desert trek.\\n\\n\r\nBut before I veer off-course, let\u2019s talk about the action. It\u2019s abysmal.\\n\\n\r\nWhatever definition you may have for \u201cchoreography\u201d, it\u2019s near-nonexistent here. Your typical \u201caction\u201d scene might have 10 seconds of something even within reach of being called \u201cdynamism\u201d (usually it\u2019s just the \"death and carnage\" scenes, which, granted, tend to be well-animated when they actually happen). The rest consists of some disappointingly sluggish direct face-offs between a human and an abnormally non-intimidating (just goofy) giant CGI cockroach. Remember that boxing character? Well, let\u2019s just say I wouldn\u2019t buy tickets to watch him fight these roaches. The rest is a combination of more bland dialogue pretending to be discussions of strategy, some science lessons from Mr. Narrator, shounen-style filler monologues, lengthy scenes of everyone just sitting around crying or gawking (as the roaches stand around doing nothing), or frustrating interjections from yet another woe-was-me backstory to waste another two-thirds of an episode on.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the production weaknesses don\u2019t end there. Visually, there\u2019s the obvious issue with the armies of CGI body-builder roaches being of poor quality. Yet somehow even when half of them are off-putting CGI, their designs just don\u2019t look frightening enough to feel like a threat (oh, wait, that would require some decent characters to be threatened by them in the first place). Honestly, the awkward human character designs manage to be more uncanny than the dumb, goofy-looking muscle-roaches could ever hope to be. When combined with bland colour and background design, static direction, a repetitive aesthetic and unremarkable animation, there\u2019s little left to carry the show visually.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio doesn\u2019t fare any better. Aside from a passable opening, the actual soundtrack of the series is pretty poor. Not one song is either worth listening to on its own or effective in the context of the scene. At best, they add nothing, and at worst, they\u2019re actively ill-fitting, not to mention the repetition of the few (memorable is too much credit) \u201crecognizable\u201d ones just serves to make the increasingly soul-numbing viewing experience even more bland. Also, the sound design is atrocious at times, with some sounds quite literally clipping whatever audio channel it was recorded on. I thought it was my headphones, but nope, it was just an oversight that the most inexperienced hobbyist sound editor could recognize and fix in seconds. Production is more complicated than that, of course, but it seems there was some \"production hell\" going on behind the scenes and/or a rushed schedule failing to warrant the time or money to fix all such mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nWith this lack of even a serviceable level of production, and with so little in the way of substance or entertainment value combined with increasingly awful pacing, Terrible Formars is a landfill's worth of garbage in almost every conceivable way. The only thing it has to define itself is a few comical death scenes with brief spikes in animation quality, but the show couldn\u2019t even commit to that one-trick gimmick as a selling point. While there are plenty of technically \u201cworse\u201d pieces of media out there, those were at least memorable horror shows. The only memorable thing about this is how little it even seems to care about anything it does, and if the show doesn\u2019t care, it's hard to care as a general viewer. It feels like an ill-informed product, and a failed one on every level.\\n\\n\r\nLet me be clear that I hold no resentment to the creators of this, nor do I think this show \"owes\" me anything - I myself chose to sit through it on a dare after all. But I'm going to call it like it is, and with that disclaimer made, Terrible Formars is the worst kind of bad anime. There may be other more shockingly incompetent shows out there, but the experience of watching this is awful. It\u2019s not an ironically enjoyable \u201cso-bad-it\u2019s-good\u201d series, not intriguingly or bafflingly insane or stupid, not uniquely or memorably inept, lacks value as a learning experience, and isn\u2019t even insulting or offensively terrible; at least that would be SOMETHING! This is nothing. It\u2019s empty; pointless; a creative void in animated form. It\u2019s atrociously-executed and amateurly-produced across the board; utterly devoid of substance, integrity, plot, proper characterization, heart, effort, or literally anything worth caring about. Even the over-the-top deaths wear off fast. I can only recommend this to masochists. Everyone else, AVOID!\\n",

Terra Formars aired in 2014 and most of the brutal inhumane scenes were censored.. but Bro do you even know what day it is? It's 2015 and all the scenes are now uncensored *Mind blown*\r\nI can honestly say the uncensored version is a totally different Anime. Example? Sure. They don't play Basketball anymore on Mars. :)\r\nWhy did I rate Terra Formars so high?\r\n- Fast paced and captivating plot twists! (None stop action)\r\n- LOADS OF FIGHTING! (I say 70%)\r\n- LOADS of gore and decapitation! (A MUST have in a *Horror* apocalyptic genre, I hate it when an Anime has aHorror genre tag and I get absolutely no gore at all)\\n\r\n- LOADS of deaths (Not really a spoiler since every apocalyptic genre has a huge death rate)\\n\r\n- Bug ability plot mechanics. (Informative information about their abilities *Insectopedia* You never get to see any of *bug mechanics* in Anime so this is a first for me and most of you guys too. You know what  I mean by *Bug ability plot mechanics* when you watch it)\\n\\n\r\nDon't get fooled because my MAL buddy said so! Don't get fooled because its rated 7.07 on MAL! People just follow the \"score hype train' and always listen to the fool. Please don't do that!You need to watch it for yourself first and not listen to the lowed scored elitist members who rated this Anime below 5! Ok sorry enough of the rambling. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, If you like action packed gore suspenseful science fiction action where no one, not even the main characters  is safe, and you enjoy a sprinkling of trivial knowledge throughout the series, this is the perfect Anime! AND If you don't like seeing insects getting REKT because your a nature boy/grill then please put this Anime on your drop list. Thanks. :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Terra Formars was one of the series that received a lot of conflicting opinions during the fall 2014 season. Some loved it for the Linkin Park grimdark edginess while a majority of people hated on it purely due to the censorship. But let's face it, censorship is not a valid reason to give this series a one out of ten. If anything, there are much bigger problems than a giant black circle in the middle of the screen when it comes to this show.\r\nTerra Formars is one of those series where it could have possibly been decent. You start watching this show and the amazinghot blooded opening music comes on and you get all pumped up. Then as you go through it you just wonder to yourself if time was better spent studying for that final instead. The experience was akin to being teased by a really hot girl but suddenly experiencing erectile dysfunction when she tells you she has syphilis halfway through the makeout session. The premise was pretty interesting and I really liked the idea of how the tables have turned and the bug overlords are now hunting down the humans. You shouldn't expect anything more from the story other than to set up action. That's perfectly fine because that's what this show is meant to be. Unfortunately, it's those small details that really pisses you off and drove this show straight into the dumpster. The biggest offender of this is the narration. I'm an advocate of showing and not telling because it does not ruin the immersion experience. In this show however, you constantly have this out of place infodump either in the middle of action scenes or just before a big reveal and it completely destroys the atmosphere. Not only that, it treats the viewers as if they are 75 IQ retards just because the studio is too lazy to incorporate these information through character interactions. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs is one of the things that went well for this show. Unfortunately the same cannot really be said of a lot of the characters themselves. Personally I think the main problem is that 13 episodes is not nearly enough to develop such a large cast. While dynamics between the main characters were done decently, you just can't give a damn about the rest of the cast. And when they get killed off it seemed like they are randomly killed just for the sake of being a tear jerker or to induce shock through all the gore because you do not feel a connection to them.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of shock and gore, oh boy, we now come to the censorship. Remember when you thought Tokyo Ghoul was pretty heavily censored? Well that was pretty tame compared to this. Sometimes the screens would just be half black and other times they would have random black circles. To speak the truth, I actually loved the censored version because I just find it absolutely hilarious and it also spawned lots of dank memes with that one particular head grab scene. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day you should treat this show like one of those B movies from the 1950s about vampire Nazi sunflowers from Venus or some shit like that. Watch the censored version and enjoy it while making fun of the hilarious expressions of the cockroaches, the absurd fights and some QUALITY animation with your friends. \\n",

            "content": "Would you like to hear a joke?\r\nTerraformars.\r\nThat's the whole joke.\r\nTerra formars follows the expedition of strong humans to mars, who have the task of killing and capturing evolved fighting cockroaches that were used to make Mars more inhabitable for humans. The objective is to find a cure for a disease that came from Mars, which could lead to the deaths of many people on earth.\r\nTerra formars is very much a sci fi, horror anime. The shows main message is trying to look at the perspective of \"If humans were the pests\" instead of cockroaches. It does this by looking at the themes of evolution andhow humans could lag behind in terms of further development in the future, leading to extinction. Another theme is medical advancement as a way of combatting the evolved cockroaches, this involves taking the characteristics of certain organisms and fusing them with humans to give great fighting abilities. The show also highlights the characters personal reasons for joining the expedition, and their goals for the end of mission too. In terms of atmosphere, there is tension throughout due to the many fights constantly going on, leading there pace being similar throughout. Fighting is very much prevalent with many characters and cockroaches alike being killed, showing that no one is safe. Furthermore, the show looks deeper at how the characteristics of the organisms enable humans and cockroaches to fight.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, in terms of story, there is little to be desired. The shows pacing was steady due to the fact that 8 of the 13 episodes contained none stop fighting. This in turn lead to a lack of suspense as there was no plot development for nearly all of the whole show. It's over focus on new abilities and 'epic' fights lead to a rushed ending, which, in turn, reverted back to focusing on the epic fighting rather than focusing on other topics such as how the cockroaches managed to evolve.  Unfortunately, the excessive focus on humans and cockroaches dying lead to the story being one dimensional. This was upsetting, as the introduction to the show had good pacing and took more of a holistic  approach in explaining the plot, character interaction and fighting. Lastly, it's choice of how episodes were ordered was very questionable, as the pacing suffered severely with the focusing on developing 2 or 3 characters for a few episodes. This in turn lead to further plot  development troubles.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the animation, the picture quality, overall fluidity of fight scenes and scenery as a whole was to a high standard, as expected from a 2014 anime. The character models were quiet varied, offering more distinction between the different types of organism characteristics the humans had. Overall, it was a pleasure on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the models of the cockroaches do look very  stereotypical of black tribal warriors, which could be offensive. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a huge cast of characters involved in Terra Formars, many involved characters with powers and none combatants. It mainly focuses on the characters with super powers, which a narrator explains which organism the abilities have been taken from. Character  development is prevalent with some, but not all due to the size of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the shows lack of remorse for characters makes it difficult to like, as many characters could end up dying. This makes it tough to find a \"personal favorite\". Also, the show seems to lack a solid main character, as there are so many characters important to the mission, so many that die and so many that are under developed, the lack of structure means it's hard to determine which is the main character. Although, some characters were developed to a good standard, and it did attempt to explain many characters opinions.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the music, both the opening and ending are more focused on rock music, which was fine but not entirely too my liking. It's OST was very pleasurable, highlighting and amplifying tension in battle, as well as more orchestral music for character infractions, which I enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, Terra Formats  fundamental errors in it's writing and in basic story telling lead to the show looking more like Fight club than a sci fi horror.",

            "content": "I can honestly say this review is completely unbiased, as I watched the show with no idea whatsoever of its reception. I marathoned it all in one night and decided to read some reviews atferward to see if anyone shared my thoughts about it.\r\nLet's just say they did, but the negative aspects were amplified hundredfold.\r\nFirst of all, the story. I'm going to be honest and say the idea seemed a bit weird, if not stupid, but I decided to give it the benefit of doubt.  Giant humanoid cockroaches commanded by another   pretty much immortal giant cockroach? A martian virus? A possibly aliencivilization wanting to destroy the earth using muscular bugs? Okay.\\n\\n\r\nI gave it a six simply because of the concept. It is not original by any means, but it's got a couple unique aspects. And hell, it was entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe art wasn't bad at all. Those cockroaches are easily the creepiest things I've ever seen in anime, and I've seen plenty. I kind of find it odd that Mars could seem to alike Earth, even with the moss growing around, but I'll call it  artistic license. I liked the characters' designs and the slightly more realistic way in which they were drawn, and I even found some of the characters to be handsome in an unconventional way. I gave it an eight.\\n\\n\r\nThe OSTs weren't the best, but they were fitting enough. The wailing woman in the sad moments seems to be a must in these sorts of shows. I did like both the OP and ED.  A seven seems a bit too kind, but there were a cuuple OSTs that did get me pumped up in moments of tension.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has one of my favorite male characters in anime, Adolf. It's frustrating how little screentime he got as he's easily the most developed and had so much more potential. I won't say anything else, cuz spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn't really fond of anyone else, I must admit. They just had too little screentime and many backstories seemed very soap-operaish.  Perhaps if they had givevn more focus on the character their deaths could've had a much bigger impact, sans a certain character. But I have to admit, though, that me being the softie I am did suffer every time someone died, but seeing the other reviews that's probably just me. \\n\\n\r\nThe only other character for whom I really cared was Michelle, who I hink also had great time for potential. And well, she's really badass.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the potential each character had, and because of Adolf, I'll be extremely generous and give this area a nine.\\n\\n\r\nIf one thing's for sure, I was hooked. Even though most of the tension consisted of cheap shock value and I'm pretty sure they're all going to die at ome point, I found myself on the edge of my seat several times (particularly on the parts revolving around Adolf).  The sort certainly had the element of tension, and fot that I'll five it a seven.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't as bad as some people put it to be, in my opinion. It just suffers from not being executed well enough.  For me, its major flaw was the lack of development, the pace, that sort of stuff. The themes were good,a nd even if it was not directly put, a certain one about how death is in te end futile got me thinking a lot, and I love animes that get that reaction from me.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially... well. SPOILERS! When Adolf died. He tried dying at first, but ultimately realized his he did value his comrades and proetected them until the end. And the fact the cockroach leader survived a lightning bolt falling directly on top of him was kind of an asspull if you ask me. The worst part is, he died without saving anyone. But he did die among comrades, so I guess that kind of shows that in the end, death is not entirely meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nI did hate his whore of a wife, though.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it? Yes, but only to a certain public. One that could see a show for what it is despite its flaws. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "No good can come from putting \u201cMars\u201d in your title. \r\n\u201cTerra Formars\u201d is an adaption of the seinen manga by Sasugu Yu and Kenichi Tachibana by the same name. Serialized in the same magazine as Tokyo Ghoul, (Young Jump, or Shonen Jump for big boys) \u201cTerra Formars\u201d is a sci-fi/action horror.\r\nOh, you were expecting more of an explanation? But, there really isn\u2019t anything else to say. I might have been able to crack a joke, but the anime is a joke enough already for me to not have to. I\u2019m just going to stop wasting your time here; \r\ntl;dr: this show sucks \r\n---PLOT:---\r\n(Yes, I didwatch it uncensored)\\n\\n\r\nMany years prior to the story, humanity sent cockroaches and various mosses to Mars in hopes of terra-forming the surface. (making it a suitable environment for earthly life.) It worked, too. But recently, a disease has broken out on Earth, and a handful of \u201cspecialists\u201d from all over the globe are sent to Mars in hopes for finding a cure. But on said planet are hordes of the cockroaches, which have evolved to the point of being almost human. Naturally, the series is advertised as a \u201chyper-violence\u201d action series that\u2019s filled with more blood than narrative substance.\\n\\n\r\nBut instead of being a mindless, action-filled gore-fest, it\u2019s character backstories and apparent mystery sub-plot actually means it demands a certain amount of respect as a story. So that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to treat it; like an actual story. (You reap what you sow, Sasugu!)\\n\\n\r\nSo we start out with a concept that the anime is clearly supposed to be conveying; you know how you just step on a bug you see, and don\u2019t even give it a second thought? Well what if the bug\u2026 is now stepping on you? I\u2019ll admit this is definitely a clever setup for some good ideas, except for the fact that the anime does literally NOTHING with it. Instead of intertwining this could-be moral question and primal fear into the \u201cnarrative,\u201d (if I could even call it that) it\u2019s forgotten in favor of underwhelming mystery and government conspiracies that dilute what the series is trying to be in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, random people, if they so desire, are given the opportunity to get a surgery; one where combined with an injected medicine, (or it can be snuffed and eaten, you name it) can turn them into hybrids, where they get the abilities of a specific animal or insect. For what its worth, the anime is filled with informative narration about these hybrids that sheds some light onto the actual traits of their respective creature\u2019s capabilities, but that\u2019s where any ounce of this idea being inventive stops, because,\\n\\n\r\n1.\tWhy are they operating on and sending random, everyday people to Mars instead of combat-trained professionals; or at least certified Astronauts? There are a few sure, but most of the people onboard fall into the \u201caverage joe\u201d category.\\n\\n\r\nLike many anime, the reason as to why is alluded to, but we never fully learn because it just\u2026 ends. It\u2019s another inconclusive story, with a \u201cgo read the manga ending.\u201d \u2026yay.\\n\\n\r\nThese \u201cspecialists\u201d arrive on mars to inevitably battle the cockroaches, which have evolved into lightning fast, aggressive, upright beings reminiscent of Homo Erectus, down to the point of carrying a club. But despite being the threatening monsters they are, they\u2019re portrayal is horribly inconsistent. They\u2019re supposed to be lightning fast, but often times just stand there when they\u2019re being attacked. They even turn around to run away and aren\u2019t as fast as they\u2019re made out to be. They can break through a space vessel; but can\u2019t escape a net? I can\u2019t even give that a pass because, even though the nets in the series are designed to withstand three times the strength of a single cockroach, why can\u2019t the ships? They\u2019re goddamn space ships!\\n\\n\r\nAnd due to the amount of wandering still shots, tremendously overdone exposition, and backstory that does nothing but interrupt the \u201caction.\u201d The pace of the anime is comparable to an old dog taking a shit. What I mean is that its\\n\\n\r\nSLOW.\\n\\n\r\nThis makes the whole of 13 episodes feel twice as long, all while constantly loosing focus; jumping to character backstories sporadically, (so much so that they usually take up half or more of the episode) and just plain feels like procrastination, as there doesn\u2019t seem to be much to work with. But oh, who gives a shit, the whole reason one would want to watch this is for the insane hyper violence, right?\\n\\n\r\nExcept\u2026 the action is minimal, and honestly straight up boring. The choreography is all over the place, ranging from \u201cits alright, they\u2019re kicking stuff\u201d to \u201che\u2019s not even moving.\u201d They take a few whacks and stand around and think to themselves a little more, and for what? The pacing literally creates plot holes! Why are the cockroaches standing with them and not attacking? They seem to have some sort of order; but that\u2019s not explored either!\\n\\n\r\nThis story has way too many problems, and not enough ground to stand on. At least I can say that\u2026 it tried.\\n\r\n---Plot Score: -Terrible- \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---CHARACTERS---\\n\r\nThis will undoubtedly be the most difficult portion of the review for me, because I don\u2019t remember any of the characters. No one stood out. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its dependence on character backdrops, they\u2019re all so stagnant as human beings that you just don\u2019t care. A lot of the backstories involve something stereotypical like a childhood friend getting sick, themselves being experimented on, or\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u2026Their retina detaching. That\u2019s a thing? Holy shit, now that\u2019s scarier than any cockroach man!\\n\\n\r\nEither way, There\u2019s not really a main character either. You could argue it\u2019s the first introduced character, Hizamaru Araki, but he really only gets ignored from then on in favor of having a different character get the spotlight in every episode. But they\u2019re past is never used to further build them up as people, in fact, its never utilized at all. They get it, and then it cuts to them battling a cockroach where they will either come out unscathed and continue to be ignored, or just straight up die. Character development? Let\u2019s just give them a sob-story life! Where should we drop it? Eh, in the middle of an important battle is fine! Characterization? Who needs it, lets just kill em\u2019 off!\\n\\n\r\nOh, so its one of those anime. Characters die. They get elaboration, and die, making me question the purpose of bringing up their lives in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d like to say that the cast isn\u2019t full of duds, and that there is maybe one or two favorable characters, but there really isn\u2019t. Even if they don\u2019t die, they\u2019re screen time is hammered into the dirt because the cast is so large. \\n\\n\r\nAt least it tried\u2026\\n\r\n---Characters Score: -Terrible- \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---ANIMATION---\\n\r\nThis animation, done by\u2026\\n\\n\r\nWait, what the hell?\\n\\n\r\nWarner Bros licensed this?  Oh great, now America is taking over anime\u2026 yippee\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the animation, (which I believe to have been done by LIDENFILMS though I could be wrong) is a mixed bag of sorts. The frames usually look fantastic, with high detailing in the lakes and mountainous terrain of terra-formed Mars, as well as things like beautifully drawn irises (that dilate; done well too) and the heart-stopping, visceral scenes of endless bloodshed and high-intensity gore. (In fact, I originally thought this was a Madhouse production)\\n\\n\r\nBut like I said, the actual amount of lingering stills and breaks between the action make the series feel slow as hell, and that drops the quality of the animation because there\u2019s no effort involved. To add insult to injury; there are hordes and hordes of CG cockroaches. Identical, 3D rendered, cockroaches. Every insect, and every vehicle in this series is done with CG. I\u2019m getting so sick of it. It\u2019s common I know, but just so utterly lazy. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that it looks fine, just above average I\u2019d say. \\n\r\n---Animation Score: -Substantial-\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---SOUND---\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is rather unimpressive, (surprise surprise) but the opening \u201cAMAZING BREAK\u201d by TERRASPEX was actually pretty cool, it was an adrenaline-rush inducing metal/rock piece that I actually feel fit the overall tone the show was going for quite nicely, though the ending, \u201cLightning\u201d by the same artist, wasn\u2019t quite as memorable. \\n\\n\r\nAnd everything else is generic, beat em\u2019 up music, (with electric guitars and hard rock rhythms) nothing really stands out that much. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I\u2019ll just say that the cockroach\u2019s battle cries made me laugh so hard; I don\u2019t really know how to describe it either, they just sort of happen out of the blue sometimes and instead of making them menacing, it makes them even more hilarious that they already are.\\n\r\n---Sound Score: -Substantial- \\n\\n\r\nAFTER REPORT:\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n-\tfun animal facts?\\n\r\n-\tA few interesting concepts, like the form changing surgery\\n\r\nMIXED:\\n\r\n-\tVERY heavy gore and dismemberment\\n\r\n-\tUnconcluded. Because of this though, there\u2019s always room for improvement! Right?\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n-\tPacing is slower than a sloth; prolonging the actual experience\\n\r\n-\tRipe with unexplored plot threads and plot-holes aplenty\\n\r\n-\tAbsolutely boring, undeveloped characters that will just die within an episode or two, and when they don\u2019t their screen time is abandoned \\n\r\n-\tCompletely misplaced character backstories that take entirely too long, interrupting story flow, and literally do NOTHING in the way of development or characterization\\n\r\n-\tUnderwhelming fights, nowhere near as much action as is advertised\\n\r\n-\tVastly inconsistent portrayals of the enemies\u2019 abilities \\n\r\n-\tThe whole thing doesn\u2019t make much sense anyway, sub-plot\u2019s twists are not explored, and in the end it\u2019s just straight up boring\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: -Abhorrent-\\n\r\nTerra Formars takes itself way too seriously.\\n\\n\r\nOne has to ask themselves; what is there to be entertained by in this series? There\u2019s some violence for sure, but hyper-violence has been made much more fun in other series, (Hellsing Ultimate, for one) because this time it isn\u2019t really even prominent. I don\u2019t patronize people, if you liked this, that\u2019s totally fine. But I don\u2019t see how. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the show that\u2019s been reduced to both a racist meme and a poke at Japan\u2019s horrible censorship. In my honest opinion, it deserves no more. If you either want something to make fun of, or if you want some sleep medication, there\u2019s this that\u2019s right in front of you.\\n\\n\r\nA downright hilariously earned 2/10 for this one. Well done. \\n",

Overall Terra formars has me note 6, if you like anime action and sci-fi, surely Terra formars will at least please you, otherwise I would not recommend it highly.\\n\\n",

Genetically modified people with animal-based powers fight huge mutant cockroaches on Mars. Hell yeah? Over the top concepts that just don't give a damn are the best. The story is a basic one: Go up there and find a cure for some Mars disease. Badass guys and gals kicking some space insect butt. Terra Formars does not pretend to be \"deep\" and \"philosophical\" (which is the norm nowadys I guess). This would have been the greatest thing I ever saw if I was 15 years younger,and I'm still a little boy on the inside who likes a good brawl. The show won't most likely win any awards, but I can at least hope for a second season. The art and opening are good tho.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problems Terra Formars has is the slow pacing and horrible INITIAL censorship in the first 3 episodes. There are uncensored episodes now. \\n\\n\r\nTl;dr this is like power rangers, but with bugs.",

            "content": "~ Don't underestimate... ~\r\nTerra Formars had the potential to revive the Sci-Fi/Horror genre, but indefinitely fell short of this...\r\nThis is a perilous and action-packed journey into uncharted land, Inhabited by a particularly formidable alien race. An apocalyptic epidemic-like fate looms over the shoulders of humanity, and metaphorical titans are sure to fall. It is an unpredictable, and fast-paced sci-fi/horror series of epic proportions. And whilst touching on the subjects of both sentience, and betrayal, I cannot deny that it's certainly a story with substance.\r\nA slightly-cliche, though appropriate, isolated-feeling, and otherworldly Martian landscape sets the stage for this 13 episode series. Invading both the sci-fi andhorror realms with an integration of strong violence, into an alien world: It shouldn't come as a shock that its audience will need to be appreciative of unending action sequences. As for the chronological\\n\r\nprogression, this is in fact quite a fitting description. With the concept of scale being used often to emphasize severity and intensify the viewers' perception of the events here... It bodes well that the interplanetary premise: a scientifically accurate and vast wasteland, really helps to invoke curiosity. We are after all made both curious, and afraid of the unknown. This is of course decent substance to make even the most far-fetched of concepts seem real, and immersive.\\n\\n\r\n~ Story and Character development ~\\n\\n\r\nIf you were to ask me \"What's behind this show?\", then I would relay: \"a boundless \"red planet\" premise, to stage an interspecies war\". The underlying problem with this (as I will elaborate), is that it's simply too extensive and substantial for 13 episode production to make full use of. It's malnourished, and full of gaping holes particularly in the character department - that will likely throw many off course.\\n\\n\r\nBesides having a story that wouldn't ever necessarily \"run dry\" from a content-observant perspective... Everything operates on a large scale with Terra Formars: So expect to see chains of events, all of which have some impact, and make some kind of dent in the overriding plot. Debatably devoid of intricacies: this anime can't afford to expend time on small, and technically irrelevant, but highly praise-able quirks/details that can be used to further the familiar sense of immersion... giving the anime a one-of-a-kind presence. With Terra Formars on the other hand, we only got the barebones of the story... again... time is of the essence.\\n\\n\r\nIt falls into a trap that many action-based adventures have been known to in the past... The story is one-dimensional. Everything that goes on during 312 minutes of running time, does so in what I like to call: an immediate-scope. What this entails, is that everything happens on a whim. There's little in the way of \"establishment\" or goals beyond the first 2 or 3 episodes, and this makes things seem too spontaneous. Almost, \"done without thought\", which is ironic because I'm sure the manga was well thought out, and would clear all of this up. As for this anime: it becomes tiring how EVERYTHING has to be relevant to the same overriding plotline, and so not enough happens besides dealing with Terra Formars, to add that other \"dimension\".\\n\\n\r\nNow what I will give it, is unpredictability. The show has an effectively unending suspense that compliments the event-based story, and really brings out this sense of struggle that reminds you \"this is a journey fraught with dire consequences\". Violence plus unpredictability equals death, so expect the unexpected! The show itself really is a thrill ride, and if you were to watch it rather casually or on a whim: then its cinematic qualities would nevertheless shine through and keep you engaged for the most part. Now there's a really distinct sense of camaraderie and mutual respect for one-another in Terra Formars. Combined with the evident struggle of humanity against the alien race, and it becomes a pretty interesting story of survival in spite of its blatant flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe word \"interesting\" is used rather loosely nowadays, and it's regrettably not the term I would use to describe this story's cast of characters. The show blatantly tries to build upon them, with long and almost unconsented flashbacks that kill the show's pacing, and leave little room for more substantial events. As an anime, Terra Formars tries so hard to meet every objective, but doesn't admit to its identity as an action-oriented story, and instead ends up sub-par in the areas where it counts.\\n\\n\r\nIt tries to forge some sort of emotional connection between the viewers and cast, but there are simply too many actively involved personalities to make extensive character development even an option. With the elongated flashbacks that let us in on various character backgrounds, if you're not still angry that a fight was just called off to make way for a blast-from-the-past, then you can start to appreciate some of our protagonists. But not for long. There's just so much always going on, and too many time constraints to adhere to with this anime: It means that even if we're going to be \"investing\" into a character, it doesn't make up for the fact that a fair number of faces are still strangers by the last episode.\\n\\n\r\n~ Audiovisuals ~\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the score: It's simple, and a tad \"rinse and reuse\", but effective. Terra Formars treats us to a highly appropriate and intense-sounding OP and ED which pertains to the anime's \"power\" in being such a thriller. It compliments the themes well.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding animation, we've got a strange mix to contend with. For the most part we get a rather drab colour palette which is both appropriate for the barren landscaping, and the dark nature of the show. The animation is generally of a considerable quality: with fine detail shining through, and an emphasis on lighting physics which adds to that sense of realism and immersion. Whereas some of the animation is frighteningly fluid, other parts are less impressive. Overall: I won't deny that it's a feast for the eyes for the most part.\\n\\n\r\n~ Final thoughts ~\\n\\n\r\nThe vast story of Terra Formars was doomed as soon as it was given just 13 episodes to develop everything. But it did evidently put some effort into it: with a strong start that set the scene well, with unfortunately trails off into mindless combat and unexplained character relations. With the character aspect being a hindrance because too many will remain almost like strangers. Tough credit where credit is due: It is a visually pleasing and unpredictable thrill-ride, with some charm to it.\\n\\n\r\nThere's too much \"manufactured\" feeling of sentiment infused into this short series, and so as far as \"long term seriousness\" goes, it's not worth the watch. It's strength is in its immediate-scope presentation, chock full of action, and it would honestly be na\u00efve to watch Terra Formars for anything besides a cinematic \"shock-value\" thriller set of qualities.\\n\\n\r\n~ When they say there's one, there's thirty... ~",

            "content": "I will give Terra Formars credit for its setting. It is just unique enough to make you interested in its premise. The story is just there as a backdrop, an enabler for the gory action if you will. It mentions some political intrigue in passing, setting itself up for potential twists, but never bothers going deeper into it. It gives the plot some flavor, but requires a second season to deliver on it.\r\nThe sound did its job for me, the music and voice-acting in particular sticking out as good. The art however does need to be addressed. The design of the cockroaches is too campyto be scary, which is why I would have preferred had they kept them in the dark, rather than the stale CGI army we got instead. The cockroaches also kinda look like racist caricatures of black tribesmen, which I hope I'm not alone in noticing. The rest of the character-designs however gives the viewer plenty of variety to enjoy. For those who think this is nothing but graphic violence I would also argue that the action-scenes knows how to play up the sensation of characters flying at high speeds and performing great feats of strength.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Terra Formars does show that it has bite and not just bark, is in its characters. At the start, the characters are too thin to really work when they are fighting as a team, and I would go as far as call the writing incompetent during the first half. But once the latter half of the show comes in it slows down greatly, fleshing out the characters in ways that was a welcome surprise. Had the show been more focused on the characters' personal stories early on, I think this show would have been far more hit than miss.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give Terra Formars a 5 for being an enjoyable show to fans, but very uneven with just as much good as bad things in it.",

A flat out space odessy?\r\nThats not the case here, Terra Formars is an action packed Sci-fi anime with many gore elements,its an honest anime towards the viewer from the very first episode , u know what u'll see and what to expect and it does it WELL\r\nStory 5--Its not rocket science thats for sure.Enhanced humans with bug abilities are send to Mars to fight some evolved cockroaches in order toobtain some samples of them to fight a virus that threatens earth with extinction.There are no sub-stories and the flow is annoyingly fast, especially at the first 3 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7-- I quite like the art in Terra Formers, its unique the fights are pretty good and its great for gore fans like me, u'll get to see a lot of blood, different kind of fatalities and many other.Also the female figures are just great on this one!\\n\\n\r\nSound -6- Nothing special here. The sound effects are worth mentioning, quite decent\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -6- The character development is not perfect but also not non-existant as it has mentioned by some reviewers.U get to see many glimpses of Alex's past but also from many support characters such as Adolph and Sheila.So i wouldnt go so far calling the character development non-existant, its actually Ok.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -7-It is clearly a matter of taste.For what its made i think its above average,action packed gore in quite a few moments, its a slash and splash fest and its quite enjoyable if u ask me.For some others though it might be just a nonsense",

            "content": "Every now and then there's an anime that's released that walks the delicate line of being called absolute garbage and absolute FUCKING garbage. These shows tend to focus heavily on shock factor deaths as a one trick pony, which in turn removes any integrity it may have. Some notable cases include Elfen Lied, Gantz, Mirai Nikki, Deadman Wonderland and now the next anime to carry the torch Terra Formars, has stepped up for the challenge. \r\nStory: 2/10\r\nStory? What story? Government conspiracies, the mission of Bug II and anything else the show brought up remains unresolved. Plot points that go nowhere and simply end abruptly. It'slike slowly going up the rails of a roller coaster and getting ready for the ride but the ride never happens. The show treats the material as more of a glorified add to read the manga than a stand alone work. This co-dependence on the source material to make a cohesive story is just lazy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nYou'd think by now that CGI will be used in better effect in complimenting a show, right? Well, Terra Formars spits on the face of innovation, giving us hoards of horrid CGI cockroaches that rival that of Gonzo's track record. And to top it all off, it's simply the same design copied and pasted. The character designs, also deserve special mention for looking rather stiff. It feels like no effort or love was placed into this series. The only noteworthy mention should be about the grim backgrounds of the Mars environment. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe same tracks were played continuously, showing no variation at all. Nothing worth listening to on its own and nothing that really grabs your attention. They simply serve to follow the scenes, but does nothing to heighten them. Voice performances were fine. Each character's voice actor matched their given traits, standouts being Michelle K. Davis. Of course, it will all be forgotten almost as soon as you're finished with the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not even sure this cast can even be considered \"characters\". They didn't even manage to make them 2 dimensional. There's more depth in your run of the mill shounen  protagonist than any of these \"characters\". They mostly follow the lines of common fodder or OP roach killer. \\n\r\nThrowing in a depressing backstory doesn't qualify as proper characterization. Especially if we don't even remember them by the time the 20min run time is up.  It seems like characters were only introduced to be killed by the next episode. Not only giving you no time to even care about them, but it also broke immersion when death is treated with no tension. Just a fodder fest of people we don't give a fuck about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm a completionist, the only reason I even finished this nonsense was because of the short run time. Unlike other nonsensical series like Elfen Lied, Terra Formars became more of a chore to watch. I'd rather take my chances watching another Michael Bay film that sitting through this again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nTerra Formars was simply another rushed adaptation that felt more like an eyegasm for the fans than an actual show. If you're a fan of excessive gore or the manga then this might be for you.",

            "content": "Notes\r\n-I haven\u2019t read the manga.\r\n-I watched the uncensored release of the anime.\r\nTerraformars, an anime about a bunch of genetically modified humans with animal powers that get sent to Mars to exterminate a race of hyper evolved humanoid cockroaches called Johj. Sounds radical, right? Unfortunately it isn\u2019t and here i\u2019ll explain why.\r\nStory: \r\nReally, there\u2019s not a whole lot to talk about in terms of story. The entire plot is just an excuse to get the characters to Mars as quickly as possible and make them fight a whole lot and i suppose it does achieve that just fine.\r\nThe main problem with the storytelling in Terraformars isthe pacing. \\n\r\nFor a series that prides itself on being nothing but dumb action and violent fights, it\u2019s actually painfully slow. We get shots that linger forever for no good reason, characters standing around doing and saying nothing for extended periods of time, tons of narrator delivered exposition and a ludicrous amount of flashbacks that sometimes take up the entire duration of an episode, while not really adding anything substantial. The best moments of the show are when it throws away any pretense of storytelling and just goes into full-on hot-blooded action-mode. Unfortunately these moments are rarer than you might assume and usually over quite quickly. \\n\r\nSpecial shout-out to the shitty worldbuilding of this series. \\n\r\nTerraformars is apparently set 600 years in the future, yet aside from space travel, genetic manipulation and terraforming i guess, no technological advancements were made by the human race. The people back on earth still drive the same cars, dress in the same clothes and use the same fucking smartphones as we do today. Why even set the series this far in the future, if you\u2019re not gonna use it for some interesting worldbuilding? \\n\r\nThe lightning fast evolution of the humanoid cockroaches is ridiculous anyway, may as well have set it fifty years in the future and not expose your complete lack of imagination. \\n\r\nOh yeah, there\u2019s also some government conspiracy subplot, but no one cares.\\n\r\nThe series doesnt\u2019t even have  any conclusion at all, it\u2019s set up for a sequel  that will undoubtedly happen considering the popularity of it\u2019s manga counterpart. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters of Terraformars are about as boring and one dimensional as they come. The series utilizes constant long-ass flashbacks with sappy background stories to flesh out the characters, but it never works out, the characters remain uninteresting and all the flashbacks achieve is to kill any feeling of momentum this action series might have had. \\n\r\nI shit you not, there\u2019s one character whose entire backstory involves people in his life telling him what a boring person he is. \\n\r\nHowever, this fleshing out only applies to a handful of the surprisingly large cast of Terraformars. The rest? Nameless cannon fodder that is absolutely and utterly useless and usually spend their time sitting around waiting to be killed. \\n\r\nAlso, holy fuck Terraformars, your only important German character is named Adolf, are you fucking shitting me? Would it have killed the writers to spend five seconds to google more appropriate German names?\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe OP is a generic fast paced buttrock track and it\u2019s just kinda eh, but i can\u2019t shake the feeling that it doesn\u2019t really fit the series. I suppose i expected something a bit darker and more atmospheric. \\n\r\nThe ED i don\u2018t even really remember to be honest, the music of the series in general is fairly forgettable. \\n\r\nAs far as voice acting goes, it\u2019s all fitting for the characters, but no one in the cast really delivers a standout performance. \\n\\n\r\nVisuals:\\n\r\nThe character designs are one of the few things in Terraformars i can praise. As someone who appreciates semi realistic human designs in anime, this stuff is right up my alleyway. The animal transformations of the humans also look pretty cool.\\n\r\nThe same thing can\u2019t be said of the primary antagonists of the series, unfortunately. The designs of the humanoid cockroaches or Johj have gained some notoriety for being 'racist', as they look almost like caricatures of large muscular black guys. I looked into it and apparently they are based on the homo erectus and not black people. \\n\r\nLooking at it that way, the design makes some sense, but is still not a great choice, as the Johj look silly and not particularly threatening. I feel like this is a wasted opportunity, the creators of the series could have created something truly horrifying, considering the creatures are based on fucking cockroaches of all things. The Johj could have been some serious nightmare fuel, instead they are silly cavemen. \\n\r\nAnimation in the series is fine when it counts, the fight scenes namely. It\u2019s fairly consistent and the battles feel impactful, violent and on occasion even well choreographed. Too bad the color palette is so ugly, as all the colors in Terraformars look washed out and muddy. \\n\r\nI suppose this was to give the series a darker and gritty look, but it ends up just being unappealing. \\n\r\nThere\u2019s also this distracting noise filter that they kept using seemingly at random. What was the point of that? It just made the already so-so visuals of the series look shittier whenever it was active. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI\u2019m not gonna lie, as much as i shit on this series, there were some pretty kickass moments hidden in there, namely  whenever the action was in full effect, but they are few and far between and get marred by all the problems plagueing this series. If nothing else, at least Terraformars is not particularly long and won\u2019t waste a whole lot of your time.\\n\r\nAnd this may sound unbelievable, but the educational value of Terraformars is actually surprisingly high (that is, more than nothing). You will pick up a lot of weird animal facts in this series, so there\u2019s that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nTerraformars is a series with a whole buttload of problems. Even if you are looking for a short, violent, action series, which is exactly what Terraformars is, there\u2019s a lot of better stuff out there that you should check out instead.\\n\r\nI give it a final rating of 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, please excuse any grammatical mistakes, as English is not my first language. And please feel free to leave me some feedback, i really want to improve.\\n",

            "content": "You know something no one wants to see at a lunch or dinner table? Cockroaches. Those little critters stalks around with their creepy legs and spreads disgusting odor near your delicious food. Worst yet, they want your food. But do you know what\u2019s even more disgusting or perhaps terrifying? It\u2019s when you become the food. No lie. Terra Formars reverses the situation when humans are the prey as cockroaches (also known as Terra Formars) hunt down humans to eliminate them from existence. There\u2019s something to think about\u2026\r\nFor a series based off of the same name, adaptation pacing becomes a chore to handle. I don\u2019t givemuch credit for the studio or director when they do a sloppy job as the first few episodes can really make people wonder if this is all worth it. Forget the word \u2018all\u2019, but it\u2019s more like partial considering the first few episodes broadcasted on TV were obstructed by arsine censorship. (they do fix it later though) But beyond that technical point, Terra Formars isn\u2019t really a groundbreaking show. \\n\\n\r\nTaking for face value, the show is actually pretty simple to understand. It takes place in a futuristic setting far beyond our present year. We also get alien species known as the Terra Formars, creatures who look like cockroaches but are many times its size with irregular body structure and abnormal thirst for destruction. Then, there are the humans that fights them on planet Mars. Actually, their original goal is to collect research examples as a deadly virus has taken hold on the human population but now they are playing a case of survival game against these creatures. As unoriginal as the premise sounds, the show has plenty of reasons to why viewers might be interested. The idea of fighting against alien species is thought provoking as it opens many opportunities to explore the show\u2019s gimmicks, mechanics, and characters. The problem is that the first episode leaves open a gap that needs to be filled when in terms of getting everything started. It launches the characters on full scale towards their mission and skips their background and origins. That\u2019s not the main problem though as the show accelerates fast into outer space for the main course. There\u2019s not much time for preparation either as the crew gets ambushed on their way to space.\\n\\n\r\nThis season covers the Annex I arc detailing the stories of a group of crew members including lead protagonist Komachi Shokichi. Made up of members of many different countries of origins, the series\u2019 characterization is shallow at best for the first half of the season. We don\u2019t\u2019 find out too much about much of the main characters except a select few such as Komachi. The case of death flags are also raised high for certain characters as flashbacks are played and their actions are recorded as last wills. However, the show does give more sympathy and depth for other characters later on. A prominent example is Adolf who is highlighted by flashbacks to characterize his motives and roles in the series. And as such, the reality can easily be realized of the cruelty on the frontlines. After all, the show is clearly violent, gory, and obviously isn\u2019t afraid to kill anyone in the show. Whether you\u2019re a badass action girl like Michelle or a first year newbie, Terra Formars preys on humans as if they are helpless drones. And to be honest, this show doesn\u2019t stray far from that as humans are portrayed as the underdog. However, action does contradict this later on as we see humans fight back in a tale that can be described as \u201cbug war\u201d. I label it as such because humans who have experimented on themselves are able to adapt insect-like attributes and possesses their abilities to fight on par with the Terra Formars. For the action itself though, this show can only be watchable when it\u2019s not obstructed the black censors of death. The original TV broadcasted aired the first three episodes that made itself look like a comedy. When you get scenes blocked by black bars or basketball shaped ovals, it really makes itself look like a joke. (example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzmOsvCCIAARgDt.jpg) Luckily, the show eventually got uncensored versions although the gore is still not as explicit as the manga. While shock value may sometimes be looked down upon as trying to sell its product, I think it\u2019s necessary for this show to adapt that with justice. This is because the show is violent. It is explicitly gory that needs to get the message across of what a sci-fi horror should be like. Although certain scenes are left out from the manga, the uncensored action is tolerable with sensible OST. \\n\\n\r\nOn the scientific side of the story, the show falls apart with the explanation. In retrospect, it is vague and hard to take in all at once. We don\u2019t know much about the origins of the Terra Formars besides their basic attributes and we can make from their evolution. Speaking of which, the show actually adapts more of that as we find out how well the cockroaches adapt to their environment. Still, the generational concept weakens itself and tries way too hard when it comes to its elements. It\u2019s lazy when it comes to crafting the story by skipping certain parts while lauding viewers to experience what the \u2018bug war\u2019 is like. But to experience that, the show also needs to make us feel attached to the characters. Unfortunately, it\u2019s far from achieving that with the certain deaths of various key characters. I do give some credit for the daring risks this show takes though as well as some unpredictable twists that comes by a few times. However, Terra Formars is more like a sci-fi horror that is treated as an action flick rather than a creative story. It has this engaging premise but is over-egged with saturated action with not enough context. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of artwork, the show is crude on most parts but not in terms of actual quality. It simply creates a mature atmosphere with the main characters in this futuristic setting. Speaking of which, the series hardly has any world building so don\u2019t expect the setting to steer its engine towards that direction. What you do have are adult characters, in contrast to the teenagers we often see trying to save the world. This is actually a positive and refreshing to see as we can tell the series has a more serious feeling. The characters are designed to look like troops ready to go to war. Their face expressions tells of a tale of horror just by looking at them. Besides some oddball fan service on occasions, the series has decent artwork and fitting character designs. However, the Terra Formars are crafted in a way that can spark some controversy because they resemble Homo Erectus. It\u2019s also hard to take them seriously with their ridiculously shaped eyes, overly enhanced muscle structure, or just in general of what they look like that seemingly resemble humans.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack has a moderate coordination with some suitable OST supplemented by the OP and ED songs. The background music is fitting but repetitively used on certain episodes. Not only that but emotional scenes sometimes lack the atmosphere that it tracks to convey. As for the character voice mannerism, I can hardly remember any of them besides a few climatic moments. Almost none of them stand out much since they are screaming most of the time while fighting for their lives. The Terra Formars are probably only memorable for their actions and occasional groans. Most of the time, your headphones will be filled with screams of terror. No intelligence. No credible humor. Just a of bucket load of hellish cries.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this shows is a glorification of a mixed bag adaptation. While it reasonably adapts some of the core elements, its main problems lies with the world building and weak story. Its unoriginality and generic tropes with invasion and sci-fi horrors themes may makes it seem like it can be interesting. However, its lack of charisma and it\u2019s hard to fathom what the show is trying to even achieve. Fighting against the Terra Formars, saving mankind, or just showing us some sci-fi adventure with shock and cruelty. This show is like a callous cash-in with an attempt to adapt an engaging premise but never able to make the cut.\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nOne of the most frightening organisms on the planet is so miniscule that it's a wonder that it exists in the first place, let alone causes massive harm. This organism is, of course, the virus. A tiny, technically lifeless thing whose only function is to replicate to keep its existence going. In biology, it's a rather fascinating phenomenon that has been in place for millions, if not billions, of years. While human technology has improved by leaps and bounds in an immensely shorter time span, there are still questions and unknowns we have yet to answer. Among theminclude nearly incurable diseases. With this premise in mind, Terra Formars takes shape. That shape being a crooked and jagged mess.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nTerra Formars starts with a man named Akari, whose fighting prowess has given him the opportunity to join a select group of people aimed at finding a cure to a deadly disease that has plagued the Earth. Him and many others undergo an operation to mutate their bodies and board a spaceship destined for Mars and the supposed answers they seek.\\n\\n\r\nThe story telling within the anime follows a rather inconsistent style. It begins by following a majority of the groups confined to the ship, providing us with a glimpse into who is on board, the countries involved, and the gravity of the situation. Once on Mars, the focus shifts from a group mentality to an individual one. At this point, characters are singled out and, for usually less than a full episode, he or she is given a small amount of background. The idea here is to give us a sense of connection. That the people we're watching risk their lives on a distant planet are more than just fodder to the cause. But it never comes off this way (save for one character, more later). The show tried to focus on the characters over the story because the story itself isn't compelling enough to engage the audience. They attempt to mix in some plot elements, such as parallel stories and espionage, but it isn't executed nearly as well as it could be.\\n\\n\r\nThis execution is unquestionably the result of the core of Terra Formars: the fighting. Instead of attempting to showcase more of what the world has to offer or how the mission is more meaningful than it at first seems, it instead highlights the fighting between the humans and the cockroaches. This prominent focus therefore defers to gore and violence instead of actual narrative balance.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the nature (if you will) of the show, part of the \"allure\" is in the powers of the characters at play. The problem is that, in order for the viewers to understand the mutations, a considerable amount of literal narration and time is spent on discussing what animals the humans are using. More often than not, it occurs during the fights themselves. Meaning, besides the story telling already being as choppy as it is, what the anime puts on a pedestal also succumbs to the same choppy issues. The mutations may have ties to the characters' pasts, but the inelegance of their incorporation within the story leaves much to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nTerra Formars maintains a rather mature look throughout the season. The characters themselves are usually well defined, with sharp lines and contours for the faces and throwbacks to the actual animals they are portraying. The same can't be said for the environments. The vast majority of the locations are usually just rocky terrain and boring to look at, with almost zero variety. As for the enemies, CG is used for the cockroaches when a large amount of them are on screen at once. It can be a little off-putting at first, but over time one gets used to seeing them in that state.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation suffers a bit, unfortunately. Not only do there exist a lot of still frames and only mouth movements for many of the characters during dialogue, but many of the fights contain little choreography. Coupled with the fact that the majority of the battles contain zoomed in shots or little animation, the core element of the anime is a major letdown across the board.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime can be watched either censored or uncensored, but it is not worth it to see with the former in place. The censorship present when active makes many of the scenes completely impossible to watch, once again impeding the anime's shtick (very violent killings).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nPutting it rather bluntly, the entire cast is unmistakably bad. It's only saving grace is that there exists a single character who, without him, would render everyone as forgettable. I'll start with the bad and work towards the (only) good.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the first characters introduced is Akari, a rough and tumble dude dead set on saving the girl he loves from the disease gripping her. His motivations are clear, yet his underlying strength is not. Taking the chance to create a better tomorrow for the ones he loves, he accepts the task presented to him, hoping to do everything in his power to bring peace back home, even if said power consumes him. He sounds rather intriguing on paper, but beyond the first episode or so, we never really learn much more about him. That is to say, he never again takes the spotlight long enough to make him relevant to the story at hand. It's a shame, considering he is one of the cast members who we learn a little bit about. His underutilization sets the precedent for everyone else involved.\\n\\n\r\nSheila embodies kindness. Free spirited and filled with generosity, she tags along with the rest of the squad not as a fighter but more as a cheerleader. Unable to mask her fear of the mission at hand, she clings to a romance that she most likely knows deep down can never be. Her friendship with Alex and Marcos shows that, despite her ladylike demeanor, she isn't afraid of helping those in need. The precedent set earlier is used once more; she is shown, talked about, then subsequently put to the side for the rest of anime. It's a little more forgivable this time, since her overall purpose was to give Marcos a reason to fight. The justification is there, but not executed well enough simply because her character feels just as useless as the rest of the people on board.\\n\\n\r\nThe only (seriously, the only) good character found within Terra Formars is Adolph. The byproduct of a terrible experiment, his broken spirit and reason for fighting feel the most human, despite the beast within him. His dedication to the position of captain and composed behavior in the face of an incomprehensible scenario make him a sight to behold both on and off the battlefield. He's a great character not just for being bad-ass, which he most certainly is, but because he actually contains some semblance of depth. Where he begins and where he ultimately ends help to showcase the futility of getting one's hopes up. A tragic character, his inclusion gave this one a small light in the sea of darkness.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nSuffering \"Mirai Nikki Syndrome\", arguably the best part of the show is the OP. The back-and-forth vocals coupled with the fast guitar make it extremely catchy and great fun to listen to, even outside of the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is at least okay. The drums bring about the tempo, the piano adds to its gracefulness, and the vocals are slow and simple to follow.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is largely forgettable, save for the signature, six-note, up-and-down piece that plays when a battle is about to begin. The sound effects involved at least add to the brutality of the aforementioned fighting.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to voice acting, there were no standout performances to be had. The only notable voices were the cockroaches and their \"Jo Ji\" which is the extent of their vocabulary, yet the meaning of varies wildly.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhen the anime first started, the censorship was quite unbearable. Black shading and polka-dots filled the screen, making much of the on-screen action hidden to the viewer. If the entire point of the anime is to show grotesque ways of murdering humans and \"cockroaches,\" then it should be quite obvious that any form of censorship would ruin the intended goal. It was eventually alleviated, but the damage was done.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime doesn't focus on much else. Some attempts at humor are made, but it never tries too hard at it. Same for the drama; outside of Adolf, the rest feels lackluster and completely falls flat. Watching the good guys use their animal abilities should be really fun to watch. And at times, it is. Watching Alex hurl metallic spheres at incredible speeds, seeing Michelle crushing a foe to smithereens, or witnessing Adolf's almost god-like powers can be quite cool. But these moments are too few and far between to make the show compelling enough to keep one interested.\\n\\n\r\nTerra Formars wasn't trying to do much. But even for what it set out to do, the execution just wasn't there. The story is bland, the characters are bad, and the rest is boring. Perhaps in the future, when missions to Mars are actually feasible, we can send this anime to where it belongs: anywhere but here.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, inconsistent, too much focus on the fights, poorly placed explanations\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, lame art style, little animation even for the battles, too much censorship\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Adolf saves the day\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, okay ED, bad soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, literally just humans squashing bugs\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "Warning: this review is written for the average anime fan and not other critics since that wouldnt help anyone and would just be me ranting\r\nSo I began watching terra formars mid airing, i had always wanted to check it out (since seeing it on anichart) and i did so. to be honest i had high expectations, out of all the anime this season this looked the most unique. after finishing the first episode my expectations took a huge hit (this was one of those slow beginnings of introducing characters and backgrounds). i almost dropped it but i didnt and im glad i didnt because onep 2 is where the real meat of the show started. \\n\\n\r\nnow if you cant tell already this anime has gore and i started watching this on crunchyroll (god the censoring was terrible), luckily though i found a sight that had it fully uncensored and was able to take in the full experience.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nnow theres not much of a story besides people going to mars to collect samples of a virus to create a vaccine, but (tiny spoiler, kinda) twist is \"terra formars\" attack the ship and now theyre stuck on mars surrounded by hordes of creepy humanoid roaches (very attack on titanish). however there is a rescue ship coming to mars to save them and the story becomes how they survive until then (which is really interesting since ive never seen any other any that say \"you have 1 month dont die until then\")\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\ni still have no idea how there were able to do the cockroaches right, even if it was cgi how were they able to make it so unnoticeable, this i really dont know. all the characters were all animated decently well, you can tell there was no lazy work ... except maybe in some of the first fight scenes. most of the fight scenes were great you see a fist then the fist smashing into the exoskeleton of a roach but in the first fight there were one or two attacks that were set on a black background. then if you look at the last battlefield (the one that had nukes fired upon) it looks stunning, maybe it was the flames or maybe just the gradience (them gradience)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nsound is not something i can say much about, the voice actors all did their jobs well and the series wasnt really reliant on the soundtrack even in the fights scenes and when there is it's in the background to keeps your heart pumping. the op and ending doesnt stand out that much either, it wasnt anything bad, it was semi good and fitted the series and thats what i think is important\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6\\n\r\ni would like to mention that on the ship to mars there were 99  people on board, luckily most of them were slaughtered before ep 3. yes, the show does kill off many people, but most the characters that dies arnt that important, in fact i think in the entire show only 3 important characters dies and i only say important is because they had backstories and screen time. Still the characters arnt that deep especially the main character whom i can only say is main character because he was introduced first (most characters gets equal screen time after the first episodes). i wont say the characters are stereotypes since all characters fall under a stereotype but they do have certain traits such as the happy go lucky one (that obviously dies), the heartless commanding one, or/and the charismatic cheif. many of the characters also get episodes for themselves with backstories on why they chose to come to mars and how they became who they are. a type of character development you could say since any other kind would be kinda difficult while fighting cockroach after cockroach. also, having an attention span of 5 seconds i skip most of the backstories besides adolf's whos backstory was a great buildup to the climax for the character and story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nok, i gotta admit it i did get sucked into continually watching this week after week, what can say i just like how mindless and fun it is. one major reasons i kept watching was to see the powers of the next character and what species theyre based on. each character in the show fight with an ability based solely on a species on earth, for example if your based on an alpheid shrimp (which can fire jets of air) then your ability would be that, stick your hand in front of a cockroaches face and blow it off.\\n\\n\r\ni enjoyed Terra Formars the same way i enjoyed Attack on Titan, seeing characters put in a situation where everything is against them and seeing what happens next\\n\\n\r\nIt should be worth mentioning that the show will be finished in another season (if it comes out), the last scene scene is actually really similar to the last scene of btooom they even have the same helicopter\\n\\n\r\ni cant guaranty youll enjoy this but its definitely worth taking a look and if you do want to watch this then watch till episode 2/3 then decide to continue or stop watching since episode 1 has stopped alot of people\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.2\\n\\n\r\ntips\\n\r\n1:sit back an relax\\n\r\n2:watch the anime for the reason of enjoying it and nothing else like how your suppose to watch anime\\n",

            "content": "I would not even have known about Terra Formars if I had not seen a short YouTube clip months back. And right now, I am so glad I clicked on that video. \r\nStory: \r\nFuturistic setting on Mars where people with animal powers (mostly insects) fight humanoid cockroaches. Interesting premise to say the least. At first, I had low expectations for the show. Reviews for the first few episodes had been very low for the extreme censorship when it was originally airing. However, I had watched the series after all those black screens were taken down and must say that the show surprised me. I foundthe story to be exciting and interesting at the same time through every episode. The scientific facts scattered through the whole thing show a great amount of research was done by the creator. Terra Formars is a smart show for sure, and if you get distracted during the scientific outbursts by the narrator, confusion will likely set in. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe environments, character models, and animation all look fantastic. I love the darker theme to the colors shown. The fighting and gore is well done for both the roaches and humans, making the show feel more mature. Blood isn't splattering all over the place in every fight unrealistically like in other shows, which is a relief.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nGreat soundtrack overall. Whether it be for tragic, action-packed, or horrific moments, there are songs to match each. The opening and ending are also well done. Voices match their characters, and the sound effects go with what is happening on screen. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI like how there is no central main character in Terra Formars. This is the story of Annex 1 and all its divisions, so multiple characters in various divisions get different amounts of character development and back-story, which really makes it unpredictable when trying to guess who will die in the near or far future. There is not a single character on the human side I was hoping would get killed off, and I love the charm some of them have. There were more than a few unexpected funny moments, and they didn't feel childish in execution. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis was not only a fun show, but a great one, and these 13 episodes were the best time I have ever had with an anime thus far. The end of the final episode did leave off on a cliffhanger, but the manga has not even finished yet, so hopefully there will be a season 2 soon enough. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n-Interesting/exciting story\\n\r\n-Fantastic art for environments, characters, fight scenes, and gore.\\n\r\n-Amazing soundtrack, good voices\\n\r\n-Likable characters, lengths of development provide unpredictability for who dies.\\n\r\n-Not only a fun show, but a great one",

            "content": "Every year theres allways those anime wich generally are deemed has \"bad\" or \"mediocre\" because of their inconsistent nature and their unpopularity, they strive to get a certain fanbase however this \"try hard\" factor usually winds up becoming their very downfall.. However if theres a show that despite being unpopular and mediocre  manages to be a hell of a ride, that would be Terra Formars.. At first glance, naturally, terra formars looks like your survival horror show that it takes itself so serious its laughable.. and thats exactly what it is.. the best part of Terra Formars is the fun you get from it..The art is really messy and misguided, the antagonists are crazy stupid and the characters are there to either get killed or to support the non-existent drama.. I do have to acknowledge Terra formars for their story telling wich isnt bad.. actualy its quite fair however this loses all of its impact due to the small lenght of the show and weak character development, i also have to point out the fact that they explain really well every \"power\" and insect characteristics  in a fast and efficient way.. It is true and i cannot deny that Terra Formars is nothing but a popcorn flic, and that is enough to make this show superior to various other shows of its kind.. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was actually fair.. I loved the opening and the ending, the background music was fitting and reasonable.. The real factor of this show is  the enjoyment you get from its mindless fun every episode.. Its far from being good but it certainly isnt bad.. I give this show medium-low priority its the kind of show you watch after a long tiring day of work something to laugh at and relax without thinking to much. \\n\\n\r\nPs: Turn off your brains while  watching this.. It will enchance your experience",

            "content": "Seeing so many negative reviews for Terra Formars, I decided to offer a positive view instead. Note that I would probably give an 8 for this anime, but because of it's pure enjoyment factor, I'm jacking it up to a 9.\r\nWhat I like about Terra Formars is that the universe is much more...developed, than the typical fare that action anime gives us. It's not a bunch of teenagers running around saving the world, but a people who have been chosen from a diversity of backgrounds tasked with collecting samples to cure a virus that has surfaced on Earth. Questionable scientific methods aside (i'm going tochalk it up to 500 years worth of scientific research). The premise itself is interesting enough: cockroaches were sent to Mars to Terra Form (hence the name), to perhaps make it suitable for human habitation in the future. But fast forward 500 hundred years and these cockroaches are some bigas$ humanoid mutations each with the strength of an army. The irony of becoming to the cockroaches on Mars what they are to humans on Earth seems to be presented again and again as the narrative switches between Earth and Mars.\\n\\n\r\nTo combat these the humans hybrid themselves with various animals, taking on the fighting ability of various dangerous animals from all over the world. I really enjoyed the exposition on the different kinds of animals and how their abilities would fare in human combat. It kept me interested. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime also had political elements which are always lacking in the genre. Subversion, typical politicking and allied blocs of nations with their own agendas provide a nice overarching story to complement the straight up massacre (on both sides) that constantly seems to be happening on Mars. \\n\\n\r\nWhat seems to lack though is the presence of interesting characters. I only seem to be attached to one, and that is Michelle (and perhaps Adolf) - the others simply blur into the background for me. They aren't exactly original or well thought-out, and I've found myself feeling nothing in many of the 'character development' scenes. However, I will put that aside because Terra Formars isn't trying to be something it's not. And for that, I won't nitpick at the lack of compelling characterisation.\\n\\n\r\nTerra Formars makes me wonder at what will happen next, and though not necessarily original, is highly enjoyable and unpredictable. The plot is enough for me to continue watching definitely, and the themes on extinction and survival are palpable throughout the show. More than that though, it is action-packed, with a decent soundtrack and gets my blood pumping when I watch it, and that in itself is worth the watch.",

            "content": "A few weeks ago a friend of mine dared me to embark on a dangerous mission - one which could subject me to emotional turmoil even if I emerged alive. Turns out a bunch of no-name idiots were waltzing off to Mars to gather samples and research a cure for some lethal virus, while trying not to be ripped apart by giant mutant body builders with cockroach heads.\r\nMy mission? To sit around watching these idiots pretend to actually be doing something for 13 episodes while my senses are senselessly abused! I accepted, on the condition that this unnamed friend watch \u201cBtooom!\u201d in exchange. After completingmy mission, I can safely say I\u2019d rather re-watch that twice over than tune in to this clueless \u201cperformance\u201d again.\\n\\n\r\nSaid performance is Terra Formars; the \u201caction\u201d survival \u201chorror\u201d anime that doesn\u2019t care about either itself or its viewers; the show that feebly pretends to offer everything while offering absolutely nothing. Well, nothing except a few ridiculous, laughably edgy \u201cdeath and gore\u201d scenes in the first few episodes, which are so over the top at times that they transcend being horrifying and become plain silly. A certain head-severing spinal cord whip comes to mind.\\n\\n\r\nIf you really must watch this show (and I strongly advise against it), at least make it the uncensored version, otherwise you\u2019re stripping out what little enjoyment there is to be gained from this animated fecal matter, be it for s(c)h(l)ock factor or simply laughing at the show\u2019s tryhard nature. But I\u2019m sorry to say that even such ironic enjoyment from the biology-defying bloodbaths is in short supply here, since both the comical absurdity and the actual shock value quickly dissipate as such scenes get toned down after the first several episodes. This leaves the show to rely on its actual substance and merit.\\n\\n\r\nHah, I wish. Terrible Formars goes to great lengths to muck up everything it tries to accomplish (...well, \u201ctries\u201d is pushing it), and to even greater lengths to ensure it\u2019s as crushingly devoid of ANY substance whatsoever as a 5-hour season can be.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t be fooled by its promises of a sci-fi survival story. There isn\u2019t one. It literally sets up the basic premise, sticks the idiots on mars and then a bunch of said idiots and some roaches drop dead with no meaningful progress in sight. Plot threads vanish as quickly as they appear to never be brought up again. None of it leads anywhere and none of it ends up mattering as far as the viewer is concerned. Even if I wanted to make this a spoiler review, I\u2019m not even sure there\u2019s anything I could say about the plot that could spoil the viewing\u2026 \u201cexperience\u201d. It\u2019s like dangling a fish hook, waiting for a bite, then immediately cutting the line - on purpose.\\n\\n\r\nRinse and repeat until the writers get bored of it and stop casting out any hooks to begin with, and you\u2019re just left with bugs and stick figures gawking at each other, occasionally interjected by a narrator gushing long-windedly about insects, lightning, the stages of suffocation and so forth. Honestly, these science lessons to pad out the episode or try to make some one-time bug transformation ability seem meaningful were the closest things to interesting material in the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nSo, without any notable plot progression the show is left to leverage another strength, like a sharp script or a solid cast of characters. To be honest, the latter quality is the one single area where Terra Formars succeeds most.\\n\\n\r\nSucceeds at what? Being entirely incompetent on every level!\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the cast have NO defining personality. They barely qualify as one-dimensional. You could have any two of them swap places and nothing of note would change. Several of them get some lengthy, drawn-out \u201csad backstories\u201d, but evidently the show forgot to make the backstories even remotely define the character, explain their personality or tie meaningfully into current events, so you\u2019re still left with non-characters with either one or no defining personality traits!\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is driven by the loss of a loved one to fight off the roaches and gather the virus samples, which is an acceptable motivation, but like most things in the show, NOTHING comes out of this - it\u2019s just explaining why this caricature is on the mission and leaving it at that! There\u2019s NOTHING else that defines him. He\u2019s so bland and unremarkable that in any other show he would feel like a one-off side character, but there\u2019s no competition here.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a woman who\u2019s a jerk to her lover! What a complex character! And another was a famous boxer and - whoa, look! His bug transformation involves punching things! LOOK, IT WAS RELEVANT! What a miracle. Too bad that\u2019s about all we know. These are some of the show's \"better\" attempts at making a character. With most, you\u2019d be lucky to remember any of their names.\\n\\n\r\nThese aren\u2019t characters; they\u2019re just cutouts made from tree bark! And no matter how gratuitously violent the show tries to make some of their deaths, I don\u2019t care, because why would I? It\u2019s just tree bark!\\n\\n\r\nEven the dialogue fails to add any flavour to them. In fact, it\u2019s all quite dull. Its serves only to either blurt out exposition, fill time in a scene, or occasionally force in some awful comic relief. Are you tired of boob or perversion jokes? Well, these are just about the least-creative, most lifeless perversion jokes I\u2019ve ever seen, or even comedy as a whole that isn\u2019t set in a high school club room. Not to mention that in a supposedly serious story of survival, this forced style of humour comes across as out-of-place.\\n\\n\r\nWithout anything of interest in the dialogue, characters, their backstories, and no plot threads that go anywhere, all of the above just comes off like awful filler in practice. Yes, the plot and characters themselves are on the level of bad filler, dragging out the show, going nowhere, lacking direction, and existing only to waste the viewer\u2019s time between any semblance of action. For a show whose first selling point was over-the-top violence, it seems intent on diluting it as much as possible, and this problem only gets progressively worse as the show goes on. Frankly, the pacing of everything after the first third is unacceptable, and what was already at best mildly ironically amusing becomes a downright agonizing viewing experience as episode after episode goes by without an interesting moment in sight.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the production also tends to fall short, so these moments of \u201caction\u201d that should be something to look forward to are more like drops of dirty water in a desert. But I was so dehydrated that I was willing to take anything. I cheered out loud when, after several episodes of NOTHING, there was a brief sort-of-edgy scene with some character whose name I\u2019ve all but erased from my memory. Then it was straight back to the desert trek.\\n\\n\r\nBut before I veer off-course, let\u2019s talk about the action. It\u2019s abysmal.\\n\\n\r\nWhatever definition you may have for \u201cchoreography\u201d, it\u2019s near-nonexistent here. Your typical \u201caction\u201d scene might have 10 seconds of something even within reach of being called \u201cdynamism\u201d (usually it\u2019s just the \"death and carnage\" scenes, which, granted, tend to be well-animated when they actually happen). The rest consists of some disappointingly sluggish direct face-offs between a human and an abnormally non-intimidating (just goofy) giant CGI cockroach. Remember that boxing character? Well, let\u2019s just say I wouldn\u2019t buy tickets to watch him fight these roaches. The rest is a combination of more bland dialogue pretending to be discussions of strategy, some science lessons from Mr. Narrator, shounen-style filler monologues, lengthy scenes of everyone just sitting around crying or gawking (as the roaches stand around doing nothing), or frustrating interjections from yet another woe-was-me backstory to waste another two-thirds of an episode on.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the production weaknesses don\u2019t end there. Visually, there\u2019s the obvious issue with the armies of CGI body-builder roaches being of poor quality. Yet somehow even when half of them are off-putting CGI, their designs just don\u2019t look frightening enough to feel like a threat (oh, wait, that would require some decent characters to be threatened by them in the first place). Honestly, the awkward human character designs manage to be more uncanny than the dumb, goofy-looking muscle-roaches could ever hope to be. When combined with bland colour and background design, static direction, a repetitive aesthetic and unremarkable animation, there\u2019s little left to carry the show visually.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio doesn\u2019t fare any better. Aside from a passable opening, the actual soundtrack of the series is pretty poor. Not one song is either worth listening to on its own or effective in the context of the scene. At best, they add nothing, and at worst, they\u2019re actively ill-fitting, not to mention the repetition of the few (memorable is too much credit) \u201crecognizable\u201d ones just serves to make the increasingly soul-numbing viewing experience even more bland. Also, the sound design is atrocious at times, with some sounds quite literally clipping whatever audio channel it was recorded on. I thought it was my headphones, but nope, it was just an oversight that the most inexperienced hobbyist sound editor could recognize and fix in seconds. Production is more complicated than that, of course, but it seems there was some \"production hell\" going on behind the scenes and/or a rushed schedule failing to warrant the time or money to fix all such mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nWith this lack of even a serviceable level of production, and with so little in the way of substance or entertainment value combined with increasingly awful pacing, Terrible Formars is a landfill's worth of garbage in almost every conceivable way. The only thing it has to define itself is a few comical death scenes with brief spikes in animation quality, but the show couldn\u2019t even commit to that one-trick gimmick as a selling point. While there are plenty of technically \u201cworse\u201d pieces of media out there, those were at least memorable horror shows. The only memorable thing about this is how little it even seems to care about anything it does, and if the show doesn\u2019t care, it's hard to care as a general viewer. It feels like an ill-informed product, and a failed one on every level.\\n\\n\r\nLet me be clear that I hold no resentment to the creators of this, nor do I think this show \"owes\" me anything - I myself chose to sit through it on a dare after all. But I'm going to call it like it is, and with that disclaimer made, Terrible Formars is the worst kind of bad anime. There may be other more shockingly incompetent shows out there, but the experience of watching this is awful. It\u2019s not an ironically enjoyable \u201cso-bad-it\u2019s-good\u201d series, not intriguingly or bafflingly insane or stupid, not uniquely or memorably inept, lacks value as a learning experience, and isn\u2019t even insulting or offensively terrible; at least that would be SOMETHING! This is nothing. It\u2019s empty; pointless; a creative void in animated form. It\u2019s atrociously-executed and amateurly-produced across the board; utterly devoid of substance, integrity, plot, proper characterization, heart, effort, or literally anything worth caring about. Even the over-the-top deaths wear off fast. I can only recommend this to masochists. Everyone else, AVOID!\\n",

Terra Formars aired in 2014 and most of the brutal inhumane scenes were censored.. but Bro do you even know what day it is? It's 2015 and all the scenes are now uncensored *Mind blown*\r\nI can honestly say the uncensored version is a totally different Anime. Example? Sure. They don't play Basketball anymore on Mars. :)\r\nWhy did I rate Terra Formars so high?\r\n- Fast paced and captivating plot twists! (None stop action)\r\n- LOADS OF FIGHTING! (I say 70%)\r\n- LOADS of gore and decapitation! (A MUST have in a *Horror* apocalyptic genre, I hate it when an Anime has aHorror genre tag and I get absolutely no gore at all)\\n\r\n- LOADS of deaths (Not really a spoiler since every apocalyptic genre has a huge death rate)\\n\r\n- Bug ability plot mechanics. (Informative information about their abilities *Insectopedia* You never get to see any of *bug mechanics* in Anime so this is a first for me and most of you guys too. You know what  I mean by *Bug ability plot mechanics* when you watch it)\\n\\n\r\nDon't get fooled because my MAL buddy said so! Don't get fooled because its rated 7.07 on MAL! People just follow the \"score hype train' and always listen to the fool. Please don't do that!You need to watch it for yourself first and not listen to the lowed scored elitist members who rated this Anime below 5! Ok sorry enough of the rambling. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, If you like action packed gore suspenseful science fiction action where no one, not even the main characters  is safe, and you enjoy a sprinkling of trivial knowledge throughout the series, this is the perfect Anime! AND If you don't like seeing insects getting REKT because your a nature boy/grill then please put this Anime on your drop list. Thanks. :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Terra Formars was one of the series that received a lot of conflicting opinions during the fall 2014 season. Some loved it for the Linkin Park grimdark edginess while a majority of people hated on it purely due to the censorship. But let's face it, censorship is not a valid reason to give this series a one out of ten. If anything, there are much bigger problems than a giant black circle in the middle of the screen when it comes to this show.\r\nTerra Formars is one of those series where it could have possibly been decent. You start watching this show and the amazinghot blooded opening music comes on and you get all pumped up. Then as you go through it you just wonder to yourself if time was better spent studying for that final instead. The experience was akin to being teased by a really hot girl but suddenly experiencing erectile dysfunction when she tells you she has syphilis halfway through the makeout session. The premise was pretty interesting and I really liked the idea of how the tables have turned and the bug overlords are now hunting down the humans. You shouldn't expect anything more from the story other than to set up action. That's perfectly fine because that's what this show is meant to be. Unfortunately, it's those small details that really pisses you off and drove this show straight into the dumpster. The biggest offender of this is the narration. I'm an advocate of showing and not telling because it does not ruin the immersion experience. In this show however, you constantly have this out of place infodump either in the middle of action scenes or just before a big reveal and it completely destroys the atmosphere. Not only that, it treats the viewers as if they are 75 IQ retards just because the studio is too lazy to incorporate these information through character interactions. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs is one of the things that went well for this show. Unfortunately the same cannot really be said of a lot of the characters themselves. Personally I think the main problem is that 13 episodes is not nearly enough to develop such a large cast. While dynamics between the main characters were done decently, you just can't give a damn about the rest of the cast. And when they get killed off it seemed like they are randomly killed just for the sake of being a tear jerker or to induce shock through all the gore because you do not feel a connection to them.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of shock and gore, oh boy, we now come to the censorship. Remember when you thought Tokyo Ghoul was pretty heavily censored? Well that was pretty tame compared to this. Sometimes the screens would just be half black and other times they would have random black circles. To speak the truth, I actually loved the censored version because I just find it absolutely hilarious and it also spawned lots of dank memes with that one particular head grab scene. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day you should treat this show like one of those B movies from the 1950s about vampire Nazi sunflowers from Venus or some shit like that. Watch the censored version and enjoy it while making fun of the hilarious expressions of the cockroaches, the absurd fights and some QUALITY animation with your friends. \\n",

            "content": "Would you like to hear a joke?\r\nTerraformars.\r\nThat's the whole joke.\r\nTerra formars follows the expedition of strong humans to mars, who have the task of killing and capturing evolved fighting cockroaches that were used to make Mars more inhabitable for humans. The objective is to find a cure for a disease that came from Mars, which could lead to the deaths of many people on earth.\r\nTerra formars is very much a sci fi, horror anime. The shows main message is trying to look at the perspective of \"If humans were the pests\" instead of cockroaches. It does this by looking at the themes of evolution andhow humans could lag behind in terms of further development in the future, leading to extinction. Another theme is medical advancement as a way of combatting the evolved cockroaches, this involves taking the characteristics of certain organisms and fusing them with humans to give great fighting abilities. The show also highlights the characters personal reasons for joining the expedition, and their goals for the end of mission too. In terms of atmosphere, there is tension throughout due to the many fights constantly going on, leading there pace being similar throughout. Fighting is very much prevalent with many characters and cockroaches alike being killed, showing that no one is safe. Furthermore, the show looks deeper at how the characteristics of the organisms enable humans and cockroaches to fight.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, in terms of story, there is little to be desired. The shows pacing was steady due to the fact that 8 of the 13 episodes contained none stop fighting. This in turn lead to a lack of suspense as there was no plot development for nearly all of the whole show. It's over focus on new abilities and 'epic' fights lead to a rushed ending, which, in turn, reverted back to focusing on the epic fighting rather than focusing on other topics such as how the cockroaches managed to evolve.  Unfortunately, the excessive focus on humans and cockroaches dying lead to the story being one dimensional. This was upsetting, as the introduction to the show had good pacing and took more of a holistic  approach in explaining the plot, character interaction and fighting. Lastly, it's choice of how episodes were ordered was very questionable, as the pacing suffered severely with the focusing on developing 2 or 3 characters for a few episodes. This in turn lead to further plot  development troubles.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the animation, the picture quality, overall fluidity of fight scenes and scenery as a whole was to a high standard, as expected from a 2014 anime. The character models were quiet varied, offering more distinction between the different types of organism characteristics the humans had. Overall, it was a pleasure on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the models of the cockroaches do look very  stereotypical of black tribal warriors, which could be offensive. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a huge cast of characters involved in Terra Formars, many involved characters with powers and none combatants. It mainly focuses on the characters with super powers, which a narrator explains which organism the abilities have been taken from. Character  development is prevalent with some, but not all due to the size of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the shows lack of remorse for characters makes it difficult to like, as many characters could end up dying. This makes it tough to find a \"personal favorite\". Also, the show seems to lack a solid main character, as there are so many characters important to the mission, so many that die and so many that are under developed, the lack of structure means it's hard to determine which is the main character. Although, some characters were developed to a good standard, and it did attempt to explain many characters opinions.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the music, both the opening and ending are more focused on rock music, which was fine but not entirely too my liking. It's OST was very pleasurable, highlighting and amplifying tension in battle, as well as more orchestral music for character infractions, which I enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, Terra Formats  fundamental errors in it's writing and in basic story telling lead to the show looking more like Fight club than a sci fi horror.",

            "content": "I can honestly say this review is completely unbiased, as I watched the show with no idea whatsoever of its reception. I marathoned it all in one night and decided to read some reviews atferward to see if anyone shared my thoughts about it.\r\nLet's just say they did, but the negative aspects were amplified hundredfold.\r\nFirst of all, the story. I'm going to be honest and say the idea seemed a bit weird, if not stupid, but I decided to give it the benefit of doubt.  Giant humanoid cockroaches commanded by another   pretty much immortal giant cockroach? A martian virus? A possibly aliencivilization wanting to destroy the earth using muscular bugs? Okay.\\n\\n\r\nI gave it a six simply because of the concept. It is not original by any means, but it's got a couple unique aspects. And hell, it was entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe art wasn't bad at all. Those cockroaches are easily the creepiest things I've ever seen in anime, and I've seen plenty. I kind of find it odd that Mars could seem to alike Earth, even with the moss growing around, but I'll call it  artistic license. I liked the characters' designs and the slightly more realistic way in which they were drawn, and I even found some of the characters to be handsome in an unconventional way. I gave it an eight.\\n\\n\r\nThe OSTs weren't the best, but they were fitting enough. The wailing woman in the sad moments seems to be a must in these sorts of shows. I did like both the OP and ED.  A seven seems a bit too kind, but there were a cuuple OSTs that did get me pumped up in moments of tension.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has one of my favorite male characters in anime, Adolf. It's frustrating how little screentime he got as he's easily the most developed and had so much more potential. I won't say anything else, cuz spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn't really fond of anyone else, I must admit. They just had too little screentime and many backstories seemed very soap-operaish.  Perhaps if they had givevn more focus on the character their deaths could've had a much bigger impact, sans a certain character. But I have to admit, though, that me being the softie I am did suffer every time someone died, but seeing the other reviews that's probably just me. \\n\\n\r\nThe only other character for whom I really cared was Michelle, who I hink also had great time for potential. And well, she's really badass.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the potential each character had, and because of Adolf, I'll be extremely generous and give this area a nine.\\n\\n\r\nIf one thing's for sure, I was hooked. Even though most of the tension consisted of cheap shock value and I'm pretty sure they're all going to die at ome point, I found myself on the edge of my seat several times (particularly on the parts revolving around Adolf).  The sort certainly had the element of tension, and fot that I'll five it a seven.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't as bad as some people put it to be, in my opinion. It just suffers from not being executed well enough.  For me, its major flaw was the lack of development, the pace, that sort of stuff. The themes were good,a nd even if it was not directly put, a certain one about how death is in te end futile got me thinking a lot, and I love animes that get that reaction from me.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially... well. SPOILERS! When Adolf died. He tried dying at first, but ultimately realized his he did value his comrades and proetected them until the end. And the fact the cockroach leader survived a lightning bolt falling directly on top of him was kind of an asspull if you ask me. The worst part is, he died without saving anyone. But he did die among comrades, so I guess that kind of shows that in the end, death is not entirely meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nI did hate his whore of a wife, though.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it? Yes, but only to a certain public. One that could see a show for what it is despite its flaws. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "No good can come from putting \u201cMars\u201d in your title. \r\n\u201cTerra Formars\u201d is an adaption of the seinen manga by Sasugu Yu and Kenichi Tachibana by the same name. Serialized in the same magazine as Tokyo Ghoul, (Young Jump, or Shonen Jump for big boys) \u201cTerra Formars\u201d is a sci-fi/action horror.\r\nOh, you were expecting more of an explanation? But, there really isn\u2019t anything else to say. I might have been able to crack a joke, but the anime is a joke enough already for me to not have to. I\u2019m just going to stop wasting your time here; \r\ntl;dr: this show sucks \r\n---PLOT:---\r\n(Yes, I didwatch it uncensored)\\n\\n\r\nMany years prior to the story, humanity sent cockroaches and various mosses to Mars in hopes of terra-forming the surface. (making it a suitable environment for earthly life.) It worked, too. But recently, a disease has broken out on Earth, and a handful of \u201cspecialists\u201d from all over the globe are sent to Mars in hopes for finding a cure. But on said planet are hordes of the cockroaches, which have evolved to the point of being almost human. Naturally, the series is advertised as a \u201chyper-violence\u201d action series that\u2019s filled with more blood than narrative substance.\\n\\n\r\nBut instead of being a mindless, action-filled gore-fest, it\u2019s character backstories and apparent mystery sub-plot actually means it demands a certain amount of respect as a story. So that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to treat it; like an actual story. (You reap what you sow, Sasugu!)\\n\\n\r\nSo we start out with a concept that the anime is clearly supposed to be conveying; you know how you just step on a bug you see, and don\u2019t even give it a second thought? Well what if the bug\u2026 is now stepping on you? I\u2019ll admit this is definitely a clever setup for some good ideas, except for the fact that the anime does literally NOTHING with it. Instead of intertwining this could-be moral question and primal fear into the \u201cnarrative,\u201d (if I could even call it that) it\u2019s forgotten in favor of underwhelming mystery and government conspiracies that dilute what the series is trying to be in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, random people, if they so desire, are given the opportunity to get a surgery; one where combined with an injected medicine, (or it can be snuffed and eaten, you name it) can turn them into hybrids, where they get the abilities of a specific animal or insect. For what its worth, the anime is filled with informative narration about these hybrids that sheds some light onto the actual traits of their respective creature\u2019s capabilities, but that\u2019s where any ounce of this idea being inventive stops, because,\\n\\n\r\n1.\tWhy are they operating on and sending random, everyday people to Mars instead of combat-trained professionals; or at least certified Astronauts? There are a few sure, but most of the people onboard fall into the \u201caverage joe\u201d category.\\n\\n\r\nLike many anime, the reason as to why is alluded to, but we never fully learn because it just\u2026 ends. It\u2019s another inconclusive story, with a \u201cgo read the manga ending.\u201d \u2026yay.\\n\\n\r\nThese \u201cspecialists\u201d arrive on mars to inevitably battle the cockroaches, which have evolved into lightning fast, aggressive, upright beings reminiscent of Homo Erectus, down to the point of carrying a club. But despite being the threatening monsters they are, they\u2019re portrayal is horribly inconsistent. They\u2019re supposed to be lightning fast, but often times just stand there when they\u2019re being attacked. They even turn around to run away and aren\u2019t as fast as they\u2019re made out to be. They can break through a space vessel; but can\u2019t escape a net? I can\u2019t even give that a pass because, even though the nets in the series are designed to withstand three times the strength of a single cockroach, why can\u2019t the ships? They\u2019re goddamn space ships!\\n\\n\r\nAnd due to the amount of wandering still shots, tremendously overdone exposition, and backstory that does nothing but interrupt the \u201caction.\u201d The pace of the anime is comparable to an old dog taking a shit. What I mean is that its\\n\\n\r\nSLOW.\\n\\n\r\nThis makes the whole of 13 episodes feel twice as long, all while constantly loosing focus; jumping to character backstories sporadically, (so much so that they usually take up half or more of the episode) and just plain feels like procrastination, as there doesn\u2019t seem to be much to work with. But oh, who gives a shit, the whole reason one would want to watch this is for the insane hyper violence, right?\\n\\n\r\nExcept\u2026 the action is minimal, and honestly straight up boring. The choreography is all over the place, ranging from \u201cits alright, they\u2019re kicking stuff\u201d to \u201che\u2019s not even moving.\u201d They take a few whacks and stand around and think to themselves a little more, and for what? The pacing literally creates plot holes! Why are the cockroaches standing with them and not attacking? They seem to have some sort of order; but that\u2019s not explored either!\\n\\n\r\nThis story has way too many problems, and not enough ground to stand on. At least I can say that\u2026 it tried.\\n\r\n---Plot Score: -Terrible- \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---CHARACTERS---\\n\r\nThis will undoubtedly be the most difficult portion of the review for me, because I don\u2019t remember any of the characters. No one stood out. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its dependence on character backdrops, they\u2019re all so stagnant as human beings that you just don\u2019t care. A lot of the backstories involve something stereotypical like a childhood friend getting sick, themselves being experimented on, or\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u2026Their retina detaching. That\u2019s a thing? Holy shit, now that\u2019s scarier than any cockroach man!\\n\\n\r\nEither way, There\u2019s not really a main character either. You could argue it\u2019s the first introduced character, Hizamaru Araki, but he really only gets ignored from then on in favor of having a different character get the spotlight in every episode. But they\u2019re past is never used to further build them up as people, in fact, its never utilized at all. They get it, and then it cuts to them battling a cockroach where they will either come out unscathed and continue to be ignored, or just straight up die. Character development? Let\u2019s just give them a sob-story life! Where should we drop it? Eh, in the middle of an important battle is fine! Characterization? Who needs it, lets just kill em\u2019 off!\\n\\n\r\nOh, so its one of those anime. Characters die. They get elaboration, and die, making me question the purpose of bringing up their lives in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d like to say that the cast isn\u2019t full of duds, and that there is maybe one or two favorable characters, but there really isn\u2019t. Even if they don\u2019t die, they\u2019re screen time is hammered into the dirt because the cast is so large. \\n\\n\r\nAt least it tried\u2026\\n\r\n---Characters Score: -Terrible- \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---ANIMATION---\\n\r\nThis animation, done by\u2026\\n\\n\r\nWait, what the hell?\\n\\n\r\nWarner Bros licensed this?  Oh great, now America is taking over anime\u2026 yippee\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the animation, (which I believe to have been done by LIDENFILMS though I could be wrong) is a mixed bag of sorts. The frames usually look fantastic, with high detailing in the lakes and mountainous terrain of terra-formed Mars, as well as things like beautifully drawn irises (that dilate; done well too) and the heart-stopping, visceral scenes of endless bloodshed and high-intensity gore. (In fact, I originally thought this was a Madhouse production)\\n\\n\r\nBut like I said, the actual amount of lingering stills and breaks between the action make the series feel slow as hell, and that drops the quality of the animation because there\u2019s no effort involved. To add insult to injury; there are hordes and hordes of CG cockroaches. Identical, 3D rendered, cockroaches. Every insect, and every vehicle in this series is done with CG. I\u2019m getting so sick of it. It\u2019s common I know, but just so utterly lazy. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that it looks fine, just above average I\u2019d say. \\n\r\n---Animation Score: -Substantial-\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---SOUND---\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is rather unimpressive, (surprise surprise) but the opening \u201cAMAZING BREAK\u201d by TERRASPEX was actually pretty cool, it was an adrenaline-rush inducing metal/rock piece that I actually feel fit the overall tone the show was going for quite nicely, though the ending, \u201cLightning\u201d by the same artist, wasn\u2019t quite as memorable. \\n\\n\r\nAnd everything else is generic, beat em\u2019 up music, (with electric guitars and hard rock rhythms) nothing really stands out that much. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I\u2019ll just say that the cockroach\u2019s battle cries made me laugh so hard; I don\u2019t really know how to describe it either, they just sort of happen out of the blue sometimes and instead of making them menacing, it makes them even more hilarious that they already are.\\n\r\n---Sound Score: -Substantial- \\n\\n\r\nAFTER REPORT:\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n-\tfun animal facts?\\n\r\n-\tA few interesting concepts, like the form changing surgery\\n\r\nMIXED:\\n\r\n-\tVERY heavy gore and dismemberment\\n\r\n-\tUnconcluded. Because of this though, there\u2019s always room for improvement! Right?\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n-\tPacing is slower than a sloth; prolonging the actual experience\\n\r\n-\tRipe with unexplored plot threads and plot-holes aplenty\\n\r\n-\tAbsolutely boring, undeveloped characters that will just die within an episode or two, and when they don\u2019t their screen time is abandoned \\n\r\n-\tCompletely misplaced character backstories that take entirely too long, interrupting story flow, and literally do NOTHING in the way of development or characterization\\n\r\n-\tUnderwhelming fights, nowhere near as much action as is advertised\\n\r\n-\tVastly inconsistent portrayals of the enemies\u2019 abilities \\n\r\n-\tThe whole thing doesn\u2019t make much sense anyway, sub-plot\u2019s twists are not explored, and in the end it\u2019s just straight up boring\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: -Abhorrent-\\n\r\nTerra Formars takes itself way too seriously.\\n\\n\r\nOne has to ask themselves; what is there to be entertained by in this series? There\u2019s some violence for sure, but hyper-violence has been made much more fun in other series, (Hellsing Ultimate, for one) because this time it isn\u2019t really even prominent. I don\u2019t patronize people, if you liked this, that\u2019s totally fine. But I don\u2019t see how. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the show that\u2019s been reduced to both a racist meme and a poke at Japan\u2019s horrible censorship. In my honest opinion, it deserves no more. If you either want something to make fun of, or if you want some sleep medication, there\u2019s this that\u2019s right in front of you.\\n\\n\r\nA downright hilariously earned 2/10 for this one. Well done. \\n",

Genetically modified people with animal-based powers fight huge mutant cockroaches on Mars. Hell yeah? Over the top concepts that just don't give a damn are the best. The story is a basic one: Go up there and find a cure for some Mars disease. Badass guys and gals kicking some space insect butt. Terra Formars does not pretend to be \"deep\" and \"philosophical\" (which is the norm nowadys I guess). This would have been the greatest thing I ever saw if I was 15 years younger,and I'm still a little boy on the inside who likes a good brawl. The show won't most likely win any awards, but I can at least hope for a second season. The art and opening are good tho.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problems Terra Formars has is the slow pacing and horrible INITIAL censorship in the first 3 episodes. There are uncensored episodes now. \\n\\n\r\nTl;dr this is like power rangers, but with bugs.",

            "content": "~ Don't underestimate... ~\r\nTerra Formars had the potential to revive the Sci-Fi/Horror genre, but indefinitely fell short of this...\r\nThis is a perilous and action-packed journey into uncharted land, Inhabited by a particularly formidable alien race. An apocalyptic epidemic-like fate looms over the shoulders of humanity, and metaphorical titans are sure to fall. It is an unpredictable, and fast-paced sci-fi/horror series of epic proportions. And whilst touching on the subjects of both sentience, and betrayal, I cannot deny that it's certainly a story with substance.\r\nA slightly-cliche, though appropriate, isolated-feeling, and otherworldly Martian landscape sets the stage for this 13 episode series. Invading both the sci-fi andhorror realms with an integration of strong violence, into an alien world: It shouldn't come as a shock that its audience will need to be appreciative of unending action sequences. As for the chronological\\n\r\nprogression, this is in fact quite a fitting description. With the concept of scale being used often to emphasize severity and intensify the viewers' perception of the events here... It bodes well that the interplanetary premise: a scientifically accurate and vast wasteland, really helps to invoke curiosity. We are after all made both curious, and afraid of the unknown. This is of course decent substance to make even the most far-fetched of concepts seem real, and immersive.\\n\\n\r\n~ Story and Character development ~\\n\\n\r\nIf you were to ask me \"What's behind this show?\", then I would relay: \"a boundless \"red planet\" premise, to stage an interspecies war\". The underlying problem with this (as I will elaborate), is that it's simply too extensive and substantial for 13 episode production to make full use of. It's malnourished, and full of gaping holes particularly in the character department - that will likely throw many off course.\\n\\n\r\nBesides having a story that wouldn't ever necessarily \"run dry\" from a content-observant perspective... Everything operates on a large scale with Terra Formars: So expect to see chains of events, all of which have some impact, and make some kind of dent in the overriding plot. Debatably devoid of intricacies: this anime can't afford to expend time on small, and technically irrelevant, but highly praise-able quirks/details that can be used to further the familiar sense of immersion... giving the anime a one-of-a-kind presence. With Terra Formars on the other hand, we only got the barebones of the story... again... time is of the essence.\\n\\n\r\nIt falls into a trap that many action-based adventures have been known to in the past... The story is one-dimensional. Everything that goes on during 312 minutes of running time, does so in what I like to call: an immediate-scope. What this entails, is that everything happens on a whim. There's little in the way of \"establishment\" or goals beyond the first 2 or 3 episodes, and this makes things seem too spontaneous. Almost, \"done without thought\", which is ironic because I'm sure the manga was well thought out, and would clear all of this up. As for this anime: it becomes tiring how EVERYTHING has to be relevant to the same overriding plotline, and so not enough happens besides dealing with Terra Formars, to add that other \"dimension\".\\n\\n\r\nNow what I will give it, is unpredictability. The show has an effectively unending suspense that compliments the event-based story, and really brings out this sense of struggle that reminds you \"this is a journey fraught with dire consequences\". Violence plus unpredictability equals death, so expect the unexpected! The show itself really is a thrill ride, and if you were to watch it rather casually or on a whim: then its cinematic qualities would nevertheless shine through and keep you engaged for the most part. Now there's a really distinct sense of camaraderie and mutual respect for one-another in Terra Formars. Combined with the evident struggle of humanity against the alien race, and it becomes a pretty interesting story of survival in spite of its blatant flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe word \"interesting\" is used rather loosely nowadays, and it's regrettably not the term I would use to describe this story's cast of characters. The show blatantly tries to build upon them, with long and almost unconsented flashbacks that kill the show's pacing, and leave little room for more substantial events. As an anime, Terra Formars tries so hard to meet every objective, but doesn't admit to its identity as an action-oriented story, and instead ends up sub-par in the areas where it counts.\\n\\n\r\nIt tries to forge some sort of emotional connection between the viewers and cast, but there are simply too many actively involved personalities to make extensive character development even an option. With the elongated flashbacks that let us in on various character backgrounds, if you're not still angry that a fight was just called off to make way for a blast-from-the-past, then you can start to appreciate some of our protagonists. But not for long. There's just so much always going on, and too many time constraints to adhere to with this anime: It means that even if we're going to be \"investing\" into a character, it doesn't make up for the fact that a fair number of faces are still strangers by the last episode.\\n\\n\r\n~ Audiovisuals ~\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the score: It's simple, and a tad \"rinse and reuse\", but effective. Terra Formars treats us to a highly appropriate and intense-sounding OP and ED which pertains to the anime's \"power\" in being such a thriller. It compliments the themes well.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding animation, we've got a strange mix to contend with. For the most part we get a rather drab colour palette which is both appropriate for the barren landscaping, and the dark nature of the show. The animation is generally of a considerable quality: with fine detail shining through, and an emphasis on lighting physics which adds to that sense of realism and immersion. Whereas some of the animation is frighteningly fluid, other parts are less impressive. Overall: I won't deny that it's a feast for the eyes for the most part.\\n\\n\r\n~ Final thoughts ~\\n\\n\r\nThe vast story of Terra Formars was doomed as soon as it was given just 13 episodes to develop everything. But it did evidently put some effort into it: with a strong start that set the scene well, with unfortunately trails off into mindless combat and unexplained character relations. With the character aspect being a hindrance because too many will remain almost like strangers. Tough credit where credit is due: It is a visually pleasing and unpredictable thrill-ride, with some charm to it.\\n\\n\r\nThere's too much \"manufactured\" feeling of sentiment infused into this short series, and so as far as \"long term seriousness\" goes, it's not worth the watch. It's strength is in its immediate-scope presentation, chock full of action, and it would honestly be na\u00efve to watch Terra Formars for anything besides a cinematic \"shock-value\" thriller set of qualities.\\n\\n\r\n~ When they say there's one, there's thirty... ~",

            "content": "I will give Terra Formars credit for its setting. It is just unique enough to make you interested in its premise. The story is just there as a backdrop, an enabler for the gory action if you will. It mentions some political intrigue in passing, setting itself up for potential twists, but never bothers going deeper into it. It gives the plot some flavor, but requires a second season to deliver on it.\r\nThe sound did its job for me, the music and voice-acting in particular sticking out as good. The art however does need to be addressed. The design of the cockroaches is too campyto be scary, which is why I would have preferred had they kept them in the dark, rather than the stale CGI army we got instead. The cockroaches also kinda look like racist caricatures of black tribesmen, which I hope I'm not alone in noticing. The rest of the character-designs however gives the viewer plenty of variety to enjoy. For those who think this is nothing but graphic violence I would also argue that the action-scenes knows how to play up the sensation of characters flying at high speeds and performing great feats of strength.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Terra Formars does show that it has bite and not just bark, is in its characters. At the start, the characters are too thin to really work when they are fighting as a team, and I would go as far as call the writing incompetent during the first half. But once the latter half of the show comes in it slows down greatly, fleshing out the characters in ways that was a welcome surprise. Had the show been more focused on the characters' personal stories early on, I think this show would have been far more hit than miss.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give Terra Formars a 5 for being an enjoyable show to fans, but very uneven with just as much good as bad things in it.",

A flat out space odessy?\r\nThats not the case here, Terra Formars is an action packed Sci-fi anime with many gore elements,its an honest anime towards the viewer from the very first episode , u know what u'll see and what to expect and it does it WELL\r\nStory 5--Its not rocket science thats for sure.Enhanced humans with bug abilities are send to Mars to fight some evolved cockroaches in order toobtain some samples of them to fight a virus that threatens earth with extinction.There are no sub-stories and the flow is annoyingly fast, especially at the first 3 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7-- I quite like the art in Terra Formers, its unique the fights are pretty good and its great for gore fans like me, u'll get to see a lot of blood, different kind of fatalities and many other.Also the female figures are just great on this one!\\n\\n\r\nSound -6- Nothing special here. The sound effects are worth mentioning, quite decent\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -6- The character development is not perfect but also not non-existant as it has mentioned by some reviewers.U get to see many glimpses of Alex's past but also from many support characters such as Adolph and Sheila.So i wouldnt go so far calling the character development non-existant, its actually Ok.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -7-It is clearly a matter of taste.For what its made i think its above average,action packed gore in quite a few moments, its a slash and splash fest and its quite enjoyable if u ask me.For some others though it might be just a nonsense",

            "content": "So Terra Formars I have seen people give mix reviews from being absolute ass or being really good so where do I stand. I'd say it's meh. Keep in mind that I watched this show after reading the manga and that it is much better and to read it instead and don't tell me you don't like reading your reading this review so...  \r\nAnyway do I think the story is good, Kinda? well the story is there is there is a Virus and People need to go get a cure from the Terra Formar, which are evolved cockroaches that look like cavemen. The firstthing you'd ask yourself is why not get the Virus from the people that died on earth well the story has you covered it tells you that the Virus doesn't duplicate. then your next question is THEN WHATS THE PROBLEM? just accept the people infected as an accepted loss and put them in like a cave or something the virus wont get out, apparently the writer didn't think of that so OFF TO MARS IT IS. Also they use animals for powers which leads to interesting but rule breaking physics; this is the most interesting part of the show by far.\\n\\n\r\nSo the Art is it good, Yeah? it's good. It's stylized and has some great art with it's characters. not so much when the cockroaches are in giant groups because it uses really bad CGI and just looks really off. hey I said it was good not perfect. If it was perfect you would see better gore scenes like in the manga but what ever you can't have your cake and eat it too.\\n\\n\r\nHow about the sound is that memorable? in a way. The opening does the Attack on Titan thing where it sound bad the first few seconds then it gets going so there is that. The ending is also pretty good it gives the feeling that the show has ended again it's a rock song keeping with the theme of being badass. Outside of the parts where the cockroaches show up and gives this frightening beat the music is really forgettable I don't even know if there was music to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main problems I had watching the show was that it didn't give me the feeling that the characters where important. Until the later episodes when they where giving backstory to characters when they do something which didn't really happen in the manga... that much. I know why they did it this way but still doesn't mean I will like it. outside of that the characters are well written they make you feel for them and shows that the world in which the characters come from isn't pretty and has many real world problems. also more than likely your favorite character in this show will be because of your sexual interest and nationalism since this show is not about just Japanese people it shows how the world needs to come together and help, it will be spoilers if I continue since there is politics but it's only in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nWas the show enjoyable? Yeah it was actually if you don't think or if you just want to see gore it's not bad I liked the show. it's nothing SUPER but it's entertaining and interesting if you don't think about the physics and logic too much and just expand your imagination a bit. I believe you would enjoy the show if you: have read the manga, just want to see some gore, want to see animal superpowers, or want to see an interesting idea done pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the manga was better; if you want to get into this series read the manga. If you don't want to read then at least watch the OVA first since that is how it was in the manga, and you will like this show a bit more which will make it less likely for you to drop it and put it in your BAD LIST. Also spoilers it ends with a \"Read the Manga\" ending or \"Wait for Season 2\" ending.\\n\\n\r\nWell hoped this helped you decide in watching Terra Formars see you next time",

            "content": "Terra Formars is an action, horror sci-fi piece. The manga began in 2011, written by Sasuga Yuu and drawn by Tachibana Kenichi. In 2014 we got a two episode OVA and a full thirteen episode series, both of which were handled by Liden Films. A studio that's done nothing I've seen, although I know their names because they're also working on the Berserk sequel that's scheduled to start airing in July. I'm not sure what to expect so let's just take a look at Terra Formars, both the prequel OVA & the TV series.\r\nStory:\r\nIn the OVA, we see the ill-fated Bugs-2 mission to Mars wherea group of people with insect-based powers, which they turn on via injections, fight against a swarm of humanoid cockroaches. Why they don't just use one of the many pesticides that's proven efficacious against cockroaches instead of mucking about with their DNA, I haven't the foggiest. In either case, the longer series opens with a young man fighting in cage matches. After fighting a bear, he's approached by a familiar gent in a suit and a young woman. The two recruit him to join them in a trip to Mars, giving him a variation of the surgery that the Bugs-2 crew had. He survives the procedure and is taken to Mars on a mission to retrieve samples to concoct a vaccine for a disease that's spread to Earth from there, along with a large number of people from varied countries. They're under the command of Captain Komachi, one of the only survivors of the OVA. That's when things go badly. The cockroaches somehow get aboard their spaceship and those members of the crew who survive the attack are forced to separate into six groups, all heading in different directions. Can they survive long enough to reach one another and complete their mission?\\n\\n\r\nAs is my usual habit, let's discuss the problems with the narrative first. The biggest one is that it features a lot of situations where the solution or the problem itself, comes out of nowhere with no valid explanation. Take the opening event. How did these mutant cockroaches break into a sealed spaceship without getting noticed? You'd think they'd have to rupture the hull, creating explosive decompression, or something. The very last fight sequence also has a character use powers that they've never displayed before and that there was no indication of them having. Just when they really needed them to get out of a bad situation too, how fortuitous. No, wait, contrived. There's also a pretty significant issue with exposition. Basically, there are segments, usually during action sequences, where the narrator jumps in to talk about flora or fauna and how the powers of these various people work based on that. It not only disrupts the action sequence but roughly drags you out of any investment you may have had in the scene. The science in this is just terrible too. The worst part is that it doesn't even work within the series' own universe. To use an example, there's a character with the powers of Camponotus Saundersi aka the blast ant. The narration talks about the ant's ability to self destruct using autothysis and yet, somehow, that translates to this character being able to blow the cockroaches she hits up. These things blow themselves up by rupturing a gland they have for that express purpose how the hell does that translate to being able to blow these cockroaches, which don't even have that gland, up?\\n\\n\r\nAbout the only positives that I can give the narrative are that the premise has potential, the idea of people using abilities of insects and other flora and fauna to fight a common threat could have been really interesting, and that it tries to be more than just a mindless action series. I'll give it credit for that, it clearly is trying. It doesn't succeed, but there is an effort there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a big part of the problem. They try to make the cast compelling and sympathetic but the execution is woefully shallow. Most of the characters we learn anything about have some bland, trite back story where they have a sick loved one or they grew up poor or some such thing. None of which tells us anything about them as a person. About the closest we get to a fleshed out character is Adolf and they spend close to an entire episode showing us flashbacks of his life. We do get flashbacks of a very small number of the other characters, but none that are on that level and most are a lot more shallow than what we get with him. The biggest problem with the characters being so egregiously boring is that there's no investment in them or what happens to them. We see a lot of characters die after they've gotten roughly five minutes of screen time and two lines, if that much. Even the characters who die after we've spent a bit more time with them are largely just too bland to care about.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have our villains. I'm not going to talk about how their motivations are weak, even though the only explanation the series gives for them killing humans is that they think we're vermin. No, the problem here is a lot worse than that. These things aren't intimidating in the least and a lot of the \u201ctension\u201d in the series revolves around them being this overwhelming, terrifying force. Yet, they look ridiculous, a good fighter in the main crew can slaughter huge numbers of them with ease and they don't feel fear or pain, which is a huge evolutionary disadvantage. The child friendly version of the brood were more frightening and they got dealt with in an episode. Even the Spaceballs were more intimidating than these guys at least they had a transforming maid robot.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe goofy villain design aside, I do generally like the art in this. The characters have interesting looks, at least when you factor in their mutated forms. The backgrounds have some nice detailing. The fight scenes are very gruesome but also are impressive, when the flow isn't disrupted by the narrator giving us information, some of which is outright wrong. The series also does largely refrain from pointless fan-service scenes. About the closest they come are some scenes where some of the guys in the team will try to peep at one of the women or their eyes will wander, which, in all fairness, is a realistic situation.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe vocal performances in this are passable. They are a bit emotionless and dull but they aren't bad and they're about what you'd expect from the writing. Murai Shusei's music is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't any. We get a few stated het crushes and some characters who we're told are married but, aside from that, the relationships really aren't developed enough for them to get homo-erotic.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nSo that's Terra Formars, a mindless action series with delusions of grandeur. While I do give it credit for trying to do something more, in this situation, it might actually hurt it since the execution is shallow and the end result is that the action sequences are interrupted and weakened by narration. It isn't a bad anime, but it is weak. My final rating for the series and OVA together is going to be a 4/10. Next week it's Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata.",

            "content": "I will be evaluating this anime according to the circumstances surrounding its production. That is mostly because it was the FIRST anime to be produced by its respective studio. In other words, I will be ignoring the censoring part and carry on as an uncensored version watcher. \r\nAlso, as of credentials, I've watched all 13 episodes and read the manga as well.\r\nStory (main plot): 2/10 \r\nClearly, the beginning was rushed, but that was inevitable (far too many characters to handle in 13 episodes). The premise was extremely rough for the series and was the reason for many drops (including the censorship). The reasons behind thecrew's expedition to Mars sounded more like an excuse than anything. And so, yes, 2/10 for the main plot.  However, I am only giving this grade because of the MAIN PLOT. \\n\r\nMany sub-plots centering around the main characters made the anime extremely enjoyable (see character rating)\\n\\n\r\n Art: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt style is pretty subjective, but I appealed to me. However, if argued that the cockroaches' designs were lazy (they pretty much have the same face), then I'd just reply that if they had to give a difference face to EVERY single cockroach on Mars, then the budget would explode (think about it, in war anime, soldiers are all dressed to same way).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound is very subjective too, but I think the OSTs were great and dramatic, fitting the anime's overall theme. Great opening too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (sub-plot): 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMany main characters are very likeable. One is able to identify to many of them simply because of the screen time spent on their respective backgrounds on Earth, as well as their reasons of joining the expedition. The characters of Terra Formars were its strongest point. Now I won't go further into details because I don't want to spoil anyone.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI literally watched it for the characters (and their own unique sub-plots), not for the plot itself. Also, being a manga reader gave me much more details about the anime, so it was much more enjoyable  8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAfter a bumpy start, the anime redeemed itself around episode 6~7 and kept getting better from that point on. Along with the fact that it was the FIRST anime to be produced by its studio, I believe that I can safely give the anime a 7.\\n\\n",

The way they showed these stories of the characters, it was amaaaazing :)\r\nThe main story also isn't bad, it had something interesting in it, wasn't really special or something new, but it was still good. \r\nWhat i also loved and enjoyed was the fighting in this anime, The fighting scenes really areenjoyable and powerful, just like the scenes should be!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nJust like i said before, i like how they show the characters and their individual stories, because that way you can connect to every character individually and that's a great thing cause you start liking them all even if you didn't really liked them at the start.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAt the start i didn't really enjoyed the animations cause of the censured parts and hiding much stuff - it was actually a pain in the ***. But after episode 3 i thing, the censure stopped and the showed everything and that's where the fun started. I really like the movement of the characters, they are fluid and natural. The surroundings are also really nice made, even the colors were fitting with the story and the atmosphere of the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that i loved the Opening theme, it is a great piece of powerful music - it had something like a adrenaline boost if you ask me :)\\n\r\nFor the ending theme and the background music in the anime, it wasn't bad, but it also wasn't really good, they could have made it a bit better, or at least more memorable, i had to re-listen to it to remember what it was actually.",

For those who like a dark and gory story(like me), you will love this show. \r\nPersonally I wasn't accustomed to the art style of the show and its occasional switch to CGI. But I soon came to love the art style and wish that more anime used this dark/semi realistic art style.\r\nSpeaking of realistic this anime is brutal when it comes to killing of characters. By the first few episodes I came to realize that no character(Except 1) was safe and it showed the power of the roaches.The writersalso did some great research on the bugs which play a central role in the story. I thought this was pretty interesting and just added onto the realism of the anime which I loved. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion almost all the characters in the show were likable(There is a lot of character development/Flashbacks). \\n\\n\r\nOverall a solid show which I enjoyed a lot.",

Its not complicated or needs a background story its simple. A diseases is incurable and 100 people are sent to mars to find a cure, with their own agendas. The story uses many cliches but does still deliver a basic enjoyment, It is exactly like Attack on Titian so you wont really be looking at something new  \r\nART------- The art work is amazing in 1080p. The art looks on point, sharpened and its not sloppy. Blood looks great and its doesn't looklike Jelly or water mixed with red. The art shows what it wants to show without any misconceptions. The show is a must watch in HD 720p/1080p! The presentation is dark and bright at points in the show.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND-----the sound is basic. its not shitty 3rd grade re-used sounds. it ON POINT. Guns sound likes guns, cuts sound like cuts, and etc. THE ROACHES due sound like crap, and they say CHU CHU, which is weird and doesn't sound scary! OPENING AND ENDING music are great TRACKS to listen to, ever time it ends or opens it keeps me wanting for more\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS-----The characters in this show are not the very best, but are not cardboard cut outs. The main character is exactly from \"Attack On Titian\" He is strong and goes right to the action, but thank god he is not a pussy! Other Character who survive long enough are somewhat loveable, but if killed off you wouldn't feel much of an impact. The only character the delivered such potential was Adlof R. He was shown and was played out very carefully 10/10 on his part! He played as a badass and showed it. Everyone else thou are very generic, for example you got your strong girl, your idiot, a man with a passion, and your cowards.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT-------The enjoyment is delivered! the enjoyment is not at its very best but does deliver what you wanted. At the end of every episode you don't feel like wow that was shit, its more like \"oh i wonder what happens even thou i could watch something else\". Every death felt either like wtf?! or finally or like NOO!  But this section really depends on what type of viewer you are.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL---This anime is something to watch on your free-time it will be worth it. Its not great but decent. Please watch it but you might be disappointed...",

            "content": "This is trash. With some enjoyable elements that do not save the anime in the end.\r\nDetailed breakdown.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nThe story is centered around humans being murdered by humanoid cockroaches. On mars. And then Humanoid cockroaches being murdered by humans. There's reason for everything, but it pretty much doesn't matter.\r\nThe story in the end follows an incredibly boring pattern:\r\n1. Introduce a character\r\n2. Murder them horribly.\r\n3. Spend half of episode depicting their grieving friend murdering cockroaches. While there are flashbacks of their past.\r\n4. Murder somebody else, then repeat the scene.\r\nOn occasion it throws some trivia about insects at viewer, which is read in a cheerful announcer voice. Butin general, everything is drawn out, overly long and not very good. Basically, in teh end I felt like I saw 2 or 3 episodes worth of information. It is dull.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, it mostly goes for cheap shocks and gore moments, which are not terribly interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10:\\n\r\nSurprisingly there are some very nice and interesting design for humans and their battle form. However, those designs are wasted fighting hordes of incredibly dull and poorly designed monsters. A lot of cool character designs are promptly killed off without giving them enough screen time, which is a big waste.\\n\\n\r\nThe cockroaches often use CG, and that CG is poorly done and noticeable. Backgrounds are incredibly bland and all look the same - depicting martian landscape (which is green, due to terraforming efforts), and looks like it was taken from an old videogame. So, it is generally poorly done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10:\\n\r\nIt felt like the anime has one battle theme total in the whole series. Well, there were few more of them, but because \"cockroach battle theme is playing all the time\", they're not very memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10:\\n\r\nHighly stereotypical and bland. The anime tries to portray some character interactions between them, display feelings, etc, but in the end it doesn't look very convincing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 2/10:\\n\r\nI really liked some character designs, but using them in such way was a big waste. Well designed (visually) characters barely get any screen time before getting killed off, and the rest of the anime looks bad in every department - visuals, story, everything. Besides, who the heck managed to come up with this kind of bland and uninteresting monster for an antagonist? \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10:\\n\r\nIt is junk, but the character designs are nice. I think a good idea would be to get an artbook somewhere - if it exists, and look at character designs there. The anime itself is best skipped. There are cheap gore shock moments, but they do not make it interesting.",

Terraformars is equally average in all those aspects. The story is nothing new: the show introduces a bunch of characters at first and as each episode unfolds you learn about a particular character and their ever-so tragic backstory via flashback.The art design is so ugly and unappealing that is almost laughable. The cockroach humanoids resemble Japanese salarymen crossed with cavemen with insect wings. There are some well animated action scenes, so that helped me a bit in bumping the Art score to a 5. I have no real recollection of the sound design or music so yeah...5/10. The characters are completely 1-dimensional and run the gamut of every stereotype and arch-type you can think of. \\n\\n\r\n Yet on the Enjoyment Scale, I would give it, without hesitation, a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nTerraformars is the new great example of the anime equivalent of a 'B-Movie.' \"So bad, it's good\" as the cliche states. Everything about this show is so exploitative and melodramatic, I could not stop watching. I watched episode after episode and by the end I didn't even care if the show had forgotten its overarching story (something something Mars something something hieroglyphs)   \\n\\n\r\nThere are moments in this show that are so profoundly stupid yet at the same time gloriously epic that I would recommend this show to anyone in a heartbeat who's looking for some actual fun and enjoyment in these truly dark days. \\n",

Its terra Formars.\r\nStory 4/10:-\r\nThis is the only bad thing I found out about Terra Formars, while ur watching the anime u don't really get what is going on, sure they show hints between now and then, but that is not enough. The story is kinda over the place, but I guess the main aim of the story is not half bad so Igave it a 4.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10 :-\\n\\n\r\nThe art was just amazing, I like how they made their transformations to still look human but still transformed, showing that they still have their human side inside of them and that they have control of themselves, all the transformations were done splendidly and the environment also looked great.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 :-\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the few shows that I cant ever forget the sound in it, the songs playing while they are fighting gets u hooked up, the op was really amazing being fast paced and fits the show, the ed was really great too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10 :-\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the strongest point in this show, the characters make up for the story's mistakes, each one of the characters had a unique story to him, we get to see his/her past, what was their motivation for going on to the mission, and how it effects their fighting style and actions, surely not all the characters and given the same care, but with only 13 episodes and so many characters u can only do much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10 :-\\n\\n\r\nFor me I really enjoyed this show, and the only reason am not giving the enjoyment a 10/10 is because of the story, since I really enjoy a well-planned story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 :-\\n\\n\r\nAn amazing show that I'd suggest to people who like gore and character development, along with some badass moments that even when I remember them I still feel the same shiver I felt when I first saw it. This show totally deserves a 9/10.\\n\\n",

There was lots of death and nothing really was resolved.  \r\nArt 7:  I thought the art was good, nothing amazing.  There were a couple great moments, but everything was pretty basic.  The fight sense were pretty good [lots and lots of blood]\r\nSound 6: The tracks were the same, throughout the whole anime. The intro was amazing though, I really liked that.  Voices were good nothing special there  \r\nCharacters 4: As far as these go.. people just died off withoutany of us even knowing what their names were.  Why does this matter? well simple only a few were selected to go to mars and they died off so fast.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9:  As much as all these cons are there.. I really did like the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6.2: I really did want to love the show, but it just didn't go anywhere.  There are so many cons to this show which makes me sad.  The Idea was great just the way they went about it was not.

The story didn't really get anywhere, simply just about teams from different countries joining to fight these mutated roaches from mars or something. I didn't see much character development, characters were pretty much on a suicide mission to really obtain nothing but to beat the crap out of some roaches for messing with Earth. Sound was over-exaggerated but whatever that was the least of my concerns. Art was decent as should be, nothing special. I thought the show was a bit odd at first,but decided to try it out since my friends kept telling me to give it a try. However, just trying to finish the series was dreadful so no I didn't really enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nThose who give this anime above an 8 surely have some processing to do because this is beyond FAR from being at least \"Decent\". Go do yourself a favor and skip this anime because I found this a waste of time.",

It definitely gave me some serious imperialism vibes, and the roaches themselves (particularly their overall character design, their movement, and how they cock their guns sideways) just seemed like a weird caricature of a racial stereotype. Maybe I'mwrong, but it definitely made watching this show weird having this context to go off of.",

I love dark and morbid storylines which this anime does have, but i don't really like gore for the sake of gore; which this anime also has. I'm also just generally not a fan of bulky, muscle bound artwork which did color my opinion on this anime.\r\nWith that said I have a rule that I always watch the first 3-5 episodes of an anime before deciding to give up on it since some thingsjust develop slowly, and as you can see i got through episode three and gave up. What little storyline there is in this series just seems so far fetched I couldn't believe in the actual threat they were trying to make me worry about. The fact that the \"cockroaches\" some how evolved to look exactly like mr. universe type body building apes makes no sense and from a visual prospective i just didn't believe in them as a threat or enjoy seeing them as the \"bad guy\". The rest of the the story has very little developed plot (which i've been told this anime takes place like in the middle of the manga so maybe that's why) and it seems to mostly rely on gore and shock value to keep you interested. So as I am not a fan of gore for the sake of gore without a real plot to keep me interested i couldn't make it past episode 3.",

            "content": "My views are limited to the 13 episode anime and part of the manga. This will be a short review, briefly touching base on each element of the story.\r\nStory (5)\r\nAt first, I was intrigued by the concept of the anime and had high expectations. It's not an everyday thing to see a survival show about giant mutant roaches. However, at the midway point, the story hasn't progress at all. Only killing and fighting scenes were shown. When I finished this anime, I didn't sense any progression of the story at all. The entire anime only depicted the story span over a few days with severalflashbacks accompanied with character death.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7)\\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn't feel attached to any of the characters. There was no main characters, and they weren't developed at all. Plus, a lot of them died quickly.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5)\\n\r\nUnlike most otakus out there who bias Japan over other countries, I don't. I am very well aware of global politics, so the political element of this anime annoyed me, a lot.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say this anime is racist, but it certainly portrays a very biased political view. I hate it. I want to point out that I don't find the resemblance between black roaches and African Americans to be racist, I never made that connection when I watched the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt is never a good idea to bring politics into anime. I will point out all the political elements in this story and some rather disturbing things. \\n\\n\r\n- One of the main German character is named Adolf, after the dictator of Nazi Germany. (I don't think that's a coincidence). Surprisingly, he is portrayed in a very positive light.\\n\\n\r\n- The reason Adolf was portrayed to positively may be because of Japan's political standard back in WW2. Japan was one of the axis power that supported Nazi Germany.\\n\\n\r\n- One scene in the anime showed the bodies of all Chinese crew members. (Assuming they were Chinese because of a metal plate that said Liu and China on there). I take this as a sign of the superiority of Japanese over Chinese people. This scene also reminded me very much of the NanKing massacre and how Japan invaded China and Korea. \\n\\n\r\n- The Russians were made to be very stereotypical. Strong, big, and somewhat blood thirsty. In one scene, I remember clearly, of the Russian commander telling the roaches to fear Russia. \\n\\n\r\n- In the manga, the Chinese characters were portrayed to be evil, ruthless, and very twisted. In was shown later that China had betrayed all other nations. This negative depiction of China may be resulted from the non stop conflicts between Japan and China. \\n\\n\r\n- From what I said above, I believe it's safe to assume that this anime isn't solely about the roaches. This anime has many political elements and portrays other countries in a biased manner. It gives off the anti-Chinese government vibe, and glorifies Germans, especially Adolf... \\n\\n\\n\r\nOver all (6)\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think this anime is a bit nationalist, but not racist nor sexist. Regardless, I still very much enjoyed the concept of this anime, and the cool anime facts narrated in an epic voice.",

I'm just sharing it to other people who might have the desire to watch the show but have only seen critiques reviewing mainly the flaws.\r\nTo start off the show was a bit iffy at first. There was a all of a sudden rush into the story and gave no character development at the beginning giving a bad impression at first. But what allured me to continue watching this show was that it was refreshing. UNIQUE! A new look at a genre and story that hasn't been touchedon a lot.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\r\nThe story has a lot of potential because it is so unique. An experiment that threatens the human race, that happens to be bugs. Bugs stepping on humans instead of humans stepping on bugs. Take that story and compare it to the average bad ass main character plot, or story that never kills off any characters. In those stories it's so predictable who dies  (if there are any deaths), and who wins in the fights. Basically, this is a show that's unique in it's own way, added with characters surrounded by death flags.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nFor those who say that the characters are not memorable, i'd have to disagree. Again personal opinion. I believe that the characters were well structured, and remembered for something they did, mainly in a fight. Of course they did cut-off many characters, the ones who were important stayed and made a good impression.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was average at best. more closer to a 6, I rated the art a 7 because it went well  with the atmosphere and theme of the show. A very dark outlined art for a dark show. Though the CGI could've been better, that art in the fighting scenes were solid, and that is why I gave art a 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nNothing too special, but the music fir the theme and was played at the proper times, in the prope scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nIt was enjoyable, I did get a thrill from the action scenes, and it was suspenseful seeing who would die, and how they would die.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nIf you enjoy bloody action scenes watch uncensored. In conclusion though, if you enjoy sick action scenes with great potential for the characters and stories, I believe that you might like the show.",

Those, working with the animation, sounds, and cinematography, result in quality fantasy action fights that I wish other anime had. \r\nI really like the sound effects, although they are used a bit too much, and the accompanying narration for every fight. Not to mention that the fights are (like I mentioned) similar to Monster BugWars, or some show on Animal Planet. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to the story, but the fights are well executed, with good sequencing, concept and explanation of supernatural powers, and production quality. \\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much to the anime other than the fight scenes, production quality, and Animal Planet-like narration.

And why does Akari have mysterious abilities that make him well-suited to fight these mutants? \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend you to watch the OVA which explains exactly what is happening in this anime, if you go straight to the series you might be a little lost on the aim of the characters and not fully understand some of the characters relation to the enemy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really really REALLY like this anime.\\n\r\nMinus all the gore that is seen in it, the plot is amazing!\\n\r\nAs you keep on watching, you keep questioning what is happening and why it's happening. \\n\r\nYou end up wanting more and more.\\n\r\nTo avoid any spoilers, I would recommend you just watch the OVA first and see if you're interested in the series.\\n\r\nThere is currently a second season for this anime and the artwork is superb!\\n\\n\r\nRecommend for people who enjoy gore or for people interested in realistic story lines (so a story line similar to Akame Ga Kill)",

            "content": "Note: I'd like to begin by saying that I have no experience with the manga and I've only watched the uncensored version. \r\nFirst, the bad. This show is far from perfect. At times the pacing is breakneck and at others it slows to a crawl. Most of the cast is completely expendable and as a result one might have a hard time growing to care about a character before they're ripped in half by a giant and extremely muscular cockroach. The monster design is silly and had a tendency to make break out in laughter during the early episodes. Even the things that many othershere praise, i.e. the gore and violence, tended to carry very little weight.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite its many faults, Terra Formars is tense. The major part of the story takes place over the course of one horrific night, where the crew of BUGS 2 find themselves completely outmatched in a strange and foreign land. It's not a story about a team of underdogs overcoming the challenges before them, it's a brutal and desperate tale of of survival. And though the show is littered with meaningless character death, the few impactful deaths pack a punch and manage to keep you on your toes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, though the show has many shortcomings, its strengths are enough to carry it through its run. It's a decent show that's sure to entertain fans of horror and sci-fi alike.",

            "content": "Disclaimer:\r\nMinor spoilers possible,I'm lying there's nothin' to spoil.\r\nTransformers is a show about giant robots who turn into cars fighting each other.\r\nSounds awesome doesn't it? Well it is,excluding the movies. Unfortunately we'll be reviewing Terra Formars instead, an awkwardly named anime about bug men,and women we don't discriminate who gets their spine ripped off, fighting space roaches from Mars.\r\nStory.\r\nPremise is pretty much the extent of this story. If we include the annoying flashbacks that added little to nothing, except in this one German characters case. No need to really keep on this subject here's a two because why not.\r\nArt.\r\nAh now we are getting to the goodbits. Well not good in the ,, I creamed my pants,,  manner but in a ,,thank god it's this type of bland animation,,. Animation used here is the one I can tolerate even tho it's overused and murky. Of course it's not taking any prizes on beauty contests and if it were a human I'd need a bag to fuck it but here's a 6. If you are wondering why then my explanation is design of bug powers with a smidgen of good use. The blows feel like they matter,when toe-to-toe fights are in motion and not massacres that are common in here. Oh yeah there's a lot of gore like a lot...Yeah there's lots of gore. I know I'm stretching this one out but it's my obligation to tell you that first few eps contain some hard core gore and later ones aren't shy from non-human but still pretty gory gore. I might be going mad for giving it this high of a score or I've just been watching all the wrong anime, granted I did watch D. Gray-man: Hallow so that could've caused some breakdown.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThis is a mixed bag. Sometimes sound effects are damn good and emphasize the scene, as they bloody should, and soundtrack is a bit cheesy but effective. HOWEVER the other side is that punches sometimes sound like they are mining for coal with their hands trough the enemies guts. Opening was pretty hype and I'd take nothing less when this animes only up side is fighting. Here's a 5 now shut up Eva.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nNope. \\n\r\nOkay there are characters there's also a distinction between them. First eps try to set up some characteristics for it's trio but nah it's a failure. There's some feely touchy at parts tho because of rather unappealing characters it falls flat. There's a German guy named Adolf I adored, there's also one in the anime. He is posted as a tragic character basically having every possible bad thing happen to him. He was just a wee bit engaging that I could say that episode with him fighting was bloody awesome but we'll talk bout it later. There's an annoying bitch and another one and another one and... Well you get a point there's tonna annoying bitches , both male and female we don't discriminate on who deserves to die for their crime of existing. In the end character are a meh but Adolf Hi...Reinhardt boosted the score from 3 to a 4.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n,,ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?'' I hear you say and yes I am. I'm giving this a 7 because of, again, that Adolf guy and his thrilling episodes. Also fighting was pretty enjoyable. The fights are occasionally murky and annoyingly interrupted by flashbacks that,as I said, are pretty unnecessary. I liked the entomology lessons from the show and enjoyed them unironically.\\n\r\nSo yeah let's get to the end of this mediocre mess.\\n\\n\r\nNow i want to swiftly wrap this up with few lines cause my lasagna are gettin' cold.\\n\r\nThis anime is one of those ,,enjoy the bloodshed,, ones however it even screws that up on occasions meaning it cannot be fully enjoyed with your brain turned off. I personally do like it but it's not something you should watch with high expectations. Actually dig a hole and place your expectations there then you can enjoy this for a murder fest that it is. This anime I cannot give anything but a 4. In truth the average is more of a 4.8. I will not give it a 5 despite it being closer to it because it does not deserve it. Watch this if you've nothin' better to watch or don't watch it at all, you won't miss much.",
