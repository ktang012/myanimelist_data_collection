            "content": "Some shows are better left without a sequel. \r\nMeet \"Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren\", Kyoto Animation's latest offering, the esteemed studio that once brought titles such as Haruhi, Clannad: After Story and Full Metal Panic: TSR to the anime industry. The KyoAni of 2014 is no such studio. Instead, we find rubbish like Free and Kyoukai no Kanata on an almost seasonal basis. The KyoAni of before is done and gone. They can't even seem to do sequels right any more. \r\nIt remains a mystery how KyoAni managed to mess the Chuunibyou franchise this badly. Granted, the first season wasn't anything particularly special, butit was at least an enjoyable watch. The 'chuunibyou' syndrome made for a unique premise and, hey, the girls were cute. It had some failings of its own towards the end, but the endearing nature of Yuuta's and Rikka's relationship at least felt meaningful. Ren-- however-- has no purpose or meaning beyond providing lazy fanservice. It is as Ghostbusters II is to the original. Even if Ren never existed, there would be nobody to complain except the series' most die-hard fans. It accomplishes nothing and provides nothing that the first season didn't already. It is remarkable only in how unremarkable it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance between Yuuta and Rikka is at best cute, at worst, puerile. KyoAni has made it painfully clear that they have no intentions of creating a believable or realistic relationship. Six months into the relationship and they had not even held hands yet... really. Really. They blush and run away when they so much as see each other, and hearing the word 'kiss' might as well land them in their hospital's intensive care unit. They have the mental maturity of a five-year-old, and it makes me wonder, why? It's not as though it's difficult to portray a healthy relationship between two teenagers. Anything sexual is clearly beyond them, but at this point in the relationship you would at least expect them to be holding hands and kissing. Nope. The only explanation that comes to mind is that KyoAni is afraid of upsetting the otaku, because-- oh no-- how dare you defile their waifu by showing them in a happy relationship. \\n\\n\r\nDuring the light-hearted episodes, things are generally okay. There's plenty of the same chemistry between the characters and it's always neat to see how Rikka and Dekomori will rationalise completely ordinary things as something fantastical. The episodes that focus on Dekomori and Nibutani are actually some of the series' strongest and, thankfully, they receive a lot more focus than they did in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, the comedy is definitely weaker than the first season. Some of the jokes fall completely flat and then there are episodes that involve such things as Kumin's 'napping contest' (I kid you not), which are absolutely asinine. Hell, Kumin in general has to be one of the worst characters in recent years. She has absolutely no depth, no personality or defining trait beyond 'sleeps a lot'. The show would be so much better if she wasn't stealing precious screen-time away from the characters that actually matter. Sorry, Ishiki. \\n\\n\r\nThe largest problem with Ren is that it lacks any sort of pacing or cohesion. There's an introduction, a climax-- but where is the middle? It changes from silly chuunibyou nonsense to sappy melodrama without warning. How is anyone supposed to care about the drama when no time is given to first prepare it? It's like the story started in media res, a few random chapters taken out of a larger novel. A new girl shows up, she falls in love with Yuuta, causes some trouble, and then, bam, it ends on the same footing as the first season. No resolution; nothing added to the characters. \\n\\n\r\nAnd why is Shichimiya here in the first place, anyway? Her contrived introduction (conveniently moving to the same apartment complex as Yuuta, who she conveniently happens to be childhood friends with) is already enough to get the eyes rolling. She joins the crew in the chuunibyou nonsense, which is fine, but then she is immediately given the spotlight in order to cause melodrama where there never needed to be any. I suppose when you lack the imagination to create drama between two developed characters, you can haphazardly throw in a new character with the same exact drama as previous. It's essentially just a copypaste of Rikka's growing feelings for Yuuta at the end of the first season. Heck, KyoAni is so lacking in ideas that they even threw in the 'Yuuta reading a note from his past self' again. I guess the only positive thing that can be said in Shichimiya's defense is that she is cute... at least when she's not splitting your ears with her \"Nihahahaha\" catchphrase. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not mature enough to support the drama. It's difficult to care much about Yuuta's and Rikka's relationship when they go about it as a toddler would. The season desperately, desperately needed more Nibutani (and Yuuta without the influence of Rikka) as they are the only two in the show who feel even remotely like human beings. Even if KyoAni decided to go full-force with the drama, there's a good chance it could have worked with Nibutani. Instead she is relegated  to the background during the important scenes, a sort of cheerleader, a pal who pushes the two forward because they are too childish to take that step themselves. \\n\\n\r\nAt least there is little to complain about when it comes to the visuals. It's the usual quality you would expect of KyoAni, with plenty of motion blur and pretty scenery for you to gawk at. I did count a number of scenes where the art quality dipped into the abysmal, though, like when the camera zooms in on a swimming Shichimiya, lazily drawn as two coloured blobs stuck together. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also great. Most of the background tracks are so quiet that you wouldn't ordinary notice them, but they do a solid job in enhancing the mood of each scene. The sappy piano pieces make the otherwise cringeworthy melodrama a bit more tolerable, but I don't think even the most beautiful piano pieces would be able to save those scenes. On the other hand, the opening sequence is catchy but noticeably less interesting than the first season. Many people complained about all the fast cuts in the first season's opening, but hey, it was unique. It gave the show that extra bit of charm. The opening and ending sequences here don't really achieve that. They just exist. \\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou Ren should have been better. I wanted to like it; I wanted to see the adorable relationship between Yuuta and Rikka explored further. But all I ever experienced was mild amusement in between the mountains of irrelevant nonsense. Ren does nothing but undermine the ending of the first season. It ruins the relationship almost entirely and provides nothing that needed to be shown. It is a painful example of one of the problems with the anime industry, for studios repeatedly produce sequels 'for the fans' rather than because of any artistic interest. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are desperately, desperately craving for more Chuunibyou, you might have a better time with it than me. If you are sceptical about how the heartwarming ending of the first season could ever be expanded upon-- avoid, avoid, avoid. It's far more likely to damage your image of the series rather than improve it.  \\n\\n\r\nMaybe some day KyoAni will return to what made them interesting. Somehow it seems unlikely.",

            "content": "I think most of the anime watching community has learned to generally expect two things from KyoAni:\r\n1. There will be moe\r\n2. The story and plot will either be subpar or shit. \r\nI want to say that it's nice Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! got a second season, I really do. The first season of Chuunibyou was decent; it had a little bit of eight-grade syndrome, a little bit of romance, obligatory KyoAni moe, and a bit of slice of life. Characters actually felt like they made progress and it was a fairly enjoyable watch overall. I can't say the same about the second season. \r\nI'dlike to discuss the story, but I'm afraid there is really nothing to talk about. There is no story. There is no plot. Asking for either of these from this sequel is like asking a rock to win a race, and no, this isn't Spongebob. I made a mistake by hoping there would be some kind of turn around and something interesting might happen during the second season, like the ending of the first season. The so called 'romance' between Yuuta and Rikka, which was the whole driving force behind this sequel, is severely lacking. Yuuta seems more like Rikka's father than boyfriend and that's just pathetic. The attempt at a love triangle is not only badly paced, but also feels extremely forced. Basically, if you watched this sequel, or plan to, you most likely didn't come for the story. At least, I sure hope not. \\n\\n\r\nAssuming you've seen the first season of Chuunibyou, you have a general handle of what the characters are like. There's not much change other than the introduction of Shichimiya, Yuuta's old chuuni buddy. The character development is stagnant and most of the series is about Rikka getting romantically flustered. But hey, remember that one character Ishikki? Yuuta's friend, the bro-tier dude of season one? Yes, the guy who gets his head shaved. Guess what? The series takes a massive diarrhea dump on him. The sequel throws him in at random times and tries to garner some cheap laughs at the expense of his already unfortunate life. I couldn't even laugh at instances aimed to be funny gag moments. If I felt anything, it was sadness and pity. \\n\\n\r\nThe only saving grace that Chuunibyou Ren! has is that I find KyoAni's animations to be good. The art and animation are consistent and I believe that's one thing that the studio does right. Sound is decent, but I didn't find the OP or ED to be anything noteworthy. \\n\\n\r\nSequels for anime can be a blessing when done correctly. Sequels can also tarnish whatever good the first season had accomplished. The latter is what happened here. There's nothing more frustrating to watch the second season of an anime only to be disappointed by the steep drop in quality. This sequel felt like KyoAni put little to no effort into it besides giving the audience the finger while trying to reach into your wallet. Unless you have time to waste, and I mean a lot of fucking time, I'd say watch something other than this.",

            "content": "Now if you haven't seen the first season of this anime, then I suggest you should before watching this season. \r\nI liked the first season of Chuunibyou, it was a fun little story that introduced (well to me at least) the \"chuunibyou\" syndrome. Y\u016bta Togashi is a boy who, during junior high school, had 'adolescent delusions' (\u4e2d\u4e8c\u75c5 ch\u016bniby\u014d?, lit. \"junior high school second grade illness\"), believing that he possesses supernatural powers and dubbing himself the 'Dark Flame Master,' therefore alienating himself from his classmates. Finding his past embarrassing, Y\u016bta attempts to start off high school where he does not know anyone, free from his olddelusions. This proves to be difficult, however, as a delusional girl in his class, Rikka Takanashi, learns of Y\u016bta's past and becomes interested in him.\\n\\n\r\nNow the first was good, it was funny and the fact that Rikka was also referencing the \"dark world\" and her \"superpowers\" was funny because it could get her into to trouble and embarrass Yuta in public. This \"connection\" they had started an amusing romance. The story was enjoyable, jokes laughable, and characters loveable, as the first season was reaching it's climax you felt some support towards Rikka and Yuta's relationship and hoped they would be together forever.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the same could be said for the second season which started January this year. The story continued, showing the gradual progression of the relationship between Yuta and Rikka. However, it strikes me as shocking to how boring the storyline has become in it's new season. \\n\r\nThe story is pretty much the same, showing very little progression in the main story and introducing a new character, Yuta's childhood friend, Satone Shichimiya . And I'm sorry to say but she does not do a whole lot for the beginning of the story aside from make Rikka jealous due to her closeness with Yuta and even that does not have much of an impact on the story. \\n\r\nThe artwork is good due to that fight scenes that are thrown in from time to time and I send Kudos to the producers for the effort put into them. However, I would like to see Yuta do a bit more with him being the \"Dark Flame Master\" and all. The first season showed him to be a \"legendary warrior\" and I would like the fight scene to show a bit more of him standing out rather than leaving it all up to Rikka.\\n\r\nThe sound is ok, music isn't great but it isn't bad. The opening isn't as good as the first one IMO but its not bad.\\n\r\nCharacter is a problem here. In terms of development, I feel there is very little with all the original characters as well as the new character introduced this season. Yuta does not do a whole lot except from constantly trying to improve his relationship with Rikka and it annoys me that he does not take obvious chances to: hold hands, hug or heck even kiss her! For example, the episode escapes me, but the time when him and Rikka were sitting after their date and about sunset, it would have been the perfect opportunity to kiss the girl! ARGH, make a move man! Rikka isn't all good either. Yeah sure it was fun and new to see her constantly refer to her \"dark world\" and take everyday life as if it wasn't that important compared to her Wicked Eye. It became annoying that she constantly refers to that and I thought it was abolished or at least watered down. Yes I know it is called Chuunibyou, but I would like to see more of a romance going on rather than a boring story with a poor relationship.\\n\r\nI feel it could be a better story if it had more of a romantic approach rather than a story of a girl who cant control herself and a guy who cant develop his own relationship.\\n\r\nOverall, I had hoped for more from the producers due to the first season being great and enjoyable. I would have liked to watch the season through but the story is preventing me from doing so however if it changes, then I may approach this series again.",

            "content": "I had very high hopes for Chuunibyou demo Koi Shitai! Ren. I have been a fan of the first season ever since I watched it, but I cannot say that with the second season.\r\nWith a slice of life, character development is important. Very. Important. And the first season, I believe, did a very good job at that. Behind the whimsical nature of the first season, there was a serious theme of growing up and what is lost when someone does. This was emulated through Rikka. Sadly, the second season doesn't touch this at all.\r\nInstead, the second season has the audience follow the relationship of Yutaand Rikka. It is a full on romantic comedy, but it also fails at being a well-made one. The romance is tiring to watch and the comedy is pitiful. Isshiki becomes the center of horrible jokes and becomes nothing more than a town fool. \"Hahaha! He's darker than he should be! Lol! A dude likes him!\" The comedy revolving around Isshiki is lackluster and, at times, can be offending. The only saving grace from this hell is the romance of the anime. If I had to compare it to the hell of watching the comedy, I'd compare it to purgatory.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance is meant to be cute. The audience sees the couple in various situations that would never happen and watches as the couple takes their relationship an extremely small step forward every episode. Emphasis on the extreme. Yes, it's supposed to be cute seeing both of them blush at the thought of doing anything that involves their significant other, but it becomes a drag to witness. Even more enervating to watch is the half-ass attempt at creating a love triangle.\\n\\n\r\nShichimiya is the new character introduced this season, and she is also the old chuunibyou buddy of Yuta. And she is a horrible character. \"I love Yuta, but Rikka loves him now. I'm sad. Now, I'm happy for Rikka and Yuta.\" That is the extent of her existence.\\n\\n\r\nThe main thing I find saddening in this last season is the chuunibyou. In the first season, it was the thing that was viewed as childish, something people grow out of. Eventually, the audience finds out that people can grow up and keep a part of them childish. Hence, Rikka's \"grown-up\" love for Yuta while she still keeps her chuunibyou. For this last season, there is now reason for the chuunibyou. It is just there. The main use for it in Ren is to provide comedy. Thankfully, the outrageous behavior of Rikka's, Shichimya's, and Dekomori's chuunibyou is still as funny as the first season.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the anime keeps it's well done art and animation. It is pleasing to the eyes and softens the blow one gets from the other aspects of Ren. I found the OP fine and thought the ED was really good, but this is a rating of the show and not how much money a studio can pour into their OP's and ED's.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was extremely disappointed. I went into Ren expecting more of the first season. With this tragedy, I hope that there will never be another sequel. My love for Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! has been stained.",

            "content": "There is no sequel to Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai!\r\nIt does not exist\u2026.\r\nOr at least that\u2019s how it should have been. Unfortunately, KyoAni decided to make Chuunibyo Demo Koi Ga Shitai! Ren, a sequel for an anime that's one of the best of its genre. \r\nWhen a sequel is created for any concluded story, it is akin to flipping a coin; It can either improve and provide a wonderful expansion to the story, or ruin the story and fall flat on its face. Sadly, the latter happened to Chuunibyou Koi Ga Shitai! Ren. The most concise reason as to why that is, is simply becauseit was completely unnecessary. The story of Chuunibyou was already done. Finished. Concluded. But then KyoAni had a great idea that maybe they shouldn\u2019t end it there. And the finished result? A supposedly romantic rivalry between Rikka and Shichimiya, Yuuta\u2019s old friend. \\n\\n\r\nWell I have to admit, the thought of a love rivalry is a pretty good concept, and it could\u2019ve honestly worked. However, the fault here lies in the fact that none of that actually happened. Instead, we were given a subpar plot which revolved around Rikka and the gang just finding the newest ways to mess around, without actually having anything to add to the plot. In fact, over half of the show was just about the cast doing their weird chuuni things and making comedy, which surprisingly isn\u2019t as funny as it was in the first season. There was no direction to the plot, and so instead it went all over the place, ranging from beach episodes to napping contests, which basically made everything feel like filler.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the rest of the season? Well, it was spent doing an incredibly rushed and contrived love triangle between Rikka and a new character named Shichimiya, and believe me, it wasn\u2019t good at all in the slightest. That\u2019s because it just\u2026 happened. Yes, there was some foreshadowing, which in this case was brought about by Yuuta\u2019s complete insensitivity to romance. However, when the romance part did happen, it was like: Development, Climax, and Resolution, all in 4 episodes. In other words, the pacing was utter garbage. So as I said, the romance just kinda happened.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, another downfall of this anime is in the character development, or the lack thereof. From the start of the anime to the very end, there was very little changes in the cast, if any at all. In fact, the only noticeable change in the characters is the fact that they are now a lot more chuunibyou-ish, and all of them have started to participate in those chuunibyou battles. Other than that, there isn\u2019t much to be said. And the new character Shichimiya? Well her sole purpose in this anime is to provide a rival for Rikka to compete against and to add another chuunibyou character. But as with the rest of the cast, she is just a dull character, and even moreso than the rest of the them due to not being in the prior season.\\n\\n\r\nSo pretty much the only good thing I can say about Chuu-2 Ren is that its animation was amazing. KyoAni may not be the best when it comes to storytelling or plot writing, but they sure are the best when it comes to animating stuff, as it has been proven time and time again. The animation for Chuu-2 Ren was smooth, clean, and very modern. There were no flaws or stutters as far as I can tell, and the fight scenes were just jaw-dropping. But then again, this is KyoAni we\u2019re talking about, the same people who can animate water and make it look gorgeous beyond words.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, there\u2019s also the music. The opening of Chuu-2 Ren, VOICE by ZAQ and its ending, Van!shment th!s World by Black Raison d'\u00eatre are both very energetic J-pop songs. They are very much fitting with the theme of the anime, and are both quite catchy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, did I enjoy Chuunibyou Koi Ga Shitai! Ren? No, not at all. It\u2019s an anime that lives off the popularity of its prequel. A horrible continuation of what could\u2019ve been a good ending. That\u2019s why I cannot give this anime a score higher than I did. It\u2019s not as funny and doesn\u2019t have the same romance its prequel had, nor does it provide a good continuation for Chuunibyou, and is overall a bad anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, does Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai! have a sequel?\\n\r\nUnfortunately it does, however I deny its existence. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n~First and foremost, thanks for reading my review. If you have any comments regarding my review or just want to have a discussion, then leave a comment at my page. I will greatly appreciate it. =)~\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm writing this review to defend the series. I'll give reason why you should watch it too. ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS.\r\nNOTES:\r\n1. Don't compare Light Novels with the anime.\r\n2. Don't lose interest with the negative feedback to this sequel.\r\n3. I made everything short and outlined so finish reading this.\r\nSTORY: This is worth watching. I'll explain the benefits under.\r\nART: The art is still superb as ever. You can feel they spent lots of money on this.\r\nSOUND: Still worth remembering as always.\r\nCHARACTER: This is what I like this season, they did not focus only to Yuuta and Rikka, they gave good screen time to other characters too.\r\nBENEFITS:\r\n1. Progress ofrelationship of Yuuta and Rikka. \\n\r\n2. More episodes to other characters like Nibutani, Dekomori, and most especially KUMIN.\\n\r\n3. Introduction of a brand new character and some minor characters.\\n\r\n4. Past of main characters. Especially Yuuta's, Nibutani's, and the new character.\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment. AND each episode feels both satisfying and craving for more, just like when I watched \"Haganai\". The comedy scenes are again funny.\\n\\n\r\nPOSSIBLE CAUSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT:\\n\r\n1. Too much rooting for Yuuta and Rikka's relationship development. I'm reminding you, there is a PROGRESS here but others just want more.\\n\r\n2. This sequel kind of have less comedy scenes than the prequel.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nSome anime episode feels to quick to watch, don't you agree? But with series like Chuunibyou, each episode is packed with entertainment. Never ever compare anime to Light Novels, this is anime and that is Light Novel. Even though they said they missed out a lot in the LN, I can say that the anime arranged the plot sequence properly.",

But it comes out many disappointments, and lack of resources.\r\nVery confusing, the story leads to a direction that is not clear. And if the story had misdirection, then the characters contained in this film becomes dead, within the meaning of the word. The characters seemed to be only made \u200bto fill the vacancy in this story.\r\nNext, a new character in this story. Actually, this character is a character that is not necessary for this story, this triggers another character (besidesRikka and Yuuta) also becoming not necessary. Becomes unimportant and just fill the vacancy of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnother sadness in this story is the deepening of the characters conducted by the author. Very typical and irrelevant In my opinion. I don't sense any excitement anymore when I\u200b watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "To start off, I have to say that I completely disagree with most of the reviews that I've read. \r\nYes, I think that the first season ended in a way that it could have ended there, and we'd all go along happy... BUT this season actually had a very real portrayal of young love (to a certain extent). \r\nIf you look past the \"Chuunibyou\" syndrome, and at what each character is actually feeling, I at least, felt a deep pang of nostalgia throughout the whole thing. \r\nIs it the best anime in the world? No. Could the show have done without the sequel season? Yes.Should it have? I don't think so. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed seeing where they went from the first season's final episode. If it had ended with the first season we'd think that Rikka got over her \"Chuunibyou\" just because Yuuta told her he accepts her.. but it's more than that. I think that the anime really came across well in the under-written aspect of relationships, and their sometimes awkward moments of expectation vs. bravery. Not necessarily in moving forward, but in doing what you think your partner wants vs. what they actually want vs. what you want.. and all that comes with this type of lovers' miscommunication and confusion. Whether in Yuuta's somewhat controlling nature, and Rikka being confused about how she feels about it. Or either of them trying to fit a mold that the other person didn't even initially ask for. OR Schimiya trying to overcome her own feelings for the good of the group, and sometimes failing to do so. \\n\\n\r\nI think that if anyone has had any of those types of experience, they'll enjoy this show and feel like the second season wasn't, as all the other reviews seem to say, a waste of time.",

            "content": "Do you want a good sequel for Chuunibyou demo koi ga shitai ? This isn't your anime.\r\nYou wanted a good adaptation of the second novel of chuuni? This isn't your anime.\r\nFirst season of Chuunibyou demo koi ga shitai was one of the best anime I watched last year. It had romance, comedy, drama, nice animation, music, in a good distribution. Although it wasn't an exact adaptation of the light novel (what anime is, after all) I was really satisfied with it, so when I heard about a second season, I was somehow looking forward to it.\r\nWhat was I expecting from the second season? Well, firstseason ended nicely, so there was no need for more YuutaxRikka develop for sure. Maybe it was going to be another character development, a new adventure, or an adaptation of the second novel.The second light novel it's about Yuuta's childhood frient, Satone Schimiya, coming back in town, being a yandere bitch and giving some trouble to Takanashi. It never becomes a love triangle, as Yuuta deals with it in a perfect way. It wasn't the best plot, but really interesting for sure. There they had an interesting drama setup for their second season.\\n\\n\r\nI was damn wrong. Instead of it, season 2 brings no real plot whatsoever, and very little character development.\\n\r\nWe have a regression in the main couple, as there was no closure but a lot of awkwardness between Togashi and Takanashi,although 6 months had passed since season 1. It's implied this is the setup for Satone's intervention, as Nibutani even makes a foreshadow impliying Schimiya to be trouble between Yuuta and Rikka. Instead, she just brings little trouble, dissapears from some episodes, comes back, realizes she loves Yuuta, then realizes she can't have him, goes back to normal like nothing happened and becomes Rikka best friend from nowhere. She even says \"bye bye\" to Yuuta in episode 11, implying she's going to dissapaear, as she tries to do in the novel, but comes back in the last episode as nothing has happened.\\n\r\nThe rest of the season are just filler episodes, full of fanservice and moe girls, becoming some sort of harem. Makoto Ishiki is practically removed from the series, becoming a full comic relief character and having barely some screen time. Yuuta does not care for him at all. Irrelevant characters like Kumin got more screen, and even episodes focused on them. We have more girls introduced, with not relevance in the plot.\\n\r\nThe comedy is fine, but becomes kind of annoying in some episodes. All the cast becomes really idiot and regress their progress after every episode, and the fanservice gets on your nerves.\\n\r\nI'm not against fanservices, nor comedy. It was comedy what got me into chuuni season 1. But it was also the drama and the develop what kept me watching it.\\n\r\nThis wasn't what happened in season 2. Every episode become more boring than the previous, and any expectation I had from Schimiya was in vain.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and music are great, but don't make this anime worth watching.",

I agree it doesn't even compare to the beauty shown in the 1st season but come on people its still chuu2byo. \r\nYep the story line is definitely weaker as compared to the 1st season as some episodes as mentioned in many other reviews seem like filler, one example being Kumin's sleeping contest thing. The humor is not as great as the 1st season but it is still good. Highlighting the major parts here, Dekomori and Nibutani got morescreen time here and the fights, arguments and, friendly love between them was fun to watch. This season does justice to them showing how close they actually are. Also the romance between Yuuta and Rikka is supposed to be pure and cute. The story is made in a way that people feel that relationships can exist without kisses or sex. \\n\\n\r\nI believe it is not good to stereotype a series as bad just by looking at things like Rikka and Yuuta haven't even kissed yet? But they have been in a relationship for 6 months. Is it really so necessary for them to kiss just because they have been in a relationship for 6 months. Rikka running away whenever they have romance or are given attention in public just makes the series serve its purpose. When we talk about Chuu2byo we don't talk about a typical shoujo anime or shounen ai but we talk about cuteness which is depicted perfectly in the series.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the comedy aspect of the series. I don't know about other people but there is a smile on my face throughout the episode. Rikka and dekomori turning every ordinary aspect of life into fantasy is just awesome and the fights between dekomori and nibutani does make you laugh. The regular gag about not recognizing the guy who is in love with Kumin never fails to make me evoke a smile or a laugh. The reactions of Sichimiya(love rival for Rikka, a childhood friend of Yuuta) are priceless when she is being inquired about her love for Yuuta.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I believe making ren get such reviews is because the 1st series was much better than this one. Lets not compare and enjoy this series. It is not that bad as people tend to make it.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the reviews I have mentioned above please don't think that this review was meant to offend you. This was just my take of the series. \\n\\n\r\nGuyz please leave a message about what do you think about the series. I would be happy to know about your opinions.\\n\\n\r\nThank you",

            "content": "*Stumbles from all the negative press* Ouch, where all the hate coming from?  Oh, sorry, breaking the 4th wall of reviewing here...  Here we have Season 2 of Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!:  Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren.  The relationship of Yuuta and Rikka starts this series off... but not with a bang.  The second season, between the comedy and silliness that signified the first season, chronicles Yuuta and Rikka struggling with their relationship with all their friends and family providing support.  All who watched season 1 will remember how Yuuta decided to work with Rikka and herChuunibyou syndrome rather than snap her out of it or move on to possibly greener pastures.  Well, now our buddy has to live with his decision to stay with a girl with the mentality of a elementary schooler, and the drama surrounding it creates an entertaining, satisfactory series.\\n\\n\r\nStory:  8/10\\n\r\nI could be a little biased, considering I love the drama of romance more than the drama leading to a romance (Maybe because the latter isn't done often enough in anime), but I enjoyed this season's story more than the first.  The alternate-reality fights are better, and I think they're more of them this season than the first.  Yuuta's patience with Rikka while their friends babystep them further into their relationship is as cute as a box of kittens.  One major point I will give the anime is, unlike most where the male/female interaction makes no sense by the guy being Mr. Perfect (I'm looking at you Kirito when your girlfriend's body is ready, and you Tenchi, and you Mr. Perfectly Useless from Shuffle!), there's actually a reason WHY Yuuta has been taking things slow with Rikka, and the rest of cast (the normal ones anyone) don't see their progression as normal.  Those reasons make the show less LCD screen punch-worthy than others with Mr. Perfects.  And Rikka and Yuuta's relationship does develop by the end of the series.  It may not be at full flair by the end, but it develops at the speed appropriate for them.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I said I liked Season 2 better than 1, major sins exist that prevent it from becoming a 9.  For example, as the little synopsis above says, and as I'm sure anyone with a brain can deduce, Sophia becomes the third wheel in our central romance's already mountainous journey.  The writer's choice to make her another Chuunibyou weakens her impact dramatically; she should have been a regular high school student trying for Yuuta.  Luckily, Yuuta and Shikka have enough problems themselves to keep the plot in the pot boiling.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nAnd still no complaints ^_^!  I enjoyed the openings and closing animations better this time around, and with more alternate-reality battles, the animation stays strong.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:  7/10\\n\r\n*Sigh* nothing new to report.  The music throughout was there, but didn't  particularly appeal to me.  Nothing different than what you'd find in most romance anime.  The voice acting keep it at a strong 7.  Yuuta and Nibutani's transitions into their Chuunibyou selves had me rewinding the scenes with giddy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  8/10\\n\r\nPut some steel in that cement, because the characterization is stronger this time around.  Nibutani and Kumin get some spotlight, the former's thrilling while the latter's hilarious.  No words needed for the two \"lovers.\" The trials in their relationship are the epicenter.  Unfortunately, Makoto and Dekomori were dusted aside like annoying pets, while the newbie Sophia just didn't fit her role well enough (Think Melia from Xenoblade Chronicles). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Conclusion:\\n\r\nNot all anime relationships are created equal.  Some have accidents that put people in comas, some a girl with a terminal condition, some with a girl that loses her memory every day, and others with a love interest trying to balance reality with fantasy.  Chuniybou Ren builds on the fresh romance it offered in the prequel by showing an odd couple coping with their folie a deux that, from the outside looking in, seems like an extraordinary effort.  Watching these two finally share their madness and try to create a healthy relationship birthed an enjoyable journey, earning it a deserved place in my romance collection.  \\n\\n\r\nUltimate Final Technique V2:  Final Judgment Slashing Score Deus Ex Plus!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  8/10",

It was definitely a fun experience and I was very eager to get myself started with season 2. While sing praise towards season 1, I can't say the same for season 2.\r\nPlot wise, Just like season 1, the plot wasn't deep nor complex. But season 1's plot definitely had more depth and it didn't feel forced. Westill had some feels, which I like for the most part. Some of the comedy bits were still funny although several jokes lost its appeal due to continued recycling. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance progression was probably the biggest pull for me in season 1. I was expecting it but not how they went with it. Definitely a pleasant surprise, this is why I couldn't wait to get season 2 started, to know which direction they were going with it. \\n\\n\r\nI'm honestly upset with what they did with the romance this season. Well they didn't do much, I wouldn't argue if somebody said they didn't do anything at all with this part of the story. I wanted progression, I got very little of it. The romance that bloomed at the end of the 1st season stagnated until season 2 ended. \\n\\n\r\nSummary: I enjoyed it, but this season is undoubtedly inferior to the previous season.

But one thing I will definitely say, it keeps and maintains the weapons grade adorableness the first one had. \r\nI have only seen the subbed version, but honestly I thought the dubbed version of the first season as better than the subbed, so my rating may change once I see the dubbed version. \r\nI didn't think the first series had some kind of incredible story, it was just very enjoyable, and incredibly heartwarming just to watch the characters interact. That was really the thing that made it great. \r\nAnd the secondseries doesn't disappoint me at all, while Yuta and Rika's relationship didn't go that far, Deko and Mori varied from hilarious to surprisingly touching. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yes I did love Satoni, and I really got off on the NEE hahaha! I loved that character. I hope the dubbed voice keeps that laugh too. It made the character really stick out and sound like a magical girl crazy pirate. Yeah she was a cutie too. I really liked it. \\n\\n\r\nStory was lighter than the first, but had its moments. \\n\\n\r\nNo this series really didn't need a sequel... but I just loved the characters... and had to see them again. \\n\\n\r\nThis one didn't disappoint me at all. Yeah would have been great to see Rika and Yuta take the next step, but the interactions between everyone just made it all worth it.",

            "content": "Any fans of Chuunibyou's first season would likely agree that they were looking forward to another season, However this season fell flat on it face and was awful. A poor story, no character development and a matter a fact they suffered regression.\r\nThe main point of this season was to progress the relationship of Rikka and Yuuta. In the process the supporting cast which once added to the show's entertainment value(whether it was comedy or the plot) completely felt pointless and were annoying at times. Through series the literally inch closer, holding hands, hugging, a little kiss on the forehead. Any time they had a opportunitywhere the moods was right they wind up not doing anything. Case and point the finale episode was a waste that left me with a weak and unsatisfying resolution. Even the side characters complained about it! The main conflict aside from not being able to look in each others direction every other episode was with Yuuta's childhood friend Satone. She was barely enough to qualify for the main cast if you ask me. She showed up had little to no impact and things moved on. She wanted Yuuta's D, realized it was wrong, cried about and that was that, Now her and Rikka are best friends. I found myself dreading each new episode. While some were okay it wasn't enough to save the show in general. They have a large amount of \"battles\" in this season and it almost feels overused to a extent. The comedy was on pair sometimes and other times it made me want to do anything else beside watch this show. The art and animation was fantastic and the score was okay. Nothing stood out and the opening was okay.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn summery Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren is something you should not watch. It doesn't matter how much you loved season 1 it will not live up to exception. The story and characters just are not there. It felt like fanserive, they just decided \"Hey, lets make another season.What, a plot idea... characters ... please we don't need to worry about those things it is for the fans. cough*and to make a quick buck.*\"\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score - 6/10",

            "content": "A great example of a show that just didn't need a sequel season.\r\nThe first season of Chuunibyou wasn't particularly amazing in my opinion, but at least it had a premise, some conflict, an overall purpose which it delivered on, some entertaining scenes and it mostly tied itself up without leaving many loose ends.\r\nSo why did it need a sequel season? It mostly just ends up as a \"continuation of the characters from the first season\", and the entire thing just felt way too safe. The characters from last season pretty much had all of their character conflict resolved, so now they had to find anew direction to go with the series, which they rather lacked . This leads to just a series of episodes with more of the same kinds of episodes and occasional humor of the first season, only this time most of the initial charge has worn off. \\n\\n\r\nAny semblance of a conflict gets resolved very quickly and the series lacks any memorable episodes or any of what made the first season good. What ends up happening is an annoyingly slow progressing romance between two characters who already had that part of their character resolved last season, and it ends up just feeling like it was forced to be a part of the story, as ti can just be almost uncomfortable to watch. They try to add a \"love triangle\" type plot, but they don't do very much with it, and I can understand why. If they did make anything too serious and dramatic out of it, it would probably just end up feeling jarring and out of place because of the generally lighthearted tone of the show. Shichimiya isn't integrated well into the story, since she's an obvious \"third wheel\" to the group of characters, and she's an annoying character on top of that. \\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou Season 2 isn't bad, persay, it's just unnecessary. It added nothing to the original story, as everyone is pretty much where they left off without much development. The initial charm and occasionally cringe-worthy humor has since worn off, leaving the series feeling stale, recycled and highly predictable without anything new added nor anything that made the first season entertaining.",

If you dislike any of the characters in the first season, this review might help you.\r\nI already thought the characters were pretty weak, coming into the second season. What you should expect in the second season is for the characters to remain nearly the same. Or rather, you will see a series of episodes that each trick you into thinking that there will be character progression, that then revert back to the exact same dynamic. It is unbelievably frustrating to watch.\r\nThere is one moment in particular, which I can't talk about because spoilers, that happens in the second halfof the series. It got me excited. Finally, some desperately needed character self-reflection that doesn't come off as immature and nearly disfunctional (Sorry guys, not a Rikka fan). But the creators of this show had the audacity to think they can write this conflict off with no reason at all. It completely destroyed the idea of any plot. I would love to hear why they thought that was a good idea.\\n\\n\r\nI'm usually pretty forgiving of anime with little plot. But when it gets as little as \"none,\" it really becomes slice of nothing rather than slice of life. Enjoy your nothing pie everyone; it goes without saying that it could use some flavoring.",

Watching characters you liked so much degrade themselves is something nobody should experience.\r\nThis is direct continuation of Chuunibyou 1st season. Yuuta and Rikka now live together, because apparently even Tooka knows that nothing will happen in this series. Also, Yuuta's old friend with syndrome of her own moves upstairs, resulting in a very poorly executed triangle. \r\nThe high points of this season are definitely scenes with Nibutani and Dekomori. Those two are at theirbest and I'd really love to see more of them instead of, for example, an entire episode about napping (I kid you not).\\n\r\nDrama was handled much worse than in first season, pink haired girl really just felt out of place in all of this. But the worst thing about Ren is that almost nothing happened between Yuuta and Rikka. Nothing. Except now they can hold their hands without passing out from embarrassment. But if you wanted to see at least a kiss in final episodes, don't get you hopes up. They apparently have emotional maturity of 5 year olds.\\n\r\nBoth opening and ending were much behind those from 1st season, but they weren't too bad. Artstyle was really nice, even for KyoAni. Nothing to complain about here.\\n\r\nIn summary, this was a very dissapointing show. As much as it made me laugh sometimes, it came nowhere near the beautiful experience that was first Chuunibyou and I really felt cheated on at the end. Let's hope KyoAni will give this story a proper ending (like it had before Ren happened) with a movie or third season.",

Sure the story and romance in the worlds most slowly progressing relationship does not reach amazing new heights but that does not mean that the anime is not highly enjoyable. For starters one of the perks of Ren is that it continues with the same feel and humorous style as the first series, if youenjoyed the first one then it's pretty probable you'll enjoy this.\\n\\n\r\nThis series also adds to the romance and emotion by introducing us to a new character, Shichimiya (AKA the pink haired girl from the picture). I really liked this girl! Being a fan of the first series I would've probably liked this second one anyway but Shichimiya was a seriously huge part of what made Ren so enjoyable and emotional. I'm not going to mention any spoilers but we also get some more insight into the past of some of the main cast too which is always fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I highly recommend watching Ren, maybe you won't enjoy it as much as the first series or maybe you'll enjoy it more.

            "content": "Some shows are better left without a sequel. \r\nMeet \"Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren\", Kyoto Animation's latest offering, the esteemed studio that once brought titles such as Haruhi, Clannad: After Story and Full Metal Panic: TSR to the anime industry. The KyoAni of 2014 is no such studio. Instead, we find rubbish like Free and Kyoukai no Kanata on an almost seasonal basis. The KyoAni of before is done and gone. They can't even seem to do sequels right any more. \r\nIt remains a mystery how KyoAni managed to mess the Chuunibyou franchise this badly. Granted, the first season wasn't anything particularly special, butit was at least an enjoyable watch. The 'chuunibyou' syndrome made for a unique premise and, hey, the girls were cute. It had some failings of its own towards the end, but the endearing nature of Yuuta's and Rikka's relationship at least felt meaningful. Ren-- however-- has no purpose or meaning beyond providing lazy fanservice. It is as Ghostbusters II is to the original. Even if Ren never existed, there would be nobody to complain except the series' most die-hard fans. It accomplishes nothing and provides nothing that the first season didn't already. It is remarkable only in how unremarkable it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance between Yuuta and Rikka is at best cute, at worst, puerile. KyoAni has made it painfully clear that they have no intentions of creating a believable or realistic relationship. Six months into the relationship and they had not even held hands yet... really. Really. They blush and run away when they so much as see each other, and hearing the word 'kiss' might as well land them in their hospital's intensive care unit. They have the mental maturity of a five-year-old, and it makes me wonder, why? It's not as though it's difficult to portray a healthy relationship between two teenagers. Anything sexual is clearly beyond them, but at this point in the relationship you would at least expect them to be holding hands and kissing. Nope. The only explanation that comes to mind is that KyoAni is afraid of upsetting the otaku, because-- oh no-- how dare you defile their waifu by showing them in a happy relationship. \\n\\n\r\nDuring the light-hearted episodes, things are generally okay. There's plenty of the same chemistry between the characters and it's always neat to see how Rikka and Dekomori will rationalise completely ordinary things as something fantastical. The episodes that focus on Dekomori and Nibutani are actually some of the series' strongest and, thankfully, they receive a lot more focus than they did in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, the comedy is definitely weaker than the first season. Some of the jokes fall completely flat and then there are episodes that involve such things as Kumin's 'napping contest' (I kid you not), which are absolutely asinine. Hell, Kumin in general has to be one of the worst characters in recent years. She has absolutely no depth, no personality or defining trait beyond 'sleeps a lot'. The show would be so much better if she wasn't stealing precious screen-time away from the characters that actually matter. Sorry, Ishiki. \\n\\n\r\nThe largest problem with Ren is that it lacks any sort of pacing or cohesion. There's an introduction, a climax-- but where is the middle? It changes from silly chuunibyou nonsense to sappy melodrama without warning. How is anyone supposed to care about the drama when no time is given to first prepare it? It's like the story started in media res, a few random chapters taken out of a larger novel. A new girl shows up, she falls in love with Yuuta, causes some trouble, and then, bam, it ends on the same footing as the first season. No resolution; nothing added to the characters. \\n\\n\r\nAnd why is Shichimiya here in the first place, anyway? Her contrived introduction (conveniently moving to the same apartment complex as Yuuta, who she conveniently happens to be childhood friends with) is already enough to get the eyes rolling. She joins the crew in the chuunibyou nonsense, which is fine, but then she is immediately given the spotlight in order to cause melodrama where there never needed to be any. I suppose when you lack the imagination to create drama between two developed characters, you can haphazardly throw in a new character with the same exact drama as previous. It's essentially just a copypaste of Rikka's growing feelings for Yuuta at the end of the first season. Heck, KyoAni is so lacking in ideas that they even threw in the 'Yuuta reading a note from his past self' again. I guess the only positive thing that can be said in Shichimiya's defense is that she is cute... at least when she's not splitting your ears with her \"Nihahahaha\" catchphrase. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not mature enough to support the drama. It's difficult to care much about Yuuta's and Rikka's relationship when they go about it as a toddler would. The season desperately, desperately needed more Nibutani (and Yuuta without the influence of Rikka) as they are the only two in the show who feel even remotely like human beings. Even if KyoAni decided to go full-force with the drama, there's a good chance it could have worked with Nibutani. Instead she is relegated  to the background during the important scenes, a sort of cheerleader, a pal who pushes the two forward because they are too childish to take that step themselves. \\n\\n\r\nAt least there is little to complain about when it comes to the visuals. It's the usual quality you would expect of KyoAni, with plenty of motion blur and pretty scenery for you to gawk at. I did count a number of scenes where the art quality dipped into the abysmal, though, like when the camera zooms in on a swimming Shichimiya, lazily drawn as two coloured blobs stuck together. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also great. Most of the background tracks are so quiet that you wouldn't ordinary notice them, but they do a solid job in enhancing the mood of each scene. The sappy piano pieces make the otherwise cringeworthy melodrama a bit more tolerable, but I don't think even the most beautiful piano pieces would be able to save those scenes. On the other hand, the opening sequence is catchy but noticeably less interesting than the first season. Many people complained about all the fast cuts in the first season's opening, but hey, it was unique. It gave the show that extra bit of charm. The opening and ending sequences here don't really achieve that. They just exist. \\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou Ren should have been better. I wanted to like it; I wanted to see the adorable relationship between Yuuta and Rikka explored further. But all I ever experienced was mild amusement in between the mountains of irrelevant nonsense. Ren does nothing but undermine the ending of the first season. It ruins the relationship almost entirely and provides nothing that needed to be shown. It is a painful example of one of the problems with the anime industry, for studios repeatedly produce sequels 'for the fans' rather than because of any artistic interest. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are desperately, desperately craving for more Chuunibyou, you might have a better time with it than me. If you are sceptical about how the heartwarming ending of the first season could ever be expanded upon-- avoid, avoid, avoid. It's far more likely to damage your image of the series rather than improve it.  \\n\\n\r\nMaybe some day KyoAni will return to what made them interesting. Somehow it seems unlikely.",

            "content": "I think most of the anime watching community has learned to generally expect two things from KyoAni:\r\n1. There will be moe\r\n2. The story and plot will either be subpar or shit. \r\nI want to say that it's nice Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! got a second season, I really do. The first season of Chuunibyou was decent; it had a little bit of eight-grade syndrome, a little bit of romance, obligatory KyoAni moe, and a bit of slice of life. Characters actually felt like they made progress and it was a fairly enjoyable watch overall. I can't say the same about the second season. \r\nI'dlike to discuss the story, but I'm afraid there is really nothing to talk about. There is no story. There is no plot. Asking for either of these from this sequel is like asking a rock to win a race, and no, this isn't Spongebob. I made a mistake by hoping there would be some kind of turn around and something interesting might happen during the second season, like the ending of the first season. The so called 'romance' between Yuuta and Rikka, which was the whole driving force behind this sequel, is severely lacking. Yuuta seems more like Rikka's father than boyfriend and that's just pathetic. The attempt at a love triangle is not only badly paced, but also feels extremely forced. Basically, if you watched this sequel, or plan to, you most likely didn't come for the story. At least, I sure hope not. \\n\\n\r\nAssuming you've seen the first season of Chuunibyou, you have a general handle of what the characters are like. There's not much change other than the introduction of Shichimiya, Yuuta's old chuuni buddy. The character development is stagnant and most of the series is about Rikka getting romantically flustered. But hey, remember that one character Ishikki? Yuuta's friend, the bro-tier dude of season one? Yes, the guy who gets his head shaved. Guess what? The series takes a massive diarrhea dump on him. The sequel throws him in at random times and tries to garner some cheap laughs at the expense of his already unfortunate life. I couldn't even laugh at instances aimed to be funny gag moments. If I felt anything, it was sadness and pity. \\n\\n\r\nThe only saving grace that Chuunibyou Ren! has is that I find KyoAni's animations to be good. The art and animation are consistent and I believe that's one thing that the studio does right. Sound is decent, but I didn't find the OP or ED to be anything noteworthy. \\n\\n\r\nSequels for anime can be a blessing when done correctly. Sequels can also tarnish whatever good the first season had accomplished. The latter is what happened here. There's nothing more frustrating to watch the second season of an anime only to be disappointed by the steep drop in quality. This sequel felt like KyoAni put little to no effort into it besides giving the audience the finger while trying to reach into your wallet. Unless you have time to waste, and I mean a lot of fucking time, I'd say watch something other than this.",

            "content": "Now if you haven't seen the first season of this anime, then I suggest you should before watching this season. \r\nI liked the first season of Chuunibyou, it was a fun little story that introduced (well to me at least) the \"chuunibyou\" syndrome. Y\u016bta Togashi is a boy who, during junior high school, had 'adolescent delusions' (\u4e2d\u4e8c\u75c5 ch\u016bniby\u014d?, lit. \"junior high school second grade illness\"), believing that he possesses supernatural powers and dubbing himself the 'Dark Flame Master,' therefore alienating himself from his classmates. Finding his past embarrassing, Y\u016bta attempts to start off high school where he does not know anyone, free from his olddelusions. This proves to be difficult, however, as a delusional girl in his class, Rikka Takanashi, learns of Y\u016bta's past and becomes interested in him.\\n\\n\r\nNow the first was good, it was funny and the fact that Rikka was also referencing the \"dark world\" and her \"superpowers\" was funny because it could get her into to trouble and embarrass Yuta in public. This \"connection\" they had started an amusing romance. The story was enjoyable, jokes laughable, and characters loveable, as the first season was reaching it's climax you felt some support towards Rikka and Yuta's relationship and hoped they would be together forever.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the same could be said for the second season which started January this year. The story continued, showing the gradual progression of the relationship between Yuta and Rikka. However, it strikes me as shocking to how boring the storyline has become in it's new season. \\n\r\nThe story is pretty much the same, showing very little progression in the main story and introducing a new character, Yuta's childhood friend, Satone Shichimiya . And I'm sorry to say but she does not do a whole lot for the beginning of the story aside from make Rikka jealous due to her closeness with Yuta and even that does not have much of an impact on the story. \\n\r\nThe artwork is good due to that fight scenes that are thrown in from time to time and I send Kudos to the producers for the effort put into them. However, I would like to see Yuta do a bit more with him being the \"Dark Flame Master\" and all. The first season showed him to be a \"legendary warrior\" and I would like the fight scene to show a bit more of him standing out rather than leaving it all up to Rikka.\\n\r\nThe sound is ok, music isn't great but it isn't bad. The opening isn't as good as the first one IMO but its not bad.\\n\r\nCharacter is a problem here. In terms of development, I feel there is very little with all the original characters as well as the new character introduced this season. Yuta does not do a whole lot except from constantly trying to improve his relationship with Rikka and it annoys me that he does not take obvious chances to: hold hands, hug or heck even kiss her! For example, the episode escapes me, but the time when him and Rikka were sitting after their date and about sunset, it would have been the perfect opportunity to kiss the girl! ARGH, make a move man! Rikka isn't all good either. Yeah sure it was fun and new to see her constantly refer to her \"dark world\" and take everyday life as if it wasn't that important compared to her Wicked Eye. It became annoying that she constantly refers to that and I thought it was abolished or at least watered down. Yes I know it is called Chuunibyou, but I would like to see more of a romance going on rather than a boring story with a poor relationship.\\n\r\nI feel it could be a better story if it had more of a romantic approach rather than a story of a girl who cant control herself and a guy who cant develop his own relationship.\\n\r\nOverall, I had hoped for more from the producers due to the first season being great and enjoyable. I would have liked to watch the season through but the story is preventing me from doing so however if it changes, then I may approach this series again.",

            "content": "I had very high hopes for Chuunibyou demo Koi Shitai! Ren. I have been a fan of the first season ever since I watched it, but I cannot say that with the second season.\r\nWith a slice of life, character development is important. Very. Important. And the first season, I believe, did a very good job at that. Behind the whimsical nature of the first season, there was a serious theme of growing up and what is lost when someone does. This was emulated through Rikka. Sadly, the second season doesn't touch this at all.\r\nInstead, the second season has the audience follow the relationship of Yutaand Rikka. It is a full on romantic comedy, but it also fails at being a well-made one. The romance is tiring to watch and the comedy is pitiful. Isshiki becomes the center of horrible jokes and becomes nothing more than a town fool. \"Hahaha! He's darker than he should be! Lol! A dude likes him!\" The comedy revolving around Isshiki is lackluster and, at times, can be offending. The only saving grace from this hell is the romance of the anime. If I had to compare it to the hell of watching the comedy, I'd compare it to purgatory.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance is meant to be cute. The audience sees the couple in various situations that would never happen and watches as the couple takes their relationship an extremely small step forward every episode. Emphasis on the extreme. Yes, it's supposed to be cute seeing both of them blush at the thought of doing anything that involves their significant other, but it becomes a drag to witness. Even more enervating to watch is the half-ass attempt at creating a love triangle.\\n\\n\r\nShichimiya is the new character introduced this season, and she is also the old chuunibyou buddy of Yuta. And she is a horrible character. \"I love Yuta, but Rikka loves him now. I'm sad. Now, I'm happy for Rikka and Yuta.\" That is the extent of her existence.\\n\\n\r\nThe main thing I find saddening in this last season is the chuunibyou. In the first season, it was the thing that was viewed as childish, something people grow out of. Eventually, the audience finds out that people can grow up and keep a part of them childish. Hence, Rikka's \"grown-up\" love for Yuta while she still keeps her chuunibyou. For this last season, there is now reason for the chuunibyou. It is just there. The main use for it in Ren is to provide comedy. Thankfully, the outrageous behavior of Rikka's, Shichimya's, and Dekomori's chuunibyou is still as funny as the first season.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the anime keeps it's well done art and animation. It is pleasing to the eyes and softens the blow one gets from the other aspects of Ren. I found the OP fine and thought the ED was really good, but this is a rating of the show and not how much money a studio can pour into their OP's and ED's.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was extremely disappointed. I went into Ren expecting more of the first season. With this tragedy, I hope that there will never be another sequel. My love for Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! has been stained.",

            "content": "There is no sequel to Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai!\r\nIt does not exist\u2026.\r\nOr at least that\u2019s how it should have been. Unfortunately, KyoAni decided to make Chuunibyo Demo Koi Ga Shitai! Ren, a sequel for an anime that's one of the best of its genre. \r\nWhen a sequel is created for any concluded story, it is akin to flipping a coin; It can either improve and provide a wonderful expansion to the story, or ruin the story and fall flat on its face. Sadly, the latter happened to Chuunibyou Koi Ga Shitai! Ren. The most concise reason as to why that is, is simply becauseit was completely unnecessary. The story of Chuunibyou was already done. Finished. Concluded. But then KyoAni had a great idea that maybe they shouldn\u2019t end it there. And the finished result? A supposedly romantic rivalry between Rikka and Shichimiya, Yuuta\u2019s old friend. \\n\\n\r\nWell I have to admit, the thought of a love rivalry is a pretty good concept, and it could\u2019ve honestly worked. However, the fault here lies in the fact that none of that actually happened. Instead, we were given a subpar plot which revolved around Rikka and the gang just finding the newest ways to mess around, without actually having anything to add to the plot. In fact, over half of the show was just about the cast doing their weird chuuni things and making comedy, which surprisingly isn\u2019t as funny as it was in the first season. There was no direction to the plot, and so instead it went all over the place, ranging from beach episodes to napping contests, which basically made everything feel like filler.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the rest of the season? Well, it was spent doing an incredibly rushed and contrived love triangle between Rikka and a new character named Shichimiya, and believe me, it wasn\u2019t good at all in the slightest. That\u2019s because it just\u2026 happened. Yes, there was some foreshadowing, which in this case was brought about by Yuuta\u2019s complete insensitivity to romance. However, when the romance part did happen, it was like: Development, Climax, and Resolution, all in 4 episodes. In other words, the pacing was utter garbage. So as I said, the romance just kinda happened.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, another downfall of this anime is in the character development, or the lack thereof. From the start of the anime to the very end, there was very little changes in the cast, if any at all. In fact, the only noticeable change in the characters is the fact that they are now a lot more chuunibyou-ish, and all of them have started to participate in those chuunibyou battles. Other than that, there isn\u2019t much to be said. And the new character Shichimiya? Well her sole purpose in this anime is to provide a rival for Rikka to compete against and to add another chuunibyou character. But as with the rest of the cast, she is just a dull character, and even moreso than the rest of the them due to not being in the prior season.\\n\\n\r\nSo pretty much the only good thing I can say about Chuu-2 Ren is that its animation was amazing. KyoAni may not be the best when it comes to storytelling or plot writing, but they sure are the best when it comes to animating stuff, as it has been proven time and time again. The animation for Chuu-2 Ren was smooth, clean, and very modern. There were no flaws or stutters as far as I can tell, and the fight scenes were just jaw-dropping. But then again, this is KyoAni we\u2019re talking about, the same people who can animate water and make it look gorgeous beyond words.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, there\u2019s also the music. The opening of Chuu-2 Ren, VOICE by ZAQ and its ending, Van!shment th!s World by Black Raison d'\u00eatre are both very energetic J-pop songs. They are very much fitting with the theme of the anime, and are both quite catchy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, did I enjoy Chuunibyou Koi Ga Shitai! Ren? No, not at all. It\u2019s an anime that lives off the popularity of its prequel. A horrible continuation of what could\u2019ve been a good ending. That\u2019s why I cannot give this anime a score higher than I did. It\u2019s not as funny and doesn\u2019t have the same romance its prequel had, nor does it provide a good continuation for Chuunibyou, and is overall a bad anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, does Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai! have a sequel?\\n\r\nUnfortunately it does, however I deny its existence. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n~First and foremost, thanks for reading my review. If you have any comments regarding my review or just want to have a discussion, then leave a comment at my page. I will greatly appreciate it. =)~\\n\\n",

Don't compare Light Novels with the anime.\r\n2. Don't lose interest with the negative feedback to this sequel.\r\n3. I made everything short and outlined so finish reading this.\r\nSTORY: This is worth watching. I'll explain the benefits under.\r\nART: The art is still superb as ever. You can feel they spent lots of money on this.\r\nSOUND: Still worth remembering as always.\r\nCHARACTER: This is what I like this season, they did not focus only to Yuuta and Rikka, they gave good screen time to other characters too.\r\nBENEFITS:\r\n1. Progress ofrelationship of Yuuta and Rikka. \\n\r\n2. More episodes to other characters like Nibutani, Dekomori, and most especially KUMIN.\\n\r\n3. Introduction of a brand new character and some minor characters.\\n\r\n4. Past of main characters. Especially Yuuta's, Nibutani's, and the new character.\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment. AND each episode feels both satisfying and craving for more, just like when I watched \"Haganai\". The comedy scenes are again funny.\\n\\n\r\nPOSSIBLE CAUSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT:\\n\r\n1. Too much rooting for Yuuta and Rikka's relationship development. I'm reminding you, there is a PROGRESS here but others just want more.\\n\r\n2. This sequel kind of have less comedy scenes than the prequel.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nSome anime episode feels to quick to watch, don't you agree? But with series like Chuunibyou, each episode is packed with entertainment. Never ever compare anime to Light Novels, this is anime and that is Light Novel. Even though they said they missed out a lot in the LN, I can say that the anime arranged the plot sequence properly.",

            "content": "To start off, I have to say that I completely disagree with most of the reviews that I've read. \r\nYes, I think that the first season ended in a way that it could have ended there, and we'd all go along happy... BUT this season actually had a very real portrayal of young love (to a certain extent). \r\nIf you look past the \"Chuunibyou\" syndrome, and at what each character is actually feeling, I at least, felt a deep pang of nostalgia throughout the whole thing. \r\nIs it the best anime in the world? No. Could the show have done without the sequel season? Yes.Should it have? I don't think so. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed seeing where they went from the first season's final episode. If it had ended with the first season we'd think that Rikka got over her \"Chuunibyou\" just because Yuuta told her he accepts her.. but it's more than that. I think that the anime really came across well in the under-written aspect of relationships, and their sometimes awkward moments of expectation vs. bravery. Not necessarily in moving forward, but in doing what you think your partner wants vs. what they actually want vs. what you want.. and all that comes with this type of lovers' miscommunication and confusion. Whether in Yuuta's somewhat controlling nature, and Rikka being confused about how she feels about it. Or either of them trying to fit a mold that the other person didn't even initially ask for. OR Schimiya trying to overcome her own feelings for the good of the group, and sometimes failing to do so. \\n\\n\r\nI think that if anyone has had any of those types of experience, they'll enjoy this show and feel like the second season wasn't, as all the other reviews seem to say, a waste of time.",

            "content": "Do you want a good sequel for Chuunibyou demo koi ga shitai ? This isn't your anime.\r\nYou wanted a good adaptation of the second novel of chuuni? This isn't your anime.\r\nFirst season of Chuunibyou demo koi ga shitai was one of the best anime I watched last year. It had romance, comedy, drama, nice animation, music, in a good distribution. Although it wasn't an exact adaptation of the light novel (what anime is, after all) I was really satisfied with it, so when I heard about a second season, I was somehow looking forward to it.\r\nWhat was I expecting from the second season? Well, firstseason ended nicely, so there was no need for more YuutaxRikka develop for sure. Maybe it was going to be another character development, a new adventure, or an adaptation of the second novel.The second light novel it's about Yuuta's childhood frient, Satone Schimiya, coming back in town, being a yandere bitch and giving some trouble to Takanashi. It never becomes a love triangle, as Yuuta deals with it in a perfect way. It wasn't the best plot, but really interesting for sure. There they had an interesting drama setup for their second season.\\n\\n\r\nI was damn wrong. Instead of it, season 2 brings no real plot whatsoever, and very little character development.\\n\r\nWe have a regression in the main couple, as there was no closure but a lot of awkwardness between Togashi and Takanashi,although 6 months had passed since season 1. It's implied this is the setup for Satone's intervention, as Nibutani even makes a foreshadow impliying Schimiya to be trouble between Yuuta and Rikka. Instead, she just brings little trouble, dissapears from some episodes, comes back, realizes she loves Yuuta, then realizes she can't have him, goes back to normal like nothing happened and becomes Rikka best friend from nowhere. She even says \"bye bye\" to Yuuta in episode 11, implying she's going to dissapaear, as she tries to do in the novel, but comes back in the last episode as nothing has happened.\\n\r\nThe rest of the season are just filler episodes, full of fanservice and moe girls, becoming some sort of harem. Makoto Ishiki is practically removed from the series, becoming a full comic relief character and having barely some screen time. Yuuta does not care for him at all. Irrelevant characters like Kumin got more screen, and even episodes focused on them. We have more girls introduced, with not relevance in the plot.\\n\r\nThe comedy is fine, but becomes kind of annoying in some episodes. All the cast becomes really idiot and regress their progress after every episode, and the fanservice gets on your nerves.\\n\r\nI'm not against fanservices, nor comedy. It was comedy what got me into chuuni season 1. But it was also the drama and the develop what kept me watching it.\\n\r\nThis wasn't what happened in season 2. Every episode become more boring than the previous, and any expectation I had from Schimiya was in vain.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and music are great, but don't make this anime worth watching.",

I agree it doesn't even compare to the beauty shown in the 1st season but come on people its still chuu2byo. \r\nYep the story line is definitely weaker as compared to the 1st season as some episodes as mentioned in many other reviews seem like filler, one example being Kumin's sleeping contest thing. The humor is not as great as the 1st season but it is still good. Highlighting the major parts here, Dekomori and Nibutani got morescreen time here and the fights, arguments and, friendly love between them was fun to watch. This season does justice to them showing how close they actually are. Also the romance between Yuuta and Rikka is supposed to be pure and cute. The story is made in a way that people feel that relationships can exist without kisses or sex. \\n\\n\r\nI believe it is not good to stereotype a series as bad just by looking at things like Rikka and Yuuta haven't even kissed yet? But they have been in a relationship for 6 months. Is it really so necessary for them to kiss just because they have been in a relationship for 6 months. Rikka running away whenever they have romance or are given attention in public just makes the series serve its purpose. When we talk about Chuu2byo we don't talk about a typical shoujo anime or shounen ai but we talk about cuteness which is depicted perfectly in the series.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the comedy aspect of the series. I don't know about other people but there is a smile on my face throughout the episode. Rikka and dekomori turning every ordinary aspect of life into fantasy is just awesome and the fights between dekomori and nibutani does make you laugh. The regular gag about not recognizing the guy who is in love with Kumin never fails to make me evoke a smile or a laugh. The reactions of Sichimiya(love rival for Rikka, a childhood friend of Yuuta) are priceless when she is being inquired about her love for Yuuta.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I believe making ren get such reviews is because the 1st series was much better than this one. Lets not compare and enjoy this series. It is not that bad as people tend to make it.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the reviews I have mentioned above please don't think that this review was meant to offend you. This was just my take of the series. \\n\\n\r\nGuyz please leave a message about what do you think about the series. I would be happy to know about your opinions.\\n\\n\r\nThank you",

            "content": "*Stumbles from all the negative press* Ouch, where all the hate coming from?  Oh, sorry, breaking the 4th wall of reviewing here...  Here we have Season 2 of Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!:  Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren.  The relationship of Yuuta and Rikka starts this series off... but not with a bang.  The second season, between the comedy and silliness that signified the first season, chronicles Yuuta and Rikka struggling with their relationship with all their friends and family providing support.  All who watched season 1 will remember how Yuuta decided to work with Rikka and herChuunibyou syndrome rather than snap her out of it or move on to possibly greener pastures.  Well, now our buddy has to live with his decision to stay with a girl with the mentality of a elementary schooler, and the drama surrounding it creates an entertaining, satisfactory series.\\n\\n\r\nStory:  8/10\\n\r\nI could be a little biased, considering I love the drama of romance more than the drama leading to a romance (Maybe because the latter isn't done often enough in anime), but I enjoyed this season's story more than the first.  The alternate-reality fights are better, and I think they're more of them this season than the first.  Yuuta's patience with Rikka while their friends babystep them further into their relationship is as cute as a box of kittens.  One major point I will give the anime is, unlike most where the male/female interaction makes no sense by the guy being Mr. Perfect (I'm looking at you Kirito when your girlfriend's body is ready, and you Tenchi, and you Mr. Perfectly Useless from Shuffle!), there's actually a reason WHY Yuuta has been taking things slow with Rikka, and the rest of cast (the normal ones anyone) don't see their progression as normal.  Those reasons make the show less LCD screen punch-worthy than others with Mr. Perfects.  And Rikka and Yuuta's relationship does develop by the end of the series.  It may not be at full flair by the end, but it develops at the speed appropriate for them.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I said I liked Season 2 better than 1, major sins exist that prevent it from becoming a 9.  For example, as the little synopsis above says, and as I'm sure anyone with a brain can deduce, Sophia becomes the third wheel in our central romance's already mountainous journey.  The writer's choice to make her another Chuunibyou weakens her impact dramatically; she should have been a regular high school student trying for Yuuta.  Luckily, Yuuta and Shikka have enough problems themselves to keep the plot in the pot boiling.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nAnd still no complaints ^_^!  I enjoyed the openings and closing animations better this time around, and with more alternate-reality battles, the animation stays strong.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:  7/10\\n\r\n*Sigh* nothing new to report.  The music throughout was there, but didn't  particularly appeal to me.  Nothing different than what you'd find in most romance anime.  The voice acting keep it at a strong 7.  Yuuta and Nibutani's transitions into their Chuunibyou selves had me rewinding the scenes with giddy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  8/10\\n\r\nPut some steel in that cement, because the characterization is stronger this time around.  Nibutani and Kumin get some spotlight, the former's thrilling while the latter's hilarious.  No words needed for the two \"lovers.\" The trials in their relationship are the epicenter.  Unfortunately, Makoto and Dekomori were dusted aside like annoying pets, while the newbie Sophia just didn't fit her role well enough (Think Melia from Xenoblade Chronicles). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Conclusion:\\n\r\nNot all anime relationships are created equal.  Some have accidents that put people in comas, some a girl with a terminal condition, some with a girl that loses her memory every day, and others with a love interest trying to balance reality with fantasy.  Chuniybou Ren builds on the fresh romance it offered in the prequel by showing an odd couple coping with their folie a deux that, from the outside looking in, seems like an extraordinary effort.  Watching these two finally share their madness and try to create a healthy relationship birthed an enjoyable journey, earning it a deserved place in my romance collection.  \\n\\n\r\nUltimate Final Technique V2:  Final Judgment Slashing Score Deus Ex Plus!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  8/10",

It was definitely a fun experience and I was very eager to get myself started with season 2. While sing praise towards season 1, I can't say the same for season 2.\r\nPlot wise, Just like season 1, the plot wasn't deep nor complex. But season 1's plot definitely had more depth and it didn't feel forced. Westill had some feels, which I like for the most part. Some of the comedy bits were still funny although several jokes lost its appeal due to continued recycling. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance progression was probably the biggest pull for me in season 1. I was expecting it but not how they went with it. Definitely a pleasant surprise, this is why I couldn't wait to get season 2 started, to know which direction they were going with it. \\n\\n\r\nI'm honestly upset with what they did with the romance this season. Well they didn't do much, I wouldn't argue if somebody said they didn't do anything at all with this part of the story. I wanted progression, I got very little of it. The romance that bloomed at the end of the 1st season stagnated until season 2 ended. \\n\\n\r\nSummary: I enjoyed it, but this season is undoubtedly inferior to the previous season. I wish they developed more of the romance, that was I was expecting the most this season.  \\n",

            "content": "Any fans of Chuunibyou's first season would likely agree that they were looking forward to another season, However this season fell flat on it face and was awful. A poor story, no character development and a matter a fact they suffered regression.\r\nThe main point of this season was to progress the relationship of Rikka and Yuuta. In the process the supporting cast which once added to the show's entertainment value(whether it was comedy or the plot) completely felt pointless and were annoying at times. Through series the literally inch closer, holding hands, hugging, a little kiss on the forehead. Any time they had a opportunitywhere the moods was right they wind up not doing anything. Case and point the finale episode was a waste that left me with a weak and unsatisfying resolution. Even the side characters complained about it! The main conflict aside from not being able to look in each others direction every other episode was with Yuuta's childhood friend Satone. She was barely enough to qualify for the main cast if you ask me. She showed up had little to no impact and things moved on. She wanted Yuuta's D, realized it was wrong, cried about and that was that, Now her and Rikka are best friends. I found myself dreading each new episode. While some were okay it wasn't enough to save the show in general. They have a large amount of \"battles\" in this season and it almost feels overused to a extent. The comedy was on pair sometimes and other times it made me want to do anything else beside watch this show. The art and animation was fantastic and the score was okay. Nothing stood out and the opening was okay.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn summery Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren is something you should not watch. It doesn't matter how much you loved season 1 it will not live up to exception. The story and characters just are not there. It felt like fanserive, they just decided \"Hey, lets make another season.What, a plot idea... characters ... please we don't need to worry about those things it is for the fans. cough*and to make a quick buck.*\"\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score - 6/10",

            "content": "A great example of a show that just didn't need a sequel season.\r\nThe first season of Chuunibyou wasn't particularly amazing in my opinion, but at least it had a premise, some conflict, an overall purpose which it delivered on, some entertaining scenes and it mostly tied itself up without leaving many loose ends.\r\nSo why did it need a sequel season? It mostly just ends up as a \"continuation of the characters from the first season\", and the entire thing just felt way too safe. The characters from last season pretty much had all of their character conflict resolved, so now they had to find anew direction to go with the series, which they rather lacked . This leads to just a series of episodes with more of the same kinds of episodes and occasional humor of the first season, only this time most of the initial charge has worn off. \\n\\n\r\nAny semblance of a conflict gets resolved very quickly and the series lacks any memorable episodes or any of what made the first season good. What ends up happening is an annoyingly slow progressing romance between two characters who already had that part of their character resolved last season, and it ends up just feeling like it was forced to be a part of the story, as ti can just be almost uncomfortable to watch. They try to add a \"love triangle\" type plot, but they don't do very much with it, and I can understand why. If they did make anything too serious and dramatic out of it, it would probably just end up feeling jarring and out of place because of the generally lighthearted tone of the show. Shichimiya isn't integrated well into the story, since she's an obvious \"third wheel\" to the group of characters, and she's an annoying character on top of that. \\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou Season 2 isn't bad, persay, it's just unnecessary. It added nothing to the original story, as everyone is pretty much where they left off without much development. The initial charm and occasionally cringe-worthy humor has since worn off, leaving the series feeling stale, recycled and highly predictable without anything new added nor anything that made the first season entertaining.",

If you dislike any of the characters in the first season, this review might help you.\r\nI already thought the characters were pretty weak, coming into the second season. What you should expect in the second season is for the characters to remain nearly the same. Or rather, you will see a series of episodes that each trick you into thinking that there will be character progression, that then revert back to the exact same dynamic. It is unbelievably frustrating to watch.\r\nThere is one moment in particular, which I can't talk about because spoilers, that happens in the second halfof the series. It got me excited. Finally, some desperately needed character self-reflection that doesn't come off as immature and nearly disfunctional (Sorry guys, not a Rikka fan). But the creators of this show had the audacity to think they can write this conflict off with no reason at all. It completely destroyed the idea of any plot. I would love to hear why they thought that was a good idea.\\n\\n\r\nI'm usually pretty forgiving of anime with little plot. But when it gets as little as \"none,\" it really becomes slice of nothing rather than slice of life. Enjoy your nothing pie everyone; it goes without saying that it could use some flavoring.",

Watching characters you liked so much degrade themselves is something nobody should experience.\r\nThis is direct continuation of Chuunibyou 1st season. Yuuta and Rikka now live together, because apparently even Tooka knows that nothing will happen in this series. Also, Yuuta's old friend with syndrome of her own moves upstairs, resulting in a very poorly executed triangle. \r\nThe high points of this season are definitely scenes with Nibutani and Dekomori. Those two are at theirbest and I'd really love to see more of them instead of, for example, an entire episode about napping (I kid you not).\\n\r\nDrama was handled much worse than in first season, pink haired girl really just felt out of place in all of this. But the worst thing about Ren is that almost nothing happened between Yuuta and Rikka. Nothing. Except now they can hold their hands without passing out from embarrassment. But if you wanted to see at least a kiss in final episodes, don't get you hopes up. They apparently have emotional maturity of 5 year olds.\\n\r\nBoth opening and ending were much behind those from 1st season, but they weren't too bad. Artstyle was really nice, even for KyoAni. Nothing to complain about here.\\n\r\nIn summary, this was a very dissapointing show. As much as it made me laugh sometimes, it came nowhere near the beautiful experience that was first Chuunibyou and I really felt cheated on at the end. Let's hope KyoAni will give this story a proper ending (like it had before Ren happened) with a movie or third season.",

Sure the story and romance in the worlds most slowly progressing relationship does not reach amazing new heights but that does not mean that the anime is not highly enjoyable. For starters one of the perks of Ren is that it continues with the same feel and humorous style as the first series, if youenjoyed the first one then it's pretty probable you'll enjoy this.\\n\\n\r\nThis series also adds to the romance and emotion by introducing us to a new character, Shichimiya (AKA the pink haired girl from the picture). I really liked this girl! Being a fan of the first series I would've probably liked this second one anyway but Shichimiya was a seriously huge part of what made Ren so enjoyable and emotional. I'm not going to mention any spoilers but we also get some more insight into the past of some of the main cast too which is always fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I highly recommend watching Ren, maybe you won't enjoy it as much as the first series or maybe you'll enjoy it more.

I admit that as a whole, the original series was significantly stronger, and i can relate to the view that this one was a little anticlimactic.\r\nHowever, it had its perks, and i was very pleased to see some further development to this brilliantly unique and charming show.\r\nThere's no doubt about it, that Ren puts a lot of focus on the topic of romance, and for those who were expecting more of the action-comedy aspect, you may be let down. This isn't a flaw though, as from the start, Chuunibyou -with its wide expanse of genre coverage drew in a range of viewers with different tastes - it just so happens that whereas the first season was more balanced and therefore \"played it safe\", Ren (alike the ending part of the first season) is a little more delicate, deep, and serious in its approach.\\n\\n\r\nFor a Chuunibyou fan like myself, i was very glad to have the story continue, and although Ren developed the overriding plot minimally, it did give us a lot more development in the character and context areas.\\n\\n\r\nRen is very enriching for watchers of the first season who crave more depth. The addition of some new characters (1 major), and the vivid development of others such as Shinka and Kumin through various events - allows the viewer to feel more attached and connected to the anime as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nSome objectives are covered, the overall presentation is similar, but as i mentioned, Ren's strengths are in its context and development, that will surely suffice as the side of fries, and the ketchup to compliment and therefore enhance the big mac that is the original season - implying that as a standalone, Ren wouldn't really work.\\n\\n\r\nBut forgetting about the original to really crack down on my verdict for Ren...\\n\\n\r\nThe series retains all of its charm. The development of the more-complicated-than-you-would-have-thought relationship between Yuuta and Rikka serves as a backbone in some ways. This allows Ren to incorporate a lot of sentimentality, attention to detail, emotional growth and emotional battles alongside the epic fantasy styled ones. The one area that Ren acts as a step upwards, is its ability to convey emotion. Due to its newly found depth, this sequel series is very effective in the way it conveys friction between the characters, making particularly the journey the Yuuta and Rikka go on together more immersive, as i guarantee that you'll be rooting for them.\\n\\n\r\nRen will add a great extent to your understanding of the Chuunibyou legacy, and while i appreciated the emotional growth and developments it depicts, i agree with the masses that it could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nFrom this, and the extent of your own curiosity, i'm sure you will be able to decide weather of not to pursue this sequel.\\n",

            "content": "Note: This is a sequel and I highly recommend you watch the first season before reading this review.\r\nThe cast returns in Ren and they really step things up for the most part. Dekmoari and Nibutani continue their lovers quarrel which leads Nibutani to walk down a path she wants to forget abouut. Kumin does something incredible by being comic relief in a comedy show and making it work. Yuuta and Rikka largely stay the same characters in the end. This does say they are not very enjoyable to watch, they are, there is just some disappointment.\r\nRen also adds a new character, Shichimiya. She's Yuuta's childhoodfriend which obviously leads to Rikka having doubts about the state of their relationship. This is what you could call the \"story\" of Ren.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the individual parts of Ren are even better than the first season. I've already gave praises to the returning cast. The romance is cute (although not very fulfilling), the battle sequences are significantly better than the first season, the jokes are better, and the moe meter is just off the charts. However, there are some sacrifices it makes and they are big ones.\\n\\n\r\nI have two main issues with Ren. The first is with Shichimiya, she's touted as a main character but ultimately gets less screen time than the rest of the characters by simply not going to the same school. However, she arguably gets the most significant story arc and character development. This is find and good but the progression is obvious and jumpy because of her lack of screen time. She still only serves one purpose in the anime and that is to put doubt into Rikka's head about Yuuta.\\n\\n\r\nThe next is that at the end of the anime everything is still back to the status-quo. I know a lot of anime do this, but it's not as forgivable here since it actually touts that there is going to be a change at the end and then they just pull it away from you. One of the reasons why I didn't mind the drama in the first season was because Rikka actually had a major character revelation and something became of it. Here she might have somewhat of the revelation but the ultimate payoff is very weak.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the animation. It's top notch, Kyoani's budget and know how is really obvious especially during the chuuni sequences which are an absolute joy to watch. It doesn't matter if they don't really make sense they are some of the best \"fight\" sequences I've seen. The sound and music in the show are noticeably good and detailed. Again, where they really shine is during the chuuni fights where everything is just amplified.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I would say Ren has better peaks versus the first season but as a complete package it's very shallow. The anime teeters in the last quarter without the payoff required to make the whole thing work. That said, 95% of the anime is a joy to watch.",

Nice to see how both tries to improve their relationship, but Rikka is still cycling in exercise bike, without getting anywhere from her emotions. a while Yuuta is really trying improve their romantic feelings to each other.\\n\\n\r\nEnding was quite satisfying for sequel, but made me hope for new season. It can't end here, can it? But at the I had to facepalm myself threw the walls and windows, as I saw the last picture. You don't know how disappointed I'm right now...\\n\\n\r\n\"And they all lived ever after, Happy end\"",

            "content": "For I am the Mahou Maou Shounen, I will reveal the path of this review and cast aside the powers of the fallen angels, for I fear nothing but the wielder of the Tyrant Eye and her partner bound by contract, the Dark Flame Master.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThis is the second season of Chu2, and picks up exactly where the first one left off.  Most romance anime tend to end the show with that of a confession, and that is exactly how the first season ended.  Hearing a second season coming out makes this series a rare post confession anime that show the main charactersdating.  Much like the first season, Rikka's innocence that exists with her chuunibyou gives her a hard time maintaining her relationship with Yuuta.  This isn't much change from the first season honestly, but it is still a change.  \\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the style of Chu2's first season, the episodes are organized with introduction, filler, and then the last few trying with a main story.  These filler episodes weren't bad, they were quite enjoyable but the story shines in the last few episodes as it revolves around a similar concept that existed in the first season, does one need to rid of her chuunibyou to love?  The only problem with the fillers are the introduction of new characters that suffer from the Pokemon effect.  They get introduced for one episode only to never be seen again.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nKyoAni stepped up their game.\\n\r\nThe chuunibyou scenes (Where the character's imagination takes over) looks down right amazing.  It looked amazing in the first season, but I was just blown away by how much better it looks in this season.  Not only that, but the animation looks much smoother during these chuunibyou scenes.  Outside of the chuunibyou scenes we get the typical KyoAni scenery that still looks amazing.  KyoAni has always done a great job with art, Chu2's second season is no different.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs were great, every new character contains enough moe to rival that of K-On!.  Assuming you have seen the first season, the new characters introduced are similar to the main cast in terms of cuteness.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI wanna fall in loveeeeeeee\\n\r\n(insert noise of me making the following part of the song with my mouth).\\n\r\nWith the return of ZAQ (The same person who did the Chu2 OP for the first season) we get the great song, VOICE.  The animation for the OP is very pretty and paired up with the great voice (no pun intended) makes for one of the best OP this season.  The ED, Van!shment Th!s World, is sung by the Black Raison d'\u00eatre.  If you don't recognize the group, it's just the four main seiyuus for the anime.  I loved the verses for the ED, but the chorus fell a bit flat, it just didn't fit the way the song was going.  Animation seemed a bit out of place as well, but KyoAni is known for doing serious/weird animations for their EDs.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music.... There was that one song at the end of episode 10 that was amazing.  Other than that, all the rest of the background music carried the mood well, but that one song almost brought me to tears as it carried the mood TOO well.  Great job KyoAni, you always do the sound department right.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nWith the main plot of the show being the evolution of the relationship between Rikka and Yuuta, one can assume that there would be character development for both of those characters.  There was very small developments in both characters though. If I said anymore, it would be spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe best character for this season in my opinion was Schichimiya.  She is a chuunibyou but she acts more like a wise old man, helping Rikka further her relationship with Yuuta.  Schichimiya is the product of a character who wanted to not develop as a character and almost regrets that decision.  This regret was the entire driving point of the anime for me and my favorite part of this entire season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nSomething this anime does really well, is suspense.  The suspense of the kiss, the suspense of confession, the suspense of the possible break down.  These suspenseful moments were missing in the first season but make a great entrance in this season.  \\n\\n\r\nThere are multiple moments where I have laughed or \"Awww'd\"  really loud due to how funny or cute certain parts of this anime can be.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nAs a person who enjoys the arts and sounds aspect of anime more than story, chuunibyou has always caused problems between me and friends.  If you value animation, art and sound over the story, chuunibyou may be for you.\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes the problem is not having a bad sequel, but an unfulfilling sequel.\r\nThe second season of Chuunibyou is, by itself, not as bad as some people may claim it to be. In fact, had the first season not existed, then it may have received a higher score. Nevertheless, there are two main problems with the sequel that make it inferior to its prequel.\r\nThe first of the two problems is the development between Rikka and Yuuta, or lack thereof. KyoAni tries to appeal to certain viewers with the premise that the sequel will delve into the lives of an actual couple, much like Golden Time. However,the premise is all there is \u2014 despite having been lovers for quite some time, Rikka and Yuuta refuse to engage in any activity that leads to progress.\\n\\n\r\nViewers are given multiple scenes in which further love development seems imminent before the show decides to cop-out on itself just for the sake of cheaply teasing its viewers to watch more.\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to describe it is that Rikka and Yuuta may just as well not be dating at all. That would lead to less frustration and greater satisfaction by the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe second problem is the lack of innovation. The creators of the show failed to come up with any original material to further advance the plot. The audience is merely treated to a vague repetition of the same melodrama present in the first season, which is exactly what makes the series so unfulfilling.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season did a good job depicting the difficulty of growing up and how people often resort to illogical tendencies as a coping mechanism to certain problems that they face. It also delved into how we shouldn't try to cast away our pasts, for the same past constitutes our own, unique identities (and the secret fact that within all of us resides the desire to be something greater than what we are today and escape societal conventions).\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the first season accomplished this and more in a mere twelve episodes (the final two of which were, in my opinion, rushed), the second season did nothing more than to reiterate the same themes of its predecessor.\\n\\n\r\nNot only so, but there were many episodes that were unnecessary and rushed. In an attempt to develop the supporting cast more, the series dedicated more or less an episode to characters such as Kumin and Nibutani. Although this is an admirable effort, the episodic development of each character is given a context so outlandish that none of it could possibly be taken seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, again, is lacking in comparison to the first season. The fight sequences in the prequel were longer and fully animated; however, the successor to the original series contain partially animated sequences that are constantly interrupted by some point in the plot, which irks me as these are some of the high points of the show. Although the general quality of animation increased, the (lack of the) much anticipated over-the-top action failed to live up to its expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is not much different from the first, but while the original opening was quite addictive, I feel that the new one is just a step above it. The (admittedly moe) images flashing from left to right pale in comparison to the active, epic, and coherent animation of the second opening.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the second season of Chuunibyou is a continuation of the first \u2014 nothing more, nothing less. Although time continues to move forward, the plot and our characters do not do so in any profound or innovative manner; the animation, while an improvement, lacks any single action sequence that is satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, don't get me wrong, the series isn't terrible, or even bad. Some people (such as I) are hesitant to even dip their toes into the second season due to the significant drop in score, but it's not as bad as some people claim it to be (and it's definitely NOT as bad as Oreimo).\\n\\n\r\nWatch it at your own discretion, but do so with the knowledge that the series makes little progress since the end of the first season. The best way to enjoy the sequel to Chuunibyou is to dive in with little expectations and to avoid continuously comparing it to the original twelve episodes; that's exactly why I found this to be more enjoyable than most people.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (30%) \u2014 6.2/10\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (30%)  \u2014 6.0/10\\n\r\nANIMATION (10%) \u2014 8.1/10\\n\r\nSOUND (5%) \u2014 7.1/10\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (25%) \u2014 7.2/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (100%) \u2014 6.6/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S. The percentages represent how significant I considered each aspect to be in my overall score of the show.\\n\r\nP.P.S. This is my first review, so...please be gentle senpai (but seriously, I would love to hear what I can improve upon).",

            "content": "NIIIIII,HA,HA,HA,HA\r\nOk, so the sequel is over, so what do I have to say about this sequel? Well I probably agree with the majority of the MAL users who have made a review of this sequel and gave it a 5 or 6, so I'm gonna fuck around and just state my ratings for each of this sequel's category:\r\nFair 6. \r\nStory: According to the majority who had given this sequel a 6 or 5, there hasn't been any development so far as to this sequel's plot and I kinda agree to such extent, but then again, one can't deny the romance that was brewing between Yuutaand Rikka.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character's may have moved on to the next school year level, but so far nothing has change at all with their roles and their interaction with each other, let's face it Nibutani is still at odds with Sanae, Kumin is still a sleepy airhead. But, I'm a bit disappointed that Kyoto Animation has demoted Makoto as 3rd level support character also, they didn't even leveled up the Makoto X Kumin arc, the introduction of Sophia didn't add to anything at all, in fact, she is more of an additional chip on the male character's shoulder than anything else, NIIIIII HA,HA,HA,HA!\\n\\n\r\nGood 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I gave this sequel's category such score, co'z of the opening and closing theme, that I like.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The cast maybe still the same, and there maybe no development of any sort, but it was still funny and it's slice of life was still alright to say the least.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nArt: well it was still the same, though Nibutani has gone to some changes it was mostly on a temporary state than anything else, and I have nothing more to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This sequel maybe a mediocre, but still it was ok enough to be enjoyed, now does this series deserve another sequel? Probably not, co'z Tyrant Eye tells me that  it would be like eating curry for the third time where one would start to get tired of it. NIIIIIII HA,HA,HA,HA!!!!!",

            "content": "Nope, it isn't as bad as everybody makes it out to be. Season 2 of Chuunibyou could have actually been a 10 if the final scene wouldn't have happened the way it did.\r\nStory : 8/10\r\nYou know what's incredibly hard to do? Combine the genres of SoL, Comedy and Romance. You might think that those 3 are basically a given for every good romance show, but that's only half right.\r\nThe thing about Chuunibyou Season 2, is that it perfectly manages to give it's moments to every genre it has. Usually, one of those genres is bound to be ignored, like having too much slice of lifeelements and then rushing dramatic parts for the romance, or having too much of those dramatic parts so the show will feel \"stuck up\". Chuunibyou on the other hand, brings a perfect balance of comedy, slice of life elements, and serious moments.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the things that lower my appreciation of the story are mainly pesky  little scenes which are supposed to be serious, but instead throw in Chuuni jargon, and the final scene of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow to address the whole \"lack of romantic development\" argument. No, the show doesn't lack in romantic development, on the contrary, if you believe it does, you're blind. Yuuta's speech in the final episode is a great resume of this. The ultimate doom of most couples in middle/high school is taking things too quickly, I've seem more than one example of this in real life. This is also exactly what Yuuta says. He'd rather take things slowly and surely, rather that rush and eventually, destroy his relationship.\\n\\n\r\n[Spoiler] : Yes, if Rikka and Yuuta would have kissed at the end, the show would have been a solid 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's KyoAni, need I say more?\\n\\n\r\nSeriously though, KyoAni are the gods of portraying human emotion. The scene where Shichimiya \"fights\" her inner self is one of the best \"breakdown\" scenes I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is good (it's ZAQ afterall), the voice acting is on point, Juri Nagatsuma's performance was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Season 2 shines. Every. Single. One. of the characters gets some development, and even the newly introduced ones end up with as much depth as the old ones. The struggles of Nibutani embracing her past self, Shichimiya fighting her love for Yuuta, the fact that Dekomori eventually becomes close to Nibutani, her somewhat of a nemesis, and the emotional struggles of Rikka make every character human. Even Kumin shows another side of herself, even while being a side character. The characters all grow and by the end of S2, are all different than from what they were in S1 or the beginning of S2.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMinor inconveniences aside, Chuunibyou S2 offers a fun story that is also very deep if analysed, and portrays human emotions unlike any other anime.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend watching S2 or all of Chuunibyou? If you have a bit of analytical thought, then yes. If you're in it simply for the romance, then no.",

            "content": "I'll make this short and to the point.  This season of Chuunibyou is essentially what people who have seen Angel Beats wanted for the future - character development for supporting cast and more time spent with characters we enjoy.  \r\nI've noticed that the majority of people who have given season 2 a low score generally cite that the series lacks a story.  Patently false; what they probably mean is that what THEY wanted to happen didn't.  Feeling entitled doesn't make being denied what you want a valid criticism.  \r\nTrue, the first season wrote a huge check that nothing afterwards wasgoing to be able to cash, short of god-tier writing or some forced melodrama.  However, to say that this season didn't have a story is just covering your eyes and ears to the show itself.  I personally found it refreshing to see a romantic rivalry handled the way it was in this case and the expansion on the other characters was also nice to see, as always in gorgeous Kyoani SOL fashion.",

            "content": "Before I start anything, I just want to address that I like the idea behind Chuunibyou. A story where it talks about the 8th Grade Syndrome? I'm in (call me a sucker). As to why I'm only talking about it a year after the release of the 2nd season is none of your business. Yeah, it's a product of the times. I mean, it's KyoAni, they ride the waves of the mainstream (Get it? 'Cause it's a stream and there's a wa- forget it.) But after milking it dry with a ONA released from their YouTube channel and numerous specials that were made after the1st season, is there really a need for a second season to happen? Well, the charts and the money talked and now here we are: Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a sequel, you have to give the audience new things and improvements needed from the previous season (if needed) that would forward the story. And what we got are 2 major things:\\n\\n\r\n1: Yuuta and Rikka adjusting to each other now that they're in a relationship (Spoiler) and\\n\r\n2: A new threat, in the guise of an old friend from Yuuta and Nibutani's childhood that may or may not have feelings for Yuuta, takes center stage\\n\\n\r\nBoth problems seem very interesting but here's why the show didn't pass with flying colors (at least, for me). The first problem is the natural course of any relationship and it's fine in that respect but don't pretend you've never seen this before (maybe having a very normal dilemma is to show how Rikka is changing? idk). And the resolution both of them had by the end was just okay (again, for me). So anything interesting that I could anticipate from this show would come from Satone or the childhood friend. And it's...underplayed. I mean, they've introduced her in Episode 2 but her arc wasn't tackled until Episode 7 or something. And even after that, her story wasn't developed that well, like it's missing something. It's like I KNOW she's Yuuta's childhood friend and they have a lot of precious memories together, but I don't UNDERSTAND that (does that makes sense?). And the worst part is, they have the time to actually establish that. There were many fillers in this season that could've been for Satone's story but no, we have to raise Nibutani and Dekomori's yuri flag higher and we have to give that sleeping senpai an arc. It's just disappointing. I guess one good thing that happened in the story would be when the choice of keeping her \"powers\" or falling completely in love was introduced to Rikka. I can't fully discuss my problems with the story without going to Spoiler Territory but that was one of the few interesting parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, there was also that \"Dark Flame Dragon\" thing. That happened...\\n\\n\r\nStory aside, the art was also good here. It's about as awesome as the 1st one. I'm not sure if there were more \"fictional scenarios\" that were here compared to the first season but there are several. All of the members in their club (even including Nibutani and Yuuta) joins in the 8 Grade train so that creates a lot of opportunities for those \"fictional scenarios\" and they, more or less, took advantage of that. The songs and OSTs are nice but there's nothing that I would listen to outside of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all, this is a second season we didn't need (if not for the moe fan service). Satone was a very interesting character to mix into the story but ultimately became boring and a waste of potential in the end (Guys, it's not too late. You can still make an OVA to redeem her. I'll be waiting.) If there's anything I've gained from this, that would be a better understanding of Nibutani's life (?), there exists a napping competition (which I would be happily obliged to participate), and a good time (despite its shortcomings). You would have to be a pretty big fan of the series to fully enjoy this one.",

This might be an opening for another season where there will be more development of the characters, not just Yuuta and Rikka, but also we might see more of Kumin and Isshiki. Add Dekomori and Nibutani on that.\r\nI enjoyed the whole series because there is still \"cute\" element right there, especially when Rikka still wears that \"Wicked Eye\". The battle sequence through the flowof the story just colors up the mood of the series, even though Rikka should've already changed after Season 1. But it is still about Chuunibyou syndrome, right? \\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, this series really made me happy on my life on how do I deal with my sadness. I hope some people see that. \\n\\n\r\nAs a conclusion, the whole series was great for me. The only thing that was lacking is character development. The series was cute and funny. Battle scenes were still badass.  I hope there will be more of that.\\n\\n\r\nI hope KyoAni makes season 3 for this. We just need to wait for a while. I would love to see the progress movement of the characters. I know \"that ending\" would like to indicate that there will be more of it. Welcome aboard to those who are waiting for season 3!

            "content": "Half a year ago I indulged in the first season of Chuunibyou and got wrapped up in the decent romance, though found the humor to be lacking and the characters hard to identify with. In the final paragraph of my review, I stated:\r\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that the second season manages to stay in touch with the romantic and character-specific side rather than the stupid goofiness of having eighth-grade syndrome. Or even strike a balance between the two. Because the show only seems to shine when it does just that; gets that balance between dumb and decent\u201d.\r\nAnd Kyoto Animation must have listened to me because season twodoes a great job of striking a balance between the humor and the romance, while adding in another character who, at first, you feel will bring the series into the love triangle poo-poo garbage spectrum, but actually becomes the best, most relatable character in the series.\\n\\n\r\nPros\\n\r\n1.) Striking the Balance- The first season\u2019s first half was nothing but establishing what eighth grade syndrome is and how it affects the characters, but did it in a comedic and awkward way. It then spent the latter half getting the romance going. This second half was good, not great, but managed to create an interesting romance that I wanted to see to completion. Season two balances the two aspects really well. Some episodes are centered on the comedy, others on the romance, all culminating in a central story arc  about Yuuta and Rikka being the most awkward and strange couple on the planet. The humor itself isn\u2019t particularly funny; I\u2019ve never really enjoyed this series for the humor. But the romance is given enough time to give us character development, some silly situations, and a lot of romantic development. There\u2019s no dry portion of the show and fans of either aspect of Chuunibyou should be sated by what\u2019s presented.\\n\\n\r\n2.) Mature Execution of the Love Triangle- The moment I saw new character Shichimiya Satone was entering the fray, I figured the show was going to fall straight down the gutter. Imagine my surprise after seeing how well the triangle was executed without giving in to the typical tropes and situations. The love triangle itself isn\u2019t presented until later on in the series, but becomes most of Satone\u2019s character through these episodes. She\u2019s in love with Yuuta, she\u2019s his childhood friend, she had a chance to have him, but she decided to instead focus on being a magical girl. When forced to see that Rikka can balance being a weirdo and being a lover, she gets really lovesick. And she could move in on Yuuta and fight Rikka for his love, but instead we see her trying to cope with these feelings and get rid of them. And this is such a little thing to so many people, but love triangles in anime, books, and TV always become immature battles for a person\u2019s heart that don\u2019t compel me or pull me in because of how immaturely it is presented. The fact that Satone mopes about it, is trying to get him out of her head, respects the boundaries between Rikka and Yuuta, and tries to find a way to change her feelings is such a well done process. If this anime lives on in my mind for anything, it will be Satone\u2019s character.\\n\\n\r\n3.) Cute Romance- Despite how awkward and weird it is, the romance between Rikka and Yuuta is adorable as hell. Rikka is so scared to even hold hands and the way her friends push her and gossip about it all is realistic and fun. All the characters work so well together to help produce an outcome for this romance. I don\u2019t want to call it mature, because the characters are far from, but it is well written. It\u2019s a romance you can remember with a smile and a warm heart.\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n1.) Humor- This is a series that I don\u2019t find funny in the least. Maybe I\u2019m not deluded enough or never had eighth grade syndrome so don\u2019t understand the humor. I enjoy the awkwardness, but it isn\u2019t as funny as the awkwardness of Welcome to the NHK or Watamote, possibly because of how cutesy everything is. And I think awkward, weird humor about people like Tomoko and me only work if done in realistic, and not so cutesy ways. Then are these characters who still kind of suck\u2026\\n\\n\r\n2.) Dekomori and Kumin- Need I say more? To tell the truth, Dekomori is actually bearable in this season. She\u2019s still a bad, unfunny, and annoying character; but I did think the development between her and Nibutani was a nice touch. Kumin is just\u2026there. Maybe that\u2019s the joke. But ultimately I hate useless characters who add nothing to the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI enjoyed this season a lot more than I did season one. Putting the focus on the romance, handling typically immature ideas in a mature way, and giving us Satone, the cutest goddam weirdo around; Chuunibyou does a lot right and is a definite watch for all fans of season one. Those who didn\u2019t like the first season won\u2019t find anything that will change their minds, though might appreciate some of the things I mentioned.",

It retained all the fun, comedic elements and endearing characters of the first season but really failed to develop on the previous season in any way. \r\nThere was barely any development in the relationship between Rikka and Yuuta, and all the other main characters now seem to be there purely for the comic relief. A variety of side characters were introduced none of which had any real impact on the plot. Satone Shichimiya, Yuuta's middle schoolfriend is introduced to the story which created some drama but again not much development. There were some missed opportunities when it came to character development such as the conflict of whether Rikka had to give up 'chuunibyou' to really love someone but it felt rather dismissed.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is fabulous as one would expect from KyoAni. Aside from the lack of development, I still found it a really entertaining watch right up until episode 11. The last episode felt like a filler that didn't really fit in. It was like an elephant sat on my 11 episode balloon. It was just tacked on to the end and made me question the entire thing.\\n\\n\r\nIf you were a fan of the first season, I'd still say give this a go just don't expect anything mind blowing.

            "content": "REALITY, BE RENT! SYNAPSE, BREAK! VANISHMENT, THIS, WORLD!!!  As the last installment of the Chuunibyou series, (which I have done reviews for), Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren became one of the few shows in the 2013 winter season that was looked forward to, as its success in its previous season had done wonders for itself!  So, let us delve ourselves into the minds of the great Tyrant eye, and Dark flame master once again, or as they are known in this mortal realm, Rikka and Yuuta.  \r\nADVISORY WARNING:  Watch both Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! and the Chuunibyou movie beforewatching this.  This is a sequel series, so watching this right away would be confusing.\\n\\n\r\nStory (6.19/10):  While its predecessor had a decent story to follow, this series...does not.  Following the events of the series after the movie, Rikka and Yuuta are now living together after a set of circumstances that were actually quite random, and the two begin their new lives together, sharing a base and being bound to the contract of lovers!  Or as it is known in normal terms, living together in the same apartment, while also being boyfriend and girlfriend.  \\n\\n\r\nThe series is mostly comprised in a romantic comedy aspect of itself.  Compared to the drama that happened in the second half of the first season, (which I might add, I loved), the ren series focuses more on the relationship between Yuuta and Rikka as they awkwardly try and interact with each other in a way that most couples would.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I don't like about this, is the presentation of it.  The idea itself is quite cute and endearing to watch, but the execution in terms of how it was presented was less than average.  For starters, the idea of the \"contract of lovers\" between the two main cast doesn't even really begin until about halfway through the series.  Before that, it's essentially a load of episodic side stories and one episode characters that didn't really help the show at all.  In fact, I think it hurt the show's credibility a little bit.  After that, when the show finally tries to get itself together, they add in Shichimiya, a character I was DYING to see at the beginning, (since she is on the freaking cover art), and then go into this arc about her, which also didn't help the main story.  It helped Shichimiya's character development, but from an overall story standpoint, not so much.  \\n\\n\r\nWith that, the comes the end of the series, which does actually wrap things up well.  All of the problems were cleared (mostly), it had a very cute scene, and well, it ended up like most romance animes do.  (I'll let you figure that one out.)  I was somewhat upset with the end due to the buildup resulting in just a rage inducing slap to the face, but I suppose it was somewhat fitting for the show, somehow.\\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\\n\r\n+  Very cute story idea (especially with the characters)\\n\r\n-   Side story episodes that didn't help anything\\n\r\n-   lost main idea as the series went on\\n\r\n-   TOO MUCH COCKBLOCKING\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.65/10): To make the story element of the series a bit less important in terms of why anyone would watch this, the characters certainly made up for the series a lot.  \\n\\n\r\nTogashi Yuuta.  As the main protagonist of the Chuunibyou series, Yuuta comes back into the series, essentially more or less the exact same way he was in the original series; with the exception that he now accepts his alternate persona Dark Flame Master or DFM a little more.  In terms of development Yuuta is mainly focused on in the series to \"reach\" out to Rikka more, so that they can get closer and improve their sprouting relationship.  He certainly does get more development in the way that he cares for his Chuuni girlfriend more and more as the series goes on, but he still is rather the same in terms of who he was previously.  That being said, I still like his character due to the way he \"punishes\" Rikka, cause in all honesty, it's pretty funny and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nTakanashi Rikka.  As the main female lead of the series, as well as being the Tyrant Eye, and just one of the more enjoyable characters in this series, Rikka, like Yuuta, hasn't changed very much.  She still retains her Chuunibyou self, as well as gaining all sorts of weird things through ways that make no sense.  (i.e. a pair of night vision goggles).  Throughout the series, she is shown to truly love her boyfriend Yuuta, always mad at when she doesn't get his attention, trying her best to improve their very awkward but cute relationship, and even billowing comical smoke every time she hears or talks about their relationship. Beyond that, she doesn't really change much, as this particular series' development is so drawn out and slow.  \\n\\n\r\nBetween these two characters, is the relationship that is the crux and most important part of this show.  The interaction between these two characters is the main reason why I watched this second series.  (Also, I just love this series in general).  What they do, rather then trying to improve their relationship, is draw it out so long that they basically get nowhere.  Sure there are little flagpoints and noticeable areas where the relationship gets a bit better, but it's just so drawn out that it is actually quite infuriating to watch.  Even the other characters in the show are bothered by this.  Yuuta even specifically states in the series that he and Rikka are taking things one step at a time, which basically is an excuse for the creators to drag things out as long as possible.  \\n\\n\r\nShichimiya Satone is the last character that I will be reviewing.  As the Devil Magical Girl, and the  newest member to the cast of Chuunibyou, Satone is a very interesting case.  With a past with both Nibutani and Yuuta, Satone adds to the cast by being that character that appears out of nowhere, and breaks all hell.  And that my friends, is the reason I love her.  Satone, while introduced late in the series is given an arc all to herself towards the end, where she must, like Rikka in the previous season, battle the turmoils that dwell within her, albeit less morbid and saddening than Rikka's.  She gets some nice character development during her arc, as well as trying to help Yuuta with his relationship, while just being plain awesome most of the time due to how ridiculous and loose her character actually is.  \\n\\n\r\nWith these three, we also have Dekomori, Nibutani, and Kumin, all of which pretty much get their own episode in terms of their focus, and nothing else.  They mostly play a supporting role and nothing much else.  They're still enjoyable characters, retaining all of their traits from the last season, but in terms of anything more, there's not really much else.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast for this series is rather small, consisting mostly of people that appear for around an episode or two.  (Also, the only other guy named Makoto, yeah, he gets like zero screentime.  He appears, then runs off.  That's it.)  They don't add very much to the show, except to give the side story episodes something that resembles a plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\\n\r\n+  Good retaining of the main characters and their traits\\n\r\n+  Good development and introduction of character\\n\r\n-   Terrible romance development with excessive cockblocking\\n\r\n-   Completely pointless side cast that appears for a singular episode most of the time\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.89/10 and 7.31/10):  By my standards, the art for this series is very nice looking and good.  By Kyoto ani standards, I'm not too sure, since I don't know their rating scale.  \\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou has its charm of having a very fluid looking color palette that involves eyes that look like gems, hair that flows like water, very simple, moe, and elegant character designs, and OMG the unneedingly epic scenes!  \\n\\n\r\nWhat Chuunibyou has that other animes in a similar category have, is the fact that it has these scenes that I dub unneedingly epic.  Contrary to what they did this time, the Chuunibyou series has upped its visual effects by making the magical bullshit the characters do in their imagination a lot more epic and flashy, as well as adding in an extremely detailed background.  From an art standpoint, Chuunibyou excels in the fact, that it is very awesome to look at.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom a musical standpoint, I would say that this time, it was average.  The music wasn't all that fantastic, as the OST and ED sounded a bit meh in my opinion.  It was still good, don't get me wrong, but I felt as though that it sounded a bit generic and a bit less memorable than the songs of the original series.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Chuunibyou does have its moments in the in show soundtracks, having beautiful flourishes and moments of sound that are quite awe-inspiring.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, the voices for the series remain relatively unchanged, and sound just as they did in the first season.  With the addition of Juri Nagatsuma as Satone Shichimiya, the cast I felt improved because of the added in character.  (Also, Satone's laugh is awesome.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\\n\r\n+  Godly aesthetics \\n\r\n+  Good voice acting\\n\r\n+  Awesome mystical backgrounds\\n\r\n-   Average sounding soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (7.01/10):  You know that feeling when you anticipate something, and it turns out to be less exceptional than you once thought, Chuunibyou ren was this for me.  When I saw that Chuunibyou was getting a new season, I was greatly ecstatic, as their return would make my high school days a bit more bearable.  After watching this series though...I'm seeing that in a slightly different light.\\n\\n\r\nMy first impression when I watched the first episode, was the fact that this series was getting a sequel that would change the whole series for the better.  It did the complete opposite.  For several weeks, I had watched side story after side story, and I was greatly disappointed to see a series that was once on my favorites list turn into this.  Bear in mind, I still watched it to the end.\\n\\n\r\nI still continued watching because I thought that the story would take off more and more into oblivion.  While I still did get to see some scenes that I enjoyed, as well as the story I was desperately hoping for, it still wasn't enough for the fact that the first few episodes were side stories, and the pacing was as slow as they come.  But, Chuunibyou is still Chuunibyou, as the charm of the show is still retained even through this slog of a mess. \\n\\n\r\nIf you liked the Chuunibyou series, this is something you might like.  Personally, since this was still Chuunibyou, I did kind of like it.  But since there were so many troubles with the series, I can't really recommend it to anyone else, since sequel series' require watching the first one to understand.  That being said, I, PyraXadon, the Phantom Avenger that steals the powers of immortal beasts, bid you adieu.  (I just needed to put my own Chuunibyou schpeal in there.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: (6.99/10)",

            "content": "This will be the first review I have ever written so I hope it won't turn out too bad.\r\nAfter really enjoying the first season of Chuunibyou, I was excited to watch the second one and see where it took the characters. In comparison to the first season I felt like some of the episodes were a little lacking in development and progress towards a main plot. However, this didn't really bother me. Partly why I liked this anime so much is because it's just about a bunch of friends and the random adventures they go through. To me, it doesn't have to have any sortof real significance. Their activities always kept me interested and usually put a smile on my face from the antics they'd go through. \\n\\n\r\nIf you were someone who was watching this series as it was being put out each week, I could understand your disappointment in waiting a week for an episode where there was no real plot progression. But now as someone who has access to all the available episodes, just take it in stride and enjoy each episode for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nI think part of the reason why there seemed to be so many filler episodes, was so that the viewer grows attached to the characters. In an anime with a romantic aspect, you aren't going to feel any compassion towards the characters' love if you don't feel anything towards them as the characters that they are. In order for the anime to make an impact on your emotions, it had to make sure you were connected enough to the characters to even be able to do so.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I would like to ask people going into this anime to go into it with an open mind. Don't go in expecting too much from each episode. Enjoy the episodes for what they bring you: small adventures with laughs and bonding between the characters as friends. If that isn't what you're looking for, then maybe it's just best that you skip over this one. If you really did enjoy the first season of the show then going into this one should be an enjoyable experience. As long as you aren't concerned about fast pacing, just enjoy the laughs, bonding, and emotional endeavors!",

Season 1 flashed moments of development that kept it watchable, but season 2 simply does not hold up.\r\nStory: How many times can we fit the lines \"fake mori summer\", \"synapse,break\" and \"dark flame master\" into 12 episodes. The story beats you into a coma with repetitive one liners, increasingly unlikable characters, and cliches until the final credits roll. It's attempt to create a love triangle(within 3 dedicated episodes?) falls front on its face due tothe fact that it has no lure, substance, or anything at all that a love triangle needs. Instead of adding another 8th grade syndrome screwed childhood friend into the mix, why not add a normal high school girl? She would not only be able to represent the ideals Yuuta had going into high school but also provide another perspective for the characters(in need of it obviously) and viewers. Instead, the audience is left with a poorly/barely even written love triangle that gives the audience no reason to ever believe that Yuuta will ever even consider leaving rikka for another chuunibyou girl. It's like wondering, should I trade my life in prison for 90 years of prison?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: One of the worst if not the worst collection of characters I've ever encountered in a romcom. Maybe if this show took place in elementary school it'd be fitting but for a high school romcom it is mind boggling and mostly painful. Yuuta is still a father to his delusional 8 year old girlfriend rikka, dekomori only speaks the lines \"master\" and \"fake mori summer\", nibutani is a know-it-all with 0 credibility, and honestly Kumin is a walking mannequin. Nothing to see here, just a poor arrangement of characters that claim they're growing up, yet still use pacifiers and diapers.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Some okay Osts, forgettable op and ed. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Wow! Something positive about the show! Great artwork all around as expected from Kyoto animation. I believe I watched a couple episodes at 480p, and it still looked great. Fight scenes were a notch above too. Brilliant work.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you liked Chuunibyou season 1, I'd suggest staying clear of this one. It really makes you realize how delusional the characters in this universe are, and offers no development from the first season. Even if you have no expectations for this season, it's still a let down. That's a pretty big indicator of the nonsense this season is.",

            "content": "Based from the first season, I think the second season would be a good one to watch until the end because I got interested about what will be happen to this couple, Yuuta and Rikka\r\nBut after I finished watch this serial. Here's some review for you\r\n[Story]\r\nBasically, I really enjoyed the story they make. I still can't believe about how they make a long enough story with something that you never thought it would be. Unfortunately, I'm a freshman in anime world and I didn't know that Kyoto Animation always have something that can make you surprised (and surprises are not always good for a storyline)\\n\\n\r\nI felt a bit disappointed. Sometimes, I found some episode were \"Out of track\" and looks like a filler episode. One thing that I can't handle much more is troll from KyoAni. It always ruined a good climax into a joke easily and this is a big disaster for every people who want to watch something because they want to get a good story (just like me)\\n\\n\r\n[Art]\\n\r\nJust like another KyoAni's productions, they always made it with a very good details and moe characters. Chuuni battle in this series made me really enjoy the battle. The collaboration between handed-drawing and CGI tech really make an epic battle with a high quality graphics. Also, the background is good enough with some details\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\r\nI wasn't good enough at music. But I didn't get anything wrong in this series. I enjoyed the OP and ED which mixed perfectly with the scene. I found that some sad and romace scene with background music was helpful to build the feel of the scene. Nothing to be disappointed at this part\\n\\n\r\n[Character]\\n\r\nThis is the main reason I want to watch this series. I wanted to get a good development from Rikka, who hasn't grow enough at the first season. But she doesn't make a significant changes. Luckily, for some people whose had a chuunibyou in their past, they can feel what she really want to do to Yuuta. I can see a good personality from Rikka who just looks like she didn't have any except her syndrome\\n\\n\r\nThe new character, Satone whose bring the conflict in this season was successfully make some people confused about whose side I should take. Another supporting character like Nibutani, Dekomori, and Kumin also done a good job to help Yuuta and Rikka to develop their love. I feel sorry to Isshiki. He just like disappear in this season and didn't have any significant development\\n\\n\r\nBut (again) a bad ending just make every good development in this season looks unimportant anymore\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]\\n\r\nIn this part, I will separate it\\n\\n\r\nFor people who really want to get a good story:\\n\r\nI think you still can enjoy this season as long as you keep focus at the main line and think that some troll and \"out of track\" episode is just something to entertain you. I think this serial also give a deep meaning about \"who am I\" and \"what should I do to make another people happy?\"\\n\\n\r\nFor people who want to get a good comedy and some epic battle:\\n\r\nYou can enjoy this season same as the first season. There are some comedy scene which can make you pause your video player just because you cannot stop laughing in a while. How about the battle? Same as the first season, epic and has a good graphic, and get an ear-candy music\\n\\n\r\n[Overall]\\n\r\nIf I took from the story, this season is a little bit worse than the first. But it still enjoyable and make you curious about what will be happen after it (at least you can say that before the last episode)\\n\\n\r\nIf I took from the enjoyable, this season bring a fair slice for the comedy, drama, and the romance\\n\\n\r\nIf you just curious about what happened to Yuuta and Rikka after the first season and really expected a good drama in this season, you may leave this series. But if you want to get more epic battle and get entertained by some comedy, you can watch this series\\n\\n\r\nThat's all my review about this season. Sorry for a bad grammar. I hope this is helpful for everyone who consider to watch it or in the middle of this season",

            "content": "Most sequels are way worse than the first one, and the second season of Chuunibyou is just another example approved this theory. For anyone like me, enjoyed the in-depth story about family and self-consciousness in the first season, will completely let down by season 2. The story in the second season is just simple normal romance story, and even this tasteless plot was presented in a messy way.\r\nAfter watching the whole season, I felt only episode 10 and 11 helped develop the story. Most episodes in season 2 are completely nothing to do with the further development of the plot. Yes, I enjoyed the gagsin these episodes, but it doesn't mean I can tolerate so many empty meaningless episode. Just imagine it, I've waited a whole week for a good episode, but what I got is an episode about nap competition? Jeez!\\n\\n\r\nI'm wondering what will it be if the story of season 2 became the movie version? Now we got a terrible recap movie and a terrible season 2, why not just turn the story of season 2 into the movie instead of a recap movie? I'm sure this story will be clearer and better paced if KyoAni turn it into 100 minutes (actually I think 90 minutes could finish this story), and I'm sure an average movie will be a lot better than a bad movie plus a bad season.",

            "content": "First thing that comes to mind, after watching this: why the hell did they do a sequel?!\r\nOf course, money comes as an easy explanation, but from the point of view of who watched the first season and, like me, enjoyed it throughfully, there's no excuse. This sequel has no reason of being.\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nSPOILER AHEAD, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK AND ONLY IF\r\nYOU ALREADY WATCHED THE SHOW OR YOU DON'T INTEND TO WATCH IT:\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nThis is an entire season made because a boy and a girl should have kissed in the first season but hadn't, so that they could kiss. After 11 episodes of pure bullshit (sometimes funnybullshit allright, but this doesn't change its nature), with the exception of a couple of meaningfull scenes, after something like a year of relationship, they don't kiss.\\n\\n\r\n_________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nEND OF THE SPOILER\\n\\n\r\n_________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, to justify me giving it the bare sufficiency, speaking of marks, this is just because I loved characters in the first season, and because of the beautiful art of KyoAn animes. If this had been a different show, there would have been no problems, but the first part of the series created some expectations, which sure have been left unsatisfied.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, let's say that you should watch it if, like me, you are the kind of person who can't leave things undone, and so you feel incomplete if you don't get to know the whole story. If not, and you can feel ok with watching just a part of a story (that actually should have been considered concluded at the end of the first season, since there's no developement at all in this sequel), then leave things at that, and don't waste your time on this second season.",

            "content": "Following the widespread success of the original Love, Chunibyou, And Other Delusions (Which I am just going to refer to as Chunibyou/Season one because who has the time to keep typing out that title?), Heartthrob/Ren seemed like an adaptation that would be impossible to avoid. Based on the 2011 light novel series by Torako with art from Nozomi Ousaka, Chunibyou caters to any fan of the slice of life or comedy genre through quick-witted dialogue and a lovable character roster. Being picked up by Kyoto Animation definitely aided it's relevance, and the series has now become a bombshell among the anime community in both Japanand America.\\n\\n\r\nHeartthrob picks up right where season one left off -- with Yuuta and Rikka slowly trying to move their relationship forward. The issue is that Rikka is still extremely shy and has problems even holding his hand. But now, due to unforeseen circumstances, the couple has to move in together as Rikka's sister is moving away. Now, there are certain issues that would typically arise from this situation that we're just going to overlook because it's Yuuta and Rikka we're talking about. You'll understand if you watched the first season. Regardless, this is a slight hurdle for the two of them but essentially allows them to move closer together on an emotional (And physical *wink*) basis. Or at least it should...\\n\\n\r\nOut of nowhere, Yuuta's childhood friend, Satone Shichimiya, waltzes back into his life. Girlfriends don't typically like when other girls do that sort of thing and Rikka is no exception to that rule. What makes it even worse is that Satone is the girl that Yuuta owes his chunibyou to in the first place. Needless to say, Shichimiya (Who is also stuck in chunibyou limbo) becomes not only a rival in love for Rikka, but a rival in the dark realm as well. So now we have sort of two different conflicts: Rikka vs. Satone/Wielder of the Wicked Eye vs. Sophia Ring. The great thing about these conflicts is that they essentially wind up fusing together as the two girls come to terms with themselves and the way they feel. It's like a battle between good and good as opposed to good and evil. Just instead of camouflage, both sides are wearing hair ties and mini-skirts (Which is totally better, in my opinion).\\n\\n\r\nNow, the great thing about this show is the steady build-up of each girl's feelings. Satone, even though she is sort of an antagonist in a way, is just as likable as Rikka. There really is no bad guy as far as this sequel goes, and that just makes the conflict more...conflicting. It's up to the viewer to decide how they want the love triangle to shift. And as I said, it just builds and builds until the two girls can no longer contain their feelings and erupt in emotional supernovas most likely visible from planets we haven't even heard of. If there is anything that Heartthrob excels in when compared to its prequel, it's the strong coming-of-age theme for nearly everyone involved -- but more specifically Satone and Rikka.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some things that suffer in this sequel, however. Considering the majority of the characters in the Chunibyou universe have already been established and introduced to us prior to Heartthrob, there is a noticeable lack of character development present throughout this series. Now, I understand why some people will defend that and say that it isn't really necessary for character progression to carry over, but I'm going to disagree. There are plenty of sequels out there where the main characters continue to change throughout multiple courses, why should this go against that? Rikka and Yuuta are essentially the same people they were in season one all throughout Heartthrob. Even when the conflict is resolved there isn't much change apart from Rikka trying slightly harder to come to terms with her feelings. And I mean slightly. Like, so slightly that the ultimate unraveling of her inner struggle is kissing her damn boyfriend on the cheek. As for Yuuta...yeah he's still exactly the same person he was in season one.\\n\\n\r\nWith this lack of development in established characters, however, comes one phenomenal use of character development in that of Satone Shichimiya. Even though Rikka obviously has more camera time in Heartthrob, I'd go as far as saying that Satone is the true focal point of this series. She is the sole character whose struggle is relatable and realistic. The final arc places her in a situation that viewers dread for the entire series and it's absolutely heartbreaking. But the tough part is you can't even get upset about it because realistically, we all know that Yuuta and Rikka are the couple that actually belong together. This scenario -- the whole love triangle ultimatum thing -- is something that happens to many people throughout middle school and high school. I know I made various connections to my personal life throughout this sequel. If anything, Chuunibyou Heartthrob does a great job exemplifying that and just that.\\n\\n\r\nIn Summary:\\n\r\nLove, Chunibyou, and Other Delusions! Heartthrob is not as enjoyable as its prequel, but it is more emotionally stirring and relatable. The comedy is bright and quirky, the characters are exquisitely memorable, and the addition of Satone Shichimiya is a much-needed wake up call for the Chunibyou series. Though character development in pre-existing characters has been tossed on the backburner, there are still plenty of moments in Heartthrob that fans of season one would be delighted to see. I'd mark both this and the prequel down as essential viewing material for all slice-of-life fans, both new and old.",

Didn't update my anime list though.\r\nAnyway back to reason for me in writing this review.\r\nI love the series as a whole. Cuteness, battle sequence, comedy AND YES THE ROMANCE.  \r\nTaking a quick look on the first season, it ended perfectly. Some people say it should've just ended there. I considered what they've said though because it was a really cute and nice ending for the series, not gonna lie.\r\nBut for me, the story didn't feel the \"end\". If we're gonna base on age, the story felt \"young\".\\n\r\nWhat do I mean by \"young\"? You're young which means you have a lot of choices to take. You're not just gonna stay on that exact place even though you're already happy with it.\\n\r\nYes that is what I've felt on the story. No not just the story but the series as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nNow here we go on S2, where they sliced up some part of the past of Yuuta including his past relationship with Shichimiya therefore leading to a love triangle where it caused slowdown to relationship between Rikka and Yuuta.\\n\r\nI must say that this is a good way to not rush too much on the story, but we all know it is a common thing though.\\n\\n\r\nI think some people just wanted to see where it will lead to that's why they disliked it. Kisses? Higher Contract? Marriage?  I guess I can understand what they're pointing. It is just the story will feel too rushed when those were done already. Just like what Yuuta said in the last episode, they didn't need to rush to change.\\n\\n\r\nI hope some people see what I'm trying to point at, because some people just straightly wanted to expect the obvious therefore leading to disappointment or dislike. \\n\\n\r\nWrapping up my review, the story is good. It just slowed down a bit when we're talking about their relationship. Art is good. Comedy is good. Yes, the cuteness is always there and must be there whenever season 3 arrives. Sound, I don't have any problem with that. Characters, well don't remove Rikka on the next one or I'll regret everything I just said. We're talking about Chuunibyou syndrome right? Not just the romance itself, so the battle sequence is just really badass and of course cute.\\n\\n\r\nWell I guess we'll see what will happen in season 3. Story didn't end right there, not a cliffhanger but that didn't practically felt the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rate: 9/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Firstly, I would like to point out that most of the reviews on here are all negative and it's understandable. Secondly, I apologize beforehand if you find any spelling mistakes or wrong names. I'm very bad at remembering names..\r\nYes the first season was better but the second season had some strong moments too.\r\nSTORY: \r\nWell the story itself at first is a little jumpy, we don't see it truly come to light until episode 6. The main focus is development of Rikka's and Yuuta's love life and the Chunnibyou syndrome. For one I actually got emotional in the last few episodes because I felt that \"YesI want more, but it feels so pure\" You wanted more lovey-dovey stuff? Go watch something else because this is demonstrating-for me- pure highschool love. And even the characters themselves hint at this, such as the dirty jokes between Nibutani and Dekomodi about \"higher contract\" etc. As for other plots in the anime, It was quite humorous to watch and to be honest I was enjoying this thoroughly and marathoned it in less than 12 hours~\\n\r\nYes, basically the story was mainly focused on developing, maybe slowly-true, the love life but it is sweet to see that \"Yes they did truly choose each other\" it was strengthening that Contract.\\n\r\nNow, one thing that bugged me constantly was the forced Love triangle.\\n\r\nOkay, bringing in a new character is fare and simple but I felt it was very forced. Let me explain in characters.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nI've always loved the characters in Chuunibyou they are all so cute and unique and the voice seiyuus match the characters perfectly. My favourite character is Dekomori and in this 2nd season I became even more in love with Rikka and Nibutani. Rikka is just adorable and you can't deny it, she really puts out her effort that she really does love Yuuta's and that strong connection is what makes her such a powerful female lead. \\n\r\nNibutani always made me laugh in this season, her way of denying her Mori Summer and always trying to keep cool really brought a smile to my face Everytime.Dekomori was as cute and mischievous and rowdy as ever and I love that about her. Characters that are upbeat always hit top marks with me. \\n\r\nThe other characters all have a role to play in the show, yes even Ishikki who is always forgotten~\\n\r\nBut now, I want to talk about the new character.\\n\r\nThe magician devil girl Sophia or her earthly name Shichimiya.\\n\r\nI did not like this character. For one, like I said before the love triangle with her cutting into Rikka and Yuuta's love life made me agonized Everytime she interfered.\\n\r\nShe also did not feel like a very strong character. I could tell just by her laugh that she was lieing to herself.\\n\r\nBut this is still very human as is all of this anime, it's what the essence of Chuunibyou is-\"Escaping Reality\".\\n\r\nAnd yes she did want just that as did any other of the 8th grade syndrome characters. So yes I hated her but I understand her.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & SOUND:\\n\r\nWell, after getting so caught up in the story and characters I usually never care for whether the music or animation is top notch. I'm usually someone who watches the ending and openings once then just skips them so it's very hard for me to critique this. But the animation was beautiful especially the action scenes I always felt like I was immersed into them-I could picture it actually happening~\\n\r\nSome flaws would be those close camera shot pans with the faces it looked..a little odd at times- but it's hard for them to get everything right. They work so hard for us fans anyways.\\n\r\nAs for the sound the opening song was really good and I enjoyed it more than the ending one. However, I can't really be a judge of sound as i never pay it mind much.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nOkay, Lastly I definetely enjoyed this. I'm sorry if you don't like his anime and see it for it's good merits. I laughed, I cried, I sat on the edge of my seat and felt anger, jelousy and annoyance while watching. These emotions are all good reason why I feel that the sequel does deserve some respect and does prove to be a great anime~ The first season was better but I feel bias is unnecessary for this sequel. \\n\r\nCompared to other sequels such as Clannad:After Story and Little Busters:Refrain where you see the stronger developments instead- this is a sequel that seems to just highlight the after events and prove the love formed in the first season. \\n\r\nWith that, I shall end my review. I hope this helps understand a little more of the good sides of this sequel~\\n\r\nThanks for Reading \\n\\n\r\nRating 9/10 (Due to dislike of one of the characters)\\n",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*\r\nIf I could choose, I'll choose the first season, and also, I regret watched this show, I like the first season instead the second one. Why? Well, many things make me say that. And I also expect more nice story than the first season but my hope just too high.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe first season and the second one story is almost same, I hope this season is more focused to Togashi and Rikka relationship, but I only find it a little. The story is only focused on their daily life. Some episodes make me bored and paused it for some days, butI manage to watch it again. Well, I hope the producers make a better story if they planned to make a new series again.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art and the animation is great, the blur, the camera zoom, all is great. No complain from me, keep up the good work.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe OP and ED sound is nice, the background music is nice, especially in romance scene, it just quiet and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10\\n\r\nThis is the worst part here. I just think that they shouldn't added Shichimiya, since she didn't have many role here. Togashi and Rikka's relationship only increased a little, the last episode is nice but why they disturb them about Chimera things?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nI just didn't enjoyed this season like the first season, Ren is more worst, why they make a new season if the quality is bad, I just didn't like Ren. Also, some jokes aren't make me laughing like the first season, but I still like it tho.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's your choice want to watch this anime or not, but it still not that bad, if you like a slow paced anime and focused on comedy, this one is perfect for you. And I also like the girls, they're so cute. Well, it's enough I think, so see you on another review.",

            "content": "MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD:\r\nTo start this review off, I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed season one of Chuunibyou. While I did like the first season, it makes me absolutely heartbroken that I cannot recommend season two even to die-hard fans. However, I don\u2019t think that watching this season was a waste of time at all.\r\nStory:\r\nIn this season, the plot is centered around the relationship that Yuuta and Rikka have built together in season one. While their romantic relationship grows very slowly and while people criticize it for being childish and immature, I honestly thought the romance between them was, at times, well-paced. Theirmoments together feel genuine and don\u2019t seem entirely out of place. However, Shichimiya, a chuunibyou and former friend of Yuuta\u2019s, appears and develops feelings for Yuuta. I don\u2019t entirely mind this love triangle that they're trying to push for in this season. It could have been done well, but the fact of the matter is that it wasn\u2019t. The main problem with Shichimiya\u2019s story is that her romantic plot is rushed. If they gave the romance more time to fully develop, then I think it could have had a meaningful impact on the viewer. Instead, the romance plot almost immediately leaves after it is introduced and it feels as if there was no real resolution. I liked where Shichimiya\u2019s story was going, so it hurt to see it abruptly end on an inconclusive note.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAside from Ishikki becoming a punching bag for awful jokes and also becoming non-existent in the story, the characters this time around aren\u2019t terrible. There is a bit of growth shown in the relationship between the characters in this show. My only real confusion comes from Nibutani\u2019s character. In the first season, she was totally against the idea of reverting back to her old chuunibyou self. While reverting back to her old self was justified one time (oddly), she unnecessarily reverts back to Morisummer twice: once to fight off Rikka\u2019s sister and another time to simply talk to Shichimiya with both times leaving no impact. Other than that, the characters are pretty good. Well, maybe except that whole episode where Kumin and the gang enter a sleeping competition (I kid you not).\\n\\n\r\nMusic and Sound:\\n\r\nIf you pay attention to the background music, it\u2019s actually really well done. If the scenes, in which they were played, were complementary to the music, the season could have had the potential to be amazing. The sound design is also worth mentioning. The sound design\u2019s best moments are shown off during the action scenes and every sound effect is impactful.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\r\nBeing the sequel to the first season, the art and animation is of course just as good and, at times, better. The art and animation shows its true potential during the action scenes and it never disappoints. Outside of the action scenes, the art and animation is of pretty sound quality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAs I have said before, I cannot recommend this season to just anybody who liked season one. Aside from the filler sleeping contest episode, the obliteration of Ishikki\u2019s character, and Shichimiya\u2019s rushed romantic plot, this season wasn\u2019t awful. I\u2019m glad I saw this season because, besides all of its flaws, it's the same show with (mostly) the same characters you know and love.\\n",

            "content": "Chuunibyou is back and it's...well, I hope you really liked season 1...This picks up right after Slapstick Noel (a Christmas special episode, very cute!). Yuta and Rikka are an item (Lover's Contract or something like that) and so hilarity ensues. She even lives in the same place as Yuta! \r\nThe story got a low score, and while I'm probably being rather harsh, I'm comparing it to the caliber of what was in season 1 storywise. Where Rikka was an interesting character before, she is reduced to a whiny, jealous little girl over time. Despite Yuta practically being a SAINT to her through all her crap,she just makes you dislike her more and more over time. By the end of the season you almost want them to break up. The finale is touching, but by then you almost want Rikka to disappear. On the plus side, we get THE funniest Dekomori + Nibutani episode of the entire two seasons during this series. Trust me, you'll know it when you see it. Aside from this, the first episode seemed to have a lot of promise but it just falls flat after that. Where's the emotional content of the first season? Where's the mix of comedy and serious that makes you respect and love the characters? Not here...but unless you REALLY liked season 1, you probably won't finish season 2. \\n\\n\r\nArt is great, same as before. Very crisp and imaginative, not much else to say that I haven't said in the original review. They got a perfect score on this for continuity and for it being so rockin' to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nEh, theme music wasn't much better than the previous one. Voice acting was ok, but Sophia's cackle made me want to scream and cover my ears. It was definitely a good job, just bits here and there that stood out. Not much to say regarding this as it's about on par with season 1. \\n\\n\r\nSo here's another lower score. While we do get a great Dekomori episode, not much happens in character development, Rikka more or less regresses to the point of disliking her towards the end. Sophia is an interesting character, but exists as a sort of strange anti-antagonist. Her mere presence and friendship with Yuta drives Rikka nuts to an unreal level. The whole \"past love\" trope is to be expected, but even though Sophia couldn't be more supportive of Rikka than she is, it still turns into argument fodder for Yuta and Rikka. You almost want an episode devoid of either of them just to get a break. \\n\\n\r\nWhile there are many marks against it for me, it was still watchable if you are a Chuunibyou fan (I have Dekomori and gothic Rikka figurines if that tells you anything lol). We do get some good episodes here and there, but not as consistent as the first season. Even the serious parts towards the end of season 1 were still enjoyable and good because you cared about the characters so much. Season 2 ended up like an anime version of Saved by the Bell for 24/7 cosplayers. Gross...\\n\\n\r\nThis season has some SUPER funny moments, but compared to the previous season they are too few and far in-between. Some humor instead of cliche shoujo romance trash would be great. I'm not opposed to Shoujo Rom-Coms either, I loved Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun, Kuragehime was fantastic too! This show just took something it was and forsook it to try something it wasn't, the great blend from season 1 just isn't here. It's still worth watching if you are a big Chuunibyou fan, but I don't recommend starting here. The progress between Yuta and Rikka is nominal at best, so just tell yourself they get closer and skip it if you don't have time to devote to this season. If you're a Dekomori fan like me, watch the episode where Nibutani is running for class president (if I recall correctly), it's worth it. Might want to pass on the rest though. Could have been way better, best kept to hardcore fans.",

            "content": "First, I gotta throw this out: Chuunibyou is one of my favourite series of all time so there may be a slight hint of bias in the following review. Just a bit.\r\nOkay, let's begin.\r\nBefore any actual review of Chu-2, I just want to mention that Chu-1 was very good, in terms of story, art, characters, everything. One thing that bugged me a bit was the depressing side in the final episodes. I realise that whole topic is depressing but it didn't fit in a lot with the beginning. I was missing the comedic and romantic undertones near the end; it seemed like a drama instead,not that there's anything wrong with drama (some I love) but it's not what Chu-1 was supposed to be: a rom-com. Nevertheless, Chu-1 was very good and I gave it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nOn to Chu-2. I thought KyoAni didn't do that bad of a job as everyone else seems to believe. Sure, some of the aspects like little visual effects were lacking in the second season, but that's small talk. What really matters is the story, art, sound, characters, and overall enjoyment of the show, which I think Chu-2 flourishes in.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9/10\\n\r\nMaybe it's that the story was a little complicated or had a lacklustre final goal. Maybe it's just that other people aren't smart enough to find the hidden meanings. Of course, MAL condones spoilers, as does the rest of the community, so I can't really elaborate on the metaphors and hidden meanings, but Yuuta's Dark Flame Dragon may be a little more obvious that you think... only the contract holder can awaken it. Shichimiya's battle is pretty straightforward as well. Whatever the case may be, Chu-2 did a really good job in selling the story and moving the plot forward. True, they did use less comedy in the second season, but it's because I was so attached to the characters from Chu-1 that I enjoyed the second season more.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nSmooth animation, nice visuals, nothing out of the ordinary from KyoAni.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nIt's kind of expected with a Slice of Life anime. The art and sound can only go so high because most scenes are limited to normal everyday activities. However, because Rikka and Shichimiya transport themselves to the other dimension, stuff like the sound effects have an edge on their other SoL rivals. However, seeing as how this is a continuation of the first season, there wasn't much change in the sound effects or the OP's and ED's. To be completely honest, they were plain and not really that memorable. But they still work with the mood of Chu-2 so the opening and ending songs are pretty solid and on par with the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10 (completely bias-free)\\n\r\nLike I mentioned earlier, I'm attached to some of the characters from Chu-1. First, I'll start with my favourite carry-overs: Nibutani (Mori Summer-chan), Dekomori (Mjollnir Hammer-chan), Rikka (Tyrant Eye-chan), and even Ms Serious Tooka. I also liked Kuzuha, despite her lack of screen time. In Chu-2, Rikka was still the same, Nibutani became even more likeable, Dekomori was still the annoying first year with no respect, and Tooka got even less screen time so she kinda fell off my listing for Chu-2. Rikka is so cute and shy, it's adorable (that ahoge tho...).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I rated Chu-2 a 9/10 because of its lighthearted tone and awkward romantic motifs. It's definitely relatable, which I think boosts my rating.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it, not really sure why people are rating it lower than a 7. It deserves a 9 every time. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed Chu-2 and would definitely welcome a season 3 with open arms.",

There is also not much of a story line to this season as there was in the first series.\r\nWhat I do like however is the colours and art. This style of anime is absolutely the best in my opinion and basically outweighs everything else.\r\nSoall in all I would say this season is 7/10.",

            "content": "After the string of disappointments this show has given me, I felt as though I wanted to write a review to tell others to stop after season 1.\r\nStory (5/10):\r\nThe main concept of the story is carried over from season 1, which happens to appeal to me. The problem is that Ren now decided to add in an unnecessary and unwanted new character, but never developed the romance which was supposed to be the focus of season 2. It's an example of one of the worst teased romances out there.\r\nArt (7/10):\r\nThe art is just as good as season 1. (For those who have not seen season1: It is smooth, colorful, but average.) The problem is that it does not use goofy exaggerations in the art to drive the jokes home, as it did in the previous series.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\r\nNothing special to say here other than the ending was charming enough to make me re-watch it a few time. Other than that, everything did it's job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10):\\n\r\nWhat can I say? I love the characters in Chunni. The problem here is that they added a character from Yuuta's middle school to mess with the progressing romance and explain how Yuuta exactly got the \"eighth grade syndrome\". We did NOT need that. He already said that he got it from \"too much anime\", which I'm sure made him a little more relatable to some people here. What is not relatable to many is a high school harem (which does form). If it is relatable... I envy you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10):\\n\r\nI ended up enjoying it less and less as it progressed. Do not be fooled by the possibility of an actual romance or by the decent first few episodes. It's not worth it. This is a great example of an anime that you can drop after season 1.",

            "content": "Some people thought that the sequel to Chuunibyou is one of the worst anime from Kyoto Animation and some people like me thought this was a pretty average/decent show. \r\n(There will be slight SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (6.5/10) (SPOILERS)\r\nDue to unforeseen circumstances, Yuuta and Rikka are now living together. Yuuta, who never even went out with a normal girl is worried on how to advance his relationship with Rikka and then everyone else has moved up a grade. Furthermore, a girl who calls herself \"Sophia Ring Saturn the 7th\" makes an appearance. \r\nThe story of the 2nd season picks up from the first season whereYuuta and Rikka are now a couple and are now living together..Wait a minute? Story? What story? Compared to the first season, this season basically has no plot at all. This season shows us what Rikka and Yuuta (plus the rest of the characters) are doing now that they are a couple. I can highly say that the sequel was highly unneeded and unnecessary but it is a treat that KyoAni gave to the fans or big fans of the first season. They're like \"You want to see how the couple and the rest of the characters are doing? Then here ya go!\".\\n\\n\r\nIn the first season, the first half was lighthearted and full of comedy and the second half, the tone was changed, the atmosphere gets serious and the show got dramatic. In this season however, pretty much almost all the episodes are lighthearted and comedic. In fact, the light-hearted/comedic atmosphere is revamped here. There are still dramatic moments in the show but compared to the first season, it's not a lot. \\n\\n\r\nWhile reading the synopsis, you would think that Yuuta and Rikka's relationship would really advance but it didn't happen. In fact, 90% of the show is just your typical Kyoto Animation high school scenes, the 6% is dedicated to their relationship and the final 4% is the love triangle between Yuuta, Rikka and Satone (Stats pulled right out of my ass).God, not only is the love triangle horrible but it's unnecessary, it's so cliche and it's only purpose is to \"advance\" the relationship between Yuuta and Rikka. In other words, a grand excuse to advance their relationship.. I really REALLY don't want to say this but Satone seems more like a plot device to me even though she's one of the best characters I've ever seen and she's my favourite character in the series.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the romantic development between Yuuta and Rikka is almost non-existant, I still enjoyed the show because of the lighthearted/comedic atmosphere of the show which I loved in the first season. There's more Sanae and Nibutani arguments, though I loved that episode where Sanae and Nibutani got along, more Chuunibyou battle scenes, Kumin is somehow a lot better in this season compared to the previous season and basically more of everything that I found hilarious in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, the second season of Chuunibyou is just a \"kawaii\", moe, slice-of-life high school show where almost nothing happens. Though I gotta admit, I did enjoy the second season for it's fun atmosphere. When it comes to story, however, the first season is better. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nKyoto Animation and their animation...What's there to talk about? Ever since they made Haruhi Suzumiya, their animation has been the second best in the anime industry, just behind ufotable and after Madhouse. The 2nd season of Chuunibyou is no exception. The Chuunibyou battle scenes looks way better than the first season, it's more fluent, and more smoother. The background has more lighting and the character designs looks almost the same as the previous season. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nJust like my previous review, the OST that I will only talk about are the battle themes. The battle themes in the first season was amazing and in here, it's more improved. The battle themes are like those themes you hear on a RPG/JRPG game. Smooth and amazing (Chuunibyou) Battle scenes with an amazing battle theme playing in the background..KyoAni could became a video game company. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"VOICE\" by ZAQ and the ED theme song is \"Van!shement Th!s World\" by Rikka Takanashi, Shinka Nibutani, Kumin Tsuyuri, and Sanae Dekomori. The OP theme song for this season is now one of my favourite anime openings. Not only is the OP theme song great but the OP animation is so goddamn great. I'm talking about the part where Rikka and Satone fighting in a battle. It's obvious that so much money and manpower was poured in the OP animation. I also love the ED theme song because it's catchy. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (7.5/10)\\n\r\nSince I already talked about the characters in my previous Chuunibyou review, I'll only talk about the new character and briefly talk about the rest of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nSatone Shichimiya or \"Sophia\" for short is the new main character introduced in this season. I prefer calling her Sophia because it's easier to remember, easier to write and easier to say. Sophia also has a Chuunibyou and turns out that she is a childhood friend of Yuuta. Well, I guess that proves that Yuuta wasn't a complete loner when he was suffering from Chuunibyou. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, after watching this season..Sophia is now my new favourite character in the series, kicking Sanae out of my \"Number One Favourite character in Chuunibyou\". She's just better in every conceivable way. Her personality is great and hilarious, her laugh is awesome and infectious (my younger sister is now imitating her laugh and it's annoying the shit out of me), and her appearance is perfect. Not that her appearance has anything to do with why I like her character. Too bad she was used only as a plot device to try and strengthen the relationship between Yuuta and Rikka. I would have preferred her being independent and not being involved in a love triangle. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are mostly the same but of course, with some changes. Yuuta is trying to figure out how to advance his relationship with Rikka but of course, you barely see him do that because much of the show is focused on the characters fooling around instead of focusing on the goddamn relationship development. Rikka Takanashi barely develops in this season which is a disappointment because I loved her character development in the first season. Nibutani and Sanae still constantly fights, though I loved seeing them get along even if it was only for 1 episode. Finally, Kumin is a lot more likable in this season. She still sleeps a lot but she also talks more in this season and she also has more of an active role in this season. Kumin felt like a side character in the previous season whereas in this season, it felt like she was an actual main character.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nI would be lying to myself if I said that I completely hated this season due to a lack of plot and relationship development. I'm also a fan of slice-of-life so seeing the characters fooling around and having Chuunibyou battle was quite enjoyable for me. I mean, that's where Kyoto Animation is good at..The slice-of-life genre. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shita Ren\" is just a \"kawaii\", moe, slice-of-life high school anime series that Kyoto Animation is known for. Compared to the first season, the plot and the relationship development is very lacking. Although, if you're a fan of slice-of-life like me then you might enjoy this season..I definitely enjoyed this season due to the lighthearted/comedic atmosphere. Otherwise, you'd be very disappointed with the 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (7.3/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Second Season can be enjoyed by slice-of-life fans and big fans of the previous season\\n\r\n+Comedy is a lot better\\n\r\n+Smoother and More Consistent Animation than the previous season\\n\r\n+Better Soundtrack/Better OP theme song\\n\r\n+\"Sophia\" is a likable character\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Lack of plot\\n\r\n-Lack of relationship development\\n\r\n-Love triangle\\n\r\n-\"Sophia\" introduced as a plot device only",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nNow the trouble with making a sequel is trying to outdo the first series and despite this series still being good it wasn't as good as the first series.\r\nThe story continues with Yuuta and Rikka who are now together in a relationship, but they are also living together too, unbeknownst to them an old acquaintance of Yuuta's has moved in upstairs and it will create problems that will test Yuuta and Rikka's bond.\r\nNow the story was still enjoyable and focused more on the Romance aspect this time by concentrating on the relationship between Yuuta and Rikka who they themselves have no idea whatto do while also considering it's a Chunnibyou relationship which makes it very strange and difficult to make work in the first place.\\n\r\nThe story decides to become a bit a love triangle which most of the time don't go well for me and in this it was half and half I liked some things, but didn't like other things, but it the outcome of it was done well.\\n\r\nYou also get to see more development between the characters too especially Dekomori and Nibutani who have to overcome problems of their own.\\n\r\nIt was interesting how events unfolded themselves and how the situation would actually become very emotional for some of the characters and I liked how they were able to overcome some of the changes and emotions that they were going through.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters continued to be a great source of entertainment for me, but with the introduction of new characters it meant some of the others would get less screentime.\\n\r\nYuuta and Rikka continued to be on opposite sides even though they are now together however Yuuta has actually started sliding back into his Chunnibyou side while also trying to keep up with the person that he was trying to be at the beginning of the first season and Rikka continues to be mischievous, but she is more aware of the people around her and cares for them much more now that they have become closer friends and now that she is in a relationship with Yuuta it creates some really adorable moments.\\n\r\nA new character who has been introduced called Satone Shichimiya who has the alias of Sophia Ring Saturn the 7th is Yuuta's previous companion when he was a Chunnibyou in middle school and she has decided to continue being one, she is much like Rikka only more hyper and louder with her words who causes the form of the love triangle to happen, however she seemed like a fun character and she didn't really annoy me in any way.\\n\r\nDekomori and Nibutani also grow as characters despite still arguing with each other there is a point where someone who looks like Nibutani tries to impersonate as Mori Summer which of course creates a rift between the two characters, but they work it out in the end and it really shows how much their friendship has grown. \\n\r\nEven Kumin herself gets some action by saving the club at what she does best in a sleeping competition and her friendship with Rikka has also caused her to become more a Chunnibyou too.\\n\r\nYou even get to see more supporting characters like Cento who is the daughter of Tooka's head Chef in Italy which gives Tooka more of a motherly appearance in this series, however the only downside for the characters is how Makoto is used in series 1 he actually had quite an impact on the group now he is just around getting a lot of bad luck which really makes his character forgettable in this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle continued to be great with the Chunnibyou battles getting more focus this series and having some interesting types of battles taking place instead of just imaginative weapons being hurled around there was a stamina like element like when they were having the sleeping competition with another club or when Satone was battling the Dark Flame Dragon which looked amazing. The intro and outro compared to the first season is also not done as well it was still fun to listen just not done as good.\\n\\n\r\nThe Romance in this series was done well I enjoyed how the relationship developed between Yuuta and Rikka even though the relationship was strange it was really adorable and cute especially during the final episode which just made feel very good on the inside,the love triangle that formed when Satane entered the picture didn't really ruin the show as Satane also had a crush on Yuuta in the past and the way the Love triangle was settled was actually done pretty well compared to other anime's I have seen in the past.\\n\r\nThe comedy was once again hilarious with the shenanigans that the group got up too making for some quality entertainment like the continuing rivalry between Dekomori and Nibutani or some moments between Yuuta and Rikka who despite trying they best to have a loving relationship the way they sometimes do things was just really funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a fun sequel not as good as the first series, but it was good enough so if you enjoyed the first season you'll probably enjoy the second season too.",

However, calling it a sequel, or a second season, or  really anything but a superfluous spinoff doesn't feel accurate. \r\nThe first season of Chuunibyou started off under the impression of being yet another quirky moe-infused romantic slice of life highschool comedy shoveled off the festering pile that is the anime industry's recent lapse in creativity. What it turned out to be was a delightfully zany romantic comedy with some refreshingly mature themes, which were handled in a refreshingly unique way.  Itchanged up the stale moe-infused SoL formula of cute-girls-doing-cute-things-in-a-cute-way by adding equal parts fun and imagination, giving us cute-girls-doing-fun-things-in-an-imaginative-way (or delusional way, if you prefer). \\n\\n\r\nThe second season\u2014 excuse me, I mean the substance-devoid spinoff\u2014 attempts to capture the success of the first season without bothering with the things that made it good to those of us who aren't satisfied just watching cuteness for the sake of cuteness.  The problem lies in the fact the first season of Chuunibyou demo koi ga Shitai was largely inspired by the light novel Aura: Maryuuinkouga Saigo no Tatakai, from which it borrows its more serious themes. The second season, on the other hand, is inspired entirely by  the desire to make money.  Not only did they shelve the mature themes of the first season, but also the romance, and they veritably backpedaled over everything that came before in order to adhere to a trite formula of nonsensical whimsy. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance between Yuuta and Rikka is reduced to something even less substantial than the first season, as we are led to believe that in all the time they've been dating, they haven't kissed or even held hands. Their \"romance\" is lost so deeply in the friend-zone that any attempt at developing it is, to the viewer, like watching a quadriplegic sprinter at the Special Olympics.  They did this so it would seem like they still have somewhere to go with the relationship, but the show tries so hard not to develop anything, and to always end each episode on the same note it started, that we are left with nothing but aimless zaniness.  Sadly, that zaniness gets stale after a while, as it's just a repetition of things we've already seen over a dozen times in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a recurring theme of characters embracing and accepting their adolescent delusions, rather than just broiling in shame and rolling on the floor in classic Chuunibyou fashion, but considering this is nothing that wasn't handled with the end of the first season, it's as unnecessary as everything else in this season. \\n\\n\r\n There is the hint of a potential conflict with the introduction of Yuuta's childhood friend Satone, but the show tries so hard not to present any serious conflict to get in the way of the meandering cuteness that she is reduced to an occasional gimmick of making Rikka jealous. This conflict is always quickly resolved\u2014 as in, immediately\u2014so that nobody has to suffer the discomfort of any aspect of the show changing.  And that refusal to change is how the entire second of season of Chuunibyou can be summed up... because nothing really happens. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that refusal to change can probably be blamed as much on the audience as the producers. Prior to the show's airing, it became public knowledge that a certain character, Nibutani, underwent a makeover, altering her appearance. Backlash was so strong that after the pilot episode, they immediately altered her back and acted as though nothing ever happened.  They treated it like their own 8th grade delusion: an embarrassment to be forgotten. The problem with this is, that first episode made it clear the change was not simply a random aesthetic one; characters noted it, she retained her original appearance in the opening and in a delusional fight scene, and the change was obviously intended to contribute to Nibutani's story in some way, as part of her campaign for student council president. The arc was probably planned to revolve around her superficial concern with how she appears to other people, as that would fit well with her image conscious character. How's that for irony?  But otaku don't like change, especially when it affects hair color and skirt length, so everything was made the way it had been in the previous season, and nobody had to fear any changes after that. Because nothing happened. Thus we get a cute show about cute girls doing fun things in a delusional way. And that's it.  No mature themes, no conflict, no development. Just an adorable orgy of moe.\\n\\n\r\nThese complaints are addressed, in part, toward the end of the series, when the conflict hinted at in the synopsis is finally develops a little, but it's both too late and too little. No serious threat is posed to the relationship between Yuuta and Rikka anymore than any substantial development transpires in the relationship between Yuuta and Rikka.  We get a little bit of emotional conflict for a new character, which leaves zero emotional impact on an old viewer.  \\n\\n\r\nFor those who enjoy the genre just for what it is, and just want to watch cute girls being adorable and occasionally going into delusional super battles, slide tackling each other, and rolling on the floor, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren still delivers.  The animation is high quality and the bevy of adorable characters are hard not to love even for stony-hearted old goats. The music is fitting, though nothing that stands out from the genre, and the upbeat OP does an excellent job setting the mood for the ride you're about to take. But a brief fun ride is all you're going to get, so if you're looking for an actual sequel or extension to the first season, with the same depth and impact, this isn't it, and you will be disappointed. \\n",

            "content": "\"Oh, a second season!\"\r\nThis is my expression when I heard that chuunibyou will have a second season. \r\nChuunibyou Ren is a second season of \"Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!\" produced by Kyoto Animation (Hyouka, Free!, Clannad) that debuted in 2012. Chuunibyou Ren got many attention thanks to the popularity of the first season. The series became popular because of it's unusual theme (chuunibyou syndrome for example) and many other potential things. But, how about Chuunibyou Ren? Is it better than the first one?\r\nMy answer is no.\r\nThe story itself is actually the continuation of the series. But, I felt that the story is rather a sidestory or maybe expanded story of what happen with our beloved character. The plot wasn't move at all because of the character struggle to keeping the chuunibyou syndrome or loving someone normally. The main problem is Satone Shicimiya, a character that isn't necessary at all. She's just there to make a forced conflict between Yuuta, Rikka and She of course. All of the character are still acted Chuunibyou as well. The little conflict from first season showed up again in the second season, like conflict between Nibutani and Dekomori for example. Every episode had different story to tell like school trip, fake person, etc. But sadly, it makes the story not focused on the main plot at all. That's why I called the second season just like a side story or expanded story. The story isn't going anywhere. Some of you maybe watch chuunibyou because of it's epic chuuni battle that's really out of mind like the first season. Well, get ready to disappointed because there are not much chuuni battle in the second season or maybe I can call it not as epic as the first season. At least for romance comedy, the romance between our main character got developed even not much and also the comedy still hilarious as always. The balance between drama, romance, and comedy are structured well in the series.\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation popular because of it's high quality anime especially in the artwork. The artwork of chuunibyou were really typical for Kyoto Anmation especially in the character design. They always used moe-style character that's really fit with the genre. The background was rich and colorful with some CGI that well blended with the hand drawing that makes it fascinating. The artwork of chuuni battle also somewhat interesting and always waited in every episode. The battle artwork showed us that Chuunibyou is not a regular romance comedy, It can be mecha and action as well. The chuuni world, the action explosion, the weapon design are just really fit the theme.\\n\\n\r\nOf course if there is epic battle, it can't be epic if the music is just plain music. The music itself almost half of it were already existed in the first season but KyoAni knew that. So, they updating the music with new tune and fresh music. The only problem is the OST are not much used especially the battle OST. When I watched the first battle, the OST were epic but, I'm not heard it again until the end of the series. The voice actor and actress really fit with the character and they really know the habit, chuuni, and expressions of the character especially for Juri Nagatsuma (Satone) that I think the VA is as good as the first season. The OP \"VOICE\" by ZAQ really describe what is romance with a shaking animation that's very rare to see and the ED \"Van!shment Th!s World\" by Black Raison d'\u00eatre that's just like a regular ED but more ear-candy and addicting.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem of Chuunibyou Ren is, the characters are not as interesting as the first season, Isshiki for example. He is just there to make some laugh than, we forget about him. Another example is our new protagonist, Satone Shicimiya. Satone is a truly unnecessary character and her existence is actually can be necessary if Kyoto Animation can make her better with not just a character that's just there to make a regular conflict. Rikka and Yuuta got some development at their contract but still, it's not enough. Some other character like Nibutani, Dekomori, and Kumin also get a \"little\" development but, I felt that they're \"forced\" to get development.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Chuunibyou Ren is a series that you MAY missed this season and also, it taught me that a second season is not always needed or better. Because of it's weak story and lack of character development that are not too appealing, the series became worst than it's first season. It's very disappointing debut from Kyoto Animation. Well, I'm still can watch it until the end because I'm one of chuuni-fans and wanted to see more of them. I'm really recommend this just for someone who curious enough about what happened between our beloved character.",

            "content": "A few years back, Kyoani surprised me with a cute and strangely satisfying story about people who seemed to live in alternate realities. The sequel follows our protagonist, the Dark Flame Master, as he slowly but surely works through being in a relationship with someone whose reality is directly in conflict with the very idea of romance. While Rikka meanders her way through her feelings for Yuuta, a potential rival shows up in the form of Satone, Yuuta's middle school friend and partner in chuunibyou crime. Will this catalyze Rikka and Yuuta's relationship or throw it into disarray?\r\nIn general, a vast majority of shows thatI have high anticipation for seem to fall short, especially sequels. This kind of fits that bill as it isn't exactly what I was hoping for in the sequel. Yes, you still get the famous Kyoani moe and hilarious reactions from Nibutani but it's the same problem as in Seitokai Yakuindomo Bleep, it's just not fresh anymore. If you liked the original and want more of the same, then this would be a great fit. If you're hoping for developing relationships or interesting character back stories, you're only going to be partly satisfied. Nevertheless, despite not delivering everything that I had hoped for, this sequel is still a pretty decent watch and a good break from more serious shows.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation style is pretty similar to the original with overly moe characters and occasionally wacky imaginary fight scenes with pretty imaginative and epic backgrounds. We get a new twin-tailed addition to the cast but otherwise everyone is as you'd expect. In summary, expect more of the same of what was in the original.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI'm not sure I like the new OP as much as the original, it definitely shares elements but isn't as good of a melody. The ED is likewise not as distinct as the one in the first season. You do get a lot in insert songs as well as the original BGM, which by this point is sounding a little more distinctive. Sadly, there wasn't much innovation in this department.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of dialogue in this show and it's handled well. The strong VA cast returns for another silly, ridiculous ride. Since all the original characters are present from the get go, expect a lot more of Dekomori's \"death/DESu\"s. Juri Nagatsuma is relatively new but does a pretty good job as the new twin-tail.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAt the end of the last season, we faced a massive cliff-hanger/climax where Rikka had to choose her path. Unfortunately, the beginning of the show feels kind of like a reset to all of that. Despite the outrageous fact that Rikka now lives with Yuuta, and that Yuuta's family is MIA in Jakarta, apparently no relationship progress is being made. Furthermore, Rikka's chuunibyou is somehow now stronger than it ever was, to the point where Yuuta sometimes needs to go into \"Dark Flame Master\" mode to even communicate with Rikka.\\n\\n\r\nThere is very little focus in this season as it meanders between random themes such as visiting Dekomori's mansion and entering a napping competition to prevent the club from losing its room. The only real glue this season is Satone, who apparently moves into where Rikka used to live. As her previous relationship with Yuuta becomes clearer, Rikka is finally forced to leave her odd comfort zone. This builds up to a fairly cute climax and conclusion though by no means as intense and cliff-hanger prone as the original show.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall is there relationship progress in this sequel? Yes. However, it's relatively sparse and really could have been condensed into just a few episodes. If you're going to watch this, I'd focus instead on the character interactions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nSpeaking of interactions, you can expect a lot of entertainment value out of the relationships in the show. Though sometimes over the top, the Dekomori and Nibutani relationship is pretty funny. Their love-hate relationship is explored in quite some depth and actually has a humorous sub-climax of its own. With Satone, we get a lot more background on the early days of the Dark Flame Master and an additional dosage of potential romantic development. It's kind of goofy though as both Satone and Rikka are challenged with balancing their chuunibyou with their actual feelings.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nOverall this was a good season. Not a great addition to the original but worth it if you liked the original premise. I guess if they were to take away the chuunibyou this would just be an ordinary show, though I think it would have been interesting to show a post-chuunibyou Rikka. Oh well, you'll just have to make do with Nibutani's embarrassment and shame.",

            "content": "So I came into this show from Season 1 (of course), and I ended up quite liking the show overall and even more so than the first season. Since in the first one I already hammered on the great musical score, the solid animations, and the well written characters, I'll only hammer home new occurrences, characters, or plot-lines. I think this can be best organized in what they avoided, what they embraced, and what they could have done better compared to the first season.\r\nWhat they Avoided: \r\nSo, my biggest fear coming out of the first season was that they'd try to continue with this \"tochunni or not to chunni\" plot-line. In addition, I was worried that the relationship between Yuta and Rikka would stagnate. To their credit they avoided both of these in ways I never even considered. For the avoiding chunni plot-line, this is handed over mostly to side characters as Yuta accepted his chunni tendencies in the first season. Through Dekomori and Mirosummer's arcs, you can get your fill of trying to leave your former self behind without feeling like the story is still slogged down in Season 1 arcs. For the relationship, I was surprised that they leaned into the \"this relationship is a very slow moving process.\" What surprised me even more is that they pulled it off. I was so endeared to this cutesy relationship where Rikka isn't sure how fast she wants to mood, but also compounded by a boyfriend who doesn't see the need to advance at all if they're happy. The relationship is a heartfelt and warming story that is definitely interesting to watch unfold.\\n\\n\r\nWhat they embraced:\\n\r\nRight of the bat they embraced the huge battles almost twofold. More battles and spectacle, and with the addition of the \"homewrecker magical girl\" side character it's apparent why. They also embraced the drama of the first season, but shifted from drama with the family to drama within the friend group. I was surprised with the introduction of a love triangle that didn't feel forced, however, it did feel unfortunate. Additionally I was surprised by some of the Yuri and even (towards the end) Yaoi undertones at the end of the series. They didn't seem too hamfisted at all, and actually came off pretty well in the context of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat they could have done better:\\n\r\nI'm not gonna lie, I loved the progression of the slow moving romance. However, if you get blueballs easily, you're gonna wanna avoid this show. Without spoiling too much, only one character really got any action this season, and it's an animal.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI'm placing this series higher than Season 1 only because I think it pulled off dodging all my fears I had for the sequel. It's probably higher than I'd put it on a personal enjoyment scale, but I think it deserves the 8 by sticking a landing while not playing it too safe. If you're looking for a cute romantic time filler, definitely check it out.",

And you don't even know what Yuuta is thinking because it seems he is just 'staring there' like nothing happends, he doesn't realise about anything and he has 0 development also, he only takes care of Rikka like a father and that is all, it's fucking boring\\n\\n\r\nThis second season just leaves you with a 'tasteless' feeling, Rikka remains with Yuuta but the anime showed all the time that Shichimiya should have been the one with Yuuta, it's truly a really really bad produced second season, Horrible, should have ended the anime with the one and that is all, fucking waste of time, thank you for ruined it.",

            "content": "I didn't expect the second season of Chuunibyou to be as good as the first. That's the case with a lot of anime most of the time. Still, despite this assumption beforehand, I was left disappointed after finishing the second season. It's not bad. It's good, but not even close to the first season.\r\nThe main problem with the second season of Chuunibyou is the story. It's not nearly as entertaining as the first season. The humor, while sometimes funny, misses the mark a lot. And the drama that unfolds in the series feels forced due to the inclusion of a new character, Satone Shichimiya. Ikept wondering why her character was part of this season. The only reason she existed was for drama, and not very good drama at that. Because of this, I was incredibly bored everytime she showed up on screen. \\n\\n\r\nThere is some character development when it comes to Rikka and Yuuta. They definitely grow from the first season. But when I say grow, I mean that in the slightest way. Anyone coming into the second season of Chuunibyou and wishing for a fulfilling ending will be disappointed. Is the ending satisfying? I guess, but it could've been so much better. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I enjoyed the second season of Chuunibyou, I don't really think there's any reason to go out and watch it. Honestly, if you just watch the first season and never watch this one, you will probably be more satisfied than putting time into this. Would only recommend to die hard KyoAni fans. Everyone else can skip this one.",

Although that is the the joke of the series, Yuuta acts more of a father to Rikka, taking care of her, making sure she does her homework, cooking her meals, until Yuuta's sister moves back in and fills in the mother role.  This season takes a bit of a step down from the first, Rikka and Yuutaare still together and although their relationship progresses very, very slowly, they are both happy living together and seeing each other everyday. Rikka is still lost when it comes to romance because all she knows is her delusions. She tries everything she can to get closer to Yuuta but doing so requires her to go outside her comfort zone. The whole series follows Rikka trying to awaken the Dark Flame Dragon in Yuuta because she believes this is strengthen their relationship and they will be able to become closer to one another. This season is sweet as Rikka struggles to understand love and become closer to Yuuta. Yuuta stays patient with her and assures her that no matter what he will only love her.",

            "content": "After watching the 1st season i was left with one question \" Why is this so popular ? \r\n1st season did little in the way of anything new or different and had some bad messages and morals. \r\n~~SPOILERS~~\r\nThe 2nd season doesn't really have these issues because almost nothing of interest happens throughout the season.\r\nThe two biggest selling points of this season are \r\n1. The two of them now living in one apartment \r\n2. One of the MC's old friend show's up.\r\nThe 1st problem is solved almost instantly within the two episodes making it entirely pointless. \r\nthe 2nd issue doesn't even become an actual problem tellnear the end and even then it seems rushed and ends on a sour note for me. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of having the MC's friend add anything of interest to this story she is just used as a way to move the \" PLOT\" Forward. \\n\\n\r\nI do actually really like this new character and in all honesty i feel that she is a better partner for the MC then Rikka is. Throughout the season we see that she had a friendly relationship with the MC in middle school and even had feelings for him. Not only is she just a better character then Rikka in my mind, But she is also one of the only fun characters to have on the screen. \\n\\n\r\nReally only 4 characters do i find fun now. That is Shichimiya, Dekomori, Kumin and Nibutani\\n\\n\r\nThey went and pretty much got rid of Isshiki. He was one of the best parts of the show last season and i liked the relationship between him and Kumin. But in this he is used rarely and has little to no screen time and they obviously don't progress the relationship with Kumin.\\n\\n\r\nDekomori in the 1st season could be annoying but when she was being funny she really was funny to have on screen and i really enjoyed it when she and Nibutani were together. The show does hint at them being a couple sometimes and in all honestly i would have loved that to be the main focus of the 2nd season.  \\n\\n\r\nNibutani was my favorite the 1st season and i'm hesitant to say she is still my favorite for the 2nd. But i did ship her and the MC together cause again they are just a better couple then the MC and Rikka. While i do ship her and Dekomori together i also am shipping her and Shichimiya together. \\n\\n\r\nShichimiya being the new character of the show doesn't bring a lot. She is mostly in the back while the first 6 or 7 episodes happen. She is just a better character then Rikka and in my opinion has better character development then Rikka. She also seems to be the only person who is aware of the difference between reality and fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nNow as you read that you can probably tell that i am not a big fan of Rikka. You might even be able to tell that i'm not a fan of the MC. \\n\\n\r\nRikka i just can't help but not find much enjoyment out of her. She was pretty good on the 1st season. But near the end of that i kind of started getting annoyed by it. The show constantly makes her being delusional about reality and fantasy charming. But it's not. If anything it's more just sad and depressing. \\n\\n\r\nYuuta is really just a typical MC harem but with some class. As i was watching this i finally realized that he is a lot like other MC's and has little of his own personality. I genuinely wish he wasn't the MC and and someone like Nibutani was the MC. \\n\\n\r\nBut while i was also watching this i realized that this show is kind of like a harem show. Sure Yuuta is dating some chick. But he does have a bunch of overly cute girls that always surround him. \\n\\n\r\nBiggest problem i still have with this entire series is that they don't try helping people with the * 8th Grade syndrome* Such as Rikka that even after all the time we spent on the 1st season, She is still just as delusional as she was in the start of the the 1st season. \\n\\n\r\nThis honestly annoys me because this isn't really healthy. Sure it might be charming and all. But when you think about that in 4 years when she is an adult and has to get a job that she is gonna be at a complete lost in society . Like i can't explain how annoying this is. Especially how the MC seems to just encourage her. \\n\\n\r\nOnly character i have liked throughout without fail is Rikka's sister.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly this 2nd season should have been about one thing. That is how the characters start waking up to reality and the emotional process they are going through. \\n\\n\r\nReally there was only 3 or 4 episodes i enjoyed and they were with Nibutani and Dekomori.\\n\\n\r\nCould have been such a good show but fails a ton and i am still baffled why this is such a high rating show.",

Dontget me wrong it makes sense since Rikka is so one tracked minded that she forgets that she cant act like a child all the time but- that shouldn't be Yuuta's job. \\n\\n\r\nthere were times however, when they made small baby steps in the relationship (with the help of the others obviously) but for the most part I was left saddened..especially at the end, and if you make it there, you'll probably also feel the same way.",

It is the same as the first season so there isn\u2019t much new there. However the animation felt a little different the further I got into the series. Overall it provides a charm that helps one really get into the feel of the show as a whole.\r\nThe story this time around is more focused on Yuta\u2019s interactions with a childhood friend, Satone Shichimiya, who helped fuel Yuta\u2019s Chunibyo in middle school. Not only that but this interactionseems to put Rikka on edge more often than not. As the quest to reawaken the Dark Flame Dragon that rests inside Yuta, The relationship between Rikka and him does grow.  So my only real gripe with this would be the inclusion of Satone seemed a little unnecessary at first. Her appearance was static at best and I felt that she was placed in the story to fill a hole that wasn\u2019t currently there. However as the story progressed, and she kept popping up where our friends happen to be and she becomes a vital member of the cast. I won\u2019t give anything away but there are some pretty important developments involving not only her, but Toka (Rikka\u2019s older sister) as well that aren\u2019t explored at much length and could have been. Ultimately it didn\u2019t hinder me from loving this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is as well put together as the first season. I absolutely loved the moments where there was so much emotion and just as a big moment happened, I would tense up, and the music would have a beautiful crescendo, and the moment would be made complete. Without the music, I don\u2019t know how I might have reacted to some situations, and I know for sure that I wouldn\u2019t have reacted in such an expressed manner, rather it would be more of a roller coaster rather than huge moments and big music. The openings and closing songs are good, but nothing to special. I found that the inclusion of the similar first screen of the opener, but with a different song was a bit of a let down. To me, the first seasons opening song fit so well with that scene and while the rest of the opening is drastically different, a better song could have been chosen. The ending credits, seemed to have a similar issue, it just couldn\u2019t capture the magic it had before.\\n\\n\r\nAfter seeing the first season, I was hooked. As I said in my review of that particular season, it took be back to a time where I dressed up and had magic of my own. But now I have grown up a bit and alas I have lost that power in a sense, but this show makes me want to go back. It teaches us that our past is something that shouldn\u2019t be forgotten necessarily, and moreover we should understand that the people we are now are going to be different than who we were back then. This is a show about coming to grips with the fact that everyone grows up and everyone has a past, weather we learn from it or not is what makes us who we are today. I love this show and everything about it. I love the way it makes me feel and I love the way it makes my head spin after I think about it awhile. With an ending that is both ambiguous enough to make you want to continue the journey with the Far East Magical-Napping Society Summer Thereof, it provides enough closer to know that whatever they go through together, they are going to be okay.",

            "content": "Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Didn't need a damn sequel it should have been left as is. The sequel ruins all the characters and comes up with this stupid drama that falls into romance cliches and harem anime, it uses the classic Girl A loves Boy A and Girl B also likes Boy A. \r\nStory: What the made the 1st season so interesting was the way it used 8th grade syndrome to actually be a coping method for the main girl because she went through something traumatic, the 2nd season completely ignores that goes straight for romance tropes and makes the story significantly less interesting.The 2nd season also falls under the same problems that season 1 had and it was basically the first 6 episodes felt like pure filler and comedy, this led to the first half being unbearable and annoying humor. There were parts that made me shout like a school girl because Yuuta and Rikka acuatlly did something and progressed their relationship. The story is a mess and felt unsatisfying (The ending is the worst part)\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's Kyoto animation typical moe shots, but the show is pretty overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I don't really care about music but in a drama and romance anime music matters and I think that the soundtrack did a decent job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Honestly I connected with most characters in the 1st season who had 8th grade syndrome because I know I used to parade around public wearing some cape or anything I remotely thought was cool and pretended to be my favorite superhero, which in my opinion is the reason Chuunibyou works so well is because it has relatable characters. Unfortunately the 2nd season kind of drops the whole syndrome thing and focuses on the romance between Yuuta and Rikka and that makes me infuriated because now I'm stuck watching two teenagers act all shy and confused for a whole 12 episodes and that's no fun what so ever. I also can't relate with anyone else anymore because their not the main focus and they don't have any good stories, like I'm stuck liking only Rikka and Yuuta because they've been developed and the viewer spends the most time with them and it's not like any other character stands out (I'm stuck with the napper, little kid who makes bad jokes, and the bitch who fights with the little girl for comedy) \\n\\n\r\nHonestly Chuunibyou is a show I thoroughly enjoyed and I feel like the 2nd season ruined that for me, now I have to pretend season 2 never even existed. Also don't even get me started on that Saturn chick because she's just there to add some new drama and wish fulfillment. Maybe if the show actually made any real progress I could have given this a 7/10 but I'm stuck giving it a 6 just because I liked the 1st season and there scenes that made me jump off my bed with excitement and joy. I recommend everyone forgets this season existed and move on with their lives.",

            "content": "This sequel is a shadow of its predecessor in almost all criteria besides the service; and even then said service is hit and miss throughout the show.\r\nContext: The first series I would argue as being a genuine piece of art. The characters were created like actual people rather than tropy archetypes and the premise was actually refreshingly original, revolving around this \"eigth-grade syndrome\" concept which is arguably more relatable than some of us would care to admit. The show developed with a real sense of purpose from episode to episode, characters developing like actual people rather than as triggers and plot devices, and as aresult you could really invest your feelings into it and watching it was a genuine pleasure.\\n\\n\r\nThis second season starts off remarkably slowly. But for an initial moment of imaginative excitement when we find the two main characters living together due to extenuating circumstances and wondering what the show will do with this turn of events, instead of anything you could imagine, the show instead 180's and pulls Rikka out of that scenario. So much for that golden opportunity to play with their relationship so intimately.\\n\\n\r\nThe show stagnates for about 6-8 episodes with nothing really happening beyond the odd momentary tease thanks to the new character and love rival and although you could probably argue this [stagnation] was a meta for their relationship, that doesn't stop it from being so god damn boring. Boring enough for people to dismiss entire episodes as filler. The end of the first season concluded with the notion that either extreme of imagination vs no imagination was not ideal and the entire journey was discovering that the middle ground was best. Where we could simultaneously live our lives and yet still play.\\n\\n\r\nBut for some reason the second season starts off with a complete reset of Rikka's personality. The introduction of a love rival was an interesting route to take that would create the most drama and tension, so i suppose this was a logical progression of the rom-com element. But beyond the initial fun-ness of another Chuunibyou, this character turns out to be remarkably 2D compared to the rest of them and the shallow nature of her compared to the rest really wrestles with your suspension of disbelief. There is a moment towards the end where the show gives her some actual emotions and even some proper history, but the show slaps her around for a bit before taking them all back. In the end she existed solely to trigger and develop the MC's relationship. Talk about getting thrown under the bus.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the impression is this series was created primarily for the sake of service on a previously successful title, but even that \"service\" was spread so thin I found myself actively creating reasons to do or watch other more entertaining things.",

            "content": "Mixed feelings with this one. The plot lines just felt way too tangled and insubstantial to truly enjoy this anime. The lighthearted nature of this anime continues and it avoids the eye-roll worthy love triangle which is quite commendable.Of course, it is still super adorable. The only thing that felt lacking was any real drama to result in more character development. Where as the character development in the first season was nicely paced\u2026here? It happens at a snail\u2019s pace.\r\nRikka and Yuta continue their friendship/romantic relationship as they have both accepted that being a chunibyo (someone who integrates fantasy situations into their life) is just apart of Rikka\u2019s identity that she cannot and does not need to give up. We are introduced to Shichimiya, another Chunibyo that inspired Yuta\u2019s Chunibyo phase. As she seems to have romantic feelings for Yuta, she consumes a major part of this anime. She has pink double ponytails, a heart sticker on her cheek and a laugh which I will be lucky now to never hear again. She is also surprisingly wise in that she knows to deal with her unrequited love herself rather than become a home wrecker.\\n\\n\r\nThis season seems to be more focused on the development of the romance and though it happens in a very slow way because both of the leads are seriously shy, it is still undoubtedly adorable. \\n\\n\r\nThough Rikka claims that she wants to awaken the Chunibyo inside of Yuta, even though some events in the anime make it seem like she\u2019s achieved that, Yuta\u2019s personality doesn\u2019t really change so it sort of feels like a wild goose chase.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I will say was quite enjoyable about this season was the friendship between Nibutani and Dekomori. We are shown a glimpse of their personalities that shows that they really do appreciate the mindless banter that they have.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like this time, the show was too lighthearted to the point at which you begin to lose interest in the plot line. Though we see all our favourite characters again, Yuta is still the patient, dense character, Rikka is still the bashful yet caring Chunibyo, Nibutani is still trying to ramp up the romance between the former two, Dekomori is still annoying the heck out of Nibutani and Kumin\u2026is still sleeping.\\n\\n\r\nWhere as the opening and ending themes go\u2026sadly I found them quite annoying in this season and skipped over them each time. As for the art, it is still quite pleasing to the eye and the imagined battle scenes are surprisingly epic to the point where I think they are worthy of being an anime which has real battles as it\u2019s plot line!\\n\\n\r\nIn the first season we had Rikka and Yuta growing to accept both her Chunibyo and the realities of her father\u2019s death, we saw her caring, yet fierce sister Toka\u2019s strange display of support and we saw the formation of their club and the development of Nibutani and Dekomori\u2019s strange but likeable relationship. Where that season had quite a lot of substantial content, this just felt like a very long stand-alone episode. This is just a fun season without much progression in character personalities. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a very nice break from life into a world in which little problems are overly exaggerated but still manages to have an undeniable charm, then this season is for you! From napping competitions to imposter Morisummers, to adorable (yet sometimes frustrating) romance scenes, this season still carries the magic of the first season, yet\u2026it doesn\u2019t really feel like we\u2019ve gone anywhere once we finish.",

Ren, at episode 7, minute 4:49 \r\nWhy?\r\nEverything was fine, until the character Shichimiya Satone appeared. But why? ... you really ask why? ... she's annoying as hell. ~*THIS MAY BE SPOILER*~ At episode 7 (final episode i'm going to see, if I don't watch it again) Rikka and Yuuta were supposed to have a day just for them,like a date. But guess what? That pink-haired demon appeared, ruining Rikka's and Yuuta's day and making Rikka jealous, oh yes, that's all what she does, appearing randomly to make a love triangle, giving Yuuta eskimo kisses and hugging him, making Rikka jealous. I swear she's the first character that makes me feel like if I wanted to go to the person who created her house and murder them. Really.... uhhh... sorry for that...\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that is making me dropping the season is that.... chan chan channn..... \\n\r\nRikka and Yuuta don't doing nothing that couples does and being ashamed all the time.\\n\r\nMaybe you'll say ''But they don't know anything about love!'' or ''Let them progress how they want''.. but... just... no. I can't handle watching a romance anime without romance.

            "content": "Although I felt the second half of Chuunibyou1 contrived I decided to give Chuu2 a shot. \r\nChuu2 presents a return to the initial objectives of Chuu1, spoiling us with a coming-of-age story interjected with a healthy dose of moe and humour. \r\nFirstly, moe was well done without making me cringe at any point. My pet peeve is a moe character who has no other role but to be cute/vulnerable/eye-candy etc, and Chuu does not do this. Certainly, Chuu characters are moe, but they are rather well-developed and do not serve the sole purpose of pandering to viewers' desires.\r\nThe transition stage between the carefree childhood andawkward, self-aware teenage years is beautifully (and very literally) depicted in Rikka's near loss of 'powers'. The struggles she undergoes, the foreign emotions evoked in her, the -awkwardness- are all quite aptly expressed. While Chuu1 captured the audience with its empty play on emotions, the level of depth Chuu2 attempts to reach by developing the story and characters gives it the strength which Chuu1 lacks.\\n\\n\r\nRather than create highly dramatised moments about Rikka's past with the family issues (which were quite frankly not that interesting to watch), Chuu2 delves into the personal growth of the characters (mainly Rikka and Sophia) which I find a great deal more satisfying and gripping.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about this show on the whole, I believe, is the likableness of ALL the characters. Nibutani is dangerously close to becoming my favourite character, Dekomori's eccentricities are charming and even Kumin (who doesn't actually add to the story) is sweet. The character who blew me away, however, is Sophia. Initially she seemed like a plot device to further the Rikka/Yuuta relationship by making Rikka jealous (necessary but typical) and I wasn't too fond of her, however, the latest episodes have added a depth to her that is astounding and very, very real. The emotions portrayed and the reactions drawn out by the characters are very realistic. \\n\\n\r\nThis is not comedy/slice-of-life. Once you start thinking about the issues this show expresses, this is a very real, bittersweet coming-of-age story.",
