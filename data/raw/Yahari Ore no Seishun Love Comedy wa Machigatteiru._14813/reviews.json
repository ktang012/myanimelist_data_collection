            "content": "Now I'll admit the first time I saw the sypnosis for this anime I thought Oregairu would be a stereotypical romcom anime. Just think about it. There are two female main characters and a male character. Male character is an outcast. One of the female characters is the school's most beautiful girl. How original. But when I finished the first episode of this anime. I realized that this was something else. Something that manages to stray away from the norm and become something really special.\r\nStory- Now the story centers around Hikigaya Hachiman. A high school student who is shunned by pretty much the whole school.Luckilythis suits him perfectly as he prefers to be a loner and doesn't want to make friends. But his \"happy\" life soon crumbles as his teacher forces him to join a club which is supposed to help people with their problems.Even worse, the club also has the smart and beautiful   \"ice-cold Beauty\" Yukino Yukinoshita.(nicknamed that for her cold personality). Hilarity ensues. \\n\r\nNow the story basically revolves on the club helping out on peoples' requests and problems. Although the problem's are simple the way the main characters solve the problem isn't. The comedy usually revolves around Hachiman and Yukino's witty dialogue and sarcasm.(which is really funny btw).\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art was good most of the time. Backgrounds were filled with radiant colors and were nicely drawn.Character designs were also done well and fit well with the personalities of the characters. There was an episode or two where there was a small drop in animation. But all in all it's pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The sound was quite impressive. The soundtrack fits in really well with the anime. The opening \"Yukitoki\", is a really catchy song and I had myself humming to it in the shower for days after I listened to it. The ending, I'm afraid. Wasn't as well but is adequate for an ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-Now this is where Oregairu excels the most. \\n\r\nLet's begin with Hikigaya Hachiman. Hachiman's twisted view of life and society are definitely one of the most captivating view's of life that i've ever seen. His views of life actually affected my way of viewing life. His monologues are also enjoyable and show off a bit more of his personality. \\n\\n\r\nYuki Yukinoshita is almost the complete opposite of Hachiman. She is smart, beautiful, and rich.But the interesting thing is. She doesn't have friends either. But unlike Hachiman her reason for not having friends is her icy demeanor and being too perfect. She unlike Hachiman believes that change is a good thing. Her smart remarks are funny and her quarrels with Hachiman are hilarious. Over all she is also a nice character.\\n\\n\r\nYui Yuigahama at the start  would seem to be a completely stereotypical character.Although I couldn't say I loved her as much as I loved the other two main characters I would have to admit that without her in this anime this anime wouldn't be as good. She serves as the glue that keeps the club together. Her character does develop to be more independent and helpful. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end Oregairu really did turn out to be a good series. What I thought would be a stereotypical romcom anime turned out to be something more than that. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who watches anime.",

            "content": "Yahari Ore isn't the first anime to tackle the anti-social protagonist,  but it certainly captures it perfectly with its characters and deadpan writing. Like others have said before, you may go into this expecting a typical rom-com but will instead come out of it lashed by the harsh views of our characters. This however, is why this anime stands out from so many in the genre. It's charming, funny and yet bluntly realistic. Far too often rom-coms get stuck in the fairy tale realm of romance stories, or get too wrapped up in the emotional drama/turmoil that can be present in youthful romance. Thoseelements are fine. But what about the bitter, and rejected? Or those that aren't allowed to fit in, or who choose not to fit in. \\n\\n\r\nNot everyone of course has had this experience, but it's certainly something that people experience. And so this is what Yahari Ore does best, it gives us a perspective of those in school who have been rejected so much, they decide to play by their own rules, and that of course is excluding everyone else from the game. Afterall, it's much easier to get on by when you only have yourself to rely on. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime doesn't preach to the audience. And certainly, the view points of these characters are sometimes flawed. But it's an interesting look at how some people deal with their failure to connect to others (or rather, what can happens to someone when people reject and shut them out). Yahari Ore also looks at it from the other perspective, and isn't trying to paint one side as the victim/aggressor. We get a look at how mean and cruel we can be to each other when trying to fend for ourselves by fitting to the status quo. But this is true of both the rejected and those that reject. \\n\\n\r\nAt its core this show is very funny. The MC's biting sense of humor and harsh views of the world is hilarious (even if it always has an underlining seriousness to it). And to be clear, this isn't a serious drama. However, my praise focuses so much on the serious elements of the show, because I think that is what elevates this to a truly great Anime vs. a typical comedy. There is a lot of truth to this show, and it feels very realistic. Through the lens of the MC's harsh view on the world, we get a deep look at social behaviors and how often everyone is just trying to be something that won't be shunned from the pack. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are someone looking for a romance anime to watch, this might not be it. The romance in this anime isn't non-existent, it's actually well written in a realistic manner (it doesn't fall into the typical tropes). However, if you are looking for romance with a lot of action, then you might be let down. The romance in this anime is more about feelings, and how they can grow towards others. This is to say, the romance feels like something special here, but you will not get any closure or sweeping action between specific characters (maybe later in the LN or if we get a season 2). Although I don't think that's what this anime is about, as ultimately its focus is more on how people internally deal with their emotions, and the fear of sharing them with others. \\n\\n\r\nYahari Ore is an example of why comedy is such a great asset to art. Comedy allows us to look at aspects of life that aren't always good and allows us to examine the darker aspect of our humanity, and laugh while also getting a better understanding of it. Yes, this is a comedy that is for the most part, snarky, sarcastic and deadpan. But it's also a very interesting perspective on how we treat other people, and how those that don't fit in, (or those that choose not to play the game and try to fit in), deal with a world that heavily relies on being social.",

            "content": "\"Some walks you have to take alone.\"\r\nSomewhere along the way, I read that quote. The source is unknown to me, but I found that it struck key point in life. Well, I guess I can't generalize and say everyone's life, but I would say most people have had times they felt they couldn't count on anyone. Life is full of things that make us want to isolate people we don't understand and make us want to quit life. High school is full of those moments, those \"emotional roller coaster\" kind of moments. Basically, it can be related to my understanding of  Oregairu, I'll kindof explain...kinda later on. Maybe. Derp.\\n\\n\r\nStory - Meet Hikigaya Hachiman, pessimistic protagonist. Alliteration wins the day. Just kidding. Basically, this romantic comedy is centered around this social outcast. Along with Yuigahama and Yukinoshita, these three characters make up the main cast. Of course it's easy to start assuming and stereotype this as the \"usual\" romcom. I beg to differ. The premise for the story isn't super original. I'll admit that. But again, most things aren't. What might have been another generic and boring romcom with mediocre ratings actually was just a disguise. After watching the first episode, I began looking forward to the next week. As I sat myself down each week to watch Oregairu, I realized just how well done the entire story was. Pacing-wise, I thought it was perfectly fine. There are minor issues, but none that truly sparks any debate.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Here was the biggest \"fuck yeah\" moments I've ever had. The characters in this show were phenomenal. Let me explain: from start to finish, how they started off as, how they developed, and the amazing interaction between the characters, especially Hikki and Yukinoshita, were just amazingly done. There really isn't a show I enjoyed more than this based solely on character development. Gotta love the bantering back and forth.\\n\\n\r\nTruly, there are some gems of knowledge we can all learn from. Hikki, pessimistic and messed as he may be, truly understands the world far better than most of the other characters in the show. Despite his twisted views on life, he tries his best to help others. Not always in the nicest way, but definitely in a way that is effective. Throughout the show, there was nothing more captivating than listening to Hikki's thought process and views on life. \\n\\n\r\nI won't go into too much details about the others, but know this: the premise for each character is nicely brought out and it truly was the highlight of the entire show. The characters I mean. Interactions were perfectly portrayed and drew us in. How nice of them. I laughed my ass - pardon my language - off so many different times throughout the show just because of how well the interaction of the characters. Truly a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nArt -  Ah, I really was a little turned off by the art. Throughout the entire show, there was some episodes where it just didn't look great. But it isn't so bad to the point I wouldn't watch it. Somehow, as I watched more and more, I cared less and less. It was quite colorful, I'll admit. All in all, it wasn't something bad, I just thought they could have done better. But really now, who cares about some subjective views of a random young adult? Probably not you. \\n\\n\r\nSound - Well, I must admit that the opening was something I never skipped. I really enjoyed listening to it. And throughout the show, the soundtrack really fit well for the mood. I have nothing bad to say about it. Though I must confess I never stayed for the ending. \\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing the show, that quote really hit me. Not so much about what it meant, but that quote truly was something that describes Hikki so very well. He truly understands the meaning of \"walking alone\" and just doing what needs to be done. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, I gave this show a 9/10. I couldn't part to give it anything higher because despite how much I liked it, there were some parts that I couldn't enjoy (like my subjective views on the art and stuff but anyway). Despite all that, and minor details, it was a show I thoroughly enjoyed. Don't let the long name fool you, Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru, or \"My youth romantic comedy is wrong as I expected\", or Oregairu. Whatever you may call it, this show truly is one worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended. Highly. Yeah. Awesomeness. Now go watch.",

Did the girls all swarm you and fawn over what you did? Were you always the \"popular\" kid?... No? Me neither, and that's why I enjoy this anime. \r\nThe anime revolves around protagonist Hikigaya Hachiman who is a entirely rejected and remarked as \"gross\" by those who know him. His goal in his high-school life is to remain a loner and to avoid making friends. He does what he can to make himself unnoticeable by his classmates and he doesn't drawattention towards himself. \\n\\n\r\nHowever you can only remain a loner so long before some event comes around and forces you to end up stuck with other people. In a normal high-school, that would probably be a group project, which ends shortly and you can return to your loner style of life, but Hikigaya isn't so lucky, as he is forced into a club in which his goal along within the female protagonist is to fulfill people's requests.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is a great slice-of-life. It portrays perfectly how a loner feels and acts in a school environment, and it's hilarious to watch the protagonist attempt to fit in with the club he's stuck in. The comedic aspect of the anime focuses highly on the use of sarcasm, so if you're a fan of sarcastic comedy then I definitely suggest you give this anime a watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe character progression lacks a little, but I can't say too much as I have only seen a few episodes so far, and there is hints that it will reveal more about the how the characters turned out the way they did. Aside from progression however, the way the characters act serves for a great laugh and if you're a loner yourself you'll find yourself really relating to the protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound does a great job of fitting the mood of each scene, and there are even some moments where it can express the sarcastic remorse within a scene of constant sarcastic dialogue, so that no scene gets stale even if there is continued dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful, the characters look great and the scenery is always well drawn. They don't move much out of the school, but when they do venture out (such as to the mall in an episode) you can see just how fantastic the art is. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy this anime, and if you enjoy slice-of-life comedies I feel you would too, so check it out! \\n\\n\r\n- Shane M",

            "content": "My youth romantic comedy is wrong as I expected. But my expectations were not.\r\nSpring \u201cblesses\u201d us with yet another highschool anime about a guy who comes into contact with a bunch of girls in a school club.\r\nWhat started out generic also ended generic and nothing of value has been gained.\r\nIt\u2019s not only sad for the industry but also sad for Brains Base to produce such a subpar work, when in the past they were responsible for great shows like Baccano and Mawaru Penguindrum.\r\nStory/Content:\r\n\u201cYahari\u201d has no overall story, it\u2019s just about a boy named Hikigaya and his school life. The show goes in no direction, buildsup no goal to aim for, no romance no drama, no big lesson. While other slice of life school romcoms have at least something to aim for like, graduation, a romantic relationship or a different goal in life, Yahari stays true to slice of life and just shows us character interactions and some events.\\n\\n\r\nIf it doesn't have a story, does it have anything else to offer?\\n\r\nYes and no.\\n\r\nWhile shows without story have normally things like, great artwork, soundtrack, interesting characters, settings or concepts. None of this was found in Yahari, the jokes were sometimes funny and sometimes you didn\u2019t care. I was wondering why I am even watching this anymore as it was clear nothing was going on. It revolved around the same thing the entire time without any clear path to go. Stumbling from one boring school event to the next it felt so dragged out and couldn't keep me interested.\\n\\n\r\nEven for its genre it did nothing new or groundbreaking. There are a lot of better shows similar to Yahari that were at least enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nIt all boils down to Hachiman, the anti-social protagonist with witty comments on the insignificance of school life and school friends. While at first I liked his cynical view on his surroundings as it reminded me of my own view on school life, it became very dry at some point as it was the same thing over and over.\\n\r\nHe showed no real progression and he alone is not enough to save this anime.\\n\\n\r\nYukino was the other half decent character, she also had a very cynical outlook on life but was a more honorable student than Hachiman. Her personality though stagnated and became boring after a while. Besides being cruel and insulting she had nothing else to offer.\\n\\n\r\nYui was a possible love interest for the MC but the show decided to just leave that alone and make absolutely nothing with it. She is just a naive girl and totally bland and boring. Like the rest of the support characters.\\n\\n\r\nSaika was the only one who had an entertaining interaction with the MC but only because of the homosexual tension. Besides that he was a personality less trap just for fan-service.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, if you have no story to offer then please offer an interesting cast. Yahari has only one interesting character and that is not enough to keep me interested and entertained for 13 boring episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nYou know how well Baccano was animated? The surreal art style Mawaru Penguindrum had? Or the pretty colors in Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun?\\n\r\nWell Yahari had absolutely nothing like that.\\n\r\nIt looked so cheap, the character designs were pretty generic and bad executed. The surrounding were so boring to look at, it had no special effects or interesting artistic treats for the eye.\\n\\n\r\nYahari looked just really really generic to borderline bad. I\u2019m confused how Brains Base could produce such a cheap looking show. \\n\\n\r\nReally it fails already in 3 categories, no story, boring character and cheap look...\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nBut it doesn't stop there. The overall soundtrack in Yahari is so forgettable, even bad at points. It\u2019s just such run of the mill music that plays in the background without sticking out for a second.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is good as usual, I would have face palmed if they would have fucked that up as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is terrible and I always skipped it, the ending song is just as bad.\\n\\n\r\nFour Strikes... Yahari what are you doing?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nAs you\u2019d guess from my previous sections, yahari couldn't keep me enjoyed through the course of 13 episode.\\n\r\nWhile I didn't hate it (because then I\u2019d have dropped it without a second thought). I just felt really bored at some point and just finished it so I had it finished.\\n\r\nHere and there it was funny and even entertaining. The start was pretty okay as well, but around the middle it just dropped deeper and deeper into insignificance. Such a boring show, it didn't even had potential it wasted, it was wasted right from the start.\\n\\n\r\nScores:\\n\\n\r\n(Story) Content 3/10\\n\\n\r\nPremise and Setting -1 (highschool boy with highschool girls in a club...)\\n\r\nGenre Execution 0 (sometimes funny but mostly boring)\\n\r\nDialogues and Cleverness 0 (some good dialogues but overall too mundane)\\n\r\nInterest Keeping -1 (nothing was happening!)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonality 0 (weren't too bad)\\n\r\nBehavior and Chemistry 0 (very generic)\\n\r\nDevelopment and Progression -1 (absolutely none)\\n\r\nMotivation and Backdrop 0 (simple)\\n\r\nLikability -1 (even tough 8man was good everyone else as terrible)\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 5/10\\n\\n\r\nArtstyle 0 (generic and boring)\\n\r\nQuality 0 (not impressive)\\n\r\nBackground 0 (boring backgrounds)\\n\r\nCharacter Designs 0 (bad executed and bland looking)\\n\r\nVisual Effects 0 (simple)\\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting 0 (normal)\\n\r\nOpening and Ending -1 (terrible)\\n\r\nSoundtrack -1 (unengaging)\\n\r\nSound Effects 0 (normal)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 0/10\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation -1 (bad)\\n\r\nSound -1 (bad as well)\\n\r\nStory and Content -1 (boring)\\n\r\nCharacters -1 (annoying)\\n\r\nValue -1 (an anime without any significance)\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nYahari does nothing new or good in the romcom genre. it\u2019s yet another school anime with an antisocial main character forced to interact with a bunch of girls. The events were mundane, the side characters annoying, art and sound below average. Truly a show not worth of any ones time.\\n\r\nIf you want to watch an enjoyable RomCom try Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun made by the same studio last year. It\u2019s not really great or anything, but by far better than Yahari.\\n\r\nOr why not try out really good ones like ToraDora or Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojou by JC Staff. Even Kyoto Animations Hyouka has more to offer and a similar cool main character.\\n\\n\r\n3,4/10\\n\r\n~3/10 (Very Bad)\\n",

Then, there are some people who absolutely loathe school and think it's like prison, a place for people who are forced to go there because their parents told them something along the line of \u201cit's for your own good!\u201d Well, I'm not sure what category I belong to along those options but for a certain young man by the name of Hikigaya Hachiman, hetakes distortion to a whole new level. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is called My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU in English terms. The SNAFU part is an abbreviation for \u201csituation normal: all fucked up\u201d. No, I didn't make that up. On the other hand, the Japanese title is Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru that can also be abbreviated simply as Oregairu for easier writing. Regardless though, the series is adapted from the light novel of the same name written by Wataru Watari.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, this series took me by quite a surprise. The first episode took off with a rather blend start from my point of view as the series seemed to follow more of a slice of lifish style of narrative. As mentioned before, the series stars a cynical and anti-social young man by the name of Hachiman Hikigaya. He is in his second year at high school but unlike most people who thinks about sports, girls, or academics, he seemingly rejects reality so much that he wishes his existence was never present. He maintains his life as typical with no friends, associates, or a girlfriend. This could be a understandable given his past with how he is often made fun of by his classmates and peers. Even the teacher never stood up to him when the time calls. Poor kid...\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this is about to change because Hikigaya meets a girl who by the name of Yukino Yukinoshita. Unlike him, this girl is completely out of his league. (typical for him huh?) Yukino is seen as a girl who is admired for her beauty, academics, but also with a cold personality. Thus, she earns the title of \u201cIce-cold beauty\u201d. At the same time, she plays the role of the president of a club known as the \u201cservice club\u201d, a club created to help others in need. But of course, a club is difficult to run with just two people right? Well, that's where Yuigahama Yui comes in. On a completely obstacle scale, Yui is cheerful and often puts on a smile while enjoying the times of her life at school. Together, these three forms the trio of this series in a romantic comedy that's depicted as a complete \u201cillusion\u201d under Hikigaya's eyes.\\n\\n\r\nIn this series, I find perhaps the character interactions to be one of the strongest points of the show. In fact, our three main characters gets seemingly gets off to a rocky start in the beginning. Hikigaya stands isolated at many occasions in events while voicing out thoughts in his own mind. He seems to detest romance and likely reality itself. His 'deadfish eyes' represents a physical side of this because in essence, fishes have no personality. In other words, Hikigaya plays the role of a cynical man. Yukino on to other hand seems to have a similar personality and at the same time often makes sarcastic remarks to Hikigaya's responses. Her way of speech mannerisms shows why she earned the nickname \u201cIce-cold beauty\u201d. This side of herself is further illustrated through her brutal honesty. In fact, Yukino is someone who goes against lies and speaks the truth at times no matter how forceful it may be. However, Yukino and Hikigaya does occasionally interact in agreement with various people. This usually relates to their 'love life' where the either of them immediately declares themselves as 'nothing more than friends'. Finally, in my view, Yui represents the middle girl of the trio. She is neither cold or cynical. Instead, she is cheerful and often brings a bright smile to the gloom and doom of the club. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of this series seemingly becomes a problem at first but then, I realized it's not about romance but rather the way these three characters live out their lives through young in their school lives. I'm sure some of us felt this way one point or another in our lives as life seemingly moves way too slow. For Hachiman though, he just wants it to be all over. At the same time however, Hachiman does seem to have some interest in his life. He does seem to find both Yukino and Yui to be attractive in physical terms. However, he doesn't seem to actually want to date them because from his perspective, romance is a false reality; a lie. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance in this series is actually presented in a different way; no random fan service or breast groping. Rather, there's more of a slice of life pacing that depicts our three main characters' daily lives around others and around school as well as other places in later episodes. I personally find the romance in this series to be unique and even at times realistic. Although there's some obvious hints, it's rather presented in a conceptual style through its dialogues. Rather, the dialogues of this series also remains one of the strongest points in all of its episodes. Hachiman reflects them in his mind with his thoughts on the world and those around him. At one point, he goes over a long monologues that depicts his way of thinking against a certain type of girl. It's realistic because it can be related to anyone at school. Yes, I do mean ANYONE.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, there's also seemingly development with all three of our characters. Hachiman seems to change outlooks on himself while also influencing others. Yukino's cold heart also seems to melt at various points as she reveals more of her vulnerable self. Additionally, Yui shows more of her fragile self as well. The dynamic trio plays out their roles in a recognizable way that depicts their characters throughout each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, high school always has to drama to complete the formula right? The drama sometimes comes from the trio of our main characters. At other times, they are influenced by outside parties such as Yumiko Miura, a popular student at school. She and Yukino are like oil and water as the two never seems to get along. Among other factors, there's also drama involving Hachiman and his interactions with others that seemingly puts others in an uncomfortable zone. It's a zone of drama and in this series, it's definitely there.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one of the strongest points I enjoyed in this series is Hachiman's character. His personality is the type of \u201cI don't give a damn\u201d about anything, whether it's himself, others, or even the world around him. At the same time, he has strong opinions about the world. Like I mentioned before, this is usually expressed through his monologues. They have a reflexive sense of language that is philosophical, deep, but at the same time to the point. It illustrates the fact that Hachiman is cynical and at times even mean as demonstrated in one of the conversations he has with Yui. His view on his family also seems to be indifferent as shown through her interactions with his sister. The way Hachiman describes her as \u201cbrat\u201d and \u201cannoying\u201d again reflects his personality. However, I find this to be very well done because it is realistic. It is how siblings act in real life because who am I kidding, no brothers and sisters can get along perfectly. Don't believe me, just take look at Oremio. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, there's also a visual sense on how lonely people behave. The interactions that Hachiman goes through seems to be forced by himself as often or not, he is unwilling to participate unless asked for. Even then, he concedes in a reluctant way. It's not always easy to relate to him but there at many times I find his personality to be refreshing, realistic, and in the way of how his character is portrayed right. He isn't the typical harem protagonist who can't decide on what's right or wrong. Rather, Hachiman is an opinionated young man with his own views on the world. Those views are in the words of his dialogues that makes up the humor and personality of his character. (oh and who am I kidding here, who can ignore those deadfish eyes and antenna like hair?)\\n\\n\r\nThe series does fall under some common themes though despite its refreshment. The concept of 'students forming a club' is not a new idea. Anime series such as Medaka Box, Haganai, and Okami-San and Her Seven Companions has this idea of students coming together at school to form a club to help others or for their own purposes. It's been done before. At the same time, there's also the common sister trope used in this series. Furthermore, this series doesn't avoid some fan service or the 'festival' mood. Although the fan service is toned down, it's still there with the swimsuits, cos-play, and even maid outfits. There's even a trap in this series that distract the viewers and who am I kidding, Hachiman as well with his thoughts. The poor kid sees everything as an illusion and almost at times can't tell differences between fiction and reality. \\n\\n\r\nAs regarding artwork, this series has some generic visuals. However, I find it to fit within the themes of the series by the way it's drawn to be simple and to the point. The most obvious that stands out is Hachiman and his deadfish eyes. In fact, his eyes are never portrayed as normal but rather as the type that stands out the entire show. Am I surprised? Of course not. It fits him perfectly with his cynical personality. Then, there's cold beauty Yukino who is drawn with electric blue eyes and long hair; a true beauty indeed. It's definitely memorable because of how they look so differently from others in the series. It's also important to note that because of their looks, they are different in general. I felt that the mood of this series was achieved with this portrayal of visual artwork. It sets the realism and style of our main characters that are easy to be told apart. It's appealing and this series pulled it off right. There's no stupid deformed characters or inconsistency. It's down to the point and I'm grateful for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series has a light touch to its themes. I felt that the voice actors and actresses did an outstanding job with their performances in their roles. Hachiman's tone is completely straight forward with no hesitation on what's on his mind. His monologues are from his personal thoughts and I felt that Eguchi Takuya did a great performance. The cold tone and brutal honesty is also reflected in the voice of Hayami Saori. Finally, Yui's voice actress protrays the cheerful voice to balance out the trio. The atmosphere of the show is lighthearted and thus the OST remains so as well. It's orchestrated with slow pace and connects everything well. There's that sense of realism to go along with it with that pacing and soundtrack makes it match. The OP song, \"Yukitoki\" by Nagi Yanagi shows montages of the characters and how they come together as the Service Club. Similarly the ED song, \u201cHello Alone\u201d shows more of a bonding that is memorable at heart. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, My Romantic Comedy SNAFU was a refreshing show for me. It's like taking a deep breath and thinking back about youth and school life. It can also be related to many of us who has gone through the high school years along with those experiences of youth. Whether you were the popular kid, the loner, or somewhere the middle, there's always something you can dig out from this series related to school. The main character Hachiman is one of my favorites from the Spring 2013 lineup with his personality. Whether it's his character, his dialogues, or just himself, I loved the way he is portrayed in this series. Of course, I do feel a bit sorry for him as well at various occasions. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, this series stands out as something that definitely in my estimation to spent time on. Even if you don't like the idea of the typical school life setting where a group of kids are in a club doing stuff to help others, I think this series right here may change your mind a bit. It may start off slow paced but that's also how life is. For Hachiman, youth is an illusion. For me, this series' illusion is reality that has been quite an enjoyable experience. After all, we all been through youth with a different outlook, no?",

            "content": "In the minds of many, High School is the time of happy moments and strong memories. People tend to make friends and get involved in many activities, from sports to clubs. And despite the noteworthy drama and hardships that take place in High Schools, High School life is under the spirit that some would call \"youth.\"\r\n(Un)fortunately for Hachiman Hikigaya, he doesn't think so, and he demonstrates that all of that sass about \"youth\" is a mere fabrication to deceive oneself with a false sense of happiness. So our dear fish-eyed and \"gross\" protagonist aspires to conduct his life like a bear-- one that hibernates tocause no trouble nor get into trouble.\\n\\n\r\nSo what makes this anime featuring a dispassionate and social-apathetic loner so interesting? It is the mere fact that this protagonist gives his audience a wild crazy taste on his state of mind!\\n\\n\r\nBut that is what keeps the story from being one of the higher points of this anime. This anime has no ongoing central goal nor plot whatsoever because we've got a very stubborn character who seems immune to character development and brushes everyone off.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, Hachiman is forced into the Public Service Club by his teacher, Shizuka Hiratsuka, who wishes to correct his corrupted behavior. Alongside him, is the beautiful ice queen, Yukino Yukinoshita, who was also \"contained\" in this club for the same intentions, courtesy of Shizuka. We can only imagine what these two misfits can do to make society crumble before their feet.\\n\\n\r\nThus, the club's activities in helping others is what drives the \"plot\" of this anime, but even the most mundane tasks can be made to be rather amusing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's where the characters come in to make things worthwhile. They feature a very colorful cast here with matching personalities. We all seen this before. The busty girl. The trap. The fat otaku. The ojou. The nice guy. The fujoshi. The christmas cake. Etc. \\n\\n\r\nBut when you throw in a nonchalant, social pessimist and an intelligent, sharp-tongued ice queen... hilarity ensues. Or rather, you get amusing and witty dialogue. We see cooking, tennis, and shopping between the wide cast and every word said is like getting hit by a marshmallow or a dagger to the face multiple times.\\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between characters is great, where snark and criticism is passed on like a hot potato. The most happiest characters will fall down to size by the bitterness and scorn of the two main protagonists as they offer their services, unless the other main heroine, Yui Yuigahama, is there to cheer the victim up.\\n\\n\r\nFrom an anime that relies on dialogue and character development to advance the plot, character development does not actually fall too far behind despite stubborn characters.\\n\\n\r\nWe get to see a more insightful and justified side behind Hachiman's deadpan demeanor. And a more gentle and vulnerable side behind that icy exterior of Yukino's. Albeit, it is not that much. But that surely counts. And you can't exactly detest even the most horrible characters because of the level of understanding and empathy that you get from them.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm also trying to get across is that you see why every (almost every) important character acts the way that he or she does. Expect some important backstories and implications between conversations. The emphasis on these corrupted personas is to get you to see things from their perspective, whether their values are acceptable or hard to swallow.\\n\\n\r\nThe few things that clue you in on how deep the characters are, especially Hachiman and Yukino, are found in their conversations. While that should be prominent in every anime, this one seems to stress two different and important personas that everyone can identify with.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to the first episode, it seems that...\\n\\n\r\nHachiman is a person that stays true to himself. He sees change as a running away from your own self.\\n\\n\r\nYukino is a person that wants to start things anew. Instead she views change as a redemption.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when you place these two opposing types of mentality into socially hazardous minds, you will get some pretty deep insightful **** as I've said before. (As far as how long the anime will cover the light novels, I am pretty optimistic). I can't emphasize enough, but this anime follows through beyond what I am expecting here. So much that it is unexpected.\\n\\n\r\nI was expecting humor and problems with romance the first time I laid eyes on the title, but this anime isn't supposed to show the traditional means of romance and comedy. It's supposed to show a deeper aspect here behind the subtle use of fanservice and comedy, and that's what I admire in this anime. It's going about a pace to show why the characters are what they are, and it leaves you hoping that somehow things will get better for every characters' sake.\\n\\n\r\nThe question whether or not the two most stubborn characters in this anime will change for the better or change for the worse is very interesting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI found this anime very enjoyable and laughed at the countless moments of Hachiman's remarks (and references!) to the many quirks of the other characters. The banter between the characters is always amusing with the snarkiness and scorn bouncing about through and over the heads of the friendlier characters. And the monologues are very noteworthy in displaying a character's personality and are especially identified with the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is also backed with very fitting music that sounds like something from a well-done visual novel ranging from expressive piano notes to bass grooves. The sound has a whimsical expression that superbly matches character tones and the clean defined atmosphere touched by the art. Furthermore, the music goes hand-in-hand with Hachiman's monologues and serious recollections. At times, the music and sound will also remind you of the sad and bitter undertones that lie beneath the character's happy expression called \"youth.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is an average highschool romance story. The twist? The main character is repulsive, and intends to stay this way. Otherwise, the series is quite lackluster, and frankly did nothing that stands out in my mind to make it very enjoyable. \r\nStory (7/10):\r\nHikigaya is a die-hard introvert who enters high school that is 100% uninterested in forming a relationship. The plot revolves around him joining the Volunteer Service Club and meeting it's two members, Yui and Yukino. A love interest develops between both, but doesn't get very far due to Hikigaya's nature.\r\nHis adventures constantly involve him being the bad guy, and while there were afew good moments, they were never very outstanding. \\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10):\\n\r\nThe animation was not an eyesore, but it was frankly rather mediocre. It's a bit clear that not too much attention was given to the illustration, although the viewer (probably) won't be bothered too much by this.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\r\nIf I take anything from this series, it's the opening track. I loved that song. Otherwise, the soundtrack isn't anything to brag about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5/10):\\n\r\nThe characters are the very definition of flat; they stuck to their natures 100% of the time and each fulfilled a trite, overdone archetype: the outcast, the floozy girl, the ice-queen, etc. I felt like there could have been more to Yukino's character that lie underneath her surface, but the series did little to explore this. \\n\\n\r\nThe decision to make Hikigaya an unlikable outcast was not the most original choice, and it certainly wasn't the best. He constantly makes a deliberate attempt to make people hate him, and while I recognize this fact, it still bothers me to the point where I cannot care for him.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10):\\n\r\nIt calls itself a romantic comedy, but I didn't find myself laughing very much. On top of this, at no point would I consider this series' attempt at humor outstanding of another. I also didn't care much for the romantic part, or at least what passed for it since Hikigaya rejects all notion of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10):\\n\r\nI came out of this series with few fond memories for it. While opinions may differ on its humorous and light-hearted nature, few can deny that it is rather shallow. If you enjoy a simple, shits-and-giggles anime to watch, you may consider this. If you're looking for something with depth, continue your search.",

We are supposed to interact, we are supposed to communicate, we are supposed to be -for a serious lack of a better term- \"social\". We are supposed to hold back things we want to say even if it is the truth; heck, we even have to lie if that is what society expects of us and if that is what's necessary to maintain the status quo. However, it is hard to do that and more harder to keep it up (which I'm sure all of us can attest). \\n\r\nIt is harder for those who have been labeled by society with a particular tag; who are forced to behave as society expects them to. A loner is forced to stay a loner. A \"weirdo\" is expected (thus forced) to be a weirdo. A \"stupid\" person is expected to say something stupid, and even if he says something sensible, he is still jeered. The funny thing is: the other guys are also expected/(slightly forced) to jeer him. Quicksand is what comes to mind to describe this tag; the more you struggle to get out, the more you are dragged in. Is that how human relations are ? It seems as though, they are not formed as we want them to, they are formed and maintained as they are expected to. Is that how society works? Through expectations?\\n\\n\r\nExpectations: This word is more dangerous than I thought.\\n\r\nAs a testament to it's power, let me make it clear that I didn't EXPECT a \"romcom\" like Oregairu to provoke thoughts such as the aforementioned ones to creep into my little mind. Well, I guess it is important for unexpected things to happen, how else are we gonna escape from the quicksand!!\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nHigh school. The perfect model of the overall human society.

He has tried and failed in his attempts to become  a \"normal\" part of society. So now he is a loner-by-choice without any friends at all. Certain circumstances (mostly his teacher), forces him to join the \"volunteers\" club which exists to help people to solve their problems. However, the catch is that the club happens to currently have as a sole member -> the most popular (and rightly so) girl in school: Yukinoshita Yukino. Add to that the sweet and exuberant Yuigahama Yui to complete the club and what you get is 100% enjoyment.\\n\r\nThe plot (on a general note) thus consists of this club helping different people with various problems on request.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nIt was fine. Yes, some episodes had drops in the quality, but it wasn't bad enough to be a distraction. In fact, as I'm not the fastidious type, I only barely noticed.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nAverage here too. Liked the opening as well as the ending. Certainly not great ones but still enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nSimply awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe male lead: Hachiman/\"Hikki\" has to be one of the most badass character without a gun, or superpowers or magical powers.... ec cetera. He probably couldn't take out one young man, forget a gang of villains.... but still he is awesome. \\n\r\nHis antisocial lifestyle combined with a pessimistic view has created in him, an ability to understand our society, world and hence our life which is intriguing, almost creepy. He is able to do so only because he is an observer: he is not really a part of society. Being outside it's realm permits him a unique viewpoint that others lack. Truly an admirable character.\\n\r\n\"You say you admire me. I think what you probably admire is how I speak out things as I see them and not care about others, and how I'm unaffected by the people around me. But isn't that because you can emphasize with me, a loner? In that sense, we are the same. That means you are a loner like me. However, your admiration leads me to believe that you are still trying to fit in: you are still affected by other people's views about you. And the cruel fact is you hate yourself for it. Isn't that so?\"\\n\r\nThat is probably how he would respond to my last statement and the creepy thing is that, despite the twisted nature of his views, he is usually spot on.\\n\r\nThe way he handles the problems is also fun to watch as he uses his twisted ideologies to think of unorthodox solutions which are usually quite cruel and in-your-face but effective nontheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe first of the female lead Yukino: She is smart and witty and is not afraid to speak her mind. She is similar to Hikki in that sense. Plus, she is also a loner. However, in her case, it is not by choice. Her perfection (and probably the cold demeanour) is the cause for her circumstances. \\n\\n\r\nThe second of the female leads Yui: She is probably a stereotype of the \"cheerful and bubbly\" type of character, but still her presence is quite important. Without her, the club and probably the anime wouldn't be the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are also important in the sense that they represent the normal views of normal humans. So, they serve to emphasize the contrast between Hachiman's view and that of his peers.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this show tick..\\n\r\n1. Hachiman: his views, monologues and staight-to-the-point methods. In fact, one could make an hour long video with his monologues alone and it would still be highly enjoyable.\\n\r\n2. The interactions between the characters. This is also the highlight of the show. The interactions between the main three characters is top notch. These interactions seemed to develop along with the characters themselves which was great as well. Especially, the conversations between Hachiman and Yukino are highly enjoyable and of course funny as well.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSO,\\n\r\nThe FINAL THOUGHTS\\n\r\ncons: \\n\r\n*Cannot really think of anything significant. The setting is a normal high school, nothing fancy; that might be a turn off for those inclined to fantasy/supernatural settings.\\n\r\n*Maybe the art/animation? for the really observant ones.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nOregairu stands out from the rest of the romcoms because of...\\n\r\n*The male lead: Usually, the male lead is \"kind\", sweet and (for god's sake!) dense too. Here, he is Hikigaya Hachiman. Period.\\n\r\n*The melodrama(i.e the lack of it): Also something I liked. Had it in as small amounts as possible. So, the plot and setting seemed almost able to occur in real life.\\n\r\n*The monologues: Seriously. I recommend printing them and sticking them on the bedroom walls or something. Pure gold.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\nEntertainment: 9.5\\n\r\nEverything else: 8\\n\r\nSo, OVERALL: 8.75 = 9\\n\\n\r\nCapable of changing how we perceive the society and human nature in general. But hilarious at the same time.\\n\r\nHighly recommended to any anime viewer. Especially recommended for the ones who love romcoms (because they are the most likely to be pleasantly surprised ).\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n{P.S; This is my very first review. So, feedbacks and comments (both +ve and -ve) would be highly appreciated.}",

            "content": "I can think of at least 2 things wrong with that title.\r\nIt\u2019s not funny and there\u2019s nothing romantic about it.\r\nThe writters aimed for deadpan sarcastic comedy title, yet they didn\u2019t do their work investigating how successful deadpan comedy Works. You need to have a serious guy and a funny guy to make the comebacks, this doesn\u2019t work if both guys are dead inside.\r\nLest start with the characters shall we?\r\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with an outcast pessimistic boring character, but it becomes terribly wrong if this character has only one face to show up to the audience and shows no growth at all during the whole series.Yes we\u2019re talking about Hachiman, the dead inside \u201call I do is right or at least is the easy/fast way to do kind of guy\u201d. I still haven\u2019t figured out how did I manage to watch all 12 episodes and not die of an aneurysm on his inside monologues. A 2 x 4 wooden plank with a serious face painted on it would have been funnier and even more charismatic than this car\u00e1cter.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow lets talk about Yukino the Ice Queen. At least she shows up some progress at the last episodes of the showing some gratitude and trying hard to strengthen the bonds between her and Yui. But she\u2019s still awfully boring and hard to relate or like at all. Flawless characters aren\u2019t funny at all, there\u2019s no room for improvement. It was so annoying to see her to point out Hiki\u2019s flaws with no retort at all, watch her play tennis better than Serena Williams, up to doing all the planning for the culture festival and also become some rockstar on stage by playing a guitar and singing with no premise to us the viewers. And lets not forget about her sister being some sort top class director a la Fletcher from Whiplash.\\n\\n\r\nYui is probably the most down to earth character from the main cast. She\u2019s fun, thoughtful and a bit of a door mat by trying to fit in with the cool guys, but eventually she\u2019ll make the choice of sticking with the people who atcually care for her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory?\\n\r\nThere\u2019s really no story in it. It\u2019s a stale slice of life trying to stay under the radar throughout highschool days. The writters tried to add some kind of sub-plot on the whole Hikki/Yui backstory about her dog being run-over by a mysterious black limo, but the lazy writters just didn\u2019t care to follow up the story.\\n\\n\r\nArtsyle is just above everage, nothing to be amazed about it, guess it suits the average boring characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is just bare minimum, since most of the shots are just panning stills of Hikki doing his mindboring monologues. There are a few action scenes with more movement involved, but those are quite rare.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know why there are so many people calling this series \u201crealistic\u201d. There\u2019s nothing real about this one, being a pessimistic guy who makes no effort whatsoever to come out of his confort zone always comes back to punish him/her wheter is at work places or among family/friends.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the only times I had some laughs were from the Fujoshi jokes from Ebina. At least the wirtters know the basics of slapstick humor.\\n\\n\r\nDon't waste your time on this one, there are tons of deadpan humor series out there that know how to make memorable characters, like Hare nochi Guu, Seitokai Yakuindomo, or Konosuba to name some series that vary a lot in terms of background and story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Note: This is my first review. The sole reason I am writing this is because I felt that this anime is over evaluted, and it's probably the worst rating I've given.\r\nFirst of all, let's talk about the characters.\r\n -Hikigaya Hachiman - the main character. There is no doubt that this anime has some pretty badass monologues, making you wonder about the possibilities and choices you do in your life. Hikigaya brings joy to this anime, being this \"lone wolf\" who never depends on anyone and never wants trouble. \r\n-Yukinoshita Yukino - the other main character. This girl is very similiar to the Hikigaya, since justlike him, she'd rather be alone than with someone else. She's a famous cute girl who everyone in the school knows, specially because of her sister and successful family well know all over the country or atleast the town.\\n\\n\r\n-Yuigahama Yui -  Your regular semi-popular girl who ends up liking (and I enforce the idea of LIKE) the two \"weirdos\". Unlike Hikigaya and Yukinoshita, she prefers being in a group and fit in perfectly within society.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the sound, not much I can say, I don't take too many notes about it, since it is completely personal.\\n\\n\r\nThe story.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that made me dislike this anime was the fact that Hikigaya, who second to his dialogues, loves himself, and tries to step away from trouble and unpleasure. However, his teacher forces him to join a club in order to be an accepted person in this \"all looks\" society. He ends up meeting Yukinoshita.  \\n\r\nI will not spoil, but I think people should atleast know that this anime pretty much envolves Hikigaya being led around and actually doing stuff, work, that he hates the most. The two girls in the club, Yukinoshita and Yuigahama (Yui entered later) treat him poorly. As far as Yukinoshita goes, she demonstrates hatred towards Hikigaya. In my opinion, his characteristics would make him instantly leave the club but he ends up tolerating all the bullshit put upon him.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as enjoyment goes, I have to say the anime gets pretty dull after the first few episodes. I was expectant and ended up watching the whole anime, and I'm not sure if I regret it or not. It is indeed a great anime when it comes to monologues and dialogues between the two main characters (Hiki and Yukino) but I do not believe the story to be fit of the characters.\\n\r\nAnother thing that is quite bothering is the fact that the characters join the club to change their personalities but they end up staying  completely the same, so as far as character development goes, I'd say it's pretty weak.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I do believe it's worth is between 6-7, and I wish the story had been better developed. People should definitely give it a try, but do not expect romance or any adventure at all. \\n\\n\r\nIf you disagree on any point I've made, please send me a personal message as I am looking forward to improve my reviews. Any type of critiques would help, hope you guys have a good time with the anime and fully apreciate it unlike me :)",

            "content": "Story: \r\nWell it's a romantic comedy, so really there is no \"plot\". Like all rom-coms, the interest here is the character development, romance, and comedy\r\nCharacter development: Not much. I'd like to say I'm kidding but the characters really didn't develop much in the course of the show. They remain the same archetypal characters throughout the course of the show. They get over their \"trust issues\", but then act the same as they did before. Also it's worth nothing that the show really just ends on them being \"friendly\" and not close friends.\r\nRomance: NONE. I mean fucking nothing. No dating, no kissing, not even really anyhinting tbh. This show ends on a note of fucking nothing happening between him and his \"love interest\". The most \"blushing\" moments in the show are thanks to the trap Saika.\\n\\n\r\nComedy: It's not funny. The jokes are limited, not really tasteful, and there isn't any good \"ridiculous scenarios\". It's probably the most unfunny rom-com I've ever seen. I cannot stress this enough, there is no comedy in this romantic comedy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: This anime did nothing new in the romantic comedy genre as far as plot or themes. Everything that has been done here has been done before and better.\\n\r\n===================\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nI love animation. This show looks awful. It's got animation from pre-2007, any action scenes are done horribly, and every character shows practically no emotion throughout the show. Not only that, i'm utterly surprised how lazy it all looks. I mean there is \"we didn't have a budget\" and then there is \"we didn't care\".\\n\\n\r\nNote: Romantic comedies are generally of highest animation quality, however this is below average for any genre. \\n\r\n==========================\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: The soundtrack is just like the animation: Lazy, below-average, and not good.\\n\r\n==========================\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n(Note: I had to look up most of their names because I honestly didn't care for any of them by the end of 13 episodes).\\n\\n\r\nHikigaya, Hachiman: A fucking asshole who is negative about everything for really pathetic reasons. Of course pessimism in any situation will have some truth to it, but being anti-anything for the sake of it gets old really fast. I thought in the start he was kinda interesting, but it turns out the guy is just a fucking asshole. I cannot stress how ridiculously pessimistic and pathetic the MC is of this show, so here are some examples:\\n\r\n-Calls Yui a bitch before the audience has but 30 seconds to know her.\\n\r\n-Is an asshole to a guy who really doesn't deserve it(tennis scene).\\n\r\n-Constantly rejects everyone on everything \"just because\".(note: this does not change.)\\n\r\n-Is pessimistic beyond rationality. Like he's a walking trope of \"how can you look at this scenario in a negative light.\"\\n\r\n-Remains the same archetype(pessimist) throughout the show and acts accordingly to any situation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYuigahama, Yui: The only one who actively showed interest in the main character. Airhead.\\n\r\n-Not much else to say, that's her archetype and that's all she does/is.\\n\\n\r\nYukinoshita, Yukino: The perfect girl. Pretty, athletic, smart. Talks down to everyone, blames people who are envious of her on why she joined the club, and is really kind of a bitch tbh.\\n\r\n-Again, archetype.\\n\\n\r\nTotsuka, Saika: Honestly the only character that I liked. But....really all they did was take a cute/moe girl and call her a guy. That's all she is.\\n\\n\r\nSaki: Unimportant side character who's only point is a subplot of her job to support her family\\n\r\n-Nothing to say, she only really exist for but one episode\\n\\n\r\nThe Teacher: Another lazy archetype/trope, nothing to see here, move along.\\n\r\n======================\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: This anime is awful in all regards.\\n\r\n-There is no comedy, no romance, and all the characters are boring\\n\r\n-The animation and sound are both incredibly lazy/poor. \\n\\n\r\nONE GOOD THING: If I had to state one good thing about this show would be that it caught me by surprise. Every romance anime I have ever seen tries to deviate from the normal/average highschool-romance in some way, even if by a little. But this show made no attempts at that, leaving me surprised that a show would actually run from start to finish with nothing surprising happening along the way.\\n\\n\r\nI do not recommend this anime to anyone.",

            "content": "'Fake people have an image to maintain, real people just don't care!', TRUE indeed.\r\nBasically, this show is centered about a loner called Hikigaya Hachiman, NOT a very attractive name or looks for the protagonist, BUT then again those are the points about which the whole story of this show rotates. It is the personality and the 'real' image of this guy that makes this story one of the most unique things ever!!\r\nThen we have the heroin - 'the-ice-cold-beauty', Yukino Yukinoshita, another loner. The 'self made' Miss perfectionist, the healer of anyone's problems. The rebellion against the society. Although behind all the facade and beauty covers,even this young woman has her own problems, problems which no one is aware of, nor does she want anyone to be aware of because according to her - 'relying on people is a weakness'.\\n\\n\r\nThey are later joined by the happy-go-lucky-always-friendly Yui Yuigahama, who is having her own problems. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is by far one of the best anime I've ever seen. The first thing that fits this show right is that it's totally unique. And of course as the name itself, suggests - not your usual teen romantic comedy!, and indeed it isn't the usual sappy teen romance story, the kind of love at first sight or other idiotic themes like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe show probes into more deep and realistic themes. The philosophy of the main character is something that everyone is aware of in their day-to-day lives, but they never have enough courage or understanding to speak it out loud. Hikigaya Hachiman may very well become, the favorite character of any individual watching this show. His realistic+pessimistic take on life, BANG ON ! potraits everything about life. The truth of relationships, the number of masks that people go around wearing, and the time to time loner 101.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has it's HILARIOUS moments, Romantic moments and seriously making-you-reflective-on-life moments. With awesome art ( although season does even better in that section), music and amazing story, this si one to watch before you die. NO, let me rephrase it - ' You HAVE to watch it before you die!'.",

            "content": "\"My Romantic Youth Comedy Is Wrong As Expected\" is quite an attention grasping title wouldn't you agree? Most romance stories are non-realistic times a thousand. True love rarely exists and people don't always end up (usually don't end up) with the person they think they love. In real life, a hot girl doesn't suddenly like the main character because he's \"weak, innocent and kind\" like a lot of shows seem to portray. Life in school seems to be so great and wondrous in anime when at times it really isn't in reality. This show takes full advantage of taking a different route than most romancecomedy stories do by adding more realism and pessimism into the characters/story. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the most pessimistic, cynical and biggest misanthrope anime character I've ever seen in anime named Hachiman Hikigaya and his life in school. He is a loner and he doesn't have any friends, not that he wants to have friends to begin with. He believes that everything in the world is made of lies and he doesn't want to take part in anything related to the world (wtf right?...) But he ends up being forced to join a club - Volunteer Service Club - and it all goes from there.  The story isn't your usual romance-comedy since it doesn't focus primarily on romance but more on the main characters view of life and the world - which is something along the lines of \"This world sucks\". An intriguing aspect of the series is it's themes of life: its important not to always tackle every problem with a kind attitude as Hikki's foil (every character is a foil for each other really) the extremely kind Hayato Hayama finds out. When he enters the club meets the club's single member, a girl named Yukino (more somewhat foils). The two immediately dislike each other yet it is clear even at the start that they are very similar in attitude but go about their problems in entirely different ways. The conflict between Hayato, Yukino and Hiki is clever and well constructed as they both foiling roles as they always take different paths to solving problems. Hiki being the cynical and lonely person that he is slowly discovers that there's more to life than just being alone... Or maybe not. Anyways blah blah blah Hiki's (and others) portrayal of life is basically the story.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of anime characters fall into stereotypes, especially in a high school setting. The main character is usually some innocent pure guy who is loved by 2 girls. He has that one chill or crazy best friend who joins in on the love square. The 2 girls, one is usually some mean girl who'll end up with the main character because they \"complete\" each other since one is mean and other is nice. Then the nice, kind girl will never convey her feelings to main character, and eventually end up with the main characters best friend or something... However, the characters here are different. Hachiman Hikigaya, is a lead that is one of the most interesting and realistic. He is a pessimist, he sees the worst in people, he hates life and is the true definition of a loner/misanthrope. He has no interest in others and for the most part ignores everyone. How wonderful right? What really makes this series is Hikigaya as we see the world through his eyes. One of my favorite aspects of his character is that he's genuinely kind on the inside, sort of. He'll sometimes purposely make himself the bad guy or take the fall for everyone else despite not caring. There are some characters that know about this so it's not all annoying that he does this for no reason kind of thing. The other female characters foil him perfectly. Beautiful chemistry between the characters. There's like a new character introduced every episode, and each one is pretty unique but... I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound of the anime were decent. The voicing cast was decent and the openings were decent. There really was no music in the show though so meh... And the art was definitely high quality for a rom-com show. But the characters all look decent but the lack of details make them very plain. And compared to other high-quality rom-com shows like Sakurasou, this wasn't as colorful and bright but I didn't mind it because it was a pretty dark, pessimistic story for a rom-com. Hiki's dead fish-eyes were funny though, they fit his character well~ ^o^\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this anime, to the point where I watched it all in one day (sad I know). It really had my attention primarily because I could sort of relate to the protagonist (in the sense that sometimes although I'm not depressed or cynical , I think about how pointless life can be and annoying/disgusting some human beings can be) which is really rare in an anime. The other characters are all enjoyable, the comedy is funny for the visuals is worth looking at (yes, there are beautiful females). Despite having beautiful girls and being a modern-day romance comedy, there is no fan service which really was refreshing to see. This story is a great watch for romance-comedy lovers and cynical people in general.",

            "content": "High school is probably the definition of hell for every teenager. It is a place where kids are told they're stupid, are admired only for their looks, whose grades tell them that they won't amount to anything, are bullied by jocks, and are laughed at for what they wear or say. High school is shit. It is a place filled with ignorant condescending pricks who isolate individuals based on how they look, what they wear, or what they do. Rarely do these \"jocks\" (in other words, the kings and queens of the pricks) come to know someone before they judge. Make a mistake around themand you're permanently excluded from anything and everything \"exciting\" or \"cool\" that happens. Rarely do you find a friend in high school that likes you for you, and not because of your wealth, social circle, or looks. Oregairu is a show that dives deep into these interactions and friendships. A show whose dialogue will leave you speechless, and whose characters are so real and likeable that you just can't stop watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOh well, that was my rant on the school system. On to the review!\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOregairu was animated by a studio called Brains Base, a company known for producing shows like Spice and Wolf II, Baccano, and Durarara. Needless to say, the animation was great. Fluid graphics, complete with palatable character designs and simple backgrounds easily score the show an 8/10. The sound in this show was great. Piano music, along with an amazing OP (that is bound to get stuck in your head) makes me award this show with an 8/10 there too.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThere isn't much of a definite plot line here. It's really just a slice of life show. My biggest complaint here is that they mislabeled the show as a romance. If you're thinking of watching this show because you expect there to be romance, look elsewhere. Aside from implied romantic interests, nothing,not even the slightest bit of development, happens here. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are realistic and unique. None of that stereotypical crap you find in countless other shows in the genre. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nAnd thus, I end this brief review by saying that Oregairu paints a deep and dark portrait of the truth behind today's high schools. The interactions and dialogue between Hachiman and the other characters hit home, which is why this show is one of my favorite shows of all time. (Enjoyment 10/10, Overall: 9/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\n* Written by a current high school student.\\n",

            "content": "When you first see the cover or synopsis of this anime, most people would probably think it's the typical romantic comedy with the main guy character being surrounded by typical, beautiful two female characters. You'll probably expect some love sequence to pop up now and then and for some confessions to take place. I just want to clear this up to the people who are thinking of watching this anime that this is not your typical \"romantic\" slice of life anime. \r\nIt's going to be very difficult for me to try and explain without having to spoil anything so please try to bear with me.\\n\\n\r\nStory - I don't understand why this is labeled under romance and comedy. Despite all the little jokes that happen now and then, this anime does not make humor nor romance ever an objective. Typical romantic comedy animes (like Toradora, Sakurasou no pet na kanajo, and Clannad) always cling onto the typical cliche \"boy meets girl\" and \"boy and girl get to know each other and fall in love\". Although this anime doesn't seem to make an effort to try and diverge from the set up of this cliche, what's different about this anime is that it's actually realistic. This anime pulls a middle finger to all of those frustrating dramatic scenes and all the heart-wrenching confusion by simply not letting any of those situations occur at all. Have you ever been so angry at the characters for making stupid choices? Have you ever been frustrated at how some characters just won't confess? Or have you ever been annoyed at how stupid and pointless most of the confusion occurs from? If you answered yes to all these, then this is definitely an anime that will satisfy you by eliminating all of those annoying elements (even though it's fun to watch sometimes). \\n\\n\r\nThe reason, however, I gave the Story a 7 is because there really is no story. This is an anime about a high school club called the Service Club with only three members, a loner named Hachiman, a beautiful perfectionist named Yukino, and an awkwardly pathetic girl named Yui, trying to help people at their school \"change\". For those who have not watched this anime yet, all I'm going to say is that \"do not let the synopsis fool you\". What may happen will not happen and what may not happen will happen. It was awkward for me the first time I watched it, but after seven episodes, I realized \"this definitely is not your typical anime\". \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - This is the strongest thing that makes up a big portion of this anime. The main characters are very realistic and surprising in their own way. This is one of the first animes I have ever seen in which the \"social outcast\" cliche has actually been nailed spot on. There is no other character as cynnical, pessimistic, yet so intelligent as Hachiman Hikigaya. Though his indifference to a wide number of things tend to be disinteresting the first few episodes, as each episode goes by you get to truly understand why he acts the way he is and how his mind works. He may just be one of my favorite slice-of-life animes just because I've never watched a character so honest and realistic as him. Everything he says is either painfully true or painfully wise either way there's a sad kind of pain that comes with it. It's entertaining to say when the other main character, Yukino, always argues with him since they're both so intelligent. What's even more fascinating is that even though Yukino and Hachiman are so wise in their different ways, Yui is the only one with friends and a regard for true friendship. It is these kinds of values each character has that differentiates the quality of the story and teaches a painful lesson about the way society works. In short, realistic characters tell a realistic story. \\n\\n\r\nArt - The art isn't as different as you expect. It's not marvelous and it's not boring. What is somewhat different is the way they do the character's eyes and I find it impressive how it totally signifies how each character looks. Hachiman has got this dead eyes and oftentimes was thought of as a ghost or \"dead\" frequently in the anime. It shows how indifferent and observant he is to the things around him. Yukino's eyes are that of determination and somewhat overbearing cockiness. She knows she's perfect and talented and never had her eyes showed a sense of weakness (or have we?). Yui's eyes are big and round and symbolize her optimism and cheerfulness in the world. She tends to always be the one having fun when Yukino and Hachiman aren't. The banner itself is what's also interesting to me. Hachiman is the only one facing the other way as definition of his lonely nature, whereas Yukino takes up half of the poster with her overbearing confident look, while finally there's Yui, keeping up her cheerful look. Even though the art is not perfect, I truly feel that the artists kept in mind more of an objective approach rather than an aesthetic one.\\n\\n\r\nSound - I didn't really pay much attention to the sound effects or anything, but as for the voice actors, I think each character did a good job in playing their roles perfectly. The intro song is pretty good and catchy, yet the lyrics doesn't seem to encapsulate the anime's theme or synopsis (I could be wrong). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - As for the enjoyment, I guess you could say it was good watch. In all honesty, I zoomed by these 13 episodes real fast and I don't really have a reason as to why that is. It could be the quirkiness or the characters that just tend to entertain me. I really enjoyed Hachiman and Yukino as characters because they're so unconventionally different and progress the story by just being themselves. Hachiman has his badass moments and when you watch this anime you'll know what I'm talking about. Another thing I really enjoyed were the various scenarios the Service Club had to go through to meet and help new people. As much as I want to say I really really enjoyed this, as you can tell, I can't really give one solid reason. You just got to watch it yourself and take what you think was very enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it an 8. \\n\r\nAwesome characters, super unique, and totally changes your views on what you expect of a romantic comedy anime, even if it may be a misnomer. \\n\\n\r\nHope this review was helpful to you guys and gives you a sense of what kind of anime \"Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru\" is!",

Based solely on this season, you may see some feelings being developed, but they are more likely to be a feeling of friendship than of love.\r\nSnafu touches upon the point of view of those lying on the outskirts of the social society with Hikigaya Hachiman. It is implied that Hachiman has been an an outcast for as long as he remembers, but he doesn't see it an a hindrance. After his encounter with an enthusiastic teacher,he's forced to join the service club, where the show introduces the main ladies of the show, Yuki Yukinoshita and Yui Yuigahama. \\n\r\nOverall this show was quite enjoyable. While it seems carefree and cute, there are moments when the things Hikki said really made me think and for that I loved it even more.\\n\\n\r\nStory; 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed seeing an anime from an outcasts point of view.

But anyhow,\r\nHachiman isn't your average main character, unlike NHK's MC he isn't trying to overcome his predicament of not fitting in, he is aware of it though. Unlike Log Horizon's MC he isn't gifted with wits, though they both have a commonality in giving someone else the credit for all they have done, because the other person is more charismatic and thusfits what society believes. What this MC has is practicality, he is realistic, and defines the world as a pessimistic world. Although for some reason I feel like he has great faith in it, but I can't back this. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the story he will tackle problems (social) and provide solutions and what is annoying is that in real life that is how it would go down. You won't get action from this anime nor will it get you jumping out of your seat, but you will enjoy it because of how well it flows and makes you think.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of romance, even though it is tagged with it and has it in its name, it is very slight, if it is even there. And when it will come it might turn this whole anime around as it may interfere with some friendships, this is no harem that is for sure, so there must be conflict, so that might be interesting to watch too.\\n\\n\r\nThe other MC is Yukino, she is smart, beautiful and pretty much perfect and thus ostracized by society and again is aware of her situation and thus just mocks human society openly, for its cruelty. \\n\\n\r\nThe third MC (Yui) is a direct contrast to both of them. She is normal, in all ways. And that is her role. I don't exactly know how else to describe her.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime will be far from boring, it might not be a favorite for everyone, but it is definitely worth a shot. It has content.",

            "content": "A shining example of an anime with a premise that has much potential, yet is wasted in favor of the same anime cliches we see in every other show as well as characters too inorganic to care about.\r\nStory: 5\r\nI'm willing to go out on a limb here and give the story a 5, because I can see what the writers wanted to achieve in this anime, and near the end, some literary substance came into the light in a way that made me start to care about the MC, but you have to slog through the first 10~ episodes of boring cliches and annoying charactersto get to that point. The overarching theme that I took away from this show was how social nuances and the individual's role in the social hierarchy play an important part in the balance of social harmony, and how even the social outcast, the one who sees through the veil and rejects its grasp, cannot escape the important part they play in this social environment. I get the feeling that if this premise was put in the hands of a studio more focused on creative writing then it could transform into something very remarkable in more ways than one, but of course, this is not the case with this anime. Instead, we are treated with a slice-of-life styled episodic progression with only little bits and pieces of character internalization sprinkled here and there in a couple episodes. Not enough to make me think highly of the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nIf I had one suggestion to the writers on how to improve the anime, it would be to combine Hachiman Hikigaya and Yukino Yukinoshita into a character called Hachiman Hikigaya. Yukino anchors the show from reaching any real literary merit by being the most pretentious and annoying character charged with being \"the smart one\". You KNOW the writers tried shoehorning her into the story: a beautiful looking girl who is very intelligent and in very athletic shape and is perfect in every way imaginable, yet during middle school, some jealous students would frequently hide her shoes, which is why she is *somehow* a bigger recluse than Hachiman. And Hachiman's reaction to her telling him all this? Something along the lines of: \"Wow, you must've had a hard life.\" No. Not in the slightest. This is downright lazy character design. Her flawless personality is only half of what makes her so annoying. The other half comes up whenever she \"analyzes\" a person or a situation, creating these abhorrently false presumptions based on absolutely no evidence or prior knowledge. She is always \"right\" in everything she says or does because the writers just make all the characters agree with her regardless of their personality or disposition towards her, or even just how stupid and incoherent she is. If you would take just one moment to step back and actually listen to what she says, it's borderline comical at how dumb these scenes are. I could go in-depth with all the side characters, but all you really need to know is that their social problems, much like the whole show in general, has a lot of potential to be good writing on social life in the emotionally charged environment of a high school, yet is bogged down by bad anime tropes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 4\\n\\n\r\nThe art is slightly decent in comparison to other shows in the genre, though I'm not sure if that's really saying much. Thus music is flat and uninteresting, much like the show itself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nI obviously don't like it, though I stuck around till the end just to see if they could make any last ditch effort to expand on its themes. To a small extent, it did, but not nearly enough to compensate for the rest of the anime. for those wanting a decent story, this show leaves much to be desired.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nJust once, just ONCE I would like to see an anime made in the 2010's that isn't marred by all of today's cut-and-paste cliches and extremely used character archetypes and instead focusing on telling an actual, gripping story that involves organic and believable characters. When looking up this anime for the first time, it looked like your everyday cookie-cutter anime, which it was. Yet there was a little something there that made me wish this particular anime was in the hand of a different studio, in the hopes that they would've polished and improved the story, centered around a story that involves real human problems, carried by real human characters.",

There are two female main characters and a male character. Male character is an outcast. One of the female characters is the school's most beautiful girl. How original. But when I finished the first episode of this anime. I realized that this was something else. Something that manages to stray away from the norm and become something really special.\r\nStory- Now the story centers around Hikigaya Hachiman. A high school student who is shunned by pretty much the whole school.Luckilythis suits him perfectly as he prefers to be a loner and doesn't want to make friends. But his \"happy\" life soon crumbles as his teacher forces him to join a club which is supposed to help people with their problems.Even worse, the club also has the smart and beautiful   \"ice-cold Beauty\" Yukino Yukinoshita.(nicknamed that for her cold personality). Hilarity ensues. \\n\r\nNow the story basically revolves on the club helping out on peoples' requests and problems. Although the problem's are simple the way the main characters solve the problem isn't. The comedy usually revolves around Hachiman and Yukino's witty dialogue and sarcasm.(which is really funny btw).\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art was good most of the time. Backgrounds were filled with radiant colors and were nicely drawn.Character designs were also done well and fit well with the personalities of the characters. There was an episode or two where there was a small drop in animation. But all in all it's pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The sound was quite impressive. The soundtrack fits in really well with the anime. The opening \"Yukitoki\", is a really catchy song and I had myself humming to it in the shower for days after I listened to it. The ending, I'm afraid. Wasn't as well but is adequate for an ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-Now this is where Oregairu excels the most. \\n\r\nLet's begin with Hikigaya Hachiman. Hachiman's twisted view of life and society are definitely one of the most captivating view's of life that i've ever seen. His views of life actually affected my way of viewing life. His monologues are also enjoyable and show off a bit more of his personality. \\n\\n\r\nYuki Yukinoshita is almost the complete opposite of Hachiman. She is smart, beautiful, and rich.But the interesting thing is. She doesn't have friends either. But unlike Hachiman her reason for not having friends is her icy demeanor and being too perfect. She unlike Hachiman believes that change is a good thing. Her smart remarks are funny and her quarrels with Hachiman are hilarious. Over all she is also a nice character.\\n\\n\r\nYui Yuigahama at the start  would seem to be a completely stereotypical character.Although I couldn't say I loved her as much as I loved the other two main characters I would have to admit that without her in this anime this anime wouldn't be as good. She serves as the glue that keeps the club together. Her character does develop to be more independent and helpful. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end Oregairu really did turn out to be a good series. What I thought would be a stereotypical romcom anime turned out to be something more than that. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who watches anime.",

            "content": "Yahari Ore isn't the first anime to tackle the anti-social protagonist,  but it certainly captures it perfectly with its characters and deadpan writing. Like others have said before, you may go into this expecting a typical rom-com but will instead come out of it lashed by the harsh views of our characters. This however, is why this anime stands out from so many in the genre. It's charming, funny and yet bluntly realistic. Far too often rom-coms get stuck in the fairy tale realm of romance stories, or get too wrapped up in the emotional drama/turmoil that can be present in youthful romance. Thoseelements are fine. But what about the bitter, and rejected? Or those that aren't allowed to fit in, or who choose not to fit in. \\n\\n\r\nNot everyone of course has had this experience, but it's certainly something that people experience. And so this is what Yahari Ore does best, it gives us a perspective of those in school who have been rejected so much, they decide to play by their own rules, and that of course is excluding everyone else from the game. Afterall, it's much easier to get on by when you only have yourself to rely on. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime doesn't preach to the audience. And certainly, the view points of these characters are sometimes flawed. But it's an interesting look at how some people deal with their failure to connect to others (or rather, what can happens to someone when people reject and shut them out). Yahari Ore also looks at it from the other perspective, and isn't trying to paint one side as the victim/aggressor. We get a look at how mean and cruel we can be to each other when trying to fend for ourselves by fitting to the status quo. But this is true of both the rejected and those that reject. \\n\\n\r\nAt its core this show is very funny. The MC's biting sense of humor and harsh views of the world is hilarious (even if it always has an underlining seriousness to it). And to be clear, this isn't a serious drama. However, my praise focuses so much on the serious elements of the show, because I think that is what elevates this to a truly great Anime vs. a typical comedy. There is a lot of truth to this show, and it feels very realistic. Through the lens of the MC's harsh view on the world, we get a deep look at social behaviors and how often everyone is just trying to be something that won't be shunned from the pack. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are someone looking for a romance anime to watch, this might not be it. The romance in this anime isn't non-existent, it's actually well written in a realistic manner (it doesn't fall into the typical tropes). However, if you are looking for romance with a lot of action, then you might be let down. The romance in this anime is more about feelings, and how they can grow towards others. This is to say, the romance feels like something special here, but you will not get any closure or sweeping action between specific characters (maybe later in the LN or if we get a season 2). Although I don't think that's what this anime is about, as ultimately its focus is more on how people internally deal with their emotions, and the fear of sharing them with others. \\n\\n\r\nYahari Ore is an example of why comedy is such a great asset to art. Comedy allows us to look at aspects of life that aren't always good and allows us to examine the darker aspect of our humanity, and laugh while also getting a better understanding of it. Yes, this is a comedy that is for the most part, snarky, sarcastic and deadpan. But it's also a very interesting perspective on how we treat other people, and how those that don't fit in, (or those that choose not to play the game and try to fit in), deal with a world that heavily relies on being social.",

            "content": "\"Some walks you have to take alone.\"\r\nSomewhere along the way, I read that quote. The source is unknown to me, but I found that it struck key point in life. Well, I guess I can't generalize and say everyone's life, but I would say most people have had times they felt they couldn't count on anyone. Life is full of things that make us want to isolate people we don't understand and make us want to quit life. High school is full of those moments, those \"emotional roller coaster\" kind of moments. Basically, it can be related to my understanding of  Oregairu, I'll kindof explain...kinda later on. Maybe. Derp.\\n\\n\r\nStory - Meet Hikigaya Hachiman, pessimistic protagonist. Alliteration wins the day. Just kidding. Basically, this romantic comedy is centered around this social outcast. Along with Yuigahama and Yukinoshita, these three characters make up the main cast. Of course it's easy to start assuming and stereotype this as the \"usual\" romcom. I beg to differ. The premise for the story isn't super original. I'll admit that. But again, most things aren't. What might have been another generic and boring romcom with mediocre ratings actually was just a disguise. After watching the first episode, I began looking forward to the next week. As I sat myself down each week to watch Oregairu, I realized just how well done the entire story was. Pacing-wise, I thought it was perfectly fine. There are minor issues, but none that truly sparks any debate.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Here was the biggest \"fuck yeah\" moments I've ever had. The characters in this show were phenomenal. Let me explain: from start to finish, how they started off as, how they developed, and the amazing interaction between the characters, especially Hikki and Yukinoshita, were just amazingly done. There really isn't a show I enjoyed more than this based solely on character development. Gotta love the bantering back and forth.\\n\\n\r\nTruly, there are some gems of knowledge we can all learn from. Hikki, pessimistic and messed as he may be, truly understands the world far better than most of the other characters in the show. Despite his twisted views on life, he tries his best to help others. Not always in the nicest way, but definitely in a way that is effective. Throughout the show, there was nothing more captivating than listening to Hikki's thought process and views on life. \\n\\n\r\nI won't go into too much details about the others, but know this: the premise for each character is nicely brought out and it truly was the highlight of the entire show. The characters I mean. Interactions were perfectly portrayed and drew us in. How nice of them. I laughed my ass - pardon my language - off so many different times throughout the show just because of how well the interaction of the characters. Truly a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nArt -  Ah, I really was a little turned off by the art. Throughout the entire show, there was some episodes where it just didn't look great. But it isn't so bad to the point I wouldn't watch it. Somehow, as I watched more and more, I cared less and less. It was quite colorful, I'll admit. All in all, it wasn't something bad, I just thought they could have done better. But really now, who cares about some subjective views of a random young adult? Probably not you. \\n\\n\r\nSound - Well, I must admit that the opening was something I never skipped. I really enjoyed listening to it. And throughout the show, the soundtrack really fit well for the mood. I have nothing bad to say about it. Though I must confess I never stayed for the ending. \\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing the show, that quote really hit me. Not so much about what it meant, but that quote truly was something that describes Hikki so very well. He truly understands the meaning of \"walking alone\" and just doing what needs to be done. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, I gave this show a 9/10. I couldn't part to give it anything higher because despite how much I liked it, there were some parts that I couldn't enjoy (like my subjective views on the art and stuff but anyway). Despite all that, and minor details, it was a show I thoroughly enjoyed. Don't let the long name fool you, Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru, or \"My youth romantic comedy is wrong as I expected\", or Oregairu. Whatever you may call it, this show truly is one worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended. Highly. Yeah. Awesomeness. Now go watch.",

Did the girls all swarm you and fawn over what you did? Were you always the \"popular\" kid?... No? Me neither, and that's why I enjoy this anime. \r\nThe anime revolves around protagonist Hikigaya Hachiman who is a entirely rejected and remarked as \"gross\" by those who know him. His goal in his high-school life is to remain a loner and to avoid making friends. He does what he can to make himself unnoticeable by his classmates and he doesn't drawattention towards himself. \\n\\n\r\nHowever you can only remain a loner so long before some event comes around and forces you to end up stuck with other people. In a normal high-school, that would probably be a group project, which ends shortly and you can return to your loner style of life, but Hikigaya isn't so lucky, as he is forced into a club in which his goal along within the female protagonist is to fulfill people's requests.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is a great slice-of-life. It portrays perfectly how a loner feels and acts in a school environment, and it's hilarious to watch the protagonist attempt to fit in with the club he's stuck in. The comedic aspect of the anime focuses highly on the use of sarcasm, so if you're a fan of sarcastic comedy then I definitely suggest you give this anime a watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe character progression lacks a little, but I can't say too much as I have only seen a few episodes so far, and there is hints that it will reveal more about the how the characters turned out the way they did. Aside from progression however, the way the characters act serves for a great laugh and if you're a loner yourself you'll find yourself really relating to the protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound does a great job of fitting the mood of each scene, and there are even some moments where it can express the sarcastic remorse within a scene of constant sarcastic dialogue, so that no scene gets stale even if there is continued dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful, the characters look great and the scenery is always well drawn. They don't move much out of the school, but when they do venture out (such as to the mall in an episode) you can see just how fantastic the art is. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy this anime, and if you enjoy slice-of-life comedies I feel you would too, so check it out! \\n\\n\r\n- Shane M",

            "content": "My youth romantic comedy is wrong as I expected. But my expectations were not.\r\nSpring \u201cblesses\u201d us with yet another highschool anime about a guy who comes into contact with a bunch of girls in a school club.\r\nWhat started out generic also ended generic and nothing of value has been gained.\r\nIt\u2019s not only sad for the industry but also sad for Brains Base to produce such a subpar work, when in the past they were responsible for great shows like Baccano and Mawaru Penguindrum.\r\nStory/Content:\r\n\u201cYahari\u201d has no overall story, it\u2019s just about a boy named Hikigaya and his school life. The show goes in no direction, buildsup no goal to aim for, no romance no drama, no big lesson. While other slice of life school romcoms have at least something to aim for like, graduation, a romantic relationship or a different goal in life, Yahari stays true to slice of life and just shows us character interactions and some events.\\n\\n\r\nIf it doesn't have a story, does it have anything else to offer?\\n\r\nYes and no.\\n\r\nWhile shows without story have normally things like, great artwork, soundtrack, interesting characters, settings or concepts. None of this was found in Yahari, the jokes were sometimes funny and sometimes you didn\u2019t care. I was wondering why I am even watching this anymore as it was clear nothing was going on. It revolved around the same thing the entire time without any clear path to go. Stumbling from one boring school event to the next it felt so dragged out and couldn't keep me interested.\\n\\n\r\nEven for its genre it did nothing new or groundbreaking. There are a lot of better shows similar to Yahari that were at least enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nIt all boils down to Hachiman, the anti-social protagonist with witty comments on the insignificance of school life and school friends. While at first I liked his cynical view on his surroundings as it reminded me of my own view on school life, it became very dry at some point as it was the same thing over and over.\\n\r\nHe showed no real progression and he alone is not enough to save this anime.\\n\\n\r\nYukino was the other half decent character, she also had a very cynical outlook on life but was a more honorable student than Hachiman. Her personality though stagnated and became boring after a while. Besides being cruel and insulting she had nothing else to offer.\\n\\n\r\nYui was a possible love interest for the MC but the show decided to just leave that alone and make absolutely nothing with it. She is just a naive girl and totally bland and boring. Like the rest of the support characters.\\n\\n\r\nSaika was the only one who had an entertaining interaction with the MC but only because of the homosexual tension. Besides that he was a personality less trap just for fan-service.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, if you have no story to offer then please offer an interesting cast. Yahari has only one interesting character and that is not enough to keep me interested and entertained for 13 boring episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nYou know how well Baccano was animated? The surreal art style Mawaru Penguindrum had? Or the pretty colors in Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun?\\n\r\nWell Yahari had absolutely nothing like that.\\n\r\nIt looked so cheap, the character designs were pretty generic and bad executed. The surrounding were so boring to look at, it had no special effects or interesting artistic treats for the eye.\\n\\n\r\nYahari looked just really really generic to borderline bad. I\u2019m confused how Brains Base could produce such a cheap looking show. \\n\\n\r\nReally it fails already in 3 categories, no story, boring character and cheap look...\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nBut it doesn't stop there. The overall soundtrack in Yahari is so forgettable, even bad at points. It\u2019s just such run of the mill music that plays in the background without sticking out for a second.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is good as usual, I would have face palmed if they would have fucked that up as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is terrible and I always skipped it, the ending song is just as bad.\\n\\n\r\nFour Strikes... Yahari what are you doing?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nAs you\u2019d guess from my previous sections, yahari couldn't keep me enjoyed through the course of 13 episode.\\n\r\nWhile I didn't hate it (because then I\u2019d have dropped it without a second thought). I just felt really bored at some point and just finished it so I had it finished.\\n\r\nHere and there it was funny and even entertaining. The start was pretty okay as well, but around the middle it just dropped deeper and deeper into insignificance. Such a boring show, it didn't even had potential it wasted, it was wasted right from the start.\\n\\n\r\nScores:\\n\\n\r\n(Story) Content 3/10\\n\\n\r\nPremise and Setting -1 (highschool boy with highschool girls in a club...)\\n\r\nGenre Execution 0 (sometimes funny but mostly boring)\\n\r\nDialogues and Cleverness 0 (some good dialogues but overall too mundane)\\n\r\nInterest Keeping -1 (nothing was happening!)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonality 0 (weren't too bad)\\n\r\nBehavior and Chemistry 0 (very generic)\\n\r\nDevelopment and Progression -1 (absolutely none)\\n\r\nMotivation and Backdrop 0 (simple)\\n\r\nLikability -1 (even tough 8man was good everyone else as terrible)\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 5/10\\n\\n\r\nArtstyle 0 (generic and boring)\\n\r\nQuality 0 (not impressive)\\n\r\nBackground 0 (boring backgrounds)\\n\r\nCharacter Designs 0 (bad executed and bland looking)\\n\r\nVisual Effects 0 (simple)\\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting 0 (normal)\\n\r\nOpening and Ending -1 (terrible)\\n\r\nSoundtrack -1 (unengaging)\\n\r\nSound Effects 0 (normal)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 0/10\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation -1 (bad)\\n\r\nSound -1 (bad as well)\\n\r\nStory and Content -1 (boring)\\n\r\nCharacters -1 (annoying)\\n\r\nValue -1 (an anime without any significance)\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nYahari does nothing new or good in the romcom genre. it\u2019s yet another school anime with an antisocial main character forced to interact with a bunch of girls. The events were mundane, the side characters annoying, art and sound below average. Truly a show not worth of any ones time.\\n\r\nIf you want to watch an enjoyable RomCom try Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun made by the same studio last year. It\u2019s not really great or anything, but by far better than Yahari.\\n\r\nOr why not try out really good ones like ToraDora or Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojou by JC Staff. Even Kyoto Animations Hyouka has more to offer and a similar cool main character.\\n\\n\r\n3,4/10\\n\r\n~3/10 (Very Bad)\\n",

Regardless though, the series is adapted from the light novel of the same name written by Wataru Watari.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, this series took me by quite a surprise. The first episode took off with a rather blend start from my point of view as the series seemed to follow more of a slice of lifish style of narrative. As mentioned before, the series stars a cynical and anti-social young man by the name of Hachiman Hikigaya. He is in his second year at high school but unlike most people who thinks about sports, girls, or academics, he seemingly rejects reality so much that he wishes his existence was never present. He maintains his life as typical with no friends, associates, or a girlfriend. This could be a understandable given his past with how he is often made fun of by his classmates and peers. Even the teacher never stood up to him when the time calls. Poor kid...\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this is about to change because Hikigaya meets a girl who by the name of Yukino Yukinoshita. Unlike him, this girl is completely out of his league. (typical for him huh?) Yukino is seen as a girl who is admired for her beauty, academics, but also with a cold personality. Thus, she earns the title of \u201cIce-cold beauty\u201d. At the same time, she plays the role of the president of a club known as the \u201cservice club\u201d, a club created to help others in need. But of course, a club is difficult to run with just two people right? Well, that's where Yuigahama Yui comes in. On a completely obstacle scale, Yui is cheerful and often puts on a smile while enjoying the times of her life at school. Together, these three forms the trio of this series in a romantic comedy that's depicted as a complete \u201cillusion\u201d under Hikigaya's eyes.\\n\\n\r\nIn this series, I find perhaps the character interactions to be one of the strongest points of the show. In fact, our three main characters gets seemingly gets off to a rocky start in the beginning. Hikigaya stands isolated at many occasions in events while voicing out thoughts in his own mind. He seems to detest romance and likely reality itself. His 'deadfish eyes' represents a physical side of this because in essence, fishes have no personality. In other words, Hikigaya plays the role of a cynical man. Yukino on to other hand seems to have a similar personality and at the same time often makes sarcastic remarks to Hikigaya's responses. Her way of speech mannerisms shows why she earned the nickname \u201cIce-cold beauty\u201d. This side of herself is further illustrated through her brutal honesty. In fact, Yukino is someone who goes against lies and speaks the truth at times no matter how forceful it may be. However, Yukino and Hikigaya does occasionally interact in agreement with various people. This usually relates to their 'love life' where the either of them immediately declares themselves as 'nothing more than friends'. Finally, in my view, Yui represents the middle girl of the trio. She is neither cold or cynical. Instead, she is cheerful and often brings a bright smile to the gloom and doom of the club. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of this series seemingly becomes a problem at first but then, I realized it's not about romance but rather the way these three characters live out their lives through young in their school lives. I'm sure some of us felt this way one point or another in our lives as life seemingly moves way too slow. For Hachiman though, he just wants it to be all over. At the same time however, Hachiman does seem to have some interest in his life. He does seem to find both Yukino and Yui to be attractive in physical terms. However, he doesn't seem to actually want to date them because from his perspective, romance is a false reality; a lie. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance in this series is actually presented in a different way; no random fan service or breast groping. Rather, there's more of a slice of life pacing that depicts our three main characters' daily lives around others and around school as well as other places in later episodes. I personally find the romance in this series to be unique and even at times realistic. Although there's some obvious hints, it's rather presented in a conceptual style through its dialogues. Rather, the dialogues of this series also remains one of the strongest points in all of its episodes. Hachiman reflects them in his mind with his thoughts on the world and those around him. At one point, he goes over a long monologues that depicts his way of thinking against a certain type of girl. It's realistic because it can be related to anyone at school. Yes, I do mean ANYONE.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, there's also seemingly development with all three of our characters. Hachiman seems to change outlooks on himself while also influencing others. Yukino's cold heart also seems to melt at various points as she reveals more of her vulnerable self. Additionally, Yui shows more of her fragile self as well. The dynamic trio plays out their roles in a recognizable way that depicts their characters throughout each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, high school always has to drama to complete the formula right? The drama sometimes comes from the trio of our main characters. At other times, they are influenced by outside parties such as Yumiko Miura, a popular student at school. She and Yukino are like oil and water as the two never seems to get along. Among other factors, there's also drama involving Hachiman and his interactions with others that seemingly puts others in an uncomfortable zone. It's a zone of drama and in this series, it's definitely there.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one of the strongest points I enjoyed in this series is Hachiman's character. His personality is the type of \u201cI don't give a damn\u201d about anything, whether it's himself, others, or even the world around him. At the same time, he has strong opinions about the world. Like I mentioned before, this is usually expressed through his monologues. They have a reflexive sense of language that is philosophical, deep, but at the same time to the point. It illustrates the fact that Hachiman is cynical and at times even mean as demonstrated in one of the conversations he has with Yui. His view on his family also seems to be indifferent as shown through her interactions with his sister. The way Hachiman describes her as \u201cbrat\u201d and \u201cannoying\u201d again reflects his personality. However, I find this to be very well done because it is realistic. It is how siblings act in real life because who am I kidding, no brothers and sisters can get along perfectly. Don't believe me, just take look at Oremio. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, there's also a visual sense on how lonely people behave. The interactions that Hachiman goes through seems to be forced by himself as often or not, he is unwilling to participate unless asked for. Even then, he concedes in a reluctant way. It's not always easy to relate to him but there at many times I find his personality to be refreshing, realistic, and in the way of how his character is portrayed right. He isn't the typical harem protagonist who can't decide on what's right or wrong. Rather, Hachiman is an opinionated young man with his own views on the world. Those views are in the words of his dialogues that makes up the humor and personality of his character. (oh and who am I kidding here, who can ignore those deadfish eyes and antenna like hair?)\\n\\n\r\nThe series does fall under some common themes though despite its refreshment. The concept of 'students forming a club' is not a new idea. Anime series such as Medaka Box, Haganai, and Okami-San and Her Seven Companions has this idea of students coming together at school to form a club to help others or for their own purposes. It's been done before. At the same time, there's also the common sister trope used in this series. Furthermore, this series doesn't avoid some fan service or the 'festival' mood. Although the fan service is toned down, it's still there with the swimsuits, cos-play, and even maid outfits. There's even a trap in this series that distract the viewers and who am I kidding, Hachiman as well with his thoughts. The poor kid sees everything as an illusion and almost at times can't tell differences between fiction and reality. \\n\\n\r\nAs regarding artwork, this series has some generic visuals. However, I find it to fit within the themes of the series by the way it's drawn to be simple and to the point. The most obvious that stands out is Hachiman and his deadfish eyes. In fact, his eyes are never portrayed as normal but rather as the type that stands out the entire show. Am I surprised? Of course not. It fits him perfectly with his cynical personality. Then, there's cold beauty Yukino who is drawn with electric blue eyes and long hair; a true beauty indeed. It's definitely memorable because of how they look so differently from others in the series. It's also important to note that because of their looks, they are different in general. I felt that the mood of this series was achieved with this portrayal of visual artwork. It sets the realism and style of our main characters that are easy to be told apart. It's appealing and this series pulled it off right. There's no stupid deformed characters or inconsistency. It's down to the point and I'm grateful for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series has a light touch to its themes. I felt that the voice actors and actresses did an outstanding job with their performances in their roles. Hachiman's tone is completely straight forward with no hesitation on what's on his mind. His monologues are from his personal thoughts and I felt that Eguchi Takuya did a great performance. The cold tone and brutal honesty is also reflected in the voice of Hayami Saori. Finally, Yui's voice actress protrays the cheerful voice to balance out the trio. The atmosphere of the show is lighthearted and thus the OST remains so as well. It's orchestrated with slow pace and connects everything well. There's that sense of realism to go along with it with that pacing and soundtrack makes it match. The OP song, \"Yukitoki\" by Nagi Yanagi shows montages of the characters and how they come together as the Service Club. Similarly the ED song, \u201cHello Alone\u201d shows more of a bonding that is memorable at heart. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, My Romantic Comedy SNAFU was a refreshing show for me. It's like taking a deep breath and thinking back about youth and school life. It can also be related to many of us who has gone through the high school years along with those experiences of youth. Whether you were the popular kid, the loner, or somewhere the middle, there's always something you can dig out from this series related to school. The main character Hachiman is one of my favorites from the Spring 2013 lineup with his personality. Whether it's his character, his dialogues, or just himself, I loved the way he is portrayed in this series. Of course, I do feel a bit sorry for him as well at various occasions. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, this series stands out as something that definitely in my estimation to spent time on. Even if you don't like the idea of the typical school life setting where a group of kids are in a club doing stuff to help others, I think this series right here may change your mind a bit. It may start off slow paced but that's also how life is. For Hachiman, youth is an illusion. For me, this series' illusion is reality that has been quite an enjoyable experience. After all, we all been through youth with a different outlook, no?",

            "content": "In the minds of many, High School is the time of happy moments and strong memories. People tend to make friends and get involved in many activities, from sports to clubs. And despite the noteworthy drama and hardships that take place in High Schools, High School life is under the spirit that some would call \"youth.\"\r\n(Un)fortunately for Hachiman Hikigaya, he doesn't think so, and he demonstrates that all of that sass about \"youth\" is a mere fabrication to deceive oneself with a false sense of happiness. So our dear fish-eyed and \"gross\" protagonist aspires to conduct his life like a bear-- one that hibernates tocause no trouble nor get into trouble.\\n\\n\r\nSo what makes this anime featuring a dispassionate and social-apathetic loner so interesting? It is the mere fact that this protagonist gives his audience a wild crazy taste on his state of mind!\\n\\n\r\nBut that is what keeps the story from being one of the higher points of this anime. This anime has no ongoing central goal nor plot whatsoever because we've got a very stubborn character who seems immune to character development and brushes everyone off.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, Hachiman is forced into the Public Service Club by his teacher, Shizuka Hiratsuka, who wishes to correct his corrupted behavior. Alongside him, is the beautiful ice queen, Yukino Yukinoshita, who was also \"contained\" in this club for the same intentions, courtesy of Shizuka. We can only imagine what these two misfits can do to make society crumble before their feet.\\n\\n\r\nThus, the club's activities in helping others is what drives the \"plot\" of this anime, but even the most mundane tasks can be made to be rather amusing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's where the characters come in to make things worthwhile. They feature a very colorful cast here with matching personalities. We all seen this before. The busty girl. The trap. The fat otaku. The ojou. The nice guy. The fujoshi. The christmas cake. Etc. \\n\\n\r\nBut when you throw in a nonchalant, social pessimist and an intelligent, sharp-tongued ice queen... hilarity ensues. Or rather, you get amusing and witty dialogue. We see cooking, tennis, and shopping between the wide cast and every word said is like getting hit by a marshmallow or a dagger to the face multiple times.\\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between characters is great, where snark and criticism is passed on like a hot potato. The most happiest characters will fall down to size by the bitterness and scorn of the two main protagonists as they offer their services, unless the other main heroine, Yui Yuigahama, is there to cheer the victim up.\\n\\n\r\nFrom an anime that relies on dialogue and character development to advance the plot, character development does not actually fall too far behind despite stubborn characters.\\n\\n\r\nWe get to see a more insightful and justified side behind Hachiman's deadpan demeanor. And a more gentle and vulnerable side behind that icy exterior of Yukino's. Albeit, it is not that much. But that surely counts. And you can't exactly detest even the most horrible characters because of the level of understanding and empathy that you get from them.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm also trying to get across is that you see why every (almost every) important character acts the way that he or she does. Expect some important backstories and implications between conversations. The emphasis on these corrupted personas is to get you to see things from their perspective, whether their values are acceptable or hard to swallow.\\n\\n\r\nThe few things that clue you in on how deep the characters are, especially Hachiman and Yukino, are found in their conversations. While that should be prominent in every anime, this one seems to stress two different and important personas that everyone can identify with.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to the first episode, it seems that...\\n\\n\r\nHachiman is a person that stays true to himself. He sees change as a running away from your own self.\\n\\n\r\nYukino is a person that wants to start things anew. Instead she views change as a redemption.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when you place these two opposing types of mentality into socially hazardous minds, you will get some pretty deep insightful **** as I've said before. (As far as how long the anime will cover the light novels, I am pretty optimistic). I can't emphasize enough, but this anime follows through beyond what I am expecting here. So much that it is unexpected.\\n\\n\r\nI was expecting humor and problems with romance the first time I laid eyes on the title, but this anime isn't supposed to show the traditional means of romance and comedy. It's supposed to show a deeper aspect here behind the subtle use of fanservice and comedy, and that's what I admire in this anime. It's going about a pace to show why the characters are what they are, and it leaves you hoping that somehow things will get better for every characters' sake.\\n\\n\r\nThe question whether or not the two most stubborn characters in this anime will change for the better or change for the worse is very interesting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI found this anime very enjoyable and laughed at the countless moments of Hachiman's remarks (and references!) to the many quirks of the other characters. The banter between the characters is always amusing with the snarkiness and scorn bouncing about through and over the heads of the friendlier characters. And the monologues are very noteworthy in displaying a character's personality and are especially identified with the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is also backed with very fitting music that sounds like something from a well-done visual novel ranging from expressive piano notes to bass grooves. The sound has a whimsical expression that superbly matches character tones and the clean defined atmosphere touched by the art. Furthermore, the music goes hand-in-hand with Hachiman's monologues and serious recollections. At times, the music and sound will also remind you of the sad and bitter undertones that lie beneath the character's happy expression called \"youth.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is an average highschool romance story. The twist? The main character is repulsive, and intends to stay this way. Otherwise, the series is quite lackluster, and frankly did nothing that stands out in my mind to make it very enjoyable. \r\nStory (7/10):\r\nHikigaya is a die-hard introvert who enters high school that is 100% uninterested in forming a relationship. The plot revolves around him joining the Volunteer Service Club and meeting it's two members, Yui and Yukino. A love interest develops between both, but doesn't get very far due to Hikigaya's nature.\r\nHis adventures constantly involve him being the bad guy, and while there were afew good moments, they were never very outstanding. \\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10):\\n\r\nThe animation was not an eyesore, but it was frankly rather mediocre. It's a bit clear that not too much attention was given to the illustration, although the viewer (probably) won't be bothered too much by this.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\r\nIf I take anything from this series, it's the opening track. I loved that song. Otherwise, the soundtrack isn't anything to brag about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5/10):\\n\r\nThe characters are the very definition of flat; they stuck to their natures 100% of the time and each fulfilled a trite, overdone archetype: the outcast, the floozy girl, the ice-queen, etc. I felt like there could have been more to Yukino's character that lie underneath her surface, but the series did little to explore this. \\n\\n\r\nThe decision to make Hikigaya an unlikable outcast was not the most original choice, and it certainly wasn't the best. He constantly makes a deliberate attempt to make people hate him, and while I recognize this fact, it still bothers me to the point where I cannot care for him.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10):\\n\r\nIt calls itself a romantic comedy, but I didn't find myself laughing very much. On top of this, at no point would I consider this series' attempt at humor outstanding of another. I also didn't care much for the romantic part, or at least what passed for it since Hikigaya rejects all notion of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10):\\n\r\nI came out of this series with few fond memories for it. While opinions may differ on its humorous and light-hearted nature, few can deny that it is rather shallow. If you enjoy a simple, shits-and-giggles anime to watch, you may consider this. If you're looking for something with depth, continue your search.",

Those are the rotten rules of the Kingdom of Children.\r\nQuestion: The world will not change, but you can change yourself. So then, how will you change?\r\nAnswer: You become the god of a new world.\"\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n(Note: This review is SPOILER FREE. Also, for a quick summary refer to the FINAL THOUGHTSsection at the end.)\\n\\n\r\nSociety. Social beings. Human beings.\\n\r\n We are social creatures. We are supposed to interact, we are supposed to communicate, we are supposed to be -for a serious lack of a better term- \"social\". We are supposed to hold back things we want to say even if it is the truth; heck, we even have to lie if that is what society expects of us and if that is what's necessary to maintain the status quo. However, it is hard to do that and more harder to keep it up (which I'm sure all of us can attest). \\n\r\nIt is harder for those who have been labeled by society with a particular tag; who are forced to behave as society expects them to. A loner is forced to stay a loner. A \"weirdo\" is expected (thus forced) to be a weirdo. A \"stupid\" person is expected to say something stupid, and even if he says something sensible, he is still jeered. The funny thing is: the other guys are also expected/(slightly forced) to jeer him. Quicksand is what comes to mind to describe this tag; the more you struggle to get out, the more you are dragged in. Is that how human relations are ? It seems as though, they are not formed as we want them to, they are formed and maintained as they are expected to. Is that how society works? Through expectations?\\n\\n\r\nExpectations: This word is more dangerous than I thought.\\n\r\nAs a testament to it's power, let me make it clear that I didn't EXPECT a \"romcom\" like Oregairu to provoke thoughts such as the aforementioned ones to creep into my little mind. Well, I guess it is important for unexpected things to happen, how else are we gonna escape from the quicksand!!\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nHigh school. The perfect model of the overall human society. In fact, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the high school experience of our adolescent years are what prepares us for the complex and intricate world we call society. \\n\r\nEnter Hikigaya Hachiman, a high school student whose existence doesn't matter to this model society. He has tried and failed in his attempts to become  a \"normal\" part of society. So now he is a loner-by-choice without any friends at all. Certain circumstances (mostly his teacher), forces him to join the \"volunteers\" club which exists to help people to solve their problems. However, the catch is that the club happens to currently have as a sole member -> the most popular (and rightly so) girl in school: Yukinoshita Yukino. Add to that the sweet and exuberant Yuigahama Yui to complete the club and what you get is 100% enjoyment.\\n\r\nThe plot (on a general note) thus consists of this club helping different people with various problems on request.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nIt was fine. Yes, some episodes had drops in the quality, but it wasn't bad enough to be a distraction. In fact, as I'm not the fastidious type, I only barely noticed.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nAverage here too. Liked the opening as well as the ending. Certainly not great ones but still enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nSimply awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe male lead: Hachiman/\"Hikki\" has to be one of the most badass character without a gun, or superpowers or magical powers.... ec cetera. He probably couldn't take out one young man, forget a gang of villains.... but still he is awesome. \\n\r\nHis antisocial lifestyle combined with a pessimistic view has created in him, an ability to understand our society, world and hence our life which is intriguing, almost creepy. He is able to do so only because he is an observer: he is not really a part of society. Being outside it's realm permits him a unique viewpoint that others lack. Truly an admirable character.\\n\r\n\"You say you admire me. I think what you probably admire is how I speak out things as I see them and not care about others, and how I'm unaffected by the people around me. But isn't that because you can emphasize with me, a loner? In that sense, we are the same. That means you are a loner like me. However, your admiration leads me to believe that you are still trying to fit in: you are still affected by other people's views about you. And the cruel fact is you hate yourself for it. Isn't that so?\"\\n\r\nThat is probably how he would respond to my last statement and the creepy thing is that, despite the twisted nature of his views, he is usually spot on.\\n\r\nThe way he handles the problems is also fun to watch as he uses his twisted ideologies to think of unorthodox solutions which are usually quite cruel and in-your-face but effective nontheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe first of the female lead Yukino: She is smart and witty and is not afraid to speak her mind. She is similar to Hikki in that sense. Plus, she is also a loner. However, in her case, it is not by choice. Her perfection (and probably the cold demeanour) is the cause for her circumstances. \\n\\n\r\nThe second of the female leads Yui: She is probably a stereotype of the \"cheerful and bubbly\" type of character, but still her presence is quite important. Without her, the club and probably the anime wouldn't be the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are also important in the sense that they represent the normal views of normal humans. So, they serve to emphasize the contrast between Hachiman's view and that of his peers.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this show tick..\\n\r\n1. Hachiman: his views, monologues and staight-to-the-point methods. In fact, one could make an hour long video with his monologues alone and it would still be highly enjoyable.\\n\r\n2. The interactions between the characters. This is also the highlight of the show. The interactions between the main three characters is top notch. These interactions seemed to develop along with the characters themselves which was great as well. Especially, the conversations between Hachiman and Yukino are highly enjoyable and of course funny as well.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSO,\\n\r\nThe FINAL THOUGHTS\\n\r\ncons: \\n\r\n*Cannot really think of anything significant. The setting is a normal high school, nothing fancy; that might be a turn off for those inclined to fantasy/supernatural settings.\\n\r\n*Maybe the art/animation? for the really observant ones.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nOregairu stands out from the rest of the romcoms because of...\\n\r\n*The male lead: Usually, the male lead is \"kind\", sweet and (for god's sake!) dense too. Here, he is Hikigaya Hachiman. Period.\\n\r\n*The melodrama(i.e the lack of it): Also something I liked. Had it in as small amounts as possible. So, the plot and setting seemed almost able to occur in real life.\\n\r\n*The monologues: Seriously. I recommend printing them and sticking them on the bedroom walls or something. Pure gold.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\nEntertainment: 9.5\\n\r\nEverything else: 8\\n\r\nSo, OVERALL: 8.75 = 9\\n\\n\r\nCapable of changing how we perceive the society and human nature in general. But hilarious at the same time.\\n\r\nHighly recommended to any anime viewer. Especially recommended for the ones who love romcoms (because they are the most likely to be pleasantly surprised ).\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n{P.S; This is my very first review. So, feedbacks and comments (both +ve and -ve) would be highly appreciated.}",

            "content": "I can think of at least 2 things wrong with that title.\r\nIt\u2019s not funny and there\u2019s nothing romantic about it.\r\nThe writters aimed for deadpan sarcastic comedy title, yet they didn\u2019t do their work investigating how successful deadpan comedy Works. You need to have a serious guy and a funny guy to make the comebacks, this doesn\u2019t work if both guys are dead inside.\r\nLest start with the characters shall we?\r\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with an outcast pessimistic boring character, but it becomes terribly wrong if this character has only one face to show up to the audience and shows no growth at all during the whole series.Yes we\u2019re talking about Hachiman, the dead inside \u201call I do is right or at least is the easy/fast way to do kind of guy\u201d. I still haven\u2019t figured out how did I manage to watch all 12 episodes and not die of an aneurysm on his inside monologues. A 2 x 4 wooden plank with a serious face painted on it would have been funnier and even more charismatic than this car\u00e1cter.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow lets talk about Yukino the Ice Queen. At least she shows up some progress at the last episodes of the showing some gratitude and trying hard to strengthen the bonds between her and Yui. But she\u2019s still awfully boring and hard to relate or like at all. Flawless characters aren\u2019t funny at all, there\u2019s no room for improvement. It was so annoying to see her to point out Hiki\u2019s flaws with no retort at all, watch her play tennis better than Serena Williams, up to doing all the planning for the culture festival and also become some rockstar on stage by playing a guitar and singing with no premise to us the viewers. And lets not forget about her sister being some sort top class director a la Fletcher from Whiplash.\\n\\n\r\nYui is probably the most down to earth character from the main cast. She\u2019s fun, thoughtful and a bit of a door mat by trying to fit in with the cool guys, but eventually she\u2019ll make the choice of sticking with the people who atcually care for her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory?\\n\r\nThere\u2019s really no story in it. It\u2019s a stale slice of life trying to stay under the radar throughout highschool days. The writters tried to add some kind of sub-plot on the whole Hikki/Yui backstory about her dog being run-over by a mysterious black limo, but the lazy writters just didn\u2019t care to follow up the story.\\n\\n\r\nArtsyle is just above everage, nothing to be amazed about it, guess it suits the average boring characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is just bare minimum, since most of the shots are just panning stills of Hikki doing his mindboring monologues. There are a few action scenes with more movement involved, but those are quite rare.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know why there are so many people calling this series \u201crealistic\u201d. There\u2019s nothing real about this one, being a pessimistic guy who makes no effort whatsoever to come out of his confort zone always comes back to punish him/her wheter is at work places or among family/friends.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the only times I had some laughs were from the Fujoshi jokes from Ebina. At least the wirtters know the basics of slapstick humor.\\n\\n\r\nDon't waste your time on this one, there are tons of deadpan humor series out there that know how to make memorable characters, like Hare nochi Guu, Seitokai Yakuindomo, or Konosuba to name some series that vary a lot in terms of background and story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Note: This is my first review. The sole reason I am writing this is because I felt that this anime is over evaluted, and it's probably the worst rating I've given.\r\nFirst of all, let's talk about the characters.\r\n -Hikigaya Hachiman - the main character. There is no doubt that this anime has some pretty badass monologues, making you wonder about the possibilities and choices you do in your life. Hikigaya brings joy to this anime, being this \"lone wolf\" who never depends on anyone and never wants trouble. \r\n-Yukinoshita Yukino - the other main character. This girl is very similiar to the Hikigaya, since justlike him, she'd rather be alone than with someone else. She's a famous cute girl who everyone in the school knows, specially because of her sister and successful family well know all over the country or atleast the town.\\n\\n\r\n-Yuigahama Yui -  Your regular semi-popular girl who ends up liking (and I enforce the idea of LIKE) the two \"weirdos\". Unlike Hikigaya and Yukinoshita, she prefers being in a group and fit in perfectly within society.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the sound, not much I can say, I don't take too many notes about it, since it is completely personal.\\n\\n\r\nThe story.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that made me dislike this anime was the fact that Hikigaya, who second to his dialogues, loves himself, and tries to step away from trouble and unpleasure. However, his teacher forces him to join a club in order to be an accepted person in this \"all looks\" society. He ends up meeting Yukinoshita.  \\n\r\nI will not spoil, but I think people should atleast know that this anime pretty much envolves Hikigaya being led around and actually doing stuff, work, that he hates the most. The two girls in the club, Yukinoshita and Yuigahama (Yui entered later) treat him poorly. As far as Yukinoshita goes, she demonstrates hatred towards Hikigaya. In my opinion, his characteristics would make him instantly leave the club but he ends up tolerating all the bullshit put upon him.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as enjoyment goes, I have to say the anime gets pretty dull after the first few episodes. I was expectant and ended up watching the whole anime, and I'm not sure if I regret it or not. It is indeed a great anime when it comes to monologues and dialogues between the two main characters (Hiki and Yukino) but I do not believe the story to be fit of the characters.\\n\r\nAnother thing that is quite bothering is the fact that the characters join the club to change their personalities but they end up staying  completely the same, so as far as character development goes, I'd say it's pretty weak.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I do believe it's worth is between 6-7, and I wish the story had been better developed. People should definitely give it a try, but do not expect romance or any adventure at all. \\n\\n\r\nIf you disagree on any point I've made, please send me a personal message as I am looking forward to improve my reviews. Any type of critiques would help, hope you guys have a good time with the anime and fully apreciate it unlike me :)",

            "content": "Story: \r\nWell it's a romantic comedy, so really there is no \"plot\". Like all rom-coms, the interest here is the character development, romance, and comedy\r\nCharacter development: Not much. I'd like to say I'm kidding but the characters really didn't develop much in the course of the show. They remain the same archetypal characters throughout the course of the show. They get over their \"trust issues\", but then act the same as they did before. Also it's worth nothing that the show really just ends on them being \"friendly\" and not close friends.\r\nRomance: NONE. I mean fucking nothing. No dating, no kissing, not even really anyhinting tbh. This show ends on a note of fucking nothing happening between him and his \"love interest\". The most \"blushing\" moments in the show are thanks to the trap Saika.\\n\\n\r\nComedy: It's not funny. The jokes are limited, not really tasteful, and there isn't any good \"ridiculous scenarios\". It's probably the most unfunny rom-com I've ever seen. I cannot stress this enough, there is no comedy in this romantic comedy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: This anime did nothing new in the romantic comedy genre as far as plot or themes. Everything that has been done here has been done before and better.\\n\r\n===================\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nI love animation. This show looks awful. It's got animation from pre-2007, any action scenes are done horribly, and every character shows practically no emotion throughout the show. Not only that, i'm utterly surprised how lazy it all looks. I mean there is \"we didn't have a budget\" and then there is \"we didn't care\".\\n\\n\r\nNote: Romantic comedies are generally of highest animation quality, however this is below average for any genre. \\n\r\n==========================\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: The soundtrack is just like the animation: Lazy, below-average, and not good.\\n\r\n==========================\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n(Note: I had to look up most of their names because I honestly didn't care for any of them by the end of 13 episodes).\\n\\n\r\nHikigaya, Hachiman: A fucking asshole who is negative about everything for really pathetic reasons. Of course pessimism in any situation will have some truth to it, but being anti-anything for the sake of it gets old really fast. I thought in the start he was kinda interesting, but it turns out the guy is just a fucking asshole. I cannot stress how ridiculously pessimistic and pathetic the MC is of this show, so here are some examples:\\n\r\n-Calls Yui a bitch before the audience has but 30 seconds to know her.\\n\r\n-Is an asshole to a guy who really doesn't deserve it(tennis scene).\\n\r\n-Constantly rejects everyone on everything \"just because\".(note: this does not change.)\\n\r\n-Is pessimistic beyond rationality. Like he's a walking trope of \"how can you look at this scenario in a negative light.\"\\n\r\n-Remains the same archetype(pessimist) throughout the show and acts accordingly to any situation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYuigahama, Yui: The only one who actively showed interest in the main character. Airhead.\\n\r\n-Not much else to say, that's her archetype and that's all she does/is.\\n\\n\r\nYukinoshita, Yukino: The perfect girl. Pretty, athletic, smart. Talks down to everyone, blames people who are envious of her on why she joined the club, and is really kind of a bitch tbh.\\n\r\n-Again, archetype.\\n\\n\r\nTotsuka, Saika: Honestly the only character that I liked. But....really all they did was take a cute/moe girl and call her a guy. That's all she is.\\n\\n\r\nSaki: Unimportant side character who's only point is a subplot of her job to support her family\\n\r\n-Nothing to say, she only really exist for but one episode\\n\\n\r\nThe Teacher: Another lazy archetype/trope, nothing to see here, move along.\\n\r\n======================\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: This anime is awful in all regards.\\n\r\n-There is no comedy, no romance, and all the characters are boring\\n\r\n-The animation and sound are both incredibly lazy/poor. \\n\\n\r\nONE GOOD THING: If I had to state one good thing about this show would be that it caught me by surprise. Every romance anime I have ever seen tries to deviate from the normal/average highschool-romance in some way, even if by a little. But this show made no attempts at that, leaving me surprised that a show would actually run from start to finish with nothing surprising happening along the way.\\n\\n\r\nI do not recommend this anime to anyone.",

            "content": "'Fake people have an image to maintain, real people just don't care!', TRUE indeed.\r\nBasically, this show is centered about a loner called Hikigaya Hachiman, NOT a very attractive name or looks for the protagonist, BUT then again those are the points about which the whole story of this show rotates. It is the personality and the 'real' image of this guy that makes this story one of the most unique things ever!!\r\nThen we have the heroin - 'the-ice-cold-beauty', Yukino Yukinoshita, another loner. The 'self made' Miss perfectionist, the healer of anyone's problems. The rebellion against the society. Although behind all the facade and beauty covers,even this young woman has her own problems, problems which no one is aware of, nor does she want anyone to be aware of because according to her - 'relying on people is a weakness'.\\n\\n\r\nThey are later joined by the happy-go-lucky-always-friendly Yui Yuigahama, who is having her own problems. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is by far one of the best anime I've ever seen. The first thing that fits this show right is that it's totally unique. And of course as the name itself, suggests - not your usual teen romantic comedy!, and indeed it isn't the usual sappy teen romance story, the kind of love at first sight or other idiotic themes like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe show probes into more deep and realistic themes. The philosophy of the main character is something that everyone is aware of in their day-to-day lives, but they never have enough courage or understanding to speak it out loud. Hikigaya Hachiman may very well become, the favorite character of any individual watching this show. His realistic+pessimistic take on life, BANG ON ! potraits everything about life. The truth of relationships, the number of masks that people go around wearing, and the time to time loner 101.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has it's HILARIOUS moments, Romantic moments and seriously making-you-reflective-on-life moments. With awesome art ( although season does even better in that section), music and amazing story, this si one to watch before you die. NO, let me rephrase it - ' You HAVE to watch it before you die!'.",

            "content": "\"My Romantic Youth Comedy Is Wrong As Expected\" is quite an attention grasping title wouldn't you agree? Most romance stories are non-realistic times a thousand. True love rarely exists and people don't always end up (usually don't end up) with the person they think they love. In real life, a hot girl doesn't suddenly like the main character because he's \"weak, innocent and kind\" like a lot of shows seem to portray. Life in school seems to be so great and wondrous in anime when at times it really isn't in reality. This show takes full advantage of taking a different route than most romancecomedy stories do by adding more realism and pessimism into the characters/story. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the most pessimistic, cynical and biggest misanthrope anime character I've ever seen in anime named Hachiman Hikigaya and his life in school. He is a loner and he doesn't have any friends, not that he wants to have friends to begin with. He believes that everything in the world is made of lies and he doesn't want to take part in anything related to the world (wtf right?...) But he ends up being forced to join a club - Volunteer Service Club - and it all goes from there.  The story isn't your usual romance-comedy since it doesn't focus primarily on romance but more on the main characters view of life and the world - which is something along the lines of \"This world sucks\". An intriguing aspect of the series is it's themes of life: its important not to always tackle every problem with a kind attitude as Hikki's foil (every character is a foil for each other really) the extremely kind Hayato Hayama finds out. When he enters the club meets the club's single member, a girl named Yukino (more somewhat foils). The two immediately dislike each other yet it is clear even at the start that they are very similar in attitude but go about their problems in entirely different ways. The conflict between Hayato, Yukino and Hiki is clever and well constructed as they both foiling roles as they always take different paths to solving problems. Hiki being the cynical and lonely person that he is slowly discovers that there's more to life than just being alone... Or maybe not. Anyways blah blah blah Hiki's (and others) portrayal of life is basically the story.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of anime characters fall into stereotypes, especially in a high school setting. The main character is usually some innocent pure guy who is loved by 2 girls. He has that one chill or crazy best friend who joins in on the love square. The 2 girls, one is usually some mean girl who'll end up with the main character because they \"complete\" each other since one is mean and other is nice. Then the nice, kind girl will never convey her feelings to main character, and eventually end up with the main characters best friend or something... However, the characters here are different. Hachiman Hikigaya, is a lead that is one of the most interesting and realistic. He is a pessimist, he sees the worst in people, he hates life and is the true definition of a loner/misanthrope. He has no interest in others and for the most part ignores everyone. How wonderful right? What really makes this series is Hikigaya as we see the world through his eyes. One of my favorite aspects of his character is that he's genuinely kind on the inside, sort of. He'll sometimes purposely make himself the bad guy or take the fall for everyone else despite not caring. There are some characters that know about this so it's not all annoying that he does this for no reason kind of thing. The other female characters foil him perfectly. Beautiful chemistry between the characters. There's like a new character introduced every episode, and each one is pretty unique but... I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound of the anime were decent. The voicing cast was decent and the openings were decent. There really was no music in the show though so meh... And the art was definitely high quality for a rom-com show. But the characters all look decent but the lack of details make them very plain. And compared to other high-quality rom-com shows like Sakurasou, this wasn't as colorful and bright but I didn't mind it because it was a pretty dark, pessimistic story for a rom-com. Hiki's dead fish-eyes were funny though, they fit his character well~ ^o^\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this anime, to the point where I watched it all in one day (sad I know). It really had my attention primarily because I could sort of relate to the protagonist (in the sense that sometimes although I'm not depressed or cynical , I think about how pointless life can be and annoying/disgusting some human beings can be) which is really rare in an anime. The other characters are all enjoyable, the comedy is funny for the visuals is worth looking at (yes, there are beautiful females). Despite having beautiful girls and being a modern-day romance comedy, there is no fan service which really was refreshing to see. This story is a great watch for romance-comedy lovers and cynical people in general.",

            "content": "High school is probably the definition of hell for every teenager. It is a place where kids are told they're stupid, are admired only for their looks, whose grades tell them that they won't amount to anything, are bullied by jocks, and are laughed at for what they wear or say. High school is shit. It is a place filled with ignorant condescending pricks who isolate individuals based on how they look, what they wear, or what they do. Rarely do these \"jocks\" (in other words, the kings and queens of the pricks) come to know someone before they judge. Make a mistake around themand you're permanently excluded from anything and everything \"exciting\" or \"cool\" that happens. Rarely do you find a friend in high school that likes you for you, and not because of your wealth, social circle, or looks. Oregairu is a show that dives deep into these interactions and friendships. A show whose dialogue will leave you speechless, and whose characters are so real and likeable that you just can't stop watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOh well, that was my rant on the school system. On to the review!\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOregairu was animated by a studio called Brains Base, a company known for producing shows like Spice and Wolf II, Baccano, and Durarara. Needless to say, the animation was great. Fluid graphics, complete with palatable character designs and simple backgrounds easily score the show an 8/10. The sound in this show was great. Piano music, along with an amazing OP (that is bound to get stuck in your head) makes me award this show with an 8/10 there too.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThere isn't much of a definite plot line here. It's really just a slice of life show. My biggest complaint here is that they mislabeled the show as a romance. If you're thinking of watching this show because you expect there to be romance, look elsewhere. Aside from implied romantic interests, nothing,not even the slightest bit of development, happens here. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are realistic and unique. None of that stereotypical crap you find in countless other shows in the genre. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nAnd thus, I end this brief review by saying that Oregairu paints a deep and dark portrait of the truth behind today's high schools. The interactions and dialogue between Hachiman and the other characters hit home, which is why this show is one of my favorite shows of all time. (Enjoyment 10/10, Overall: 9/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\n* Written by a current high school student.\\n",

            "content": "When you first see the cover or synopsis of this anime, most people would probably think it's the typical romantic comedy with the main guy character being surrounded by typical, beautiful two female characters. You'll probably expect some love sequence to pop up now and then and for some confessions to take place. I just want to clear this up to the people who are thinking of watching this anime that this is not your typical \"romantic\" slice of life anime. \r\nIt's going to be very difficult for me to try and explain without having to spoil anything so please try to bear with me.\\n\\n\r\nStory - I don't understand why this is labeled under romance and comedy. Despite all the little jokes that happen now and then, this anime does not make humor nor romance ever an objective. Typical romantic comedy animes (like Toradora, Sakurasou no pet na kanajo, and Clannad) always cling onto the typical cliche \"boy meets girl\" and \"boy and girl get to know each other and fall in love\". Although this anime doesn't seem to make an effort to try and diverge from the set up of this cliche, what's different about this anime is that it's actually realistic. This anime pulls a middle finger to all of those frustrating dramatic scenes and all the heart-wrenching confusion by simply not letting any of those situations occur at all. Have you ever been so angry at the characters for making stupid choices? Have you ever been frustrated at how some characters just won't confess? Or have you ever been annoyed at how stupid and pointless most of the confusion occurs from? If you answered yes to all these, then this is definitely an anime that will satisfy you by eliminating all of those annoying elements (even though it's fun to watch sometimes). \\n\\n\r\nThe reason, however, I gave the Story a 7 is because there really is no story. This is an anime about a high school club called the Service Club with only three members, a loner named Hachiman, a beautiful perfectionist named Yukino, and an awkwardly pathetic girl named Yui, trying to help people at their school \"change\". For those who have not watched this anime yet, all I'm going to say is that \"do not let the synopsis fool you\". What may happen will not happen and what may not happen will happen. It was awkward for me the first time I watched it, but after seven episodes, I realized \"this definitely is not your typical anime\". \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - This is the strongest thing that makes up a big portion of this anime. The main characters are very realistic and surprising in their own way. This is one of the first animes I have ever seen in which the \"social outcast\" cliche has actually been nailed spot on. There is no other character as cynnical, pessimistic, yet so intelligent as Hachiman Hikigaya. Though his indifference to a wide number of things tend to be disinteresting the first few episodes, as each episode goes by you get to truly understand why he acts the way he is and how his mind works. He may just be one of my favorite slice-of-life animes just because I've never watched a character so honest and realistic as him. Everything he says is either painfully true or painfully wise either way there's a sad kind of pain that comes with it. It's entertaining to say when the other main character, Yukino, always argues with him since they're both so intelligent. What's even more fascinating is that even though Yukino and Hachiman are so wise in their different ways, Yui is the only one with friends and a regard for true friendship. It is these kinds of values each character has that differentiates the quality of the story and teaches a painful lesson about the way society works. In short, realistic characters tell a realistic story. \\n\\n\r\nArt - The art isn't as different as you expect. It's not marvelous and it's not boring. What is somewhat different is the way they do the character's eyes and I find it impressive how it totally signifies how each character looks. Hachiman has got this dead eyes and oftentimes was thought of as a ghost or \"dead\" frequently in the anime. It shows how indifferent and observant he is to the things around him. Yukino's eyes are that of determination and somewhat overbearing cockiness. She knows she's perfect and talented and never had her eyes showed a sense of weakness (or have we?). Yui's eyes are big and round and symbolize her optimism and cheerfulness in the world. She tends to always be the one having fun when Yukino and Hachiman aren't. The banner itself is what's also interesting to me. Hachiman is the only one facing the other way as definition of his lonely nature, whereas Yukino takes up half of the poster with her overbearing confident look, while finally there's Yui, keeping up her cheerful look. Even though the art is not perfect, I truly feel that the artists kept in mind more of an objective approach rather than an aesthetic one.\\n\\n\r\nSound - I didn't really pay much attention to the sound effects or anything, but as for the voice actors, I think each character did a good job in playing their roles perfectly. The intro song is pretty good and catchy, yet the lyrics doesn't seem to encapsulate the anime's theme or synopsis (I could be wrong). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - As for the enjoyment, I guess you could say it was good watch. In all honesty, I zoomed by these 13 episodes real fast and I don't really have a reason as to why that is. It could be the quirkiness or the characters that just tend to entertain me. I really enjoyed Hachiman and Yukino as characters because they're so unconventionally different and progress the story by just being themselves. Hachiman has his badass moments and when you watch this anime you'll know what I'm talking about. Another thing I really enjoyed were the various scenarios the Service Club had to go through to meet and help new people. As much as I want to say I really really enjoyed this, as you can tell, I can't really give one solid reason. You just got to watch it yourself and take what you think was very enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it an 8. \\n\r\nAwesome characters, super unique, and totally changes your views on what you expect of a romantic comedy anime, even if it may be a misnomer. \\n\\n\r\nHope this review was helpful to you guys and gives you a sense of what kind of anime \"Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru\" is!",

Based solely on this season, you may see some feelings being developed, but they are more likely to be a feeling of friendship than of love.\r\nSnafu touches upon the point of view of those lying on the outskirts of the social society with Hikigaya Hachiman. It is implied that Hachiman has been an an outcast for as long as he remembers, but he doesn't see it an a hindrance. After his encounter with an enthusiastic teacher,he's forced to join the service club, where the show introduces the main ladies of the show, Yuki Yukinoshita and Yui Yuigahama. \\n\r\nOverall this show was quite enjoyable. While it seems carefree and cute, there are moments when the things Hikki said really made me think and for that I loved it even more.\\n\\n\r\nStory; 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed seeing an anime from an outcasts point of view.

But anyhow,\r\nHachiman isn't your average main character, unlike NHK's MC he isn't trying to overcome his predicament of not fitting in, he is aware of it though. Unlike Log Horizon's MC he isn't gifted with wits, though they both have a commonality in giving someone else the credit for all they have done, because the other person is more charismatic and thusfits what society believes. What this MC has is practicality, he is realistic, and defines the world as a pessimistic world. Although for some reason I feel like he has great faith in it, but I can't back this. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the story he will tackle problems (social) and provide solutions and what is annoying is that in real life that is how it would go down. You won't get action from this anime nor will it get you jumping out of your seat, but you will enjoy it because of how well it flows and makes you think.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of romance, even though it is tagged with it and has it in its name, it is very slight, if it is even there. And when it will come it might turn this whole anime around as it may interfere with some friendships, this is no harem that is for sure, so there must be conflict, so that might be interesting to watch too.\\n\\n\r\nThe other MC is Yukino, she is smart, beautiful and pretty much perfect and thus ostracized by society and again is aware of her situation and thus just mocks human society openly, for its cruelty. \\n\\n\r\nThe third MC (Yui) is a direct contrast to both of them. She is normal, in all ways. And that is her role. I don't exactly know how else to describe her.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime will be far from boring, it might not be a favorite for everyone, but it is definitely worth a shot. It has content.",

            "content": "A shining example of an anime with a premise that has much potential, yet is wasted in favor of the same anime cliches we see in every other show as well as characters too inorganic to care about.\r\nStory: 5\r\nI'm willing to go out on a limb here and give the story a 5, because I can see what the writers wanted to achieve in this anime, and near the end, some literary substance came into the light in a way that made me start to care about the MC, but you have to slog through the first 10~ episodes of boring cliches and annoying charactersto get to that point. The overarching theme that I took away from this show was how social nuances and the individual's role in the social hierarchy play an important part in the balance of social harmony, and how even the social outcast, the one who sees through the veil and rejects its grasp, cannot escape the important part they play in this social environment. I get the feeling that if this premise was put in the hands of a studio more focused on creative writing then it could transform into something very remarkable in more ways than one, but of course, this is not the case with this anime. Instead, we are treated with a slice-of-life styled episodic progression with only little bits and pieces of character internalization sprinkled here and there in a couple episodes. Not enough to make me think highly of the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nIf I had one suggestion to the writers on how to improve the anime, it would be to combine Hachiman Hikigaya and Yukino Yukinoshita into a character called Hachiman Hikigaya. Yukino anchors the show from reaching any real literary merit by being the most pretentious and annoying character charged with being \"the smart one\". You KNOW the writers tried shoehorning her into the story: a beautiful looking girl who is very intelligent and in very athletic shape and is perfect in every way imaginable, yet during middle school, some jealous students would frequently hide her shoes, which is why she is *somehow* a bigger recluse than Hachiman. And Hachiman's reaction to her telling him all this? Something along the lines of: \"Wow, you must've had a hard life.\" No. Not in the slightest. This is downright lazy character design. Her flawless personality is only half of what makes her so annoying. The other half comes up whenever she \"analyzes\" a person or a situation, creating these abhorrently false presumptions based on absolutely no evidence or prior knowledge. She is always \"right\" in everything she says or does because the writers just make all the characters agree with her regardless of their personality or disposition towards her, or even just how stupid and incoherent she is. If you would take just one moment to step back and actually listen to what she says, it's borderline comical at how dumb these scenes are. I could go in-depth with all the side characters, but all you really need to know is that their social problems, much like the whole show in general, has a lot of potential to be good writing on social life in the emotionally charged environment of a high school, yet is bogged down by bad anime tropes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 4\\n\\n\r\nThe art is slightly decent in comparison to other shows in the genre, though I'm not sure if that's really saying much. Thus music is flat and uninteresting, much like the show itself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nI obviously don't like it, though I stuck around till the end just to see if they could make any last ditch effort to expand on its themes. To a small extent, it did, but not nearly enough to compensate for the rest of the anime. for those wanting a decent story, this show leaves much to be desired.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nJust once, just ONCE I would like to see an anime made in the 2010's that isn't marred by all of today's cut-and-paste cliches and extremely used character archetypes and instead focusing on telling an actual, gripping story that involves organic and believable characters. When looking up this anime for the first time, it looked like your everyday cookie-cutter anime, which it was. Yet there was a little something there that made me wish this particular anime was in the hand of a different studio, in the hopes that they would've polished and improved the story, centered around a story that involves real human problems, carried by real human characters.",

Of course the first thing you feel is indignance, because that which is silently communicated to you, and tears open your heart with heavy bleeding claws, could be so completely MISREAD by this clueless motherfucker who has none of the personal and SERIOUS SHIT experiences, you as a person, felt when you encountered this very touching work of art.\\n\\n\r\nIncidentally another person was also there who was of the\\n\\n\r\n\"Oh my god the feels man, its so goddamn REAL\"\\n\\n\r\nVariety of anime-watcher. \\n\\n\r\nNow the thing about observation (because one of the whole most important things about being a writer is to exactly grasp the variety of human conditions) is that you can never really grasp that this other person who is sitting opposed to you is a person who has a whole completely different set of experiences that are probably completely contrary, or even if they were similar, completely uncommunicable to your own. The latter friend revealed to me that the wasting away in anime-haven pretty much encompassed the whole of his 3 years of polytechnic experience, and thus a show that talks about that kind of thing is a whole new form of refreshment. \\n\\n\r\nOf course my own experience was slightly off, because I actually think I did a lot of stuff that time. (In fact I made it my sole grief to study just about everything other than the school syllabus, which is where I jumped into topics as disparate as politics and shoegaze music. Debate being the thing that spurred on this study binge. I also started to get into creative stuff in my spare time like randomly writing poetry during lectures and thinking up stories and plays to submit to competitions. Then again besides debate most of that stuff took place in calm separation from what the hell everyone else was doing so I guess I did a lot of stuff 'on my own terms', which means I was still the sole Egoist basking in the warmth of my four walls)\\n\\n\r\nNow the former told me before all about his essential rose-colored romcom-esque high school life, and the latter told me about his ennui filled polytechnic life. There's the distinction. Then there's also those variety of people who will go into the \"I was once like that\" kind of mentality, because they've outgrown all that rumination-in-the-void and can proudly wear their badge of maturity by distancedly communicating a sense of invoked nostalgia when in reference to the show.\\n\\n\r\n(\"Yea\", my father once told me, \"After watching the french plays and Waiting for Godot and all the dunno what stuff I wrote my own French Experimental play before.\" I forgot the name but I think he called it \"The Destruction of the Youth\" and it was a play with only one actor in a single abstract room monologuing. Incidentally that was basically the type of thing I sent to one writing competition and got completely rejected by.)\\n\\n\r\nYet somehow everyone forgets that its still like a Romanticization of that sort of life. Not only is Hikigaya observsive-compulsive, but he also has the methodism to act out the Light Yagami type calculated plans which actually have some form of success (though what this success entails is one of the core conflicts in the series). Think a weaponized Daria. (I still think Daria is the closest analogue rather than Catcher in the Rye)\\n\\n\r\nBut that's one of the great things about Oregairu. The plans that are humanly wrought, born solely out of human interactions, lacking in the chance and concrete obstacles and base unconscious psychological impulses that usually cause the whole thing to get screwed up in real life. Characters are fully analyzed. They do not act in a way that has not been planned for them, whereas the one thing that makes observation so hard in real life is that a person's entire activity can be offset by stupid physical things like illness and sickness and all sorts of psychic burdens that come out of left field. Real people don't act in character, rather they rotate around a certain set of fundaments and dogmatically learned stuff that may not be followed completely. Inio Asano, Dostoyevsky, and post Toradora Yuyuko Takemiya all take into account this unconscious stew that drives people.\\n\\n\r\nJapan is a country that has a rich mystery genre tradition. Nisio Isin was writing about how he was influenced by the \"five God-like beings\" who shaped and molded his writing style (mainly Kiyoshi Kasai, Hiroshi Mori, Natsuhiko Kyogoku, Ryusui Seiryoin and Kouhei Kadono). Borges once wrote that the Detective tradition was all about the Romanticization of pure intellect in the face of growing antipathy towards Religion and types of thought that were contrary to Enlightenment values. But early Mystery series were rooted in the concrete act, the crime and its unraveling. The extension of this strongly calculative form of Detective fiction (or Golden Age fiction) in our current times is all the 'Game' style series like No Game No Life and Kaiji that focuses on a game unraveling between two people rather than a mystery that needs resolving by a single person.\\n\\n\r\nYet now, and it seems to be mainly a Japanese thing, although there are some variants in the West. There is a form of mystery series focused on the 'mystery of intentions' as opposed to the 'mystery of events', or a combination of both. I'm talking about stuff like HakoMari and Kokoro Connect, and of course the whole Monogatari series, that focuses on the more abstract observation of human characters and the whole mystery of unweaving the human web, usually in simultaneous unraveling of a supernatural set of events. If you've watched Moryou No Hako, which is a Natsuhiko Kyogoku adaptation, it also involves a high study into the semantics of certain words, phrases, myths, legends and philosophical conceits. The mystery is in the subjective experience and its relation to our concrete actions.\\n\\n\r\nOregairu firmly fits in this tradition, although its also a 'purer' form of the subjective mystery series in that it even removes the supernatural, the unreal, the non-human, and all of the tropes that go into the crafting of standard mystery series. Its the birth of a new type of genre, mainly that of the 'psychological-observation everyday mystery' (PsObE Mystery?). Our interactions are the primary conflicts here, and rather than dramatizing the rational intellect at work, its about dramatizing the subjective social intellect. Other standards to go by are Hyouka (which is also a homage to Golden Age Detective fiction, but is actually a deep character study as well), Toradora (also not a pure PsObE but has elements), and Dostoyevsky (he has everything in the world. He is my Love).\\n\\n\r\nWhat differs the PsObE from a normal character study, is the Observer, who replaces the Detective and acts on a heightened form of self-consciousness. Self-consciousness is the important keyword here, for if there wasn't a strictly self-conscious knowing Observer there would be no PsObE mystery to unravel or game to play. So Oreki, Hikigaya (and the whole cast as well, as seen later, which is surprising that even the Alpha Bitch has a certain sense of conscious manipulation), Ami and Minori, and just about every single character in a Dostoyevsky novel, are all to a certain extent aware of their own motives and regulating these in reaction to those of others.\\n\\n\r\nThe strange thing about these characters though, is that while they are firmly aware of their own actions, there is also a part that is unwilling to budge from their fundamentals, and usually a lot of self-justification is involved in the process. A Light Yagami doesn't ever question himself, but although he questions different parts of his plan he will never ever detract from his one-track ambition (its so telling that one of his plans happens to be about fooling himself, because he, as a character, is a Monolithic will unable to change). A Sherlock Holmes is a one-track investigative mind. Araragi Koyomi is always a meddling Shonen Hero archetype that loves banter, though the rest of his harem display Observer tendencies, and the whole series is about getting him to engage the world with that self-consciousness that the others characters are growing. An Observer character must fully analyze his own motives. The difference between Hamlet and Macbeth is that one acts out of relentless ambition, from prophecy, while the other acts out of relentless self-doubt.\\n\\n\r\nAnd usually, and this is where the true empathy towards their characters comes into play, Observer characters are unable to initially get over their overwhelmingly destructive self-consciousness. This niggardly inward aspect is the fundamental character of post-war angst fiction everywhere. The void. The search for meaning. The Observer's actual mystery is his or her own self, and the games he plays are merely a reflection of that which comes from within himself. Thus its also okay for Observers to get their plans wrong, provided that later they enact a better one with a fuller consciousness. (Also another reason why Hikigaya is not a Holden. Holden doesn't act on self-consciousness but outward bound anger born from misunderstanding and a lack of knowledge. The whole twist on the theme comes from the fact that Salinger knows this, and plays down his thoughts by conflicting them with the events he encounters. His later novella, Franny and Zooey, is definitely a pure PsObE.)\\n\\n\r\nBecause Life is sure as hell complicated, and as I questioned both of my friends more it suddenly seemed as if both had switched sides, with the unexpected one being a hell of a lot more on the self-conscious observation side than the other. But I won't talk about that stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThis also places Oregairu in a different league from Evangelion, the latter being about an artistic representation completely inwards self-consciousness that has little recognition for anything outside, while the former is about the effects of self-consciousness in social relations and activities.\\n\\n\r\nEither case its all fodder for sad melancholic egoistical romantics. And I wouldn't settle for anything less.",

            "content": "Story: 7 - Generally episodic and extremely character-driven, might feel like it makes little forward progress.\r\nCharacters: 10 - Dynamic and extremely well-realized main cast, with a mostly fleshed-out and enjoyable supporting cast.\r\nArt: 7 - Serviceable, but rarely outstanding. Evocative cinematography. \r\nSound: 7 - OST is mostly forgettable, but used effectively. Solid vocal performances. Solid OP and ED.\r\nEnjoyment: 10 - Intelligent and insightful without being dry. Effortlessly breezy with endlessly likable characters. \r\nFull Review:\r\nDespite the overwhelmingly positive impression of this show from the vast majority of fans and critics alike, it was really hard not to be skeptical about this. A romantic comedy LN adaptation withan overly long title? That's not generally the realm of timeless literature. Fortunately, as everyone assured me, my expectations were blown away in no time at all.\\n\\n\r\nIt's apparent right from the opening monologue that this show really gets its characters, and empathizes with them, but it doesn't make excuses for them. And that is quite impressive considering the actual nature of the characters. Our hero Hachiman is a cynical and abrasive black hole of smug indifference. He's internalized his own isolation and built a fortress out of it, but hell if he isn't still a likable character! Not even in the sad or pitiable way that misanthropic loner nerd characters tend to be in anime. Hachiman has a certain charm and charisma all his own. It doesn't really surprise me at all to see younger fans latch on to his various \"Hachimanisms\" as some kind of gospel. His worldview is the distillation of the introverted intellectual teenager experience. I can definitely remember feeling like the only sane man in an insane world when I was his age. I think everyone probably has a little bit of Hachiman inside them, and that makes him a broadly relatable character despite how much of a huge pompous jerkass he is. Our main heroine is similarly despicable, though in very different ways. Yukino barricades herself in a perfectionist facade. Her willingness to help others and her drive to succeed are as much a crutch as her frigidly standoffish personality. Her biting sarcasm and massive superiority complex belies what may be an even more fundamentally broken person than Hachiman. Hachiman's problems are clearly nothing but demons of his own design, while Yukino's seem to be related to more external factors. Her home situation is never explored in-depth, but is hinted at being a major source of her anxieties. Their interactions(or non-interactions) are the backbone of this whole show, and would be more than enough to carry the entire show just on their own.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't the only things keeping the show afloat, though. This is a romantic comedy after all, and OreGairu has a great sense of comedic timing. The jokes flow freely from the characters' base personalities, and the show avoids most of the silly reaction faces and manzai gag set-ups that plague the host of its contemporaries. The music and animation are mostly just serviceable and don't have many stand-out moments to make either of them particularly memorable. Thankfully, the cinematography is generally quite good. The shot framing easily evokes the sense of loneliness and mistrust that the characters wallow in, but also gracefully illustrates the cracking of their proverbial shells over the course of the series. Though it doesn't ever look or sound bad, OreGairu's technical merits are definitely taking a backseat to the script.\\n\\n\r\nOreGairu's one big stumbling point is that in order to continually punch holes in Hachiman's defenses, it has to keep forcing him into situations that challenge them. And \"force\" is kinda the key word there. As smart as this show is, there's really no avoiding how wish-fulfillmenty the base foundation is. Awkward loner kid is unwillingly thrown into a club with two beautiful, and comparatively lonely girls by his equally young and attractive female teacher. Geez show, there had to be a better way to do this. Making the Main Character an ineffectual harem lead is still kinda transparently pandering, no matter how incredibly bad at it he is. Regardless of how well-written these characters are, and they are fantastic characters, the show can't really rise above the tropes it constantly seems to be sneering at. And that's incredibly unfortunate. This show has so many smart things to say and wonderfully articulated characters, but it just can't escape its own inherent ~anime~ness. Characters like Saika just bog down the story and serve as blatant reminders that, oh yeah, this is an anime romcom(Even though I am quite found of him, personally). He was still a pretty likable character, and I think he actually had decent chemistry with Hachiman, but yeah, he mostly exists just to make hurr-durr trap jokes. And he's not alone in the one-joke supporting character department. The lack of actual romance in this romantic comedy might be another possible sticking-point. I understand that issue is supposed to be the whole joke; Throwing some hapless dude into Anime Harem 101 and not having anything happen because they're all emotionally-stunted jerk-faces cloistered within their own defensive facades, clever! But that doesn't make it any less frustrating to sit through. The show is carefully trying to balance what it wants to say about its characters and having their relationships actually move forward. I'm not sure it quite succeeds.\\n\\n\r\nStill, it is undeniably fun just to see these characters faffing about. They're all just so well-constructed that it's fascinating to simply watch them bounce off each other. However, this show's greatest feat is probably just being such a breezy watch. As weighty and melancholy as the character-drama is, I still blew through this show in what felt like no time at all. I'm not sure I'd call OreGairu a timeless masterpiece, but I'm absolutely glad that it exists. And simultaneously angry that so few shows ever actually strive quite as hard.",

(Well, that's my first impression at the very least) But looks are deceiving: there's more than meets the eye. \r\nOreGairu is more of a slice of life and POV (point of view) than a romance story.\r\nMC is a loner, has corrupt beliefs, is anti-social, has a bad reputation, and a heart of steel, yet holds a strong self-awareness and is rather smart. Those108 skills he is proud of isn't for show. His intelligent monologues, ability to read beyond a person's words and actions, and deep thinking continue to amaze me.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all very good. Each one of them has a representation in today's society, hence making the anime all the more realistic. How the MC deals with them (and their problems) is basically what the series is about.\\n\\n\r\nIf were talking about the anime per se, OreGairu definitely gets 10. The anime was able to get the storyline intact, and is enjoyable as it is. It's a good anime to recommend to others.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it lacked character development compared to the novel, and some events were omitted. With that, it is not surprising why the anime is underrated. This one should be enjoying a 9+ rating, IMO.",

            "content": "So, I was going through the season and said to myself, \"Wow, this season's anime is shit\", so I decided to pick the most generic RomCom titled anime I could find. I was pleasantly surprised when this anime turned out to not have a some super-agreeable and pleasant to be around main protagonist, but instead one that acted much more like me and the average person who watches these kinds of anime, a bitter, hateful, but tolerant (this one might not be that accurate) loner.\r\nWhat I really like about Hikigaya which is different from the average edgy anime protagonist is that instead of going fullout, \"Holy shit this Linkin Park song is so good, now I'm going to cut myself and kill some bad guys because the world is unfair\", he takes a more reasonable attitude that actually seems like an introverted, someone who actually doesn't hate people, but just hates being around them.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike other RomCom anime, this show actually has its romance develop realistically instead of, \"Hey kid, I heard you were this show's protag, I need more screen time so wanna /ss/?\" But you may be asking me how this show's development is realistic. Well, the main premise of the plot is that Hikigaya is an unlikeable guy, the teachers want to help him out by making him help others out, which in turn would make them like Hikigaya. Now since Hikigaya is actually a nice person and not a total fedora tipping autist like most RomCom protags, this turns out quite well and he develops relationships in a very realistic way.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good, and it sure as hell made me want to show the pink haired girl \uff34\uff28\uff25 \uff30\uff2c\uff25\uff21\uff33\uff35\uff32\uff25 \uff2f\uff26 \uff22\uff25\uff29\uff2e\uff27 \uff23\uff35\uff2d\uff2d\uff25\uff24  \uff29\uff2e\uff33\uff29\uff24\uff25 with the force one thousand suns, while I get it in the pooper by the trap. The voice-acting and other soundtracks in the show didn't make me want to kill myself so that's pleasantly surprising for this genre.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show was probably (one of) the best RomCom anime I've ever seen so its easily a 10/10. It still leaves me wanting to get railed by a trap though.",

            "content": "Every once and a while, a show comes along that challenges the conventional aspects of its genre in a way that has never been done before. Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru (Translated into English as \"My youth romantic comedy is wrong as I expected\") is this show. Where most romantic comedies generally lean away from reality, Oregairu embraces it in a way that is virtually unparalleled in any other series. The relationships between the three main characters attain a level of realism that is seldom captured in the anime medium. This isn't some revolutionary show that will change your outlook on lifeor thrust you into some sort of existential quandary. Oregairu is simply a show about people.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10:\\n\r\nAs funny as it may seem, the most appealing aspect of the story to me is just how clich\u00e9 it is. Oregairu mocks the standard romantic comedy structure in a way that it almost could be classified as a parody. It employs the classic concepts of a love triangle, a club setting, the tsundere character type, and the mandatory pool/beach/camping episode. Honestly, it seems to me that the series' creators intentionally do this in order to completely deconstruct and ridicule the genre while providing something unique and refreshing to viewers. Don't watch this series if you are expecting a story that has never been done before. Watch this series if you want a fresh and exciting spin on anime stereotypes that will leave you bawling in laughter. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10:\\n\r\nArt is not something that stands out to me in a series unless it is extremely good or extremely terrible. The art of Oregairu is neither. The character designs are attractive and the backgrounds are made with the perfect amount of detail. If you are expecting the art to rival that of a high budget movie, you will be disappointed. One thing that really caught my eye from the lackluster art was the expansive variety utilized in the facial expressions of characters. This adds a human level of emotion to the characters and contributes to both the realism and deliverance of their lines.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nI will not for a second pretend that I am some sort of expert in regards to the use of sound in anime. All I can say is that sound was used well in moderation in Oregairu. The soundtrack did not play as often as I anticipated, but its sparse usage really added to the drama and emotions of the characters. The opening was also very pleasant to the ear and I never skipped it even once while watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10:\\n\r\nWhere do I begin? The characters of Oregairu were undoubtably some of the best that I have seen in any show. \\n\\n\r\nHikigaya Hachiman, the cynical and somewhat pessimistic lead male character, was hilarious in his dissections of everyday occurrences and his appreciation for the little things in life. Hachiman rebels against conventional wisdom and sees the world in the way it is, without the glamour and aspirations most of us enjoy. His monologues are shockingly insightful and though provoking, challenging me to rethink the way I view certain facets of my daily life. Hachiman is perhaps the most developed character I have seen in any anime as well. The way he thinks and acts changes drastically throughout the course of the show as he meets new people and learns more about how to be a friend. This development allowed me to empathize with Hachiman, allowing him to become one of my favorite characters in any show.\\n\\n\r\nYuigahama Yui, the air-headed and inexplicably nice member of the main trio, grew on me throughout the series. At first, I hated her. She appears to represent all the stereotypes and conceptions about a female lead in a romantic comedy series. I often wondered why she did what she did, not because she was mysterious in any way, but because there didn't appear to be any reason. Once her backstory was revealed however, I began to appreciate her character and the environment that shaped her into who she is. Yui served as the glue that stuck the main trio together with her much needed comical outbreaks and genuine emotions.\\n\\n\r\nYukinoshita Yukino, the incredibly cunning and calculative tsundere, at first appeared as the other stereotypical female character type of a romantic comedy series. She sharply criticizes Hachiman for what she sees as his pathetic outlook on life and refuses to admit that she in fact is in the same boat as he. Where Hachiman lacks friends for his mistrust of others and cynical behavior, she lacks them for her perceived perfection and elitist attitude. They both grow on each other in a way that is not as predictable as it may at first seem. Yukino's clever remarks never fail to make me laugh and her emotions are so strong when she allows them to show. Her backstory is also extremely well done, allowing me to sympathize with her and feel her pain. Yukino, like Hachiman, develops greatly as the story progresses and learns the happiness the comes with having a relationship with friends.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nTo say that I greatly enjoyed this anime would be the single greatest understatement in the long history of humankind. Every week I hotly anticipated Oregairu and the comedic brilliance that it entailed. I rarely laugh at loud to anime. This show was the exception. I found myself on the brink of tears as I witnessed Hachiman's internal dialogue and Yukino's blunt statements. At this point it is scary to me just how close I was to missing out on this absolute gem of the romantic comedy genre. If you are to watch this superb anime, put all preconceptions, predictions, and expectations aside. They won't be needed with this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10:\\n\r\nThe only reasoning I have for not giving this show a perfect score is that it wasn't a perfect show. Really though... what is? Oregairu allowed me to greater appreciate the imperfections of the world around me in a way that I had never done before watching it. This show is a must watch for all, regardless of whether they are a fan of the genre or not. As I close I would like to quote the wonderful Hikigaya Hachiman:\\n\\n\r\n\"Question: The world will not change, but you can change yourself. So then, how will you change?\\n\\n\r\nAnswer: You become the god of a new world.\"",

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers, if you haven't seen it just read the last paragraph\r\nSome anime have a main character that starts out completely ordinary and throughout the show shows that he is anything but. Other anime have a main character with something different about him that sets him aside from everyone else, this is the type of main character found in yahari ore. The only problem I have with anime that contain these types of main characters is that they usually cause the characters' special trait to seem like an after thought that was tossed in to spice up a story that mirrors every other genericplot found in whatever genre it is ( in this case romantic comedy). As I delved further into yahari ore I was surprised to discover that this anime was a diamond in the rough, it doesn't have a generic plot and it does everything right. \\n\\n\r\nThe first aspect of yahari ore that makes it stand out is as mentioned, the main character's special trait, he voluntarily isolates himself from everyone because he believes they are not truly happy and are only conforming to what is considered \"normal\" in hope of becoming happy. This sounds very harsh at first, especially the way it is presented, we are lead to believe that hikigaya is wrong and that we  will see his views change over the course of the anime. Before I mentioned that some anime make the MC's special trait seem like an after thought, in yahari ore this trait is made the main theme of the anime and a majority of the plot revolves around it, as it should. Hikigaya sticks to his views throughout the anime and continually makes very valid arguments on why he is the way he is, he doesn't hate himself and never apologizes doing what he does. All in all he is a very solid main character that remains consistent throughout the show, he understands himself better than most people and he is very interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNext I'd like to focus on how the plot follows a realistic order and stays away from arcs. Many romantic comedies get too eager to put the romance in and practically come out and say who the MC will end up with. In the first few episodes it will get to the point where they would be dating but a series of ridiculous events keeps them from doing so. In yahari ore we have 2 main love interests (3 if you count saika) and at the end of episode 13 the romance remains subtle and who hikigaya will end up with is still unclear. He's been on a \"date\" with both girls and they both have forces driving them towards dating hikigaya. Yukino is a fellow loner, she gives out subtle tsundere vibes but it is unclear if she likes hikigaya (if she does she probably doesn't fully recognize it yet) or that is her true personality, and she has a sister that is pushing the two to date. Yui already shows signs of liking hikiaya and is taking the initiative when it comes to going on dates, the only thing holding her back is that she won't confess. The direction the story is going in is unclear which makes it interesting, we don't know where it's going but we want to. \\n\\n\r\nI said the story stays away from arcs, which is a quality I have come to appreciate in anime. I dislike painfully clear arcs because it feels like the story is being written with 1 challenge being overcome at a time and that is unrealistic. Life throws multiple challenges at people at all different times, it won't wait for you to overcome one challenge before it throws another at you. Some challenges never go away and remain constant while others may pop up repeatedly. The only arcs in the story are the requests the club helps with, but while they work on the requests the main problems in the story continue to develop. We want to know more about the accident hikigaya was in, we want to know who hikigaya will go out with, and we want to know more about the main characters, throughout the show we learn more about these things but they continue to raise more questions and cause more problems. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I want to point out about this anime is that is doesn't rely on cheap overused tricks for the comedy aspects. One of the funniest parts of the show are the scenes with saika totsuka who is a guy that looks and talks like a girl, it is something you don't see in too many romcoms and is pulled off very well. The anime also ridicules the whole romcom genre by pointing out that whats going on is the opposite of what  would be happening in a typical romcom. Then when it comes to romance aspects it remains subtle and slow. The writter isn't afraid of putting more than just romance and comedy into the story, the plot is important and the characters are well developed. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy romantic comedies but are tired of cliche's than I would definitely recommend this anime. I personally will start reading the light novels since they are further ahead story-wise. This anime is a romantic comedy done right and has unique aspects they aren't afraid to highlight.",

            "content": "\"They say that if you change yourself, you'll change the world, but that's a complete lie.\"\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Phew. I'll shorten it to Oregairu for future reference. I was just introduced to this anime by a good friend and wasn't sure what to think about it. I just jumped into it without looking at the synopsis or anything, not knowing what to expect. Once I got in, I was hooked.\r\nHow many of you were super popular in school, or in other parts of life? With friends all around? Did you feel like you had someone to rely on? I wasn't,and it was part of what attracted me to this show. Alright, lets get into the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: If you just read the synopsis, it seems like a regular slice of life. The loner guy gets put into a situation that brings him together with a beautiful girl. Not the most original premise, but as they say, there is no bad idea, but bad execution. And this anime was done incredibly well, imho. Meet  Hachiman Hikigaya, a anti-social to the extreme in high school who is content with the way he is, having no friends or real acquaintances of any kind. He is made the join the Volunteers Club with the beautiful and well known \"ice queen\" type, Yukino Yukinoshita, for the purposes of helping others. The two have conflicting personalities and wits, and their interaction with each other make for many hilarious moments along the way as they help out other with their problems.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The strongest point of Oregairu was its characters, which are paramount to any anime. This show had some of the best characters I have seen. From the beginning, I was hooked into Hachiman's monologue, reminiscent of how I was hooked into the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise by Kyon's beginning monologue. From then on I knew there had to be potential in the MC, and oh boy, there was. Hachiman is full of pragmatism and wit, whose attitude reminds me of Keima from the World God Only Knows. His opinion of the world is quite less low, to say the least, and his lack of social interactions with others stem from his low perception of life and people in general. My favorite thing about him is his ability to justify his views, however warped they may seem to other. He has his reasons for being the way he is. Yukino Yukinoshita on the other hand, is so \"perfect\" (rich, beautiful, smart) that she seems so different in comparison, yet they both share the fact that they are both alone, in this case people are turned away by her sort of untouchable aura. The two have different perceptions of life, and their banter between one another is a huge strength of the series. The last main character is Yui Yuigahama (btw this series has many names that seem to have similar first/last names for whatever reason), a happy, cheerful girl who is the first to get help from the club. While her personality isn't as deeply developed as the aforementioned two, she rounds out the two and acts as a bond between all of them. Her personality growth is also well done also. The supporting cast is full of different personalities that I find realistic and they all represent different types. Well done again.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is well suited to the series. While it isn't too sharp and detailed, it is smooth and colorful, and works fine as a whole. It could have been better, but it was fine. I was happy with it, and I felt it worked for the overall theme.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack for the show was good and worked for the themes in which they were in. I liked the opening a lot and actually watched it every time, but I can't say as much about the ending theme. Overall, solid.\\n\\n\r\nFor voicing, I thought the voice actors were good, especially for Hachiman and Yukino. Hachiman's voice actor really captured the tone of Hachiman's character in my opinion, with good intonation and tone. The others were all fine, nothing bad to say but nothing too praise worthy either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thought this was a very enjoyable slice of life. I really loved the main characters' personalities and their interaction with each other were smooth and well done. I related to Hachiman's plight, and I think many of us can. I thought it captured many parts of life well, and sometimes the stark reality that we don't really want to talk about. Life isn't always filled with sunshine and rainbows. There are tough moments, and sometimes its difficult to get through. Maybe we all feel a bit like Hachiman at times.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this series and would highly recommend it to others. Solid 9/10 overall from me.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Looking at the synopsis, it is difficult not to inwardly groan at the premise that has been frankly done to death (and then some). So how does this \"clich\u00e9\" anime still manage to feel moderately fresh? In addition to a strong main cast and interesting dialogue, I believe the long and short of it is that Oregairu does not attempt to be anything more than it is. It rids itself of some of the annoying elements that other such shows tend to shoehorn in. That said, it is still by no means overly spectacular; it is merely a solid anime that depending on your tastesmay very well be worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the initial premise, Oregairu is a typical school comedy that as of yet does nothing to try and weave a narrative. This is unsurprising and generally expected of slice of life type anime, though in this particular case it kind of works to Oregairu's benefit. It allows focus to be drawn to character interactions without the distraction of a potentially haphazard plot. The show also lacks much in the way of drama, which is objectively neither a strength nor a fault; it honestly depends on your personal preferences. Personally, I tend to enjoy (well-crafted) melodrama in such slice of life shows, but interestingly did not miss it at all with this particular anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack here is unobtrusive yet not terribly remarkable. It gets the job done and you barely notice it, which can actually be a positive. The OP and ED in my opinion are mediocre: listenable but half of me feels like skipping them. Concerning sound design, I really do not have any complaints. In my estimation, the voice acting is the strongest point of this category. Every main character brings a fitting aura to their particular character, and combined with the fast-moving script it is certainly a job well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are where Oregairu really shines. You have Hikigaya Hachiman as the ironically apathetic and pessimistic loner of a main character, the silent and independent heroine portrayed by Yukinoshita Yukino, along with the ever cheerful and buoyant Yuigahama Yui as the second heroine. Although each of these character archetypes are easily recognizable, they all somehow feel fresh and charming as new, independent characters. This is mostly in thanks to the enjoyable fast-paced dialogue that the show offers.\\n\\n\r\nThe aforementioned dialogue script is honestly the biggest strength of the anime in my opinion. It makes character interactions fun and engaging to witness and can usually bring a smile to your face. While nowhere near the wittiness of a show like Spice & Wolf, the script is a rank above a lot of the norm. The occasional dipping into analysis on societal norms with added focus to the loner syndrome is also a nice touch and easily relatable. Jokes are amusing and refreshingly downplayed; they are not overly obnoxious like many in anime are oft to be. That said, the series lacks much in the way of \"burst-out-laughing-while-holding-your-sides\" type moments, but that can certainly be forgiven.\\n\\n\r\nIn summation, Oregairu is a surprisingly fresh and mildly enjoyable school comedy with strong characters and a good script. I recommend giving it at least a try, especially if you have a liking for toned down slice of life type series.",

And how it leaves the mind lingering in a positive way.\r\n\"Sigh, another romcom... Why not lets give it a shot.\" and was it the best shot I have ever gave. I never really watched romcom's. But this one definitely is one of the best ones i've seen. Not your typical kind, but it's amazing! definitely makes you more perceptive in life.\r\nTheir are quite a few characters that revolves around the three characters. ButI'll let you be the judge. Considering this is not your common romcom. It's definitely a great anime in it's own unique way that strays from the common expectant ones.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nThis somewhat, not exactly your daily romcom revolves around an antisocial high school student named Hikigaya Hachiman.  A teacher forces Hachiman to join the volunteer service club, which happens to have the school's prettiest girl, Yukinoshita Yukino. Through the series is a spurs of moment, and an intellectual conversation/bickering and sarcasm between Hachiman, and Yukino. Those spurs of moment would mainly be Yui Yuigahama. It would seem like your common romcom, and it's not. But bear with me. It's very much worth it. The clubs activities are to solve people's problems. The problems are simple. But they take it more in depth.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nHachiman Hikigaya, the story's main protagonist. Friendless, isolated, and yet is at fault and pushed away from society. He believes that youth is a creation by hypocrites. He joined the service club, because of his adviser. Her ultimate goal/hope is that his exposure to the world would change him to become a better person. What Hachiman, himself believe is that he is insignificant, if anything, a nobody. Which means that whatever makes people happy. He is willing to take the blame for it, no matter what people thinks of him. Though his action does give the best results.\\n\\n\r\nYukino Yukinoshita, the leader of the service club and the only member of the club. Until Hachiman was forcibly put into the club. She's your beautiful, smart, rich kind of girl. She's also envied by most girls, and is disgusted by the fact that they admire her instead of improving themselves. Her personality usually leads her to be disgusted by many. In ways, she is kind of like Hachiman. She still doesn't recognize him as a friend, but more of an acquaintance.\\n\\n\r\nYui Yuigahama, she's in the same class as Hachiman. Yui is your common cheerful kind of girl who's problem lie with her inability to express herself because of her fear of losing friends, Her personality just covers it. She greatly admires Yukino and Hachiman because they are able to express their true feelings with no problem, and is disirous to be like others. Until Yukino changed her, which is a good thing. She is formerly a member of Hayato's clique but has no say in anything whatsoever because Yumiko overwhelms her.\\n\\n\r\nThough most anime's do play a role of friendship. I'd say Yahari Ore no Seishun plays a big role in friendship. Since it really is all about understanding each other, and oneself. You need friends to point out your flaws, to improve yourself and to better understand each other as friends. Overall I love this anime. I definitely recommend it to everyone. I thought it would be those common romcom anime's, and it turns out to be way more than that.\\n\\n",

Also I'm not the best at reviews.)\r\nThis show took me a while to get into, but now I think that it's awesome. The main characters are very well thought out and you can relate to each one of them. From not wanting anything to do with people and shutting them out. To trying to be like your friends just to be popular. The design/art style of the show is very nice. The main male character Hikigaya, as dark as he may seem when he's solving problems/talking about humans, he is most ofthe time right. Not saying that the way he acts thinks is always good, but he's smart and knows how people can be. For a character he is great. Now in some reviews people say that the characters don't change/evolve but that's not entirely true. They don't change much, but there are subtle changes and they do grow as people. The drama in this show is great, it makes you want to keep watching to find out what happens next. This show also tugs on your emotions, you'll be angry, sad, happy, and you'll even laugh. There might not be much, but the comedy in this show is awesome! Also yes you will probably want to yell at the screen, you'll know what I mean when you start watching. So give this anime a try, you will probably like it more then you think. I give it a 9.8 out of 10.",

            "content": "Going by the number of positive reviews this series has received so far here on MAL, you would expect to get into a good/decent show that maybe has some original ideas going for it or at the very least something something that keeps it apart from the rest of the crowd.\r\nWhat most people agree on is the anti-social protagonist,about how the series deserves praise for tackling this type of character instead of having the usual bland boring lead most rom-coms have.\r\nLets get one thing straight out of the way : many other series had anti-social or depressed lead character  (Welcome to the NHK, SayonaraZetsubou Sensei...)  that have been handled much,much better.The closest thing explaining Hikigaya's behavior was him breaking his leg in a car accident and getting turned down of a few times in some very insignificant situations like changing phone numbers or practicing during Physical Education class while being in elementary school,that's it.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly he isnt really anti-social, he is just a self centered ,overly cynical and downright hipster of a character,with the \"im above all these sheep who get together and form friendships\" that kind of self indulging superior way of thinking, all while totally contradicting himself by staying in same damn club ,which he was completely against being dragged into (only in the first episode of course) in the first place.It doesn't even cross his mind to leave the club because how else would the producers make a high school related anime without including this very tired and unoriginal trait? \\n\r\nCall this the Kyon from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya syndrome of constantly complaining and trying way to hard to be ironic about every little thing just for the hell of it.Because that's funny and in no way gets repetitive almost instantly right? right? ....\\n\\n\\n\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun has almost no romantic elements ,which would be ok instead of forcing one down our throats,but it briefly tries having one mid series that gets completely forgotten by the next episode,like nothing has ever happened.Which is ever worse than having a bad romance in the first place.\\n\r\nAnd the comedy is mild to non existent ,this depends on your subjective taste of course.I can only remember 2-3 moments where the show got a smile out of me,most of the time it felt like a total drag despite being only 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"story\" ,if you can call it that, is just the usual high school slice of life with all the usual situations and locations you've seen a million times: the fireworks festival,going to the mall shopping,the school festival....\\n\r\nIt had a episodic nature where it introduced new character each episode alongside their petty problems in order to resolve them,no that all fine and dandy but surprisingly almost no of the issues really get resolved,they are either forgotten or just handled in the most .In some cases it goes into complete nonchalant territory  such as :\"Hey you're sad and lonely,stop being sad and lonely\" - \"well ok if you it that way\" ,  \"Hey you need money to provide your family.Why don't you get a scholarship?\" - \"Oh ok,ill get one right away\".\\n\\n\r\nThat's when the writing was just abysmally bad,it also didn't help that everything was brushed away under the rug after each episode ended with no future mentioning.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI've touched upon the main character ,but what about the other 2 female characters? Are they well developed or interesting in some way?\\n\r\nNope ,Yukino is a condescending ,overly direct ,perfect in all she does type of character .You could have literally replaced her with a robot with no understanding of human nature of emotions and it would have been exactly the same.\\n\r\nYui is the typical air-head ,overly cheerful character that is pretty much mandatory in any high school related anime nowadays.Not much to say about her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYou only need to take a brief look at the cover for this anime to guess what kind of characters they are, its that simple.Character development is non-existent ,nothing has changed about them during the events the show presented.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the side characters are completely one note and extremely forgettable ,such as a the girl who likes guy on guy \"action\",the boy who looks like a girl and is mistaken for one everytime,the cute little sister who constantly repeats \"onii chan\" over and over again .\\n\r\nNotable mentions goes to the useless ,short tempered teacher who punches students and constantly smokes around them ,because that's funny and in no way gets you instantly fired in real life right ?.....\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall its a very mediocre and forgettable anime that didn't even try bringing anything new on to the table ,it just rehashed the usual anime tropes.The high school setting has been easily the lowest common denominator for a very long time now,and this series does nothing but to reaffirm how tedious and uninteresting it has become. \\n\r\nMediocre animation that takes you back to early 2000's series ,not something made 2013,decent VA,almost no story or character progression,bland and one note character ,that's Yahari Ore no Seishun in a nutshell.\\n\r\nOh and just to make matters worse ,of course there has to be a sequel to this.Because every shitty ,unoriginal,mediocre series warrants a sequel nowadays. \\n",

            "content": "Not sure what makes this a rom-com considering there's no major romantic developments or implications that take place throughout the course of A Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU. I'd more consider this a mix of comedy and social psychology which explores the differing mentalities of high school students having differing social cliques, interactions and expectations that they wish to get out of their years in high school, the latter making for the more interesting bits in this series for me as the comedy is rather hit-or-miss here otherwise. SNAFU's main focus is on a trio of students who make up a school club called the ServiceClub who provide some sort of aid to members of their school student body. All three are social outcasts in some form due to their mentalities on high school life and/or personal flaws and develop unique chemistry with one another as they better understand one another.\\n\\n\r\nThis makes SNAFU unique from other high school rom-coms because it doesn't portray a happy and optimistic feel with its story, make the main characters popular or play up any shipping teases. Relationships with the major characters start off awkward due to their differing mentalities and expectations, yet gradually develop to a point where they would consider each other acquaintances. Differing social cliques are established in the high school setting of the series as well by having several outcasts beyond our three leads, Yui trying to fit in with her group of friends and a few characters shown to be opportunists trying to raise their social standing within the school. Hachiman's character gets prominent focus throughout much of the series as we are shown what led him to adopt his cynical mentality on adolescence and the self-harm he will inflict on his social image in order to mend situations that he and the Service Club become involved in. Much of what SNAFU has to tell on the high school experience isn't explored much in many titles and makes it a nice breath of fresh air in recent years as many high school-themed titles tend to pander to otaku audiences with more conventional premises. About the only issue I have with the approach that SNAFU does with telling its story is that it lacks a proper resolution as the Service Club members have yet to fully establish a close relationship with one another and come to an understanding with their experiences in high school. But I'm sure more of this will be addressed in the show's upcoming second season.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of presentation, there is nothing that really sticks out with SNAFU. Visuals are standard quality with smooth lining and vivid color on character designs, which have a decent amount of detail though not too much out of the ordinary. The soundtrack consists of energetic and light music pieces that do their part at enhancing serious and comical moments within the series, though nothing sticks out too prominently with the music to the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, SNAFU made for an engaging watch thanks to its solid and engaging focus on social psychology with its high school aged-characters and setting. I'm definitely looking forward to the upcoming second season of this one.\\n",

            "content": "Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru really has served its purpose in the world of a teenagers social life. \r\nIt would really be a shame if people even regards it as a typical romcom in which the boy gets the affection of the girl by going through unexpected events and helping her and all that crap. Yahari Ore seems to be a RomCom but at the same time it isnt. It deals with pointing out the sociological and psychological behavior of teenagers. And pretty much most of the facts in the story seems to be true till the very end. A ratherdifferent plot ever made and its not surprising that you may learn a thing or two from this. But the only problem is that , like the usual romcom's this one can't be suitable for all. Unlike other's  Yahari Ore seems to have integrated a few allusions and philosophy and it needs complete attention. \\n\\n\r\nStory:9\\10    \\n\r\nThe story seems to progress with a great stability and every character gets to be introduced perfectly. And as i said it before, this is not for everyone. Some might feel it to be plain-and -dry  if not  understood properly. \\n\\n\r\nArt:10\\10\\n\r\nThe atmosphere generated by it seems to give a calm environment along with some hard dialogues. And to me it seems to be the perfect combination. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\10\\n\r\nAbout 90% of the characters are normal teenagers and the remaining are our main protagonist and a few others  who share his sense of judgement. So as a result the MC has got a lot of teens to discuss about.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just for the record. This anime seems to strike the viewers with a hard hammer, the same thing they did as a student in their life. \\n\\n\r\nBut anyways, those who are interested in Yahari Ore can have its delight all you want and this wont be a disappointing one as it can grip your interest.",

            "content": "Alright, let me preface this by saying that because I have such a deeply embedded aversion to High school anime it took me a while to actually Get It, about 5 or 6 episodes at least, but once I got over my own preconceptions I realized that My Light Novel Adaptation Title is Long as I Expected actually has a surprising amount of depth, and here's why:\r\nThe Story: Normally I'd start with a brief explanation on the story, but seeing as it's situated in anime high school you can pretty much expect the characters to do anime high school things, albeit with snappy dialogue andclever trope sub-versions, so I'll just substitute it with a double helping of character analysis. I will however, warn a few of you ahead of time; this is not wish fulfillment. It may wear the veneer of wish fulfillment: an outcast [Hikigaya Hachiman] gets put in a club with the school's prettiest girl [Yukino Yukinoshita], who presumably teaches him the meaning of friendship or something along those lines, while meeting a sweet pink-haired girl [Yui Yuigahama] along the way, but that just isn't the case; despite the fact that Hachiman makes all of two friends during the entirety of the show, you can rest assured that the show begins and ends with it's [hilarious] pessimism in tact.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for The Characters: while the main cast is seemingly constructed entirely of stereotypes [a social piranha, a silent beauty, and a genki girl who acts like she's been streamlined meth and red bull to contrast the previous two], each character, and the stereotypes that they represent, is either played around with or creatively expanded upon. For instance, I really like how they take your stereotypical misanthropic introvert MC [found in every other high school anime ever] and actually flesh it out with Hikigaya. His pessimistic mentality and self-effacing method of handling others was really refreshing in that his actions were so consistent with his character; every time that he had an opportunity to play The Good Guy and earn a little societal redemption he wouldn't, instead opting to react in a way that was consistent with his social ineptitude and yet still cutting and to the point. I found it particularly interesting that his solution to most problems was to cast himself as The Enemy, effectively throwing himself under the bus so that everyone else could band together [oftentimes against him], and yet never receiving thanks. Honestly, he was a surprisingly unique character, and one that was both painful and endearing to watch. Yui and Yukino were likewise entertaining [Yukino especially], the former wearing her emotions on her sleeve and the latter an immutable mask [much like Hachiman in that regard], but I have comparatively little to say about either. Yui pokes a few holes in your typical \"happy\" girl archetype, providing interesting insight into the insecurities that stem from trying to be liked by everyone, whereas Yukino can easily be summed up by saying that she gives off strong Senjougahara vibes; by the way, for those of you who haven't seen Bakemonogatari, that is A Good Thing.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I would like to say that the show contained a wealth of character growth, but it really didn't. I mean, there was certainly an interesting revelation or two, but precious few actually went through any meaningful change. Yukino had a bit of growth I suppose, having begun with a superiority complex that spawned from the duress of living up to her family history and ending more resolute in her individuality [Yui arrives at a similar conclusion]; but on the other hand, you have Hikigaya, who started out as a somewhat watered down Nietzsche wannabe and ended much the same way, except with two friends [and potential romantic prospects] who calmly accept his frequent bouts of Nihilism. Now, normally I would peg such a stark lack of change as A Bad Thing, but I think that in this case it was The Point, as the driving theme of the show seemed to be \"the rejection of conformity.\" Hikigaya, and to a lesser extent, Yukino, both found themselves forced [though forced is a bit strong, it was more gradual] into their solitary lifestyles by misconceptions of the social hierarchy, but the thing that set them apart from all the other similar characters is that, instead of whinging, they simply accepted their circumstances and the resulting solidarity. Even took solace in it, in Hikigaya's case. The thing is, this show doesn't take the usual stance of viewing reclusiveness as something to be fixed, but rather as something to be understood, which is what really sets it apart for me. \\n\r\nThey also have a few interesting side characters, like Hayama, who subverts the Crouching Nice Guy, Hidden Douche trope quite nicely by actually perpetuating his nice words with genuine sincerity. He, unlike most, understands Hikigaya's reasoning for his scathing critique of society, but instead chooses to overlook them and hope for the best in people, wholeheartedly embracing the charming falsities that are required to maintain the public facade. He contrasts with our MC so perfectly that I'd go so far as to say that if Hikigaya is the harsh truth, then Hayama is the beautiful lie.\\n\\n\r\nAt any rate, for fear of getting too DEEP, I'm going to wrap this up by saying that My Teen Romantic Comedy is hilarious. I mean it. Seldom have I seen such snappy dialogue and smoothly incorporated references [\"just like stand users attract other stand users, loners likewise attract other loners.\"], alongside characters that manage to subvert your expectations in such funny and unique ways. For instance, Hikigaya's attraction to Saika [IT'S A TRAP]; I can honestly say that I've never seen a character fall for the trap while knowing that it was a trap beforehand. Really though, there's a hefty amount of comedy in this show that just works: Hikigaya making heterosexually questionable observations each and every time Saika is around [\"I wish I could throw water on Saika.\"]; watching Hachiman's token imouto [moe fang and all] who he's not attracted to in any way [pick up your jaws, I'm serious] trying her best to compromise his peaceful solidarity; Yukino and Hikigaya weaving verbal minefields to each other and those around them; Hikigaya's morally unsound internal monologues and cheap, dirty tactics that invariably pop up when he's confronted with sensitive choices; etc. \\n\r\nThese are but of few of the things that all come together to make this one of the funniest, most surprisingly thoughtful, and enjoyable anime that I've had the pleasure of watching this year. \"Source: Me\"",

            "content": "Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru, or My Teen romantic Comedy SNAFU, is one of the more popular series of 2013 Spring season. Even though the premise and setting - high school slice of life romance show - may not seem appealing to many, Oregairu does a lot of things very good, especially in being unique, good and refreshing. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nSet in high school, the story revolves around the loner Hikky, a person devoted to being alone who created a lot of theories of the human mind, loneliness and the thought process of human in society. While being kinda generic, the actual plotlineof Oregairu is a bit special and puts it above other high school romcoms. You will encounter many interesting situations and especially good conversations in this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nProduced by Sentai Filmworks, the Art is just what you expect it to be. Its not generic and well done. You might argue that Hikky's face is very simple and seems to just have been ignored, but I think its simplicity just adds to his character, putting focus on his personality and especially his eyes. The girls are cute and well animated, I especially appreciate the effort in animating non important background characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe voices are fitting, especially Hikkys. Damn I've never heard someone that realistically pissed and annoyed. While I found the OP just decent, I loved the ED - so awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is where this show shines. The other characters are just exactly what you would find in your everyday school and reflect their social status and personality extremely well. Hikky and Jukino however are extremely special in their refusal to join the norms of  social interactions. Like stated multiple times throughout the show, their conversations feel strange to others and refreshing to themselves, hinting a romance that sadly doesnt come true (yet?). Their character type also appeals to everyone who feels a bit like a loner or someone who just doesnt have 1000 \"friends\" around him.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nCombining special and unique niche characters with great comedy mixed with subtle hints at the flaws of society and the concept of friends, this series does everything right to entertain and motivate its viewer to think and reflect. The story is a bit generic but manages to bring out interesting twists and parts of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nA great show. A must watch for every lover of classic romcoms and comedy shows with high school settings. I've enjoyed every single episode, the execution is just too good. It shows why comedy can make or break a show centered around it, and in this case, it makes it awesome. I cant wait for the 2nd season airing soon!\\n",

            "content": "Hey Guys, this is my first review on MAL. I'm actually going to write more of a character based review. I'm going to talk about how I think these characters came to be and a little bit about myself as well. It might be a little weird but bear with me. I'll do the rest of the stuff like art and sound at the end.\r\nThis was a good anime that captivated my interest from the very beginning. I was intrigued by how different the main characters were and their reactions to their surroundings are understandable as well.\r\nHiki was, well... an interesting character. His views onthe world are quite negative yet true at the same time. He sees the ugly side of the world because he has been exposed to it for most of his life. Hiki was pretty much abandoned by the rest of his classmates because he didn't fit in and had to learn how to cope by himself. All of these tough events have cause him to become a strong, smart, and mature person. But unfortunately, he still has yet to learn about how others feel and what their motives may be.\\n\\n\r\nYukino, is yet another mature person in a un-mature community. She is unfashionable, cold, but helpful towards others. Yukino is pretty but her blizzard- like personality keeps away most people; by pushing them away and never opening up to anybody at all, at least until she meets Hiki and Yui. She is still delicate about some matters; after all, she is human. She teaches others, but in a high and mighty kind of way. Yukino believes that the more mature people should teach others of lesser mental strength. She also is not good at communication, but this is because her past classmates pushed her out from any sort of group she would try to join. Almost nobody can break into her shell, until she meets...\\n\\n\r\nYui! Yui is the most naive and emotionally underdeveloped of all the characters. But she is also the strongest at fitting into a groups and communication. Yui is also very delicate, and clings onto her relationships with others tightly, even to the point of simply being their underdog just to be able to talk with them. She changes her opinion just so others might view her in a better light. But she becomes aware of her weaknesses as she begins to talk with Hiki and Yukino. Yui also recognizes Hiki and Yukino's maturity and aspires to be able to be more similar to them. She grows the most during this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs you guys can probably tell, I like these characters a whole lot. I like them because they connect to me realistically. I see myself in each of them. I used to be like Yui, where I would just do favors for others just to gain a higher friendship status. I used to be like Hiki, where I would have a negative connatation of the whole world and be used to being alone. I would sit around just reading books to keep myself company, saying, \"I don't need anybody else, I just need to be myself\". I am like Yukino too, where I help out others, yet judging them instantly. I have my own faults and strengths like many of these characters. \\n\\n\r\nI watch these animes and enjoy them at the same time because they help teach me life lessons as well. Clannad: After story told me the importance of family, Nisemonogatari showed me to never impose my opinion upon others and Spice and Wolf taught me a little about romance. All of my anime viewing experiences have shown me little pieces of the world, and it was up to me to jigsaw it together. This anime in particular, kind of awakened this feeling of growing up faster than anybody else and simply just waiting for others to catch up and leave their old ways. All of the sadness and pain that Hiki and Yukino had to go through, made them alone and without friends. But in return, it gave them mental strength and the ability to fight back. It might sound corny, but since they lived so much in the shadows of others, they became aware of the shadows within them and others. No pain without gain, right?\\n\\n\r\nOkay now onto the 'regular' aspect of rating an anime. \\n\r\nStory: the story flowed naturally. There wasn't anything special, but there wasn't anything bad either. It was just a good plotline that was believable and realistic. It's realism is what really connects the dots. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Nothing to really say here. It looks like the same as many other animes. It's producer, brains base has nice visuals and fluid animation. It's just simply okay.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I really liked it's opening, really nice and it felt right in place. it wasn't all loud and in your face. It's tune was nice and I still find myself humming it occasionally. It's closing was just as good, but more forgettable. The seiyuu were really nice and fit into the characters smoothly. (Hiki's laugh is pretty funny)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: All ready did it. Just scroll back up. I like to do it first since I consider the characters the most important part of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I hated this anime so much. It didn't make sense. It was so dumb. I can't believe it was even aired all the way. This is the worst anime I've ever seen. (seriously, if you think ^ is true, you haven't been reading my review)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Muy bueno. Me gusta mucho!",

            "content": "I know a lot of people, both on this site and in reality, that have some sort of negative bias towards this show. Maybe it's the admittedly generic setup (loner/non-energetic guy goes to club with beautiful girls) or the fact that is has \"ore no\" in the title, which is typically a red flag that tips off generic romance comedies or ecchi shows. Either way, I am here to put all of those misconceptions to rest:\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru (*breathe*) is far from generic. In fact, it's one of the most original and charming romance comedies I've had the pleasure ofwatching in a while.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around Hikigaya Hachiman, a high school student made loner after entering high school months after everyone else because of a traffic accident. His antisocial nature is noticed by his guidance counselor, who forces him to join the similarly antisocial beauty Yukinoshita Yukino in the Volunteers' Club, which accepts requests for help from the student body and fulfills them. Sounds pretty standard, right? Well, it is. The actual plot of the story is fairly basic when it comes to the events the characters find themselves in, with the exception of a few episodes (such as the summer camp episodes). But where this anime really excels is the characters, the lot of which I'll get to very soon.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is average; there's nothing really striking to be seen. The art and character designs, though, are excellent, as they help to lend insight into each character: Yukino's harsh blue eyes and formal looking black hair give an impression of solitude and defense; Hikigaya's fish like eyes help to illustrate his loner-y personality; and Yui's bright orange hair and casual style of dress help to portray her as what she is, friendly and easily approachable. The side characters are also designed well.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing to sneeze at, but it won't amaze you. The voice acting is done well, especially Hachiman and Yui, who are portrayed in a way that, once again, reflects their personalities. I've never listened to the ED, sadly, so I can't make a judgement on that, but the OP \"Yuki Toki\" sung by Yanagi Nagi is fantastic and mirrors the theme of the story in ways that aren't always immediately visible.\\n\\n\r\nNow here comes this anime's largest strength by far: the characters. Going into this anime, I had very low expectations for the characters; they were most likely going to be cardboard cut-outs with one or two personality traits and (in the case of the female leads) an incredulous affection for the main character. Never have I been so pleasantly surprised. Hikigaya Hachiman, the main character, is one of the most relatable characters I have ever seen; his experiences with other people have hardened him into an extreme pessimist, but he's not completely ignorant of the inner ramifications of social interaction. In fact, he's quite the opposite, displaying extremely in depth knowledge of the ways in which people interact with one another, as well as their true intentions. This is used frequently for both comedy and drama, and it works well in both. Yukinoshita Yukino is standoffish and frequently prickly, and these characteristics allow an excellent dynamic to grow between her and Hachiman;  leading to a trading of insults between the two that is always entertaining to watch and reminds me of two skilled fencers attacking each other, searching for their opponent's weak point or blind spot. Yui is also a very well-developed character, with a large portion of the early episodes dedicated to helping her work through her problems with giving in to other people.\\n\\n\r\nIf Evangelion was a deconstruction of the mech genre, then Y.O.S.L.C.M is a deconstruction of the romance comedy genre; taking all the clich\u00e9 cardboard cutouts other romance comedies call characters, and replacing them with actual characters that make the viewer empathize and sympathize with them. It either does away with common tropes or uses them in extremely funny new ways. Sure, it's not a masterpiece: there are other romance comedies that were just a bit higher in overall quality (for example, Toradora), but for me, Yahari stands as a testament to what the romance comedy genre can do, and what it can still bring to viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, I did compare it to Evangelion. Deal with it.",

            "content": "\"And this is how our fucked up teenage life begins.\"\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru (My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU; I'll just refer to it as RomCom) hit home for me on multiple occasions. I was never the most outgoing of people, generally keeping to myself while being somewhat bitter that others were having a social life without compare. The series' main character, Hachiman Hikigaya (\"Hikki\") is someone who goes beyond a normal social outlier. A self-proclaimed \"bear\" (in that he prefers the solo life and avoid being social) he is confronted about his behavior in his second year of high school. Atthe whim of one of his teachers, he is forced into a the Volunteer's Club where social life is forced upon him through the help of the only other member in that club: Yukino Yukinoshita. Dubbed the \"Queen of Ice\" by Hachiman, she shares a similar disposition but has a different outlook on it, providing fodder for arguments between then. It also allows for even more relatable circumstances among viewers. Two people, both with twisted views on society, are forced to work together and hilarity ensues.\\n\\n\r\nThe social outlier focus of the main characters allows for a special aspect of this show to shine - an outside look in on how high school students function (albeit in anime form). It's a viewpoint not often used and RomCom delivers with it. I greatly enjoyed watching how the characters dealt with daily life when faced with not just other people, but themselves as well. Their development may feel slow at first, but I take it as a more realistic way of getting to know them. When you meet people, rarely do they spill everything about themselves. Time and experiences open the doors to finding out about people. It appropriately follows how people who would be considered social outcasts (but not necessarily to an extreme) would be hesitant to get to know others and works very well with the story.\\n\\n\r\nA comedic slice-of-life anime, the story focuses on how a socially awkward guy deals with being forced into interacting with others, especially girls. It delves into the world that many people do not see, and for obvious reasons - those people purposefully keep themselves hidden from the masses. Alongside the loneliness usually comes intellect, which sparks confrontations and promotes snarky humor. RomCom's story is well structured, appealing, and successfully avoid falling into the trap of being a generic high school romance. However, to me, it felt a bit derailed in the final two episodes, with very little happening. The last episode was a bit of a let down, actually.\\n\\n\r\nSarcasm and witty remarks are the major components of the show's humor and provides consistent entertainment. This is coupled with idealistic arguments and agitated banter between Hachiman and Yukino as well as with classmates. As would be expected, a counter-balance character to their hilarious debates is presented: Yui Yuigahama, the third main character.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected from a 2013 anime, the art and sound are great. The character designs are not overly-flashy or revealing (something common in high school romances) which allows for more appreciation of the story itself. Background music is consistently appropriate and enhances the mood of scenes and even the humor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall RomCom is a highly entertaining show that not only provides effective humor, but relatable characters that enhance the quality of the show. With a believable story, people who have been through high school or are in it at the time can place themselves somewhere in the show. The show successfully avoids falling into the cast-iron romance mold and holds true to the comedy aspect with wonderful use of wit and sarcasm.",

            "content": "From personal experience, I've come to learn that romcoms just aren't my thing. From the few that I watched, I noticed the same old jokes used over and over again. Couple that with a mirage of fanservice scenes, and you get my least favourite anime genre of all time...\r\nThat is, until I saw this anime. Oregairu definitely caught my attention from the moment I first heard about it. I learned about this series from a video portraying the protagonist's self-deprecating character. The video was 12 minutes long, and yet I found myself stopping the video at the 4 minute mark. The main protagonist, Hachiman, wassomething I had never seen before. Granted, this could very well be because of my very surface level knowledge of anime, but regardless, when I saw Hachiman's character for the first time, I thought to myself:\\n\\n\r\n\"I can actually relate to this character\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd so began my journey into the world of Oregairu. It was definitely not what I was expecting, and with hindsight, Hikky's character definitely did not turn out to be as sane and grounded as I expected it to be, but nonetheless, his character development and the development of other characters made me love this anime, which is why out of all categories, Character is one of the only 2 to receive a 10.\\n\\n\r\nAlongside great character writing, you have some actual comedy. Some scenes actually had me laughing out loud. Comedy is subjective, don't get me wrong, however, I think a solid argument can be made about how this anime's comedy is well written. It achieves laughs without having to rely on boring tropes that have been done to death.\\n\\n\r\nAs for other elements, story, art, and especially sound were nothing to brag about. There were some scenes with nice animation, but overall, it was lacking in personality. \\n\r\nStory is also a bit generic, staring your typical high school scenario with a bunch of females\\n\r\nSound was definitely my least favourite part of this anime. I literally do not remember a single track/sound effect, which goes to show that nothing stood out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this an 8 out of 10. It's more of a drama if anything, but for a romcom, I liked it a lot.",

            "content": "Wow. Just wow. \r\nFrom the beginning this was initially just supposed to be a random romcom to pass the time in between my regular shows, but it became so much more than that. The way I could [somewhat unfortunately] relate to Hikitani--Hikigaya on soo many aspects was just a thrilling experience rather than having to just pretend or wish I was like the female/male lead.\r\nEvery episode was filled with great meaning, Hiki quotes, and a fair share of laughs [half the time more sarcastic and sad when you look back on it]. \r\nStory- 10\r\nGiving that there is 13 episodes, I don't feel like the relationshipis rushed at all. That being said, I can only assume this is also why there is a second season, as the pace of development is very subtle and slow, however very appropriate. \\n\\n\r\nArt- 7\\n\r\nOther than Hikigaya, there is nothing super special about the art. Everyone is designed very well and I like the style and colours. But its also nothing that makes me bend-up-side-down just for the art. \\n\\n\r\nSound- 8\\n\r\nI actually quite like the choice of voice actors they used here. I couldn't imagine anyone better for Hikigaya, or any of the other characters. It was all very fitting. The OP was also very catchy and one I actually took the time to watch every episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 9\\n\r\nNothing is perfect--But in this anime it cuts it quite close! Hikigaya is a very believable and relatable character which from the get-go gets him 1000 more points than the usual romcom character. I'm not go to indepths but the rest of the cast also sticks to character very well and have very realistic aspects to them when looking back on the social society of school. \\n\r\nThe only reason I would think to bring down this from 10 to a 9 is due to my confusion on the slight character perception change of Miura Yumiko. Although it does make her seem more real by not just being a complete bxtch but due to the lack of development between the charas and her I was a tad confused at their slight relationship improvement. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\r\n^~^\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9\\n",

            "content": "Haven't wrote any review in such a long time, but after seeing \"Yahari Ore\", this is a must. Before getting to any details on the ratings, this anime is based quite on the realistic side. It's so realistic sometime to the point where it's irritable. That's exactly why I love this anime, and maybe some of you loner may like it too, because it will, or might, remind you of yourself in the past. Believe it or not, but this anime is probably one of the closest there is to reality. Although some part may seem too great to be true. Certainly people will disagree,but the problem with that is because they have never experienced some of the obstacles that were laid down for the characters. Certainly I have experienced some of them, which really brings out the emotions of how the characters were feeling into reality. This is why the story was great and amazingly crafted.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe reactions people may get as they progresses through the first episode is, \"What is going on? Who are these characters? Or, What is he saying?\" While some anime just go along the plot and missed some explanation, \"Yahari Ore\" clearly explained everything from past to present as the plot goes on. With such fine details on the characters' life, the rating for this anime being high is normal. Unfortunately, good anime can't have such perfect route, which is why there has to be some part where they \"purposely\" made viewers hate a certain scene, as in plot twist, because unless they do that, people will act like Keima and say, \"I can already see the ending\" (Katsuragi). Unlike other anime, some people could really relate themselves to the characters in \"Yahari Ore,\" because it took realistic view and put it into an anime. This is why the plot twists may seem plain to some, and very twisted to others. The story deserved nothing less than 8/10 but another thing could be said for the art, for some may pay attention to it carefully than others.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 \\n\r\nMost people, or otaku, probably wouldn't  care much for the art than the story in a \"TV\" type anime, but if you reverse that, you have yourself a Hentai watcher. Anyway, the art was nice. It was good, and not disturbing to watch in any way. That is only for how the characters, or the background were drawn. Although I'm one of those who barely pay much attention to the art, there were some scene in \"Yahari Ore\" that have an obvious mistakes. My rating for art is low for that reason. Other than some missing lines, nothing could be complained about. If the director or editor put on too much shadow highlights to make it more reality like, it would be a bit painful to watch sometime. That is why the amount of shadows, the lighting, and the textures of the backgrounds and characters were very well done. Besides seeing the cover photo and saying, \"Oh! This look like a good romance anime!,\" the sound is another theme which really got my attentions.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nWhy did I first started this? Is it because I read the Synopsis? Nope. It is because I saw the famous Yanagi Nagi! That's right, Yanagi-sama herself got to sing with her beautiful voice for \"Yahari Ore.\" This is another situation, which some otaku may have in their,\"How to find new anime,\" list. Some will look at the director, script writer, Character Designer, etc., but others may also look at the theme song performers. Certainly Beautiful. Anyway, getting back to the \"real\" sound, the OST is quite amusing. Everyone should be able to tell what kind of mood the characters are in just by listening to the anime's background music. Another key to a great anime is certainly the matching OST in the right place at the right time. Some of the time, however, it seems as if they turned the mood upside down too abruptly, making it seems a bit out of place. Other than a slight bit of non-perfection, the characters surely brings out the light and dark or the plot. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThere are anime out there, which otaku could relate themselves to a certain character. \"Yahari Ore\" took this into a deeper level of emotion. The ideology of many humans differs but there are many people out there, including myself, that took a look at humanity and thought the exact same thing as Hachiman. In character part, this is mostly based on opinions. Since Hachiman could be  related to very easily, predicting the future is like a piece of cake. Although, no anime which I have consumed so far have a character that follows the exact same idea in terms of how we think. Hachiman is probably the only character that actually did what I wanted him to do, which is great! Again, the is opinion. Those who believed that friends are everything may not see Hachiman eye to eye, but that's too bad, for the characters made \"Yahari Ore\" much more enjoyable that I have expected. Sadly, every anime has to have the annoying character, which for this anime, they made her the main character. If you don't know who I'm talking about, I'll make it clear. Yui. Nice name, but bad characteristic, in my opinion. But without her, there would be no such thing as a plot twist in \"Yahari Ore,\" which is why my enjoyment is near the limiter.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nMost of this was discussed on the earlier topic but this should be repeated. Enjoyment is solely based on personal preference on the type of anime. No matter how good it is, if one simply doesn't like a theme, they will rate it bad. As for me, I love romance. I would say it certainly lacked on that area, but I suppose they can't be extremely romantic, since it's suppose to be romantic comedy. Very successful indeed in terms of that, because viewers will certainly get a nice giggles off of each episodes, and see some romance in each of them. More importantly, my reason being for a 9/10 enjoyment is because of the connection between me and the character. This is why my overall is also high.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nNo one can denied that \"Yahari Ore\" is a great anime. It's a great anime when you can actually connect to it, and willingly enjoy it. It's very good when you like how cute the characters are to each other, the way they act, or just how cute Saika is. It's a good anime when you don't like how cute Saika, a boy, can be. It's fair, if you can't understand the words that are coming out of Hachiman's mouth. It's Mediocre for those lacking in the field of watching a realistic view on society. It's Decent for people that have many friends and never experienced anything like Hachiman before. It's poor when people just watch anime without even wanting to watch it, or they don't even like this theme to begin with, so they quit at the first episode and say it's bad just because they are who they are and we can never change a mortal in how they think or react, unless we have a specialist. It's dreadful if you seriously can't accept the facts that everything Hachiman and Yukino had said was true, and you shut the certain and put ear plugs on, not viewing what is really going on in this harsh world. The world full of hatred where humans will only think of themselves in times of emergencies, and the world where there are actually people out there without any real friends, like me for example. Last and certainly least, those who think this anime deserves the word Pathetic, please. What the heck are you even doing here? A 0/10? There's no such thing. Every single anime deserves at least a 1 out of 10, because there's no such anime where it's that bad. In fact, if it's really 0/10, that would be like killing yourself right after watching it. This is the conclusion. I rated \"Yahari Ore' as a 9/10. Certainly there will be a variety of ratings but I just wish there would be none who rated this below at least a 7/10. Thank you for reading, if you made it this far. :3",

            "content": "I will start by saying that my expectations for Yahari Ore No Seishun were not high. I picked up the show to pass time while I wait for the new Titants episode. However, this show was a pleasant surprise, it is not a typical harem show, though some of the plot are recycled and the animation not too unique, this show brings in something that too many anime fails to bring, this is a relatable main character.\r\nStory:\r\nYou can read the synopsis for full detail, but the show is about Hachiman Hikigaya, who is a pessimist high school student. He has no friends, and has beenrejected by all the girls that he has confessed to. He is a good looking person, and even book smart...but for some reason, his views on life, and his \"dead fish\" eyes makes him inattractable to the opposite mate. One day however, after writing a paper on the monotony of high school ( which I thought was pretty insightful), his guidance counselors forces him to join the Volunteer club lead lead by Yukino Yukinoshita. They instantly connect and have great chemistry, and with that, they start their adventure in which they help local students overcome their little petty problems.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is okay, nothing special, but not terrible either. Hachiman looks very like the main character of the bakatomogatari series, and even has the same strand of hair that sticks out of the top of his head. Yukino also looks like Hitagi, and has similar manners and attitude. \\n\\n\r\nBesides those very common art, there's really nothing too special to note here.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nDecent soundtrack that matches the emotions of the scene well. I really enjoyed the first bg music that played when Hachiman was delving about the hoax that we call youth, it made the scene even more impactful.\\n\\n\r\nNot a bad soundtrack, I will probably get ost when it comes out (if it hasn't already)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThis is when the show really separates from the pack, Hachiman's perception and his cunning observances makes this show I think a must watch for people of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have ever been a loner in high school, college, camp, work, or any social place, I think you will be able to relate with Hachiman. I have always been a semi loner, ever since the fourth grade (this is due to many reasons) and I never really fit in. I always thought I was looked down on because I wasn't the extroverted happy go lucky person that I looked like I should be. I felt disgusted with the monotonous non-deep, trivial conversations that people got into everyday. The same thing, but a different day.\\n\\n\r\nI put myself out and isolated myself. I had no real friends.\\n\\n\r\nEventually I realized that to achieve my goals in life, unlike Hachiman, I am not a pessimist, I need to be able to deal with people and accept them for who they are, and in turn, there may be a chance that they may understand and accept me.\\n\\n\r\nIt hasn't been easy but I have been able to have a balance between real friends and \"social\" friends that I know how to deal with.\\n\\n\r\nHachiman reminds me of how I was back in high school when I isolated myself, I also delved into the mediocrity of the popularity class, but obviously my observations weren't as funny as Hachiman. He is hilarious but makes you relate to him at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nHe basically carries the shows by himself, any episode where Hachiman isn't on top of his game, makes that episode weak and vice versa. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIt is a quick series, and I enjoyed it fully. I do wish romance would have been more serious but that's just a personal preference. Maybe a second will be coming, and if it is, then I will definitely be checking it out.\\n\\n\r\nI give the show an 8.",

            "content": "Bueno, time to make my review, muchachos, ok, so what we have here is an anime which is \"My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU,\" btw for those of you who don't know the acronym \"SANFU\" it means \"Situation Normal All F***k up\". I'd probably describe the acronym as befitting on this anime but the other phrase, hummmm not so much, it doesn't fit well with this anime's genre....I'll explain later, so far this anime's genre is compose of; Slice of life, romance, social psychology and some comedy and gender bender (EEEEWWW) element that are bonded on the main character's philosophy in life. Now, I find thisanime's story good, since there is that polar extremes and dichotomy that exist on the 3 main character's namely  Hachiman Hikigaya,  Yukino Yukinoshita and Yui Yuigahama where at one point you'll be irritated by their way of thinking and on the other you'll like them for their compassion. You might say that the main character's themselves are the slice of life and the support character's are the social psychology where the MC's are the ones who influences their presence. Ok, enough of the BS, here are my ratings for each of this anime's category:\\n\\n\r\nStory, Character, Enjoyment and Overall: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nStory- I was basically more on the slice of life and social psychology that are binded on the main character's which gives this anime's story its body, though it also has a romance genre it only plays a trivial role since there is that ambiguity if the main character's themselves do have feeling for each other. Let's face it the main male character is simply a rock in a hard place either way it was really never clear if such romance has such sincerity whether in a hetero or homo kind of way, so for this category its a 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- I think we better go over with some of the character's in this anime, and discuss their polar extremes and dichotomies:\\n\\n\r\n Hachiman Hikigaya- better known as Hikki,first of all I won't describe him as \"anti-social\" that definition is only reserve for bullies, what he is, is either a self defeating loner whose life philosophy is extremely pragmatic to the point that he detaches himself from everyone co'z those everyone are hypocrites or an asshole who can't seem to do bad things and ended up doing good instead.  \\n\\n\r\n Yukino Yukinoshita or Yukinon- according to info she is rich smart and beautiful. Just like Hikki either she is this pompous bitch who pretends to be \"Ice Cold Beauty\" or a pompous bitch with such high stature and even though she is a rude personality towards the so called \"Lost Lambs\", she would take a constructive proactive stance instead of looking down on so called \"Lost Lambs\" BAAAAAA.\\n\\n\r\n Yui Yuigahama- hummmm, either she is a kind hearten bimbo or a stupid bimbo who knows how to value kind people.\\n\\n\r\nWhat make these character to have a 7 rating, was their oxymoron characteristics that makes them say one thing and do the other in a nice way, I only limit it to such score though seeing them in such way was entertaining there are their other features that makes one be irritated as I've mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- it is good to a certain point of seeing the main character's oxymoron attitude and I can't offer anymore explanation for such score.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- It is good, and that's where the buck stops, I did mentioned about this anime's title \" My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU\" and I did mentioned as how ill-fitted the title is to this anime. That's because, as I've mentioned the romance part was ambiguous, the comedy part is very trivial, the acronym \"SNAFU\"....hummm, maybe, but really this anime's title suits well with the other anime called \"Haganai\" or \"I don have that many friends\"  co'z obviously 2 of the main character's really don't have a lot of friends or considers friendships as a nuisance, while \"Hganai\" for the most part has a lot of romance that ends up in smokes, but I ain't going further since this isn't the place for me to discuss it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre 5\\n\\n\r\nNothing much for me to say since the anime's arts is just plain and there isn't much fanservice going on.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nAs in fair enough for me to like the opening and the closing themes as well as the VA who did Yui's voice.\\n\\n\r\nPeace Amigos \\n\\n",

            "content": "High school sucks. But I bet that's puberty talking.\r\nAUTHOR'S NOTE:\r\nI haven't put out a review for some time so I guess I'm glad to be back. Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru (aka Oregairu) was an anime that was recommended to me as one of 2013's better romance/comedy/slice of life genre. Of course, I was instantly turned off just by the genre, but I've caught up with my weekly animes so I took my chance to run with it. First, I browsed through the reviews which were filled with praise as being a very clever, comedic anime about life, youth, and pessimistic analysisof high school life. Sounds enticing. Since I've just finished the anime, I will attempt to analyze this anime and give you the reason why it deserved the rating.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (6/10):\\n\r\nBeing a greenhorn to romcom/slice of life animes, I've come to a point where I will predict a vague, boring storyline, as the genre tends to stray far away from it. Actually, I was quite surprised how unpredictable it was. But that doesn't mean it will be a good storyline. In fact, due to its confusing and sudden change in character development, do we have a mess of an anime like Oregairu. Let's elaborate. At first, we see a underdeveloped and a quite negative character brooding in the shadows that defines high school as despicable and fake. With such a perverse attitude, his teacher introduces him to the Volunteer Club which only consist of another anti-social, in order to straighten his behavior. Hilarity ensues as the two students that refuses any social interaction, work together to help their fellow peers with issue that are questionable, and sometimes, completely unrelated to the plot. Another character decide to join in the fun and also becomes part of the club. The anime focuses on the trio as they live out their boring, lonely, and quite depressing lives as high school students. But wait a minute...when did the characters change their personalities so suddenly? What was the intervention? The cause and effect? During most of the anime, we see our main hero whining about how he's against society, then spontaneously, he has a change of heart in his own philosophy. Our main heroine(s) never get any chance to enhance their development until the last couple of episodes. It feels like the characters are doing whatever they want as the audiences sits there, thinking to themselves: I thought this was an anime about growing up so why is it so stagnant? In addition, the social and psychological concept behind the main character is quite elementary, nevertheless challenging. Social psychology? Nay, we are dealing with a self-conscious high school brat who decided to put walls around himself because of a few bad experiences.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):\\n\r\nComing from Brains Base, whose producers have created imaginative animations in the past, the background and character designs are impressive. Each character has their own unique characteristics and it's not hard to tell who's who. But I can't ignore the obvious laziness within the drawings in some scenes that do require the extra-boost. \\n\\n\r\nAnd their noses. No matter how detailed the creators have tried to make for each character, EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME, NON-EXISTING, FLAT NOSE.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (6/10):\\n\r\n\"Yukitoki\" by Yagi Yanagi is the OP and the EP is \"Hello Alone\" by Saori Hayami and Nao T\u014dyama. Both songs have a J-pop feel which is fluffy and positive. But to tell you the truth, I've heard them from the first episode and since then, I've just skipped them and went straight to the show. The vibes were not tantalizing enough for me to sit there and listen to the whole song(s).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (7/10):\\n\r\nAs many romcom/slice of life animes should provide, the characters are the most outstanding and prevalent. But with so many characters introduced in the anime, it was quite hard to really follow through which character development was the most powerful. I've sat and meditated on the characters and I've come to realize that within Oregairu, all of the characters are quite stationary, to the point where I question the past reviewers how they managed to give this anime a \"10\" or a \"9\". I will focus on the trios, as they are the main characters in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nHachiman Hikigaya is the ultra-straight man with a pessimistic personality. His aptitude as a social outcast allows him to be a cowardice figure that can only be pitied...so why is he complaining when his peers do? He loves to fly solo, bragging about his spirit animal: the bear, a solitary animal within the animal kingdom. He justifies his actions as someone who refuses to function in a society that wears masks, when in reality, his real intentions lie in helping others. Sorry, Hachiman: you can't help others if you can't help yourself. I just destroyed your flawed logic. At first, I was quite fond of his character, as he reflected me while I was in high school. But then, looking at him only reminded of how I acted and began to annoy me to a great extent. I really wanted to punch Hachiman (me) in the face. You see, I've been in Hachiman's shoes, literally. But as I grew older, I've learned that if you act in such a manner, you are not only destroying the relationships around you, but you're also destroying yourself. It is impossible for humans to survive alone. But to have sparked such a realization and emotion towards the audience, Hachiman can or cannot be one's favorite character in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nYukino Yukinoshita is our \"Ice Queen\" and the condescending beautiful tsundere. Quick with the tongue, Yukino's dialogue between Hachiman has a few hilarious moments, although the jokes quickly grows stale by each passing episode. Her personality is quite easy to identify: a self-conscious girl who has a inferiority complex and believes in hard work, rather than raw talent. Though I beg to differ, as Yukino seems to excel on everything that gets in her way. Many of her interpersonal problems syncs with Hachiman though she changes herself for the better. In my opinion, Yukino's character development was the strongest as her complex was triggered within her family, but gradually learns how to depend on others to solve her problems.\\n\\n\r\nYui Yuigahama is our typical fluffy, energetic heroine that annoyed me ever since she was introduced. Slow-witted and the clown of the trio, Yui is usually left out in the cold whenever Hachiman and Yukino battle out with words. Thinking carefully, Yui is the borderline between Yukino and Hachiman, the one who rides the fence. While assimilating into society, Yui is attracted by the solitude that her friends (?) share, as she gains more affection and trust from them. Ultimately, Yui is a third-party character that attempts to wiggle her way in a world (the loner world...) where they won't accept her.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (6/10):\\n\r\nI'm serious. This anime is not a head-turner at all, and I could not make myself more clear. I flew past the episodes, surviving off the comedic standoffs alone. If the comedy was not there, I would not have recommended this anime since most of the characters have a strange knack for clinging onto cliches. The supporting characters do not reinforce the characters whatsoever, and I felt like I was watching a rip-off of the popular anime, \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\". If you really want to know what this anime is about, I suggest you recall your high school days and think about those social outcast, who thought that the world was against them. Now imagine their pea-sized brains that cannot comprehend macro-societal issues and then imagine whining about how life sucks. Now proceed to the watch the anime. Maybe it will spice up the comedy effect. And to the person who recommended me this anime: \"Ehh...\"",

            "content": "Was searching for some High School RomCom kind of Anime and was very glad that I found Oregairu. When I watched the first episode, the first few parts gave me an impression of those typical kind of genre I was finding. However that impression I had change when Hikigaya, the main protagonist said many truthful quotes and his views on people/society which really makes me think about life even in reality. He's not the average kind of whiner but had certain experiences in life which changed him. So that was what grabbed my attention which kept me on watching. To add on, this Anime portraysa few characters whom really gives a good impact on it. We have Yukino Yukinoshita who is hardworking, smart, kind-hearted and straightforward(in a blunt way though). Then we have Hayama Hayato who is good in almost everything and also a goody good person. Hayama in fact, pleases others and will always avoid fights/argues. Each character have their pros and cons & only watching the Anime itself will let you understand more when they interact among themselves. Overall, I give this Anime a 8.5/10. Definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "If you are looking for a different kind of rom-com, Yahari Ore will offer you plenty. It has more complex characters than your average anime. It's story (while slowish) has plenty of development as it plays out. The authors philosophies and character design are not superficial. It is well rounded even though it has its flaws. If you are not a fan of more serious rom-coms with lots of drama, you might want to pass.\r\nThis anime is about a anti-social protagonist who's in the center of a dramatic romantic comedy. Unlike your standard light rom-com, this anime discusses philosophies through its characters. The philosophies arethen acted upon as the impetus for character decisions. It is interesting to watch these characters attempt to stick to their ideal, or discover new ones. That in itself creates much more character development than you would expect from your average anime. This also might make the anime seem more realistic. It is not. The main character magically finds himself forced into a club with the smartest hottest girl in school. How is that realistic? Most of their problems are also easily solvable in my opinion without breaking character traits or ideals. \\n\\n\r\nThe story setup is not realistic. It might appear so because the character are more developed and the problems they face are less superficial. But take a step back and examine the introduction of this anime. The main character is forced to join a club with the smartest and prettiest girl. She turns out to be an ice-queen tsundere. Shortly afterwards a cheerful girl with the opposite personality joins. Thus the anime has setup its love triangle in no time flat. Did I mention the MC's teacher is single, sexy, and smart? None of this is realistic. He just happens to be thrown into the den of two cute girls and the rest is history. Since this is where the anime starts, none of it feels genuinely realistic. \\n\\n\r\nAfter the setup, the story does feel more realistic with the problems the MC has to solve. These issues are not crazy but rather everyday high school issues that might come up. Its the details that the author goes into that makes it realistic. But the solutions feel forced as there are many ways to approach these problems. The author however, feels that he needs to force the MC and other characters to act on their ideals as a method of solving the issues. There is almost no compromise. There is almost no genuine rational. To this end, the solutions do not feel realistic and the story feels more like fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nThe story does steer clear of your standard light romance rom-com drivel. The characters develop over time and communicate in the way you would expect. You also get a diverse amount of emotions ranging from the cheerful and romantic to the bitter and hateful. Too often average pump and dump rom-com animes focus on one spectrum or the other. All this is told from the perspective of the three main characters. As one of the characters puts it: \"You must change the world rather than change yourself to win.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are more complex than your average anime cliche. They all show change incrementally which is good. There are some character flaws however. The MC unfortunately contradicts himself early on, something I believe the editors miss. This isn't important in the long run for most anime viewers since they will forget. But it leads to a less convincing MC who may not be the person he claims to be due to unfortunate events. As I said earlier, his solutions are also forced and appear contrived rather than intelligent. I believe the author wanted Hachiman to appeal to viewers by being both smart and anti-social but largely fails in the former department. The other girls also have design flaws. Both are given plenty of screen time but little of it is used to plug the holes in their character design.\\n\\n\r\nYukino Yukinoshita's problems are never really explained to the audience. This might be OK in real life and OK from the MC's perspective, but its bad for viewers. You never really get to know the why's and the hows. It is a constant mystery why she acts a certain way and none of the relevant parts address the issue. It is almost as if her character was designed with the traits without the backstory that the author would address later on. My point here is that it makes for a weak justification for how her character behaves. Its OK to hide this from the MC for romance story purposes but its not OK to hide it from the viewers. The entire point of this story is to understand the characters. The hook is the romance so you don't need to worry about the mystique. You don't need to solve this issue during the season but it needs to be explained in a way that makes sense for her. \\n\\n\r\nYui is similar in that she doesn't feel complete as a character. While she doesn't have a meta problem like Yukino, her issue is that she has no real problem aside from the romantic one. Her reasons for being in the club are entirely circumstantial. Perhaps its that she is looking for something real but the author doesn't even go there. Instead the author hamfists through their teacher advisor that she's the glue that holds the club together. I just don't buy it.  Instead of letting Yui develop something more she's entirely there for the relationship aspect. That's OK at a certain level but it makes her superficial. Her character is there to strike a balance between Yukino but she cannot do it. Her personality is the only thing that shines but her character isn't fulfilling enough. The author attempts to do something with the dog but later on the dog is completely missing from the story. Of the three main characters, she is the weakest.\\n\\n\r\nAside from plot and characters, there is also the philosophical side of this anime. The monologues from Hachiman serve to explain why he does what he does. His anti-social views however are weak compared to the real thing. He also likes to egotistically assume he approaches problems from a rational viewpoint. So why does he always take a flawed approach? The reason is simple, hes not nearly as intelligent as he is supposed to be and this I would say is not a character flaw but a design issue. I believe the author designed Hachiman to be smart enough to solve these issues in in a way viewers can relate to. But because his solutions are not even close to the best ones, he fails. This seems to be purely the fault of the author.  The character itself is supposed to showcase the anti-social ideals that he holds by making good rational choices at the expense of his personal relationships. Instead however he choose poorly multiple times though this is camouflaged by the ingenuity of his solutions. Since we are dealing with people this is not a good thing. Nobody wants to make a situation more complex than it needs to be just because its a solution. So in this sense the Hachiman ideals are actually quite weak. If we factor in the issue where he questions himself, it becomes even weaker. Furthermore the author interjects to soap-box his ideas through Hachiman. These musings are a different view than what Hachiman's philosophies are.  I suspect the author is presenting personal views rather than Hachiman's views because of this. The anime however refrains from preaching to the audience in most cases.\\n\\n\r\nThe social aspect of this anime doesn't really do it justice. While it examines the social structures of society well enough (compared to other anime), its still falls short. Many situations are not throughly thought out, many reactions are either overdone or ignored. Some of the drama even seems to be manufactured. My point here is that this anime has potential to extrapolate on the social aspects even more than it does. Instead of digging deeper however it waltzes around so that it does not damage some of the stereotypes it establishes. \\n\\n\r\nThe humor in this anime is subtle and good if you like deadpan writing. It pokes fun at every character's cliches and their developments. While it stops short of parody, it does ask many questions and does so through comedy. The comedy also serves as a nice break inbetween the dramatic sequences. One of the key features of this anime compared to others is how comedy is used by the characters as well. In that aspect I would say its more realistic than most animes which elevates the comedic factor. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day this is an anime that you should watch if you like rom-coms as it will expand your understanding of the genre. It is not like your typical rom-coms and like many decent ones, it can stand on its own.  It however, has a lot less romance than you might expect. If you're looking for something like that, I would pass on this anime as its more about trust than love. But on that note, the romance develops at pace that is much more believable than many other animes. Just don't expect to believe that this anime is that much more relatable than other rom coms.",

            "content": "8MAN BEGINS\r\nFADE IN\r\nThe slamming of a locker door. The presence of jocks, nerds, popular girls engulfed in discussions about a new phone coming, teachers scattering about in classrooms, and of course, the loner who wants nothing to do with anyone. This atmosphere, or rather, this presence is none other than high school. High school is that time in ourlives that everyone in their young-adult lives remember as either being a place of paradise or a place of temporary hell. Interestingly enough though, entertainment can sometimes have trouble capturing what high school truly is like and how the people (specifically students) within high schools react towards their lives up till then. Sometimes it\u2019s just really difficult to capture the feeling of confusion and fear that high school entraps us in, especially in anime. However, one anime that, in my opinion, almost perfectly paints this picture of the turning-point in our lives is Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru, also known as My Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong as I Expected, or SNAFU or (finally) Oregairu. \\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the light novel of the same name by Wataru Watari, Oregairu is not your typical school life-centered anime and does a great job at portraying a slightly, more accurate picture of high school. The series stars the cynical, yet wise protagonist Hikigaya Hachiman (THE 8MAN) as he traverses his days in his high school as a loner who only wishes to keep to himself without irritations. This all changes when he is forced to partake in a service club in his school in order to make friends with the classmates that he never wanted to deal with in the first place. The strength that lies within this pretty basic premise is the incredibly well-directed atmosphere and Hachiman himself, which includes how he interacts with those around him and how those around him react to him and their own selves. This certain style of the show really sets up for some for some great mixtures of comedy and drama throughout the entirety of the story.\\n\\n\r\nBeing different from other high school anime is, in Oregairu\u2019s case, an amazing strength, rather than a weakness. Sure, you will find some of the obvious stereotypes/tropes within the show (the trap, the otaku, the emotionless girl, etc.) but the central focus of Oregairu is the relationships that Hachiman forms with other characters that equally have their own amount of flaw and troubles in life, causing the show to steer away from the redundant tropes and archetypes that most high school anime contain. This distancing from everyday anime tropes allows Oregairu to successfully feel relatable to others and how their high school experience was (possibly) in relation to Hachiman and the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nWhat also seems to be a great strength that Oregairu does well against other high school anime is its comedy. The comedy in Oregairu is extremely witty and charming and provides a great balance and intertwining of social commentary with slapstick humor thrown in to it. Hachiman\u2019s inner monologues are hilarious and insightful, giving you a painted portrait of how he views the world around him. What\u2019s also great about the comedy is the fact that the show decides not to rely on fanservice in order to appeal to those looking for humor. Instead, Oregairu contains many moments of well-written situational humor that can come off as being much unexpected, in a good way, as well as a nice balance with its more dramatic moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast of Oregairu is also well-written and intriguing. What makes the rest of the cast interesting is how they all have an opposing personality/viewpoint that differs from Hachiman\u2019s.  For example, the character Yukinon, while being a bit of a stereotypical bitch, contains many complexities to her personality, such as how she doesn\u2019t know how to value a relationship or even understand what one is, causing her to express herself, realistically, as a loner. The character Yui is a girl who can be looked at as a normal high school girl with many friends, however, she actually feels as though she is a poser who is afraid to be left alone. Both of these characters and others all relate back to the theme(s) of Oregairu, which opens up for some interesting development throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and music, there\u2019s nothing too special about them, however, they\u2019re nevertheless well done. The opening and ending songs for the show are very nice and gives you a feeling for the atmosphere of the show. The overall design for the series\u2019 characters are pretty ok and nothing really terrible. I particularly liked the design of Hachiman, who has many notable features that differ from the other character models (dead-fish eyes ftw!).\\n\r\nOne flaw that can be notable within the series is that of the show\u2019s ending. The way the final arc wraps up is nice and surprising, however, there is no \u201creal\u201d finale or conclusion to the show and it all feels like an obligatory setup for a sequel (which it turned out to be true). Instead, what you get is a final episode that is more or less an unnecessary slice of life comedy side story as we as an OVA which is pretty much the same thing. You can, however, look past this flaw for the most part and enjoy the essentials of the show, without the ending distracting your enjoyment of the rest of the series. \\n\\n\r\nOregairu is as close as you can get to finding a high school anime that almost forgets that it is an anime. The show subverts many of the tropes that you can find within a large amount of high school anime and is mostly successful at doing so. Hachiman is a fantastically funny and moodily-written protagonist who is great to watch. The supporting cast of characters is written in a way that perfectly represents the overall themes and commentary that series contains. Aside from its very awkward ending and some silly moments, Oregairu is an immensely entertaining anime that represents a nice change within the demographic of school life anime. \\n\\n\r\nFADE OUT\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR?\r\nOverall, this is a very deep, enjoyable, relatable, subtle, show that takes a new outlook on the whole teenage romantic comedy like how most shows portray it. I recommend watchings this show whenever, I feel like no matter what mood you are in you will enjoy this show, and it definitely has rewatch value. But foremost, I would recommend this show if you are tired of the generic romantic comedies. \r\nActual Review: \r\nThis show will make you surprised in more ways than one. It's 544 AM and I am so tired to add nice words so Ima just get straight to the point the bestI can.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is much more interesting, deeper, and creative than you might think. It takes a different perspective on the (you guessed it) romantic comedic youth of teenagers that you always see in anime. This anime is about a loner, to be frank, if you've felt this pain in your life you can relate to this anime which makes it much better and much more enjoyable at first sight.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I had first watched this show a few years back I never really appreciated how deep and different it was. At that time I just wanted Senpai confessions and kiss scenes on top of rooftops. Basically saying, you might enjoy this more with a mature mind and some lonely experiences under your belt. You gotta pay attention to the subtle and yet deep details for this show to appeal to you. Turn that brain on 'cus this show is much more enticing than you might think.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I loved most about this show is it never out rightly says things in a manner as most rom com animes do. For example, when a character is being flustered this show doesn't go on for 2 minutes explaining that they're flustered among 3 different characters. Instead it shows his/her face turning a BIT red (to show a flustered emotion rather than a flushed feeling) and then say for the girl/guy ends up just asking that person a question their face turns back to normal. If you've ever gone through high school, I am 98% sure you have experienced this feeling. This show manages to find relatable subjects into the matter which is also why this show is much more enjoyable if you are a loner. You can connect with the Main Characters thoughts (I am sad to say I do not know his name) and contrast them with your own thoughts and emotions as you've lived your life.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I would like to quickly relook on the topic that this show takes another outlook onto the high schoolers life 'cus lets be honest. Shows like Sakurasou, Toradora, are never going to happen to most of us avid anime watchers. Why is that true for most of us? Cus lets be honest you wouldn't be up in the AMs if you actually had something better to do. :/\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also sends a lot of deep, profound, and subtle messages throughout the show if you pay close enough attention. This is probably another reason I could not appreciate this show as much as I did when I had watched it sooner. With this said, please try to refrain from just simply marathoning this anime. I know us avid anime watchers want to just gobble up these 13 episode animes like it was a buffet but I honestly recommend after a few moments each few episodes to take a break and truly let that episode sink in a little. \\n\\n\r\nAlong with the legitimately thought provoking things this show can prevent, it also has some light humor and entertainment that fills in those gaps from the show. It puts this show into a comedic setting, but at the same time slips in a few thought provoking ideas. It sets a nice setting when shows do this, as the show doesn't get boring, but then again it's not absolutely pointless either.\\n\\n\r\nNow, as much as I hate to talk about this segment, I gotta. This show honestly feels like it doesn't have a main direction. No real conflict, just, dealing with problems. But somehow it draws you into the story and yes every now and then it'll get serious but quickly it ends up being quickly resolved. You can somehow ignore this fact and press on enjoying this show thoroughly. The openings and endings also provide a very good image for what you're about to dive into. And the characters feel very unique and flourished, they feel like they're truly fleshed out without telling their childhood story of how (fill in traumatic moment like how most animes do it... lets be honest...). \\n\\n\r\nThat sort of feeling you can put into the show without having to outrightly describe it shows great writing skills (or whoever the hell wrote this story). You can put into the characters what you want to convey, and by doing so, helps to liven up the story. Making them feel more realistic and putting a new dynamic into it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a very deep, enjoyable, relatable, subtle, show that takes a new outlook on the whole teenage romantic comedy like how most shows portray it. I recommend watchings this show whenever, I feel like no matter what mood you are in you will enjoy this show, and it definitely has rewatch value. But foremost, I would recommend this show if you are tired of the generic romantic comedies.",

One day his teacher Shizuka makes him join a club after his depressing writings he will submit for his class work. This Club is called the Volunteer Service Club where he meets a girl named Yukino and later on another girl Yui who end up making him change at least a little. Hachiman stays in this club throughout this series helping fellow people of his school get through certainthings they are struggling with. Basically this club doesn't do these things for them they teach them how they can do it themselves. This club helps anyone who sends in a request for help if they are able to help them. Throughout this series you see Hachiman start opening up more and getting closer with people thanks to everyone from the Volunteer Service Club. Can he end up making friends and change his attitude towards people and school make sure you check this series out and find out. I really enjoyed this series with the awesome story line and the great artwork, the characters are awesome you sort of cling to them throughout this series and hope things work out.

I was very wary of starting this first, but I said hey lets give it a try and it was definitely worth it.\r\n\"I hate nice girls. Just by exchanging greetings with them will get them on your mind. Start texting each other, and your heart will be set a flutter. If they call you, you're done for. Enjoy staring at your logs and grinning like a fool. However, I won't be fooled again. That's what your kindcalls kindness. If you are nice to me, you're also nice to others. I always end up nearly forgetting that. Reality is cruel, so I'm sure lies are a form of kindness. Thus, I say kindness itself is also a lie. I always ended up with these expectations. And I always ended up with these misunderstandings. And before I knew it, I stopped hoping. A highly-trained loner is once bitten, twice shy. As a veteran on this battlefield of life, I've gotten used to losing. That's why I will always\u2026 hate nice girls.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis got me instantly intrigued to the story, this might appeal to some people this might not. However this is just one of the amazing quotes our main character Hachiman Hikigaya says. \\n\\n\r\nStory - It was meh, don't go into the anime raising your standards for a beautiful well written heart warming story. I am going to be straight up it isn't.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The character designs were very nice, except for the main character don't drop the show from the main characters looks.\\n\\n\r\nSound - It was meh, I don't really ever pay attention to the sound too concentrated on the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - This is where Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru shines the most.\\n\\n\r\nHachiman Hikigaya - Is this normal kid who views the world in a pessimistic way, and gets stuff done even if it isn't the most likable way.\\n\\n\r\nYukino Yukinoshita - A beautiful, smart girl who is envied by the girls and has all the guys attention. Her personality is unique and you will learn as you watch the show. \\n\\n\r\nThat is about all the interesting characters in the story, but these to make one hell of a good show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I enjoyed this a lot, mainly because I am a rom/com fan, I was kinda disappointed because the romance doesn't really get anywhere, if this is a turn off than I have no idea what to say. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - This was a great anime, with likable characters. I suggest mature viewers to watch the young ones might no understand.",

            "content": "Story: \r\nLike all of the \"High School\" themed animes it starts pretty normal. Though after a few minutes into it you start to see the uniqeness in this serie.Our mc \"Hikigaya Hachiman\" the lone wolf, a guy who has no friends but unlike the other animes this guy has no trouble with it instead he is proud the fact that he is alone. He doesn't involve himself with others, other than when it is necessary,he is a pretty slick guy with brains and a uniqe outlook at the society, his home room teacher seeing this and worrying that he will not blend in with thesociety makes him join the so called \"Volunteer's Club\". There he starts to make some friends and founds love ? (it might seem like clich\u00e9 but the characters take that away and make you see the picture from our mc,how he sees the others and the fact that how he sees the life.) (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt: Is pretty neat, eye friendly and somehow i really liked the eyes of the characters  (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound: It wasn't really that good but still does its job (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Pretty well made the confict between Yukino Yukinoshita and Hikigaya Hachiman makes you smile, and the dialog among the characters really end up well. And i really liked how he braged about his \"failure\" life experiences.(10/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Yeah you will most likely enjoy this serie. Not only it shows you how loneliness can be in a funny way but also the happiness of having friends, sharing and laughing together. There are also touchy moments that make you wonder about his idealogy about people, how he \"solves\" the others problems\\n\r\n(10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It is a pretty fun anime that will make you think and from time to time empathize with our MC. I really liked how they portraited the \"school hierarchy\", his thoughts about it, how he approached people and how he \"solved\" their problems (10/10)",

            "content": "Despite the series' low popularity, \"My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU\" really caught me by surprise. I didn't expect for this anime to be so enjoyable to watch, and expected it to all be over by the time the season ended. Thankfully, there is another season coming out and I can't wait for it. Why am I so hyped-up about this show? Let me tell you why.\r\nThe story evolves around a lone-wolf named Hachiman Hikigaya, who doesn't put much effort into school or really anything at all. To make up for his marks, he is forced to join the Service Club which currently only has onemember: Yukino Yukinoshita. She happens to be just like Hachiman; a person with very few friends, yet one of the more mature characters at their school. What's so different about her is that she's considered to be the most attractive person at the school and has a tendency to compare her \"perfect\" self to everyone else. \\n\\n\r\nSounds like a basic set-up for your typical anime rom-com, but what makes this one so unique is how much it focuses on the morals of each character instead of becoming a complete harem like \"Clannad\".\\n\\n\r\nEach character has their own way of looking at things; the world, others, and even themselves. One of the main reasons I enjoyed this series so much is that the characters are intelligent, and don't make decisions you usually see characters in typical rom-coms make. \\n\\n\r\nThe series takes it's time with character development. Overall, you get to love each character because you get to fully understand them the more you watch. I especially enjoyed Hikigaya's monologues and how much you can connect to him.\\n\\n\r\nI also enjoyed how they hint the characters' emotions towards each other. Not every character is the same as in you can read them like an open book, but most of the characters subtly express their feelings. This series isn't overwhelming in dramatic moments, which makes is actually enjoyable instead of tedious.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this anime isn't called a rom-com for no reason. This series also had it's fair share of laughs and good humor, but again not overly dramatic or raunchy like most romantic comedies so that it's enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I didn't like about this series is how slow some of the episodes are. I said earlier how this series does take it's time with character development, so when new characters are introduced or there are new mixes of characters together, you know that a big chunk of the episode will be spent focusing on the character(s).\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime was surprisingly enjoyable to watch and it really made you think about the morals represented in the series. If you like shows that are psychological, but want something away from the genre of \"paranormal\" or \"gore\", then this will be the perfect anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nTHE VERDICT:\\n\r\n+ Good Animation\\n\r\n+ Loveable Characters\\n\r\n+ Excellent Character Development\\n\r\n+ Good Comedy\\n\r\n- Slow-Paced At Times\\n\\n\r\nSCORE: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWATCH IT",

            "content": "I initially liked this show because it had a brutally honest male lead that was also a loner despite the fact that he was intelligent. *Sighs* Its called a rom com, but honestly I have seen way better shows than this that did not just finish so open ended or BLEH that I wanted my time back. Really some parts were ok, but the absurdity weighed heavier.\r\n There was massive potential for growth and REAL closure concerning the unique personalities of the main characters and how they interacted, yet t'would nae be so. This show could have stood to be longer to finish thingsup, perhaps a 2nd season is in store, who knows?\\n\\n\r\n  Basically:\\n\\n\r\n Loner guy who has good points about things seems negative for his honesty and insight and is relegated to a position he had at the show start. The rest of the characters in the long run remained absolutely indifferent to the social issues that trickle down to school age youth in our society. Perhaps it is the fault of our experiences in school, or it is in fact the world that makes life so, but to me, I just wanted a less pathetic male character in a highly enjoyable rom com again.

            "content": "First of all, I would probably include some spoilers. As in many of my forthcoming entries, you have my WARNING of SPOILERS ALERT. \r\nComparing to your standard Harem/Sci-Fi/Action/Love Comedy/Comedy /Youth Drama shows, you have the biggest freak show in town. \r\nThe show \"My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU\" could be simply put as a nerd called Hikigaya desperately trying to avoid making friends. For some unknown reasons or even past histories that I still don't understand/get it, he is desperately trying to OBJECT the idea of having friends or joining a club. He might have a better life if he would just act and join arandom club and showed up once in a while, He refuses to. \\n\\n\r\nHe is not rejected by the society. It is just himself quitting the crowd. Like what I did. \\n\\n\r\nYou've also got a girl called Yukinoshita. There are almost too many \"TOO\" to describe this girl: she is too good at her studies; too honest when she speaks; too stupid to speak so blunt; too strong that doesn\u2019t even need to rely on the others; and probably too good to be true. And I too, had such \"friend\" surrounding me. He is my English literature teacher. A good friend of mine, an ass at times. \\n\\n\r\nThe second girl called Yui also applies with a few \"too\". Quote from Frank Ocean, \"Too many white lies and white lines\". She is too weak. Too good of a girl. One thing that she is not \"TOO\" is her social skills. Just the right fit to survive. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know who she is at my life. Hell knows. \\n\\n\r\nYou've also got a Chuunibyou Otaku called Yoshiteru. He, like many, is fascinated with the idea of writing light novels. He had a dream. A Dream of becoming the top selling light novel writer in Japan. The thing he doesn't know is that he could not write: his writings are sloppy and full of grammatical mistakes. But well, who cares?\\n\\n\r\nto surprise you, this is not a slice-of-life show. \\n\\n\r\nYou never had a otaku friend that would write like this and still doesn't get his, or her literature/language teacher beating him up; You never will find anyone as useless as Hikigaya to win a tennis match against the Ace of tennis club; You might heard some, but you might never find anyone struggling with their tutorial fees, (or you might not even found one in the US, but it is something easy to found in Hong Kong). And you might probably be able to find anyone as stupid as Hikigaya trying to avoid a relationship. You might never find a woman trying to seek advice from a man on how to bake cookies (Instead of searching YouTube) that is trying to please a guy - usually man does that. \\n\\n\r\nAt times, this is not a slice-of-life show. While the solutions are raised, problems are not instantly solved (like the scholarship case), but they move on. The show does a good job of discovering solutions, not at actually helping to solve them. Scholarship case was one of the more abrupt endings of the show: the idea of Scholarship was raised, but the difficulties of getting a scholarship were ignored. It was, at times, making me feeling incomplete and quite empty. \\n\\n\r\nAt times, the show does feel shallow, sometimes circling around. There is an excessive amount of irrelevant scenes, such as maid caf\u00e9 scenes. Shopping scenes. Useless talking scene. At times, it even attempts to preach: Episode 1\u2019s did have a debate on the definition of youth and try. It is a good effort of including such ideas in an anime, but it is poorly presented in the dialogue form: there are many talks but no walks. It might be a right choice in a novel, but it would not apporiate for something like this to happen in an anime: Visual-wise, the animation at that time was considerablely boring, consisting only two guys speaking and switching position. Plus, It leaves the audience unsatisfied as they never do what they claimed they would do. \\n\\n\r\nAt times, freaks do shine. Hikigaya was the best character of all times: he is just like me and I hate myself. He's able to come up with some great solutions at times, like the tennis game. But he's trying very hard to do a useless escape. Stupidity has no boundaries, but I love him. At least I am not a good student as he does. Yoshiteru is a freak and he shines. Yukino was the genius of the group but she wasn\u2019t the one to be shining. Freaks, Nerds, genius, or just even some normal person working for their love ones, deserves to have a chance to shine.\\n\\n\r\nFreaks do deserve a chance to shine. So as the show.\\n\\n\r\n6.5",

            "content": "Oregairu is a romcom school anime. And it is one of my favorite anime. I've seen it three times. So, what makes it so special from other school romcom anime; Less romance, clever dialogue comedy, closer to reality, epic quotes.\r\nStory:\r\nFirstly, there is little to no romance in this anime. The comedy is there, but it is not situational rather it is more dialogue based. Characters give clever answers to questions and the conversation is rather intriguing.\r\nThe main protagonist, Hikigaya Hachiman, is an anti social loner in high school. He has experienced school life's harsh realities like groupings, rejections etc. So, he now has a matureview of life. The female protagonist, Yukino Yukinoshita has a similar view. And when both of them meet up in the Volunteer's club, which they are the only members of, things get interesting. I say again, there is no romance. But what makes it interesting is how close to reality this anime is. Both the characters have mature viewpoints and there words are meant to be taken seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is filled with intelligent conversations of the two characters. You can't help but be astounded by the truth in their dialogues. In other romcom anime when a girl is \"acting\" helpless, the others will help her. But in this anime, the truth is unveiled as to why she is acting like that. The protagonists's are absolutely amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much story in this anime. It just shows how these \"mature\" characters spend their high school lives.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nHikigaya Hachiman: Anti social loner in high school. But really cool and the most clever things are said by him. You'll come to love him. He's not a delinquent.\\n\r\nYukino Yukinoshita: Beautiful, intelligent girl in the same club as Hikigaya. Has a similar viewpoint of life but it is of less \"evil\" magnitude as compared to Hikigaya's. \\n\r\nYui Yuigahama: 3rd member of the club. A normal hyped up high school girl who lives her life like an average cute girl would in any other romcom anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI like the art. Really nice work on the characters. It may be quite different from what we usually see but it's quite nice for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nBoth the opening and endings are really nice.\\n\r\nYukitoki is the opening.\\n\r\nHello Alone is the first ending.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI've watched it thrice. Of course I enjoy it. Mostly because I've seen a lot of the cliche romcom series. This one stands out. The clever conversations, close to reality situations, everything amazes me. There is a slight hint of a romance in the series but it's not developed. But, I still favor YukinoXHikki.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season is coming out in Spring '15 so I'd recommend to watch this anime. It's sequel is one I'm looking forward to a lot.\\n\\n\r\n\"Those who don't work hard have no right to envy those with talent.\"\\n\r\n   - Yukino Yukinoshita\\n",

            "content": "Think Rom Com. Think Teenage Romance. Think Cliche setting. Think paper-thin characters. \r\nNow blow everything out of proportion. Take every conceivable archetype, the ice queen, the bubbly girl next door, the flawless handsome captain of the soccer club, the Prom Queen, the anti-social, anti-hero protagonist, and give them depth. So much depth that nothing is ever what it seems to be.\r\nThat's Oregairu in a nutshell.  \r\nBefore we get into the review, I'd like to start by saying that Oregairu is NOT realistic. In fact, it is hyper-realistic. The anime doesn't just strip all the fantasy away a typical Rom-com harem story. It instead cranksthem up to eleven, to a point where these high school kids talk and act like people who have lived a thousand life-time. Even the shallowest of character like Miura (who is inspired by the typical \"popular blonde hot cheerleading bimbo) possess the wisdom of a sage. \\n\\n\r\nEvery character has some ulterior motive, wants something and struggles to get what they want, and when they realized they can't have what they want, they turn to the service club for help, hoping that Hachiman, the residential batman (\"the hero we need, but not the one we deserve\") can solve their problems by doing what has to be done - often at the expense of himself. (\"because he can take it. because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A dark knight.\")    \\n\\n\r\nAt first, the people around him thought nothing of it. He was just a weirdo who has a reputation for being an antisocial freak. However, as the story progresses, it becomes apparent that helping others by hurting himself is taking a toll on those who care for him. In other words, by sacrificing himself for the people around him, he ends up hurting them in different ways. People who care for him can't bear to see him do these horrible things to himself. People who he helped can't bear the thought of being in debt to a guy like him (Hayama). Then they try to make amend by either asking him to stop (Yui), do things differently (Yukino), or try to stand up for him (Hayama)...etc.\\n\\n\r\nNone of this is realistic. None of the characters feel like high schoolers. Most people will never come across such complex social dynamic in their entire life. Hell, they don't even talk like real teenagers. It's like watching a show full of ageless vampire pretending to be teenagers. And that's what makes it so fun.  \\n\\n\r\nIn anime, there are two types of masterpieces: \\n\r\nOne that establishes an entire genre by being completely original, inventive (Ghost in the Shell)\\n\\n\r\nOne that takes a pre-established genre and cranks everything up to 11 (Hunter X Hunter, Oregairu)\\n\\n\r\nOf course, in order to be considered a masterpiece, all anime have to be well animated, well acted, flawlessly executed, but the one thing masterpieces cannot do is play safe. Oregairu's concept could've easily blown up in its face, but it doesn't. It takes every trope that's associated with rom-com, twist them, amplify them andd add new layers to them while maintains a degree of believability by giving every action a realistic consequence, while at the same time maintains a consistent theme (You should never burn yourself to keep others warm) throughout that by the end of the second season, you'd laugh at those early episodes when you thought you were watching a typical, high school Rom-com.   \\n\\n\r\nOregairu is a well-constructed masterpiece worthy of in-depth analysis and should serve as a staple of how anime should be. \\n\\n",

This anime shows how the main character, Hikigaya, sees the world and the unique ways on how he would fix things.

But from the second half onward, it went down hill.  This despite the fact that I kept aside the fact that 16 year olds can NEVER be this mature enough to be having deep philosophical conversations or arguments on the nature of human beings. It would have been more believable if this were a college setting.\r\nAnyway, I the biggest problem with this anime was the character development. The male protagonist fluctuated between being a loner, being a deliberate bad person, andbeing a complete jerk. The female protagonist, on the other hand, was a downright biatch. Being blunt is one thing, but to be so abrasively obnoxious, is another. No wonder nobody really liked her.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is good if you're looking for a slice of life comedy (if you go in expecting not a lot). Just keep in mind that both the protagonists are not your conventional protagonists and in all probability, you won't end up relating to either of them.",

            "content": "When you first see the title, you wouldn't really expect it, but this anime has a lot of impact.\r\nTo be honest, I was expected a cliche'd romcom (which I don't really hate), but was faced with a very developed protagonist and some powerful themes. \r\nStory: (Note: Plot synopsis spoilers)\r\nThe story revolves around an antisocial protagonist who is forced to join a club called the \"Service Club\" and is faced with having to help others. In joining this club, he meets the two heroines (each with their own reasons for being in the club) and the story goes on from there. Now, the wow factor ofall this is that the protagonist is  very \"self-sacrificing,\" by this, I mean that his methods of problem solving are intense on self-sacrifice in a very unexpected way.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not developed enough for me to say that there was some complex interwoven inner story, but it was good enough to illuminate the main focus of the actual anime - the characters.\\n\\n\r\nStory is given 10/10 since I feel that it did a great job without rushing or going too slow. It was the perfect pace for the given characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I feel the category of \"art\" is based on the viewer. I like this kind of art style, but others may not; so not much to say.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 on my personal preference. In terms of cinematography and some of the more technique-based parts of expressing the characters, I feel it was done fine.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nSound wasn't really memorable. There are anime with soundtracks that replay over and over in my head, but this wasn't it. The sound was very appropriate for each situation, but it was the kind of thing that works for \"the moment.\" Something that one might try to remember at one point, but not be able to.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the highlights of this anime. The protagonist is one of the most interesting ones I've seen, with a very nice twist of originality. I've seen a lot of the \"self-sacrifice\" types, but this \"self-deprecating sacrifice\" protagonist was very nice to see. There is a lot of focus on personality, and even the characters you wouldn't expect have rather developed personas. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis is something I feel that I can rewatch a few times over and over again without being bored. Everything tied in pretty well, and I really enjoyed watching the story progress.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nGreat anime, must-watch. There's also a season 2, watch that too - it gets better\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10",

            "content": "I have found that is rare in the anime industry, that an anime deviates from it's brand, and marketing. If a show presents itself as a psychological thriller that is generally what you get. Everything is put into neat categories, what the anime presents itself as is what you get content wise. There is, however the occasionally red herring that surfaces. An anime that markets itself to one audience, but ends up being an entirely different entity all together. \r\nOregairu is one such anime. At first glance it is easy to mistake this anime for your stereotypical harem filled with cliches that we have allseen many times. Oregairu is different, it breaks off from that awful mold and presents an anime that is in actuality provides a unique, refreshing point of view on the whole slice of life/harem genre. In fact, I am not inclined to even label Oregairu as a harem anime, as that aspect of the anime is relatively tame, and makes very little progress.\\n\\n\r\nOregairu is not a harem, but is actually social commentary on the psychological elements of relationships, society and friendship at its core. It is not an upbeat anime, in fact its underlying elements are very dark. The anime has comedic elements, but they all work towards highlighting some maybe unsavory parts of society, and social hierarchies that exist within society. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what drive the anime. They are interesting, because all of the protagonist have very stark contrast between each other. Yui is ditsy, is socially intelligent. She is the most adept of the three characters at interacting with people, and understanding the changes, and problems that exist between them. This is what gives her depth over your run in the mill ditsy genki girl that exist in every harem. She has multiple different sides, and an interest prospective. \\n\\n\r\nHatchiman is the main character and is perhaps the most interesting. He identify's himself as a misanthropist. He is a loner that has a cynical view on relationships, society and social hierarchy's. His methods of problem solving are often underhanded, and self sacrificing. He tends to want to solve things on his own, without the help of anyone if at all possible. Hatchiman has created a shell around him from past experiences, even though he seems like he hates people, he seems to be the first to help out in times of trouble. Hatchiman has an interesting duality about him, and that is part of what makes him one of the best characters in the anime world, in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nYuki is the creator of the club in which this show takes place, and initially she seems like she is cut from the same cloth as Hatchiman. She is cold, calculated, and very competitive. Her persona was also shaped by a traumatic past, and she is also prefers to be alone. Gradually, Hatchiman and Yuki develop a mutual respect for each other. Yuki and Hatchiman also come to realize that they are actually very different people, and sometimes this leads to conflict, and hurt when they are solving other peoples problems. \\n\\n\r\nThe contrast and depth that these characters have are what drives the anime forward. Even the side characters are not what they seem at first. This anime can be slow paced at times, but it is a journey, and it contains astute observations, and lessons about the society, and world that we live in. I highly recommend this anime, it is a cut above your typical anime.",

            "content": "This anime is not like your typical rom-com. It has your typical elements when you look at it first glance but after watching it I had a different perspective on it.\r\nStory- 8/10\r\nIt's narrated by the main character Hikigaya Hachiman. It's about a club called the Volunteer Club. People from the school make requests and the Volunteer Club does their best to complete the task. Now, when you watch it. Its not like a romantic anime. I think its was a form of satire. It was their love for being who they were and being proud of being alone. Its more of a dark comedy inthe sense that Hikigaya always philosophizes on why society is the way it is. Those conclusions are usually dark and abstract. The story was basically, how the Volunteer CLub would eventually get their tasks done and how each person with in that club would develop chemistry with each other.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was crisp, clean, colorful, and, so, not much to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSame thing with the art. Not much to complain about. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the characters were basically pre-developed, it wasn't about how they individually developed as much as it was how they developed as a club and how they use it when they're together. If you pay close attention to the characters in this series, each one doesn't really stray from their original notions or outlooks. They just use them differently. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, when watching a comedy, you have to put on your comedy \"hat\", so to speak.You have to think why it has the genre. Its because its supposed to make you laugh. If a comedy makes you laugh, then the anime has done its jon and you as the audience have done our job by reacting the way that it was meant. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nPeople tend to have one overall, look, or requirements, when looking at an anime. they don't know how to put on different \"hats\". What i mean by this is, that when you watch a series like Death Note, you have to ask yourself a couple of questions.\\n\\n\r\n1. What is the intent of this anime?\\n\\n\r\n2. Has it fulfilled its intent?\\n\\n\r\n3. How has it done that?\\n\\n\r\nIn this case, the intent is to obviously make you laugh, and to maybe be more accepting of your faults. It fulfilled its intent by making you laugh. It was a funny anime, I can honestly say that i have laughed more times in this one than any other comedy. It has accomplished this by having subtle yet obvious forms of satire along with unique personalities to further drive that fact home. \\n\\n\r\nIf you love romcoms or comedy in general, you need to have this anime in your thoughts. If you haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend that you stop what you're doing, sit down and watch this series. It's golden in the realm of comedies.",

            "content": "When watching a show that has a general premise such as this, I normally come to a general consensus of the basis of what is going to happen for the duration of the show. You have a group of students at a school, they form a club, and then some kind of massive plot point comes around and throws a wrench in everything to make a generic anime trope more fresh and unique. For example, you have shows like Kokoro Connect with random body switching and other crazy things, shows like the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya with a god who will destroy the world ifher boredom reaches an all time high, etcetera etcetera. Not that these shows are bad by any stretch of the imagination, because they really aren't, but when you take away all the unpredictability and leave this otherwise generic setting the way it is, and put in a pessimistic loner with a stilted view on youth and life in general, you have something interesting and unique in a completely different sense. \\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, the show does nothing supernatural or anything of the sort to build up tension or excitement like the other two shows I mentioned in my opening statement. What you have instead is a club of one guy and two girls who go around assisting their clients with whatever needs they have. And of course, you have you're standard nighttime fair scenes, and you're school festivals, and camping trips. Now, if I left you with just this, the average viewer would write this show off as completely unoriginal. And if we did not get the three main characters that we did, that would be a fair assumption. But it is my belief that this generic storyline is a big contributor in making it unique. This is because of how the main character, Hikigaya Hachiman, views the school culture that he is subjected to day by day. You know how in a lot of anime, a major theme is change? This anime takes that and goes the completely opposite direction with it, that change is only something you do to fit in with the world, and that you are basically lying to yourself, which is a fresh take on that whole theme in general. Of course, even though the way the characters view life is what makes the show great, it can be a bit of an eyesore to see something you have seen a million times in this genre, but the characters make this issue fairly minor.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nBecause of how Hachiman views social interactions and the social hierachy in youth present within the show, you aren't gonna see much in the way of traditional character development. However, I would say that to give Hachiman development, and therefore change his character, would actually be a step in the wrong direction, because as he is, he is a phenomenal character. Because of past experiences, he has chosen to isolate himself from others to save himself from getting hurt emotionally, something that happened on a regular basis during middle school. What I liked the most about his character was how, even though he was rooted in his own beliefs, he would never try to preach or force his way of thinking onto others, even if he would vocalize his thoughts every so often to get his point across. In fact, he is a nice enough guy that he try his hardest to help others when the situation calls for it. He does it in such a way, though, that is true to who he is, opting not to take the \"I'm a nice guy for the sake of being nice\" route. He's blunt, honest, and to the point, and he did so much more than he ever got the credit for. One scene at the end of the first episode, where the third member of the club, Yui Yuigahama, bakes a crappy excuse for a cookie or something, and even though it tastes terrible, he forces himself to eat it because she put effort into making it for him. He is the driving force of this anime, along with the other two members of the club of which I will get to next.\\n\\n\r\nYukinoshita Yukino is also a loner, but in a different sense than Hachiman. I won't get into much detail for her character, as I don't want to bore you to death, but she is, in her own right, an interesting character. She works for the sake of efficiency, and likes to keep to herself just as much as Hachiman. As for Yui Yuigahama, she is a character you would be more likely to see in a typical romcom. A bright and bubbly girl, she is basically the shoulder to lean on when Yukino cannot bear everything on her own. \\n\\n\r\nI won't go into great detail on the supporting characters, but I would like to bring light to the main clique that has a big focus on during the series. You had the blonde, kind of self-absorbed girl, the typical nice guy character complete with good looks, and the lovable loud doofus character. These characters are really only here to be the proof to Hachiman's explanations of how youth sucks. These 3 characters showcase Hachiman's prime thought throughout the series, that people have to change their image and do things that they wouldn't do because they either want self-recognition, or they want to fit into what society seems as acceptable, which I thought was a good way of supporting Hachiman's way of thinking. Of course, I left out the fourth member of the clique, because she is a raging fujoshi comic relief character who nosebleeds at the mere thought of guys getting on top of each other. Seriously, she actually directed a play for two guys to play a lead role, which was practically loaded with sexual innuendo. She was hilarious, and actually put some weight under the genre that this show is listed as.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\r\nThis is probably the weakest point of the show. Because nothing really exciting or interesting really happens in the traditional sense of things, the animation tends to be very limited. The backgrounds and stuff was nice, but it's nothing new from the stuff you see a lot of the time in a high school drama. The character designs, for the most part, weren't all that, but I at least thought they did good with Hachiman's fish eyes, something that he gets laughed upon a lot for. \\n\\n\r\nAnd normally, even if the animation and art was standard fare, I would be okay with it, and for the most part, I am. But there is one part in the entire show where I feel the animation department should have really went to work on to make it something completely spectacular. That is, of course, the concert scene. In shows such as The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Angel Beats!, a good portion of their budget was easily spent on the concert scenes, because they were both absolutely phenomenal. But the concert scene in this series was completely lackluster, with the only real movement being the bobbing up and down of the band members, and the stiff movement of hands when stumming the guitar or banging on the drums. I really wish they could have made it something really special, like many shows before have.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much to talk about sound-wise other than the fact of the music used compliments the scenes they accompanied. With no dub, the Japanese version is top notch as usual, so no complaints there. I will talk about the opening, however. As much as I did like the opening, I feel that it misleads you into thinking that this is a regular romcom kind of anime. It has the same feel as the opening for Kokoro Connect, and I just feel it didn't compliment the tone this show was going for, but that's only a minor complaint at this point. The endings were nothing great.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nEven though this show is labeled as a romcom, it is a lot more deeper than one would expect. Just remember to read the title of the show, because it is right, this romantic comedy is wrong as is expected, but it is wrong for all the right reasons, if that makes sense. The characters are really what you watch the show for, because without them, this show would be mediocre at best. Like, if you switched out Hachiman for ANYONE, even someone like Kyon (who is a badass main character in his own right), the show would drop considerably. This show just goes to show that you can actually write a show with compelling dialogue and deep themes and character motivations in a genre which is filled rich with double D boob sizes and moe blobs. I highly recommend this show, as a fan of high school drama and romantic comedies, this could become one of my favourites.\\n",

            "content": "Oregairu is basically about Hachiman adventures in the service club; a clube dedicated to helping students with their problems. Hachiman helps these students usually using unusual, or twisted means.\r\nLet's begin with the pacing. An usual light novel based anime usually runs every four episodes equals out to a novel. Oregairu has three episodes equals a novel instead of four. Which is probably because most of the novel is probably just his beliefs. Now this is relevent because a majority of the show is just the him ranting about society.\r\nEach episode usually concists of a single ark. So it's not like a lot is really happeningit's more like things are happenings and he's just thinking. This is interesting since most light novel based anime they cute out most of the protaginist's thoughts. This also makes Hachiman one of the most developed characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other character's I don't know. It's not like they're uninteresting, unrealistic, unrelatable, ect. It's more like you don't grow attached to them. Since most of the story is his thoughts you don't really get a lot of other character developement. Most of what you know of other character's is what Hachiman says. Besides that there's only really a few times you see them develope more. Basically it's enough to know who they are, but not enough to understand, or become attached.\\n\\n\r\nOne character that really stood out to me was Hayama Hayato. Who is basically Hachiman's oppisite. I liked how he spoke of idealism and while Hachiman voices his \"realisim.\" Since most of the cast is either weak will, don't show up ofte, or are also loners I found it nice to see a different opinions in there... Though it usually lost... \\n\\n\r\nMost of the shows art is plain, however Hachimans eyes... Well they describe him quite a bit. They look kinda lifeless, or tired, or maybe uninterested which really fits his personality. The animation for his flashbacks are also good since they're basically old film movies thingy. Voice actors are good. Hachiman VA captures his detest, and disinterest, while the other character's voice capture character's personality well.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening, and ending both really fit the show since they're slow paced, and mention isolations a lot. I know the ending song is called like \"Hello, Hello Alone\" just from that... Yeah. As for the BGM it's pretty fitting. Most of the BGM is almost like a rock and roll thing which plays whenever Hachiman thinkgs something, or talks about his beliefs. So like most of the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow this show is probably geared towards intellectuals, pessimists, loners, those who enjoy dark humor, and romantic shows without a lot of romance. If you like shows based around simply crazy humor you probably shouldn't watch this. (check out Panty and Stocking, or Daily Life of Highschool Boys.) Also if your one of those Idealistic Masochist's watch it. You'll see your ideals crash, and burn...\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is the kind of anime that sticks with me for my whole life and one I will rewatch probably one or twice a year.  The character of Hachiman was fantastic (mostly because I relate a lot to the loner archetype) and the two leading females, Yui and Yukino, are not far from flawless characters either.  The whole cast of characters balances out very well and never once did I find myself not caring about what one of the characters was doing.  I thought the art style was perfect for what the show was and I absolutely hope that the same companycan continue the same style for season 2.  The opening song was amazing, so much so that I downloaded it after listening to it three times before even starting the actual show, and this was the first anime I actually sat through the entire end song for every episode as well!  The plot is well thought out and true to the light novels, which I have right now ranked as my favorite light novels/manga since they came out.  I enjoyed this show the first time and enjoyed it just after finishing it for the 4th time.  Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a top notch anime that isn't a shonen \"for my friends\" or a seinen \"i am dark and thought provoking\", and then I recommend further to the people who are looking for those so they can enjoy a show that doesn't have to be either of those.",

            "content": "The surprising thing is, Yahari didn\u2019t turn out to be a typical mindless series at all. It\u2019s a well written, light psychological drama about the social life of high school.\r\nOn the outside, the approach it takes on social issues might be simplistic, but deep down at its core it\u2019s quite complex. I really admire how the show never takes one viewpoint, but multiple viewpoints on an issue. We constantly see different ideals from characters of different social statues discussed. Not only is it fascinating, but the way issues are discussed between the whole cast nail how high schoolers do in reality.\r\nThere are also quite alot of despondent themes underneath the bright colors of the series which constantly hit home with me. Particularly the summer arc, where it delivers the message that sometimes loners will forever remain loners no matter how hard they try  and that struck a deep chord within me.\\n\\n\r\nThe highschool that Yahari takes place actually feels real to life and developed. It\u2019s brought to life by a diverse and very well acted cast.\\n\\n\r\nOur male lead, Hachiman, is a character that anime has thrown at us too many times to count. I swear, most writers have no idea how a cynical recluse acts. They\u2019re mass produced and come out as dull, shallow, blown out of proportion, one-dimensional, dissociate, and the list goes on. But Hachiman transcends all of those qualities to become a multi dimensional character of his own. Throughout the series, he ranges from brutally honest to intellectually sardonic to overly ostentatious and even to being openly altruistic, all while remaining true to character, believable and relatable. People argue that his dialogue is way too embellished (though I\u2019ll argue that it isn\u2019t. Coming from a private school and being on the debate team, I\u2019ve seen people who talk more arrogantly than Hachiman), and I can buy that. What I don\u2019t buy is how that makes him any less of a great or relatable character. Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes has the speech of a sarcastic adult and he\u2019s one of the greatest reminiscence of childhood there is.\\n\\n\r\nBut just like Hachiman, the rest of the cast is a dime a dozen and Yahari manages to brilliantly characterize each of them. Yukino\u2019s not a complete Senjougahara-clone, she has her naively stubborn moments and a soft spoken side to her. Yui is your typical airhead, but she\u2019s fleshed out to well depict a broken, insecure teenager hiding her pain under a bright smile. The popular kids aren\u2019t stuck with an annoying one-sided bratty personality, but actually seem to have feelings.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Yahari lacks a bit in the development and character chemistry. Characters and their relationships with others remain stagnant until near the end and even then, it feels too inconclusive.\\n\\n\r\nAnd even with its fantastic take on high school, the overall plot is quite lackluster. In the end it\u2019s too episodic and never really goes anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end, if you want a well-written social commentary of highschool with relatable characters, Yahari\u2019s a pretty good choice. Just don\u2019t\u2019 expect the psychological drama to be up there with Aoi Bungaku, Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad or Welcome to the NHK and you should be fine.",

If they call you, you're done for. Enjoy staring at your logs and grinning like a fool. However, I won't be fooled again. That's what your kind calls kindness. If you are nice to me, you're also nice to others. I always end up nearly forgetting that. Reality is cruel, so I'm sure lies are a form of kindness. Thus, I say kindness itself is also a lie. I always ended up with these expectations. And Ialways ended up with these misunderstandings. And before I knew it, I stopped hoping. A highly-trained loner is once bitten, twice shy. As a veteran on this battlefield of life, I've gotten used to losing. That's why I will always\u2026 hate nice girls.\" -Hachiman Hikigaya (Episode 5)\\n\\n\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy Wa Machigatteiru or My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU is an anime that is based on real life situations. Especially when it was focused on about life, friendship and youth. So Here's my review:\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nLike I said, Yahari Ore no Se... OreGairu for short, is focused on about life, relationship and youth. And Hachiman Hikigaya, the main protagonist of the story, is kinda harsh about these on his own words. Believing that everything that you learn about youth, life and relationship is just the opposite way how Hachiman treats him and his community, that's why he's a lone wolf, a man that only treats by himself without relying around him. Then, as he was forced to joined at a club accompanied by the guidance councilor, Shizuka Hiratsuka, he met a girl that has the same fate as he, and that was Yukino Yukinoshita. And with these two shared the same club that relies helping hands to other people, known as the Service Club, the two became just an acquaintances rather than friends and he, she and Yui Yuigahama, are doing their club activities for the others who seeks help.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start off with the club activities, and apparently, despite on Hachiman's personality alongside Yukino which are rather has a cold and a loner type while Yui is the friendliest kind among them, it seems that they are trying to work together to resolve the case by helping the others that are seeking to finish the work in time. Which is kinda amusing to see despite on Hachiman and Yukino's personality.\\n\\n\r\nWhile on the main story, it's seems everything is focused on Hachiman, with the example on how those scenes in OreGairu reflect on what Hachiman's saying. Which is kinda educating, in my opinion. But, despite on everything surrounds him, it seems that there's something left around him despite on his how lonely his life was, and that's when he was forced to join the service club thanks to his half-ass report which the guidance councilor takes her attention to him, he still has a heart to help someone who needs their (Service Club) help. And, despite on his attitude, I can't argue with him to the story, which seems it was Hachiman's point of view on whether to determine how he was from his duty as one of the Service Club to how he was as a student. And also, despite on his lonely type and hate that surrounds him, he is also caring to someone around him, including Yukino, and Yui. And some times has a weird feelings to Tosuka. You will know everything about him and surrounds him if you watched this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, one more thing, this anime is focused on friendship and cooperation. I have no idea how this was related to Love-Comedy despite on the title name of this anime. I have seen some other scenes that are comedic, yes, but on love stories... Nah. But development about a love story, yes, especially on Hachiman and Yukino which is kinda obvious from the start they were met.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI will make this as an excuse because of this anime is focused on Slice-of-life. Except on the \"Dead Fish\" Eyes to Hachiman which seems kinda fits for his character.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe voice actors, including the three main characters of the story, Yui, which is kinda friendly type of voice, Hachiman and Yukino, both were lonely and toned down voices, is great especially Zaimokuza's voice actor, Nobuyuki Hiyama, which is I've already been known because of his very energetic voice and I've heard him for like several times since Highschool of the Dead (as Kohta Hirano).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtracks, which is kinda catchy enough. Especially the OP of the song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime, for me, is just too little development status. Others were not changed from the first to the last episode. But, that's okay for me as it was just great to see how characters role in this slice-of-life anime. And as for \"just too little development status\", let's start with Hachiman Hikigaya. For starters, Hachiman on the very first episode is expressing his thoughts regarding about how he hates the community and that surrounds him, also he is praising himself how \"Handsome\" he is, how he is when it comes to women and how smart he is. Which is kinda unknown why he hates everything surrounds him and stayed as a loner, but when his flashbacks came along, it was a surprise that it was based on every males (including me) around. About how he was been failed to fallen in love, how creepy he is to women, he got bullied (not in a serious and physical way), and others. Which is remarkable how he is on the anime, and that is why he's kinda in a loner type class. But, for he's character development, despite of being anti-social to others (according to Hachiman, to avoid being involve in friendly \"conflicts\" or \"fights\"), in every episode he helped to others or gave advice to other persons, he never gave a damn or conflicts about it. He just, you know, doing his work since the first day he stepped on the Service Club with Yukino and Yui. And until the end of the episode, he has made few friends from the ones he helped.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Yukino, despite on her cold and lonely personality, like Hachiman, she also doing her work as a Service Club member, taking it seriously for those who seeks help. But despite on her flashbacks on how she got bullied due to the other girls around her are very jealous on how beautiful she is, she don't even care, instead she ignored it and just relying on herself only. But, when she is doing her job as a Service Club member, she still has few friends with one of them is her enemy. (You will know her if you watch it). And as for her relationship with Hachiman, it seems that we've never seen anything about their relationship between them, but on the other hand, she's kinda has a feeling towards him but she's not showing it up for the audience. She just giving clues whether she was fallen in Hachiman or not. But for this anime season, they were no romantic relationship I've seen so far.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the others like Yui, which is still the friendliest girl among the three, Zaimokuza, has a chunibyou but a reliable person, and others were, at my view, no character development I've seem there so far.\\n\\n\r\nBut before I forget, there's one trap character that exists on that anime, and that was Totsuka, ... You'll know exactly why Hachiman was kinda weirdly shaken or a mild \"fallen\" to Totsuka. Just... watch this anime...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nIt's kinda surprising and interesting how Hachiman was being related  on how a male's character was. But, only for a few people that has a Hachiman lonely type character, which is literally, has an anti-social behavior and he just hate anything that surrounds him (more like an Emo Type). But anyways, a job well done to the anime studio, Brain Base (known for Durarara!! anime) and to the light novel series based on the same name. It was a complex anime that everyone could relate on this anime and one of the best Slice-of-life anime I've seen so far. But, there are no Love Stories were harmed in making of this season 1 of OreGairu, only flashbacks that tells how Hachiman feels about his lovelife, and how he hates the world.\\n\\n\r\nInteresting though, in my view, he seems kinda relates me to Light Yagami from Death Note, both are smart, both were hating the surroundings around him, and both likes to change the world by their own hands. Except of course, Light is in violent mode, while for Hachiman is on the more lighter and non-violent mode that is more helpful and not some kind of a rebel. Other might say that he is comparable to Hyouka's, Houtarou Oreki from Hyouka, both are lazy but smart, loner,and quiet.\\n\\n\r\nBut, anyways, despite on how things were settled here depending on how you viewed this anime, in my opinion, I like how the story works for this anime, I learn what are the good and bad things from Hachiman's point of view, and other good things from OreGairu. Minus the Romantic Thingy, which is obviously, once again, in this anime, no love stories were involve, only bitter love stories from Hachiman and how he became lonely at the start of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo My Verdict which is kinda hard to rate, is a 8/10. Almost to get a ten if the title does really relate to love story, kinda a minor disappointing, but there's something that could gave you clues to whom Hachiman is inlove or how Yui and Yukino thinks to Hachiman in this season and, who knows, maybe Yui has a feelings to Hachiman and has a triagle love story on the next season (which is I'm going to see it next time after they'd finished airing the whole 12 episodes of Season 2). But anyways, it has a lot of good things that you could learn here, and how does it related to you. So I hope you'll like the anime.",

Faced with constant rejection over the years for his looks and somewhat awkward demeanor, Hachiman has learned the hard way that reality doesn't play nice, and neither should he. This has taught him to be incredibly socially conscious, always aware of what he needs to do to minimize his profile and prevent himself from being hurt by others again. He serves as narrator for much of the show, and is constantly belittling and disparaging others...in his head, at least.\\n\\n\r\n- Yukino Yukinoshita is the smart, beautiful, responsible yet incredibly icy second daughter of a national politician. Her model record and cold demeanor has led her to be unapproachable and friendless - not that it makes much of a difference to her. She has a twisted sense of \"noblesse oblige\", and believes that it is the duty of the exceptional (in other words, herself) to help the \"lost lambs\" of the world. She doesn't think particularly highly of Hachiman, but is much more accepting of Yui, who isn't as afraid of her demeaner as most other girls she's encountered. \\n\\n\r\n- Yui Yuigahama is the resident dunce of the trio. Cheerful, popular, outgoing, but not the brightest, she tries to get along well with everybody. Unfortunately, her accommodating and somewhat passive personality makes her prone to following the whims of others, and she doesn't assert herself well - a problem she acknowledges. Her bubbly exterior covers an extremely empathetic personality. She's envious of people like Yukino and Hachiman, who both make and follow their own decisions without hesitation. \\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nWhether by their own will, or forced to join by Hiratsuka-sensei, the three all become members of the school's Service Club, tasked with helping the students of the school with their problems. These kinds of characters, while not exactly common, aren't that rare either. What is rare, however, is how absolutely realistic and brutally honest their portrayal is. They are all, in some way, broken and damaged people - who better than they to help others? In doing so, they are all forced to re-examine who they are and decide whether that's who they want to be, or if they want to change...or even if they can change.\\n\\n\r\nDon't let the title fool you - this is not really a romantic comedy, at least not in the traditional sense. RomCom anime has a tendency towards wearing rose-colored glasses with regards to high school, as if it were a magical place where hard work, friendship and romance are around the corner; reality is, unfortunately, far from the truth. There is virtually no fanservice of any kind (sorry ecchi lovers, you ain't gonna find none o' that here!). The show isn't about the plot, so much as it is about dealing with the fact that Hachiman, Yukino, Yui and everyone else around is just like them: insecure, awkward teenagers who haven't fully figured things out. There is no guarantee that at the end of an episode, the characters will be happy with each other, or even happy with themselves. When was the last time you saw that in anime? But you know, life isn't always happy. I myself had a great high school life, but its frankly scary how close some of Hachiman's experiences match my own and how realistic they are.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's where the main appeal is: how realistic everything is. How realistic their interactions are. How realistic their individual solutions to problems are, and how realistically they bounce off of each other. How realistic the pacing is. How realistic their growing friendship is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd despite this realism that can often-times border on straight cynicism, this show still has this unique hopefulness to it. Somehow, it will turn out alright. The quirky nature of each character makes you love them, and all of them feel like real people that have their own strengths, weaknesses and problems. You find joy in seeing a simple victory, like one of them making the other smile, or watching them make fun of each other less frequently as they go. You become elated when you watch them begin to accept others into their lives, or to finally stand up for themselves, or to come out from the shadows of others.\\n\\n\r\nOreGairu is about listening to Hachiman tell stories of his past shames and cringe-worthy rejections by others. It is about watching Hachiman and Yukino's verbal sparring matches. It is about Yukino, Yui and Hachiman trying to prevent someone else from going through what they've gone through. It is about doing something as simple as watching Yui burn some cookies, and learn the true meaning of hard work vs. talent while Hachiman and Yukino grudgingly help her. \\n\\n\r\nIt is about watching them sit down in their clubroom, lit by the sunset, after another successful but harrowing job, trying to figure out what to do next. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\nTo summarize, OreGairu is a sorta-romantic comedy slice-of-life, with incredible dialogue and deeply incisive observations on the realities of life, friendship, family, romance and high school. This is my personal favorite from this Spring 2013 season, and probably one of my favorite shows of all time. If you want something sweet, happy, or action-intense, with great visuals and sound, this probably isn't the show for you. But if you enjoy watching a portrayal of teenage life that is closer than you might expect, then I think you know what you need to do: \\n\\n\r\nWATCH THIS SHOW.",

            "content": "Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru or OreGairu for short.\r\nFrom the first line, it had grasped my attention utterly and had me chuckling.\r\n'Youth is a lie. It is evil.'\r\nThis anime in a short summary is relatable, thought-provoking, attention grabbing in the best way and most of all, it can send you spiralling down in inner turmoil because it makes you realize things you neglected maybe out of convenience or oblivion.\r\nScratch that -- A short summary would never be sufficient for this anime, in which I was skeptical about at first. But I can affirm one thing for most; it is worth your timeto watch it. \\n\\n\r\nToss away all your previous prejudices about romantic comedies and the cliche situations you can already picture with crystal clarity in your head. This brings your daily problems in a new light with different perspectives. It's comedic (duh), heart-tugging in some moments. You just get... unreasonably attached to this weird specimen of a protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10] [SPOILER]\\n\\n\r\nThis is the section that I felt is the most important for me personally.\\n\r\nIt made the story what is it and the way it could go because the characters were so... bizarre? Can I really use that word?\\n\r\nMost characters are like fragments of your personality that you have once been or are but they are more extreme. One way or another, you will see yourselves in them, even if it was just a little bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe Protagonist: Hikigaya Hachiman.\\n\r\nPessimistic to a fault, your day to day loner. And here's a little hindsight: He doesn't care what people think and he loves himself for it. Yet, you cannot shake off the fact that there is a subtle hatred for himself simmering at the background because he's willing to tell people how low he is, even if he accepts himself.\\n\r\nThe subconscious self-sacrificing kind that clenches your heart to see him do this, even if it was for the benefit of others. He is the unsung hero in this anime and yet quite a queer villain with powerful and persuasive monologues.\\n\r\nAnd then you reach an epiphany: Those words are actually quite depressingly true at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe Antagonist?: Yukino Yukinoshita\\n\r\nThe person in your life that pushes herself too much to achieve and in the end, often gains envious or jealous stares, the one that is too strong to care about the bullies. The one that burdens herself with duty and very focused to the extent of exhaustion,  who finds it difficult to confide and rely on others because she had always been a lone fighter.\\n\r\nYukinoshita is that relatable person you might have a friend of, or you are her yourself.  She might be seen as an over-achiever, but she is just trying her best. Misunderstood so she couples it with brutality of her bluntness, to go against people who talk crap about her she overcomes it with the arrogance of achievement she has. Unique and amazing... but sometimes awfully pitiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe Cheerful One (because support doesn't seem right): Yui Yuigahama\\n\r\nShe is the one that tries her best to fit in because she fears isolation. Sounds stupidly familiar right? The person who is like a 'worker bee' in a clique, afraid to go up against the head honcho and knows all too well what a fall out could do. Despite her cheerful personality, she hides a lot of pain because she is unable to understand her friends.\\n\\n\r\nStory [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nWith the characters introduced of your varied loners and typical; you get this anime. Their banters are hilarious, the protagonist's methods to solve things are unorthodox and painful to watch at times and yet logical. \\n\\n\r\nIt makes you realize that some things cannot be understood -- rather, we can never fully understand one another but we can try. It goes through the trials and tribulations of friendship with still developing romance, giving light to the plights of the people in the different levels of the status quo.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it well and out, it is not your typical anime. It is worthy of praise (in my opinion anyway) and incredibly amazing to watch. You would hardly feel time pass with the tension that is often present in the anime, their arguments and their solutions that just draws you in immensely.\\n\\n\r\nYou will probably enjoy it.\\n\r\nSo embrace it.\\n\r\nI dare you :)",

            "content": "Oregairu is an anime whose premise screams \"Look at me, I'm not one of those generic romcoms!\"... and to a good extent it manages to keep the promise it makes with its audience, although not completely exempt from defects plotwise: it will surely be a pleasant innovation that will entertain the weary viewer of school and slice of life comedies, but don't expect a revolution in the genre.\r\nStory: 8/10.\r\nOur male protagonist finds himself stuck in a club against his will, alone with what are meant to be his two love interests: nothing revolutionary, as announced; the two girls already met him in the past buthe doesn't remember it: also pretty clich\u00e9. However, more than the situations, it's the perspective from which the situations are seen that is not easily found around: away with the flag-rising and the smiles in the light of the sunset at the end of a \"we-don't-call-it-a-date-but-it-secretly-is\"; now we get bitter thoughts and cynical smirks, and the actions of the characters are coherent with the whole mindset of the series. The plot is not new, and honestly it is also pretty average, but the plot is not the same as the story: it's how the plot is told that is the strong aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10.\\n\r\nThe drawings are good, the main characters are pretty detailed most of the time and the scenery is ok; there is nothing special about it, but it surely keeps up with the level that has been reached nowadays.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10.\\n\r\nI never am particularly attentive to the background sound and to the songs, and this anime did not impress me in any sense in this direction; the opening and closing songs were just fine, but almost always I ended up skipping them to see the actual show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10.\\n\r\nThe male protagonist is surely (and deservedly) the focus of the whole series: his wry and misanthropic monologues, his ruthless and caustic way of solving others' problems, ultimately his \"loner-'cause-I-like-it\" personality are completely the opposite of what we get so often from the nice MCs that we always meet in the average romcom, and it's in a word refreshing; this does not avoid in him some stereotypical helplessness, that actually arises from his own cynicism: he doesn't see the hints of romance around him exactly because he can't help but liquidate the matter as the false hopes of some random popular high school guy. Still, he surely has an appeal to many viewers (including me) who will identify themselves more with him than with the usual male protagonist of this kind of comedies.\\n\r\nThe other characters too have some depth and originality in them: the two girls in his club are more than one-dimensional stereotypes, especially Yukino, whose not yet completely explored background has still much to offer for the second season. As for the secondary characters, they're likeable, even the ones that could easily fail (like the big chuunibyou and the girl who nosebleeds at BL); what I found appealing is that there really is a group of characters (Hayama's friends) that falls into the standard behaviour of romcoms, but it clashes so hardly with the harsh eye of the protagonist that it's still interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10.\\n\r\nI have seen a lot of generic comedies, and I surely like this genre (otherwise I wouldn't have arrived to watch so many of them). But this particular anime captured my attention for the new direction it took, which deeply changed the way the story was conducted with respect to what it is to be usually expected: because of this, I easily spent a whole afternoon enjoying this series in one sitting, which is a rather good indicator of the way I felt while watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10.\\n\r\nOregairu is certainly an experience that's worth doing, both for those who aren't usually fond of this genre (since they'll find themselves with a more realistic viewpoint on what school life is) and for those who have seen everything in the pretty uniform field of romcoms (since they'll meet an original MC and a refreshing perspective on those same experiences they've seen so many times).",

            "content": "Alrighty, after holding myself back as well as finishing exams and getting sick all together, I've finally finished an exceptionally great anime, that of which is Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru, a fantastic and dark take on not just the archetype of school romance, but of society and the world we live in.\r\n*SPOILER ALERT GOES HERE*\r\nEasily said, from the moment I started the first episode until the end of the last episode, I was never once disappointed. Sure, I did find some things that I didn't particularly like in the show, but I never stopped being entertained. I never stopped enjoying theshow. There's a whole lot that draws you into it, from the clever, witty banters between our pessimistic yet down to earth protagonist Hikigaya and beautiful Yukinoshita, gifted with a silver tongue, to the educational monologues Hikigaya has with himself.\\n\\n\r\nThe main draw of this series would be the main theme that surrounds the characters, followed by their interactions with each other. The theme being the disgusting, horrid and repulsive underbelly of society, which a minority of people in our everyday lives face, or rather like Hikigaya, live in. Therefore, what this show does is, it shows the general audience that not everything is as whimsical and happy go lucky as it seems. That life you're living right now, you know with all your friends? Chatting, talking about the latest movies, latest games, fighting amongst each other but then making up later on? There's people, exiles, 'scum of society', never given a chance to do any of those things, just because they were cast aside, hated and ignored.\\n\r\nAs the anime needed to adopt this grandeur theme, it had to toss aside the traditional school romcom setting.\\n\r\nHere's a rough analogy of the entire structure they had gone for:\\n\r\nOne day, theme decides to take setting out for a date. They go to a fancy restaurant and ordered food. Theme 'accidentally' spills some hot tea on setting's dress, snickering to himself as he helps her clean up. He apologizes and they continue. Theme then proceeds to take a massive dump on setting's face while laughing like a maniac.\\n\r\nTL;DR The theme completely shat on the setting. Sure it did have some standard throwbacks to the normal romcoms ala fanservice and insane humor(I'm looking at you Zaimokuza and Hina), but overall it was a huge makeover. You could tell the there is something going on with the 3 main characters, but the anime never really wanted to focus on the romance portion. Comedy was present in the form of dark comedy as well as blatant character trait jokes.\\n\\n\r\nWith the theme and setting in place, next were the characters, and oh boy were they astonishing. The anime does a good job of showing us that we just can't be friends with everyone in the world, you just gotta have people you don't like. Conflicts are bound to happen and you just ain't gonna connect. It's so realistic it's just too relatable. Anti-hero Hikigaya, even though he doesn't want to get involved with people, still manages to find it in him to help people with his extensive 'knowledge'. It's just brilliant that someone of his stature would even bother to do something like that, whereas the inhabitants of the bright side of society just blindly follow and go about their normal, 'exciting youth'. Another jab at the traditional setting would be how the main protag does not ever 'grow up', or change his personality to be a better one. He stays himself, because he loves himself and his current anti-social ways. There's no need for \"I need to be a stronger man, for my loved ones!\" or any defining moment to alter one's self. Sadly, one downfall would be a lack of interaction with some characters which I thought would have made things more interesting. The show was focused mainly on the trio, which is good don't get me wrong, but I felt that there should have been more time allocated to characters who needed more screen time to shine. I was secretly hoping to see Rumi again T^T Personal issue there out of the way, the arc with Rumi also shows us how this problem isn't only affecting adults/teenagers, but kids as well, which adds more to the realism the show portrays.\\n\\n\r\nSound, art, music etc etc, great, fantastic, nothing too fancy worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, now the flaws of the anime, quite little actually, apart from the one I mentioned previously. I didn't like how they resolved the issue with Hikigaya and Yukinoshita, it just felt too simple. The ending was also something like a double-edged sword, while I liked how they ended it with a sort of continuity stance which made it feel more realistic, but disappointed as there was not a very big impact. Mayhaps as the novel continues, things'll get more interesting at the true end of the series. I'll definitely be looking forward to that!\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to urge everyone, literally, everyone, consumer of anime or new comer, young or old, male or female. Everyone. You have to watch this, this will wake you up from the facade society is giving you, this is what you will face when you grow up, get a job, interact with people etc. Just remember, the next time you see a loner, hang out with him and talk to him. Who knows, he might just a friend in need, and a friend indeed.",

At first, when I saw the picture, I expected a typical girls anime, with one boy and 2 girls. But it wasn't.\r\nThe anime starts very funny, with the story of a boy which doesn't wants to have social contacts or friends. A lone wolf. \r\nLittle by little, you are going to find out, that he had one experience in the past, which characterizes him until now. Even Yuigahama and Yukinoshita aren'table to cure him.

It's the most boring and generic anime I've ever seen.\r\nstory 1/10\r\nI can't find any other words besides \"pathetic\". Since I started it last year I don't even remember what it is about, I got so bored that I wanted to drop it andforget everything as soon as possible. I guess a nihilistic teen is forced (basically everything he does is because he's forced to) to join a group with two other girls and he gets more and more bored and disgusted by humanity each day. It still could have been a nice anime if there was any character development or even some puns I don't know. It's so boring I couldn't even manage to finish an episode. I promised to myself that I'll finish it but I don't think I will be able to, since I still have a bit of self-love.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nah the art! The only good thing about this series. I enjoyed it a lot, it's probably the only thing that got me through it. It's well-done and probably the best one so far. I like Hikigaya's style because it reflects his personality and how little is his will to live, really nice. I also like how the characters' hair is never a natural color.\\n\\n\r\nSound 1/10\\n\r\nboring, I hated both the opening and the ending\\n\\n\r\ncharacter 2/10\\n\r\nI decided to give it 2 because hikigaya reminds me of L (for the way he walks), and I like his nihilistic personality but I couldn'y stand his internal monologues, he seems to be so tired of life, I'm like him too however I'm not an anime character, what I want to say is that an anime with a character like him would be inevitably boring. I didn't like anyone but hikigaya (although he's rather tedious and dull the others are even worse) and saika. Yui is exaggeratedly cheerful while Yukino is the exact opposite, always cold (not by chance Yuki \u96ea means snow), nonchalant and indifferent, I couldn't stand a person like her in my life. I don't know if there is any character development but I haven't seen it yet, and I just finished the 10th episode.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment 1/10\\n\r\nIt's so hard to even complete an episode let alone finishing the whole series. I regret starting it. \\n\\n\r\nI know that it's a really spiteful review but I don't even know how to put into words how bad I've been disappointed by this anime",

            "content": "Intro: \r\nI must say that I myself am a man who is constantly criticizing the contemporan society, the idiocy and sheep mentality of it and yet I did not relate to the show. \r\nOregairu is a failed attempt of a rom/com seen throuh the eyes of an witty outcast. \r\nAnother generic anime about a highschool boy who joins a club and meets a bunch of girls.\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nYahary adopts the overused generic and cliched premise of a guy joining a club and meeting girls, premise that is poorly executed. The story revolves around the apathetic loner Hachiman who is forced to join a club led bya distant and cold girl and through this club help out other high schoolers.\\n\r\nThe story has no clear direction, no romance, no drama, no goals to achieve, no dreams to make real and has nothing to teach you or lessons to learn. \\n\r\nWhile at first I enjoyed Hachiman's cynical point of view on life, as the story progressed it became repetitive and dull. I also did not enjoy the gay sugestions and the scenes revolving around the girly boy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nThe character are flat, one dimensional, generic archetypes with little characterization or uniques traits. The characters are stagnant and do not get any sort of develoment.\\n\\n\r\nHatchiman is the anti-social protagonist who makes witty remarks about the insignificance of school life, friends, relationships, etc. At first it was entertaining to see and hear his clever reactions but those reactions soon got very repetitive and dull.\\n\\n\r\nYuigahama is the generic, shallow nice girl and the potential love interest of Hatchiman but the creators decided there is no need for romance in this show and just forgot about that side of her.\\n\\n\r\nYukinoshita has a similar view on life with Hatchiman but has a diffrent personality. Her character is stagnant and soon becomes boring. Besides being cold, edgy and taunting everyone, she has nothing to offer.\\n\\n\r\nTotsuka is the generic and predictable trap of the series with no real personality. At first his relation with Hatchiman was entertaining but soon became irritating. The constant gay hints and other boys blushing at his sight is vile.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 6/10\\n\r\nThe animation and art is very mediocre and looks cheap, having dull backgrounds, generic character design and no special effects or any sort of \"eye candy\".\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\r\nThe opening is bad, I always skipped it and the ending theme is horrible. The soundtrack is utterly forgettable with nothing to brag about or mention.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nI did not enjoy this serie, I rather hated it and just finished it so I had it finished and never have to look back on it. \\n\r\nThis show calls itself a romantic comedy but at no point I found myself laughing or intrigued by the \"romantic\" side of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\nYahari brings nothing new or good to the table, it is just another \"antisocial boy is forced to interact with girls\" themed anime. With pathetic plot/characters and average at best animation/sound this series is a true waste of time.\\n\r\nI regret not dropping this series and I do NOT recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nPS: Feel free to criticize my review by leaving a comment on my profile.",

            "content": "I finished this anime a while ago, but I feel with so much excitement I have for a new episode every week of \".Zoku,\" I should just do a review on this season. In my opinion  Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru.Zoku is the best anime this season, (yes even more enjoyable than Kekkai Sensen.) I say this because the characters are so unbelievably easy to relate with for any common otaku. The first season just really sets this off. The story was basically just separate archs of them having to solve different problems they encounter throughout the school. When they goon a trip to help out younger students you'll really start to love this show. The deep view points different characters have on certain situations is outstanding. Then when you get to the last episode it starts to get even more deep and suspenseful. It's a fun journey and there's no reason not to take it.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't realize how lackluster the art was until reaching the second season. The art of the first season kind of gave me a Tordadora feel, and I can't say I didn't enjoy that. The art in the second season is so easy to fall in love with. So for the first season, yes the art is mediocre. Sound was ok too, but nothing really outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS ARE EASY TO FALL IN LOVE WITH! I have fallen in love with every character in the show, and it's because of the way they interact with each other. Yes there is a popular crowd that no-one really likes, but the development made between these characters is something you want to keep feeling. Watching the second season I can tell Hachiman is just going to keep developing, and something will happen between he and Yui.\\n\\n\r\nThis season received a 7, but the second season would be a 9 with the way its going right now.",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nYeah, I've said this before, but I'll say it again. I don't like slice-of-life highschool anime. Their full to the brim with countless clich\u00e9s. They usually have no clear ending. Their characters are just cardboard cutouts dangled on a string. But the thing I can't stand, is just how many of them portray high-school just... so... wrong. It makes it seem like highschool is some kind of idealistic growing point in your life, where you discover who you truly are, and form all the relationships that will be crucial for the rest of your life. Let's be frank, these high-school animerepresents real life pretty much as well as if they set in an alternate dimension where all the students were bears, or if God himself attended the school. Oh, wait...\\n\\n\r\nIt just plain...pisses me off, and that pretty much sums up my relationship with these kind of anime. When I picked out this anime to watch, pretty much at random, I expected all of this crap to be waiting for me down the line. But it turns out, everybody, that not only is My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU actually pretty damn good, but  it's also the most honest, accurate, and downright relatable anime I have ever seen in my life, that captures perfectly the social dynamics, relationships, and trials of highschool, with some of the best and wittiest dialogue of any anime period.\\n\\n\r\nHello everybody, my name is Quan, and today we will be looking at an anime very, very close to my heart: the underrated highschool flashback anime that had no reason at all to be this good, My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU(which is just going to be called SNAFU from now on, because that name is annoying to type out.). Let's get started.\\n\\n\r\nSNAFU was brought to life by the wonderful people over at Brains Base animation, who if you can't remember, were also responsible for my all time favorite anime Baccano!, and the sequel to the original economic and relaxing romp: Spice and Wolf, appropriately named Spice and Wolf II. It was directed by Ai Yoshimura, who has done...um...give me a minute. Actually, pretty much just this. I mean, she directing Ao Haru Ride, which is actually airing right now, but besides from that, there's only some storyboards for Anohana and Gintama'. Well...that just makes her even more awesome. Go watch Ao Haru Ride guys. Probably is going to be really good.\\n\\n\r\nThe script was handled by Touko Machida, who also wrote the scripts for shows such as Hamatora The Animation, and Akiba-chan, but the original creator of  SNAFU is Wataru Watari. The anime itself is 13 episodes long, and aired in the Spring of 2013. Now, with that covered, we can talk about the plot...for lack of a better word.\\n\\n\r\nWe open with Hikigaya Hachiman, a student at S\u014dbu High School, but he's far from a typical bland highschool student protagonist. He is, for lack of a better phrase, kind of a prick, whose brusque with everyone and everything, and his pragmatism tends to get everyone around very annoyed with him. He stays like this, friendless and fine with that fact, until Hachiman's language teacher: Shizuka Hiratsuka, decides otherwise. She forces him to join a very unusual club: The Service Club, whose sole purpose is to help other students with whatever problem they bring to the club. The Service Club's only other member is Yukino Yukinoshito, who is basically the most popular, rich, and academically gifted girl in the school, but despite all this, like Hachiman, has hardly any friends at all. As the pair attempt to help students with problems, despite their clashing personalities, they are also joined by Yui Yuigahama, a girl who has struggled to both fit into highschool while also voicing her opinion on things. From then on, the show follows an arc format, with each arc being a problem brought to the Service Club by any given student. What follows it a incredible relatable, yet flawed tale, of relationships, bears, and what fitting in is truly worth.\\n\\n\r\nLet's focus on the positives first shall we? Now, I think I've said this enough, but how close to home this anime can strike occasionally is almost rather unsettling, so much so that it might as well be me talking than the characters occasionally. Real social and relationship problems are addressed throughout the anime, while some other slice-of-life's would just put in unrealistic melodrama, SNAFU puts in real teenage anxiety and distress, all told through the eyes of a main character so pessimistic that he can take it all at face value. While it can be also satirical of these relationships and anxiety occasionally(in the spirit of an anime like Watamote), most of the time when Hachiman isn't sarcastically commenting on what's happening, the anime can be a little bit discouraging or even depressing. Any given arc will usually end with either Hachiman being blamed for the problem, though most of the time that's according to his plan(more on that later), or be so bittersweet that you're not sure how to react. Just like in real life. Problems don't get neatly solved in the span of one arc; there's misunderstandings, friendships fail, and certain students are pushed to the side by their peers. This isn't a bad thing though, if anything, it just shows how much the anime knows what it's talking about, and is somewhat refreshing in a way. Regardless, it's just plain fantastic.\\n\\n\r\n Also, oh my god the dialogue in this anime. When Hachiman isn't sprouting these incredible monologues that solidify him as \"The King Of Highschool\", some which I hold as some of the most relatable, intelligent, and amazing dialogue in anime period, it's interactions between the club-members. Seriously, when Hachiman and Yukino interact with each-other, it's just pure gold. Since both of them are completely honest and blunt with everyone, their conversations with one another make up of a series of sarcasm, word plays, and verbal abuse that is so incredibly entertaining and fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOK, I know I've been pretty much been non-stop praising this anime till now, but unfortunately, it's now time to address why this anime can never been on the same level as some of my favorites. Now yes, this anime is a refreshing and honest portrayal of highschool relationships and social life, with characters strong enough to relay these themes, but that doesn't mean it won't fall back on typical slice-of-life tropes when it has to. I mean let's be honest, the very premise of the series is one that has been done a million times before: cast-out loner suddenly is thrust into a club with the prettiest girl in school; not exactly original stuff, no matter how much the anime evolves from then on. When you exclude the main characters as well, you find your typical bunch of stereotypes, that are only really there for Hachiman to dissect their social group one archetype at a time. I mean, you have Yoshiteru: the otaku suffering from adolescence disillusion, Saika: the trap character, Hayama: the hunk, and Hachiman's teacher Shizuka is basically just a less mild clone of Miss Sawako from K-On! The story-lines the anime provides are nothing too outside the slice-of-life's tattered old box, from the fireworks episode, the school festival episode, to the episode where all the female characters dress up in maid uniforms. It really quite a shame, because all it does at the end of the day is water down a series that had so much potential and originality going for it; I fervently wish that the writers didn't think that they had to fall back on these weary tropes. It really makes me depressed when I think about it actually. This isn't to say the story-lines aren't sometimes awesome, the student council arc being one of  my personal favorites, but mostly their just excuses for Hachiman to be sarcastic and stuff. Also, the series does kind of seem like it has run out of ideas by the end, because at the point where the characters are dressing up in suits of armor for the school festival, I'd say you're running dry on concepts for stories. And for some reason, there's this completely forgettable OVA included, which just ended up being a huge pile of nothing. I guess that's really neither here nor there in terms of the series though.\\n\\n\r\nAs we move on to talk about our characters, and especially our main character Hachiman, I just want to say how much I love this guy. When you take him at face value, yes, he's kind of a jerk to everyone, but the more you spend time with this character the more you begin to understand him, through both those occasionally amazing monologues he has, but also the lack of correlation between what he says, and what he actually does. Due to several events events that occurred in grade and middle-school, Hachiman has pretty much closed himself off completely from people, and thus is willing to take whatever blame, for whatever he needs to, in order to keep his classes' social status quot, pretty much committing \"social suicide\" at times to protect everyone else's relationships to each-other, with the firm mindset that nobody will mind if everything is blamed on him. While this might not be entirely true, a fact which Shizuka constantly reminds him, Hachiman pretty has this belief for the whole series, though while it might not be entirely obvious, he does develop through the series, though in very subtle ways. When we're not getting a look at his character, Hachiman provides the comedy for the series, with his sarcasm and pessimism. He basically just sits in the corner of the classroom, and breaks down the social pyramid of his class, which are usually hilarious, relatable, and lead to things like Hachiman's strong desire to be reincarnated as a bear.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have the school's prettiest girl: Yukino Yukinoshita. Now Yukino isn't your typical archetype in this regard. Since she is rich, smart, pretty and aware of the facts, Yukino views herself pretty much above everyone else, and thinks her purpose is to both surpass her even more extraordinary older sister, and help out the \"lambs\" of the world with her talent. This leads to her severe lack of friends, but also that's due to the fact, that like Hachiman, she is blunt with her speech; saying things that most people wouldn't, no matter how rude or insensitive they are. Also due to her stony demeanor of not laughing or smiling like, ever, Hachiman has nicknamed her \"The Ice Cold Beauty\". Yukino however, has shown to respect Yui as a friend(if only to Hachiman as an \"acquaintance\"), and lighten up in certain circumstances, as she slowly begins to respect her peers and friends, though some problems in her past might halt her newly found friendships before they've even begun.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, let's take a look at Yui Yuigahama, who out of the three, is basically the most normal. While she doesn't particularly have any problems socially, it comes at the cost of not being able to voice her opinion. She's the girl who is ready to just agree with everyone in order to fit in and be accepted, never really voicing what she truly thinks. She dislikes this fact about herself, and respects Hachiman's and Yukino's ability to say whatever they think. Being much more outgoing than them though, she's able to become good friends with both of them, with Yukino even after suffering from her verbal abuse at first, and with Hachiman(who she affectionately calls \"Hikki\"), even if he won't admit it.\\n\\n\r\nAs I've said, the supporting cast is really nothing to talk about, though I will give a shout-out to Hayama, for being a much better character than I first given him credit for.\\n\\n\r\nAs we turn to animation, I will be the first to admit it, I'm a little disappointed with Brains Base here. I know they've been known to cut corners before, judging from Durarara's unfortunate second half, but I thought a little more effort could have been brought to this series. I mean, it's not bad, but when you look at everything else that's been coming out, it seems at best mediocre. Some scenes have extremely questionable animation,  though the show does make up for it some aspects with the character designs, except for Yukino, who looks exactly like about a thousand other female characters. The only time the animation looks really good is during the opening, which I'll get to in a moment. Now, before anybody hates me for dipping the score of this anime too low because of this one category, I'm not saying that an anime needs to have good animation to get a high score. Higurashi no naku koro ni is the perfect example of this, but in SNAFU's instance, it would have been helpful in some scenes, and pairing it with the cliched story-lines, it becomes a real problem. \\n\\n\r\n     As for sound, again, there's nothing really of note here. I mean there's a couple ambient tracks which are nice, but again, nothing stands out. However, credit where credit is due, the opening \"Yukitoki\" by Nagi Yanagi is wonderful to listen to, with a catchy and cool tune, featuring high quality animation, which does nothing but remind me that there's no high quality animation, like, anywhere else in the entire series. I'll stop talking about that now. \\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it in front of you: My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU. OK, despite all the negatives I mentioned, I can't tell you guys enough how much I recommend this anime. It manages to get past it's own clich\u00e9s to deliver an experience that it truly unlike any other, seen through the eyes of a main character that is constantly challenging the value of social norm and interactions. If you've ever been to, seen, or conceived a highschool, watch this anime. Between Hachiman, Yukino and Yui, I think that no matter who you are, you'll find a bit of yourself in them, social outcast or not. I am also delighted to announce that there will be a season 2 coming out at some point in the future. Yeah, I know that pretty much couldn't have possibly been more vague, but I'm content just to know that it will be on its way. I can wait. It may not be a completely groundbreaking series, as it falls into enough clich\u00e9s. It may not be the strongest, in both the areas of animation and sound, but for what it is, SNAFU is a fantastic watch, and currently holds a place in my top three slice-of-life shows ever. It really hurts me that this show it really not on a lot of people's radars, so if you watch the show and like it, please spread the word, and give this show the popularity it deserves.\\n\\n\r\n     Hope you enjoyed the review.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: If I were to be reincarnated as an animal, I think I would be a cheetah.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog!

The main charecters personality was a breath of fresh air when it seems that most anime are focusing on stereotypes recently. The charecters grow together throughout the story.\r\nI was pleasantly surprised with this anime, I thought it might be one Idropped but the charecters and situations all work together beautifully to make this anime unique in many ways.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I would recommend this anime to any who want a bit of a change. It's sound and music are nearly silent but still serve to enhance the scenes.",

            "content": "Well, lets just say slice of life is pretty much uncharted territory for mainstream anime watchers. So with that, there is a series that may be able to change people's minds with the stereotypical fact that slice of life anime are for people that say there life sucks, i have no boyfriend or girlfriend, and I look so ugly. Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru or My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU may be that underrated or equally rated hit that people consider.\r\nStory- This story centralizes around Hachiman Hikigaya, who in fact, is rejected by literally the general population of his school and doesn'tgive a dookie about anyone in the school either, but there is a girl who is in the same club that he is forced join in named Yukino Yukinoshita who feels the same too yet has differing opinions about things. Then after that the meet another girl named Yui Yuigahama that is more popular and your stereotypical japanese social kawaii teen. The story is a very strong yet a little weak point of the entire series. It really excels at the two's pointless banter about who is right and wrong, how should we handle it, and what will come out of it. It also excels at the three main character's struggles as they learn how to help others and help themselves to. It really is a weird yet satisfying string of events that need to be looked at. \\n\\n\r\nArt- Whoever made the art to this really make it contrast from the character's emotions and ideas. The art is bright, colorful, and is what you want or expect in other slice of life. However the standard SOL style art is kind of what also adds to the story as the the two main protagonists are very harsh, grim, and even mean which is an odd contrast that works with the art of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Nothing short of amazing, the theme is catchy, sad, and very heartwarming at the same time which is what makes the theme outstanding. The background music also makes a heightening situation even more intense when you watch it. It's really a great mix which makes it a connected experience.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Okay, now we are at the characters. Hachiman, Yukino, and Yui are the supremely strong in this anime and is the one of the only reasons why I stood until the end for these characters. The other popular kids are why this doesn't get a perfect score. They are just complete jerks that just completely shoot down Hachiman and/or Yukino's very intelligent and very truthful ideas. It just makes them feel like the stereotypical nice or jerk boy/girls people saw in public school.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- This section really depends on who you are. If you are a newcomer to anime or SOL anime, you might found some or more enjoyment in this anime. If you prefer the mechs and sword fighting shonen animes, there is a chance you might not like it. For open anime watchers, you will find a lot of enjoyment in this anime. As stated before, it really does depend on what you enjoy in anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- The ending might boil your anger a bit, but overall it is a good SOL. The three characters (I know I didn't touch on Yui but that is because discussing her is basically a big spoiler fest) make this anime very strong. The story is strong, art is what I expected, sound is exceptional, characters are amazing with some yet others are stereotypical and lacking, and enjoyment really depends on the person you are but is one of the most enjoyable SOL I have watched in a long time. Seeing another series, season, or an OVA of this would really be sad since this should stand on its own. Heck, it could change peoples minds about this genre. I hope we can see more SOL like this.",

            "content": "I can't remember my high school life with many particularly fond memories in mind. I remember being an introvert, despising sitting in class and watch people pretentiously blabber about whatever comes to mind, about how this time of our lives is the best and how we will always look back to it fondly and laugh at what the stupid things we did.\r\nHowever, we find ourselves unable to laugh at things we do in the present, especially when we're younger. It's only natural, people don't instantly grow up and mature with time. In fact, we tend to make the decisions and speak what is on ourmind what we think or do is best, even if we blurt out things by accident.\\n\\n\r\nExperience from those decisions is what helps us grow up as people. But as we live, in the present, only things that happen now truly matter (partially, anyway) or are relevant enough to occupy our minds, not including questioning past hobbies, passions, and other things that defined us in the past.\\n\\n\r\nBut what if we reject change and decide to stay the same? Does that make us miserable or happier than others?\\n\\n\r\nThis is at the core of Yahari SNAFU (which is what I'm calling it in this review). Our main character, Hachiman, is everything that an introvert in high school can relate to; snarky, pretentious, overconfident and arrogant. He also clings to the miserable style of thinking that his worth isn't as much as other people, which makes it difficult for people to be friends or even relate to him.\\n\\n\r\nHe isn't the only one, either. He has counterparts in this show, Yukino, who tries to be able to relate to people around her but fails and as such comes off as confident and arrogant, while also trying to make friends even if she'd never admit it, and Yui, who is much nicer than the other two but is also extremely passive and tries to melt into groups of people rather than find a group of friends who accept her for who she is.\\n\\n\r\nThe character dynamics between these three is the heart and soul of this show, and their various perspectives into solving the various problems they have to help in are both insightful to their respective styles of thinking and also a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters with other perspectives aren't as fun to watch as the trio, however. They're hit or miss, depending on the viewer and the problems that the trio have to solve. There is a lack of a gray zone when dealing with these problems or the people responsible for them, to the point where it becomes annoying that the show, despite doing an amazing job in humanizing the three main characters, leaves some of the side characters very simplistic and one note. \\n\\n\r\nOther side character work just as well as the main trio, Hayama being a particular example of a person who is literally the exact opposite of Hachiman; confident, popular and seemingly kind to everyone in general. But the thing is, this is why the show works so well; the masks we assume the characters are break, and quickly the characters break away from the strict archetypes they follow, making them and their experiences feel very human.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is consistent and distinct, though hampered greatly by the rather mediocre animation quality. Most of the movement feels natural and consistent, but even the blu-ray versions have some really questionable moments where the animation quality goes down.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is solid but nothing noteworthy, fitting the mood of the show but not being particularly exceptional or memorable, aside from the opening perhaps. The voice acting is extremely solid from start to finish, and never feels out of place or overblown (a rather pleasant surprise).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Yahari SNAFU is an exceptional character driven show that succeeds in bringing to life some incredibly well-written and human characters, and having character interactions that are both meaningful  and a joy to watch. Sure, some of the side characters don't develop as well as they could, which means that the themes aren't as well explored as they could, but hey, it works as a show and I really liked it.",

            "content": "Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru or Oregairu, for short, is an anime that has surprised me for this spring season. It made seem like a normal slice of life or romantic anime if you first notice about it by reading the title or looking at the way it looks. But after some episodes the whole perspective of it changes radically. It could be from the characters, the plot? Well let's find out.\r\nSTORY = 9\r\nWell starting with the story it made look cliche. But it is impressive how it is done. The story centers in our main character Hikigaya that is forced tojoin  the service club along side with Yukino Yukinoshita. So it is their job to help the other students in the school or is it?\\n\\n\r\nWell when you start watching the anime you may think that it will be your typical Sket Dance and Ookami-san look alike. Trying to help others. But this is just nothing. The story makes a U-turn about what it is about. The story besides that, it tries to emphasize with the psycologycal facts about school. The friendship, the day by day relationships, what does it mean to be part of a group, what is the real world, etc. It is a very intensive in psycology aspects and even philosophical. It is just that amusing and amazing that it tries to cover it in a excellent form and gives a real point of view of what the real life is. In which almost everyone would feel that has lived some of this stories somehow in ther lives so it is very outstanding in that aspect.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt = 8 \\n\\n\r\nThe art is ok. It is very decent, it does not show a whole perspective of a great use of  animation. But it is ok how the characters are done. They look ok. They are not average but neither impressive. The colors I would describe them somehow bright but also with dark tones in some places. It is fluid how the actions and motions are taken. But still not great in as a whole picture. But is very likeable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound = 7\\n\\n\r\nThe sound used here is also very average. I did not like the Op and End. I feel they do not belong to the series. Maybe an alternative rock song would have been very good to the series. The ending I did not like it very much. Maybe because I hate when they use the voice of the characters to sing the song instead of using their real voices. Neither when Yui and Yukino sing nor the Yui solo. \\n\\n\r\nIn the ost section It was ok. There are some tracks that I loved, specially that soundtrack with a jazzy/funky tone. Also the music used for monologues and dramatic monologues and the music including the piano. Those tracks are awesome and I can't wait for the ost to come.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are ok. Not to much to say. They do very a very good job and they all sound very natural. My favorite ones being Yukino and Hikigaya actors. All of them did a great job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter = 9\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is what I most love about the series. The characters have their own thing   even though they look cliche but their interactions with each one are really incredible.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with Hikigaya Hachiman. He is my favorite character of the series. Maybe the first flat character that I loved. He is a loner, sticks to his believes, straight to what he is going to say and he does not care what others say. He is just wow. I love him very much. Because he is not your typical loner that will join other just to be loved. He respects what he does and it does not mind. Someone who deserves a lot of respect for how he is ported and the characterization he has.  Somehow  I wish I could meet him even though he will tell in a very harsh way how I am. \\n\\n\\n\r\nYukino Yukinoshita. She is very quiet but always helpful to help others. She is somehow rare in the way that it is unknown why she behaves in that way. But it made seem she is rich but she has a past that is yet to be revealed. She is always a part of the service club and she will never leave it. It is a unique character to describe her, but it is difficult to say something concrete about her. She is what demostrates throughtout the series.\\n\\n\r\nFinally with Yui Yuigahama. Her story in the Server's club is hillarious. She is kind, ready to be friendly and goodness in herself and others. She is the first one to be helped but also ready to be a helper. Her character is very important to the story because it has a bond with the first the two main characters before they even know about them. So that it is something that adds a great thing to the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 9\\n\\n\r\nIt is very awesome and very attracting. You feel that you want to be part of ther circle and live their lives. Also I loved how the debate I have with some statements the characters say and they use. It just that amazing that it makes you want to discuss all the topics they say. It is a show that I really want to continue to know and find out how it will end. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall = 9\\n\\n\r\nI recommend it. It is very lovely, debatable and entertaining. For those who are looking for a different slice of life this is a good option and a series that it could be one of my favorites of 2013. Maybe you will find out something you haven't seen in you in years that what it did.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell Thank you for reading this review I hope you like it and thanks for taking your time to read it.",

            "content": "Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteriu is one of the best character development anime out there. It storyline is a simple story about the highschool life of a loner, a genius and a everyday normal girl.\r\n It doesn't have any flash that fantasy anime have, its romance isn't really all that romantic like most romance anime, it doesn't even have the action. However, what you're missing in those others category you will get a pure high school drama storyline that resemble your everyday life. For example, the main character might be a loner but at time he will get out of his wayto do something dramatic to stop a problem that appear in story arc. This isn't the, \"As long as I keep at it, it will solve itself kind of action\" but his action resemble that of someone that is out of the box and can at time be radical. The genius character is like most genius show a brilliant side in which she can do anything and act strong enough to take any insult or work and like most genius can do anything but hidden in that shell is something that most high schooler go through, which is loneliness and the feeling of helplessness. The every day normal girl on the other hand try to get along with everyone one and try to not cause a problem but she is usually can't solve her own problems because she is usually trying to keep it to herself and try to make everyone feel good.\\n\r\nThese three character help set up the story by mixing their problems, their emotion and their interaction in a way that make you feel for those character. You will feel helpless and sad when they're having problems, you will feel joy when they finally solve their problems, and you will feel all bubbly  by their weird interaction and how they interact with others characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent for modern viewing, it does'nt have the epic color and artwork of Mahou Shoujo but it is decent enough for you to not cringe at how bad the art is. IF you like Ore No imouto artwork, you will probably like this one because it is quite similar. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is well meh, other than the opening song, every others one is just meh, the soudn effect isn't great but it is not bad i guess. But I'm bias on this subject so I won't discuss it.\\n\\n\r\nThe character is unique in every way, they're develop in a way that make you know how they think and how they view things. On the other hand the so call villain is your everyday highschooler that you hate in high school. Some are people that laugh at you, others are just people that give you weird looks, and some even go through hell to make you look bad. They're what set up your emotion for the main character\\n\\n\r\nSince I\"m bias on enjoyment, I will tell you how I feel. If you're like me that just love character development that have some comedy and some way that make you love the main character, you will enjoy this anime as much as me. If you're looking for pure comedy, this is not your anime as it will make you feel bad at time, if you're looking for pure drama, well this doesn't have that either since it is a slowly progressive drama that build up overtime and just burst at any moment now. Overall it is one of those show that is really good at what it want to do which is develop a story base on highschool life and the many character in highschool.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is one of the best dramatic comedy that is base on high school. Hate it or love it, it deal with situation in highschool or life in general where the character in it feel helpless but can be solve with other people steping in to help. THe concept of helplessness, needing help, and awkward situation will keep appearing in this anime which is ironic because it is usually solve by a loner character that observe people in the corner.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Favorite Quotes: \"If the truth is a cruel mistress, then a lie must be a nice girl.\"  and \"Hard work betrays none, but dreams betray many.\"  -Hachiman Hikigaya\r\nOriginally did a review on this on my old account, son714, but I lost the account information, this is now my new account that I will be using to transfer my old reviews.  I'll try to change it up a bit.  To begin, these two quotes are some of my personal favorite quotes spoken by our main character.  There are many other quotes that I agreed with, but for the sake of athorough reviews let's not go too in-depth with them.  To begin, I was never a fan of the romantic comedy genre in general.  I always thought they would always ended being cheesy and painfully predictable.  However, this anime, Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru, definitely took me by surprise.  Here's some of the main reasons why I believe this anime is such a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The main storyline can be pretty much summed up in the anime description. Initially, when reading the summary I felt it was gonna be a very generic, but I realized the romance in this series isn't thrown s right into your face from the very beginning. To be more precise, the romance is pretty light in the entire series. There are only hints of romance between character now and then. Overall, the anime does a fantastic job of gradually building the romance through the services completed in the club. I thought this was a really cool idea to implement rather than simply throwing the obvious romance to the audience.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: I thought the artwork was pretty well done, nothing out of the ordinary in this anime. I liked the colors that were used in the opening theme and for the ending as well.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: I absolutely loved the soundtrack, the opening theme, and the ending themes.  In my opinion, the themes played in the series explains alot about the \"romance\" that's happening.  The soundtracks also played during each segment also made it very comical and enjoyable to watch.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in this series was what intrigued me the most. I found the characters very unique, interesting, realistic throughout the series. For those new to the anime you might be wondering how are the characters different from other romantic comedy series? To respond to this, I would say that the main character in this series was what made this anime amazing. He isn't the boring, dull, and extremely dense type of person, but actually the complete opposite. In fact, I would say confidently that he is well aware of the ongoing romance, society, and his overall environment. What makes it even more interesting is his ability to think very critically about others and situations presented at the moment. Not only is it very critical, but the way he says it in his thoughts makes it way more engaging and realistic. Alot of characters in romantic comedies cannot do this. I understand that it has to do with the writing of the developers, but it was done very well. This anime also perfectly illustrates, in my opinion, the different kinds of people there are in the world. From socially distant type people to arrogant ones this series has it all. Excellent pacing for character development made characters extremely likeable and it made you feel as if you can identify with some of them. It also made room for characters to change their initial attitudes as the series progressed. In my case, I identified perfectly with the main characters point of view and philosophies.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nMy Opinion: It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me. Batman can be related to the main character. Throughout of the series, I find that the he is a kind hearted person, but he isn't concerned about that. I feel what he is concerned about is the society around him and how it is pretty messed up according to him. As someone who holds similar viewpoints as the main character, it is one of the reasons why I really appreciated this romantic comedy masterpiece. This show has tons of comedy, a bit of romance, and tons of theories and philosophies about life. I fully recommend watching this anime not just for the romance, but for what it can offer to us as humans. Seriously, this anime actually got me saying \"yeah that's true\" alot times and \"hey the main character is actually right, it's so true about what he said about people and society.\" Yahari Ore no Seishun wouldn't be on my top five best romcoms of all time, it would fall in my top five of all time.  It is truly a hidden gem among animes.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 10/10 perhaps the most underrated romantic comedy in anime history\\n\\n",

            "content": "Experimenting with a new structure for this review. This will be divided into two main segments: Compatibility Assessment and actual review.\r\n~Compatibility Assessment (I know...the name is a work in progress)~\r\nThis is essentially a very basic guide to determine whether or not the show is for you\r\nThe following is a short list that attempts to capture the show's main qualities which may or may appeal to you, giving you a quick and convenient way to ascertain whether you should give it a go. \r\nIt is a compilation of the more frequently expressed opinions of the show. I basically scrolled through past mal reviews plucking opinions thatkept reappearing, which very well may not be an accurate representation of the show, but as a general guide, I felt that it sufficed. \\n\\n\r\nStuff people have said:\\n\\n\r\n-Hilarious banter\\n\r\n-Melodrama (teenage angst and the whole shebang)\\n\r\n-High-school setting (If it wasn't obvious enough)\\n\r\n-Average art/animation and pretty much everything else? (Don't expect god-tier Ufotable quality)\\n\r\n-Apathetic/anti-social/badass male protagonist\\n\r\n-Pretty weak fan-service (you might be dispirited)\\n\r\n-Romance...but not really?\\n\r\n-A lot of reading between the lines. (may be a bit of a brain drain)\\n\r\n-No real story\\n\\n\r\nBy no means, an exhaustive list. If you found yourself not minding the above, you should have a fun time. \\n\\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n~Actual Review~\\n\\n\r\nTo those who despise terribly misleading titles and false advertising , I'd be happy to say that \"My Teen Romantic Comedy\" delivers exactly what you'd expect, with a little added extra. Whilst the title of the show certainly alludes to a mindless and cliche high-school comedy, the likes of which I'm sure you've already had the pleasure-or displeasure- of already seeing,  Oregairu offers a bit more. Unbeknownst to newcomers, hidden underneath its sleeve is a secret ingredient, an ingredient which I like to call 'unrealistically' realistic characters or UR characters for short. \\n\\n\r\nAllow me to explain. Whilst the show certainly has its fair share of stereotypical 'stock' characters, Hachiman the main protagonist and the lens through which we view the world couldn't be further from it. He's a cynic, through and through. With 'dead fish eyes' complementing a wretched personality dominated by an unrivalled distaste for youth, social hierarchies and friendship, Hachiman's distorted perceptions of teenage life allows for a surprisingly complicated and multi-faceted character. Not to mention, for some very unexpected approaches to dealing with problems, often resorting to manipulation and reverse-psychology to get what he wants. Regardless of his deviant principles and tactics, as much as he wishes to deny it, Hachiman has a heart full of gold. He's a character who's flawed and broken. A character who has built walls around his heart to avoid getting hurt. A character who stridently opposes the very system that he feels has betrayed him. It is this realism which when dialled up to unrealistic levels and used to dictate every thing the character does that I describe as 'unrealistically' realistic. \\n\\n\r\nThe ice queen, Yukino, with her long black hair and piercing metallic-blue eyes certainly seems to fit into the character mould of the cold and detached princess but, like Hachiman, is simply another one of these UR caricatures. Brandishing a razor-sharp tongue whose tip is usually pointed at none other than Hachiman (poor guy), often resulting in some rather amusing repartees, the show makes it abundantly clear the two character's opposing world view. Whilst Hachiman's views are more bleak and pragmatic, Yukino's are more optimistic and hopeful which allows for a very interesting dynamic. Their ideologies more often than not clash, sometimes for comedic effect but also as a compelling source of drama as they try with great effort to understand each other better which is only as compelling as it is because of the fact that they are these UR characters. Little do they know, they have more in common than they realise. \\n\\n\r\nWhilst it is a common complaint amongst the anime community that these particular shows often fail to accurately represent their teenage characters, Oregairu, I can assure you is not one of these shows. These aren't characters with shallow and superficial motivations. There is a genuine sense of depth that can be found here, a wealth of alluded history behind who they are in the series and how they've ended up in the situations that they have. Just like real people, they have prejudices and they have flaws and whilst Hachiman's pithy and didactic monologues certainly sounds convincing at times, it doesn't take a lot to debunk them completely. Yet, perhaps it's his resolution to stick with these skewed bits of wisdom to justify his reclusiveness that we are given insight into just how broken of a character he truly is. As a result, Oregairu achieves something quite monumental: depicting teenage characters that feel real, albeit 'unrealistically' real. It embraces the naivet\u00e9 and sometimes outright stupidity of adolescence.It embraces the melodrama because after all teenagers are the kings and queens of hyperbole. These are character relatable to anyone who has ever been in the cold shoes of an outcast and are what breathes new life into a well-trodden story. \\n\\n\r\nFor those seeking a very typical rom-com storyline, Oregairu doesn't disappoint either. This is a story that ultimately relies on the time-honoured trope of a guy surrounded by girls, whose relationship with them at first aren't particularly close.  However, as the series progresses a reluctant and slow friendship blossoms as they work together each episode to help fellow adolescents as a part of their Service Club activities. The story has the characters leap from the relatively mundane such as cooking and tennis matches to the classic 'test of courage trope' that shows like these often like to deploy, and even the fan-favourite summer festivities. These are no doubt classic staples of the genre and Oregairu certainly knows how to pull out all the stops to recreate the poignant aromas of youth and the awfully familiar sensations of teenage-hood. All of which provide ample opportunities for both rib-busting comedy as well some insightful commentary about the world in which we dwell, from the point of view of a cynical and unproductive teenager (so maybe not so insightful). Development is slow and patience is required here. Even at the end of the run, it's questionable how much growth these characters actually underwent and how much closer they are to each other. I suppose with consideration of Hachiman's and Yukino's clashing and stubborn personalities,the rate with which the characters develop isn't particularly strange. Perhaps, it is how incremental the characters become closer to one another that it make the payoff all the more satisfying.   \\n\\n\r\nThere's much enjoyment to be had from this show and one you'll certainly benefit from watching twice or even thrice depending on how much free time you have in your hands. I know for many, the character of Hachiman was someone who really spoke to them. The lengths to which he'll go to shield himself from the pain that he's experienced from countless times of rejection is something I'm sure many has experienced making him such a relatable and fun character to watch. Whilst some may criticise the show for being melodramatic, I personally found the drama compelling once I've understood the perspectives of these characters and the way they see the world. Although, this is admittedly a matter of taste. For those who've enjoyed the first season, look forward to the next as it only gets better and on that note, I bid you all happy viewing.\\n\\n\r\nOh yea...if ur lookin for that delichious romance and sweet face suking action...uh..ur in wrong place.",

            "content": "It actually took me two attempts to get through Oregairu, as after the first season it didn\u2019t seem to be much more than an average romcom. I\u2019m very glad I gave it another chance, however, as it was much more enjoyable the second time around and the second season blows the first out of the water. There are few productions that manage to achieve characterisation as complex as Oregairu, so if you\u2019re after a character-driven drama with a hint of comedy and a ridiculous amount of subtext then this show is for you.\r\nHikigaya Hachiman is an outcast in just about every meaning of the word.By his own admission he hasn\u2019t even talked to a girl in years and can count the number of friends he holds dear without any hands at all. His every waking moment would be a struggle, if he actually cared about what anyone else thought. His impressively cynical attitude ends up getting him forced into the newly formed Service Club by a worried teacher, with the only other member being the similarly isolated Yukinoshita Yukino. Naturally, the two can\u2019t stand each other, but as they work together to help others as part of their club duties they find opinions and attitudes of rubbing off on them and, along with the bubbly but conflicted Yuigahama Yui, desperately fight to navigate the complexities of normal high school life\\n\r\nThat summary\u2026doesn\u2019t really capture what Oregairu is, but it\u2019ll have to do for now. What begins as an average romantic comedy goes on to become Interpersonal Relationships: The Anime, and does so with style, though the show also has an agenda that it pushes relentlessly (which I\u2019ll get into later). Each character is repeatedly shown to have more and more layers of personality to be explored, meaning that even those who appear to follow simple archetypes can\u2019t be taken at first glance. The drama and emotion are poignant throughout the second season with some refreshing and effective comedy scattered here and there, while the first season merely serves to set the foundation for what the series aims to achieve. Overall, however, the balance between tension and light-hearted everyday living is handled beautifully. It\u2019s worth noting that an entirely different studio took responsibility for the show half way, which may explain some of the difference in quality.\\n\\n\r\nRemember that agenda I mentioned earlier? The author\u2019s thoughts on what social strategies constitute an acceptable and effective way of pursuing individual and interpersonal growth fuel the majority of plot developments and to be honest I found that a little disconcerting. It gets to the point where multiple characters appear to connect to some intangible hive-mind to all receive the exact same opinion of any particular event when I feel that in a real situation differing views would play a greater role. That said, however, even when I disagreed with any particular sentiment the anime sought to convey I still enjoyed the story as a whole and I\u2019m sure that many viewers would eat all that subtext with a great big grin. Though if it rubs you the wrong way more than it did me you may be in for an uncomfortable ride.\\n\r\nVisually Oregairu is generally very pleasant. I found that the second season\u2019s artwork fit the series better and helped the characters come to life that much more, but at the same time some of the animation is horrific (read: every time anyone\u2019s legs have to be shown while walking or running). The BGM also fits well with several enjoyable tracks in the second half.\\n\\n\r\nSummary \u2013 From the fan craving material to analyse deeply to the individual seeking an entertaining drama, Oregairu succeeds in catering to multiple audiences and has a great deal of fun while it does so, though the second season is much better than the first. For complex character interaction and drama in a high school setting you can\u2019t do much better. At the same time though, whether you find the writing clever or obnoxious will have a major influence on your enjoyment. I personally am happy to recommend Oregairu.\\n\\n\r\nSeason One: 7.5/10 \u2013 Enjoyable\\n\\n\r\nSeason Two: 9/10 \u2013 Great\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.5/10 \u2013 Good",

            "content": "Anime is a medium commonly used to show the most outlandish situations. Situations like harem protags unknowingly attracting women just by being nice, mechas casually using stars as shurikens while said mechas are run by willpower, and even time travel.\r\nMy Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong, As I Expected does none of these things yet it is one of the most entertaining this I've ever watched. \r\nStory: The story may not seem like anything fancy. A loner protagonist with two cute/beautiful girls in a club for helping people. Classic Rom-Com situation right? Far from the truth. I cannot give away much since it would be spoilerishterritory but Hachiman's methods are some of the most unorthodox ways to fix societal problems. Basically, if you were someone who watched 8man's way of solving problems without getting the general idea of why he did what he did. He would immediately be mistaken for the antagonist of a slice-of-life anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is where Yahari truly shines. 8man, a pessimistic and cynical loner, is one of the most interesting characters in the whole show and also our protagonist. Many of his monologues, worldviews, and opinions on a lot of things were very interesting to listen to and for many people such as myself, a bit relatable. \\n\\n\r\nYukinoshita Yukino also managed to grab my attention. Her opinions and interactions with 8man were very clever and witty. She wasn't a  \"st-sop looking at me like b-baka!\" kind of female lead. Her icy attitude and intellect matched well with 8man's personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe other cast members also deserve a mention as they serve to highlight different views or aspects of society in general. Watching their interactions with Hachiman could leave you learning or considering a lot of different things about life. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Was definitely okay? Yukitoki was a vibrant OP and something which I didn't get bored of. The ED didn't stand out too much but it was alright.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It wasn't the best nor was it the worst. If you're expecting graphics like Unlimited Budget Works then stick with the Fate Series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I personally really loved this show! It's more character-based than anything else but watching these characters develop and interact was definitely worth the time. If you enjoy witty banter, clever jokes, and awesome monologues. Then all aboard! \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series can be a hit or miss for some. Others won't connect with 8man and that's perfectly fine. But for those who can or at least those who want to see how loners and cynics view life then this anime is definitely for you!",

            "content": "Oregairu or, My Romantic Comedy Is Wrong As Expected, is an Anti-Social- rom com with a typical plot of the main character being forced to interact with girls. Sounds boring right? I have to agree that when I first looked at this anime and saw the genre high school rom com I wanted to give it a bad rep. However against my judgement I went ahead and began to watch it.\r\nThe first thing that stood out to me was the monologue at the beginning of the first episode. It surprised me a little because it gave insight into the main character and how extremely anti-socialhe is. Higikaya is not just your typical \"Oh im so shy of girls because I've never had the courage to act or I am extremely self conscious and therefore consider myself a loser\" kind of ant-social. He absolutely despises the basic nature of society and its dog eat dog nature. He sees the worst in people and knows that deep down inside everyone has this nature in them. Because he views the world in this way he goes out of his way to not forge any relationships with any other students and considers himself the perfect loner. I knew then that I was in for a good show. It managed to give me a lot of insight into the character without blatantly telling me straight to my face like I am some 5 year old. \\n\\n\r\nHikigaya is then forced into the \"Volunteers Club\" by his homeroom teacher. There he meets one of the other two prominent characters in the anime Yukino Yukinoshita. Yukino is like Hikigaya on a basic level. They both don't think highly of society and its inner workings and believe themselves to be loners by choice. Although they are the same in that regard the reasons they are anti-social are extremely different. The episode continues and we introduce the third character Yui Yuigahama. An extremely bright and social girl who can be seen often with the popular clique of the school. She asks for help in making cookies so she can confess to the boy she likes. These three characters make up the main cast for the remainder of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are extremely likeable and each one brings their own flavor to the show giving it a diverse cast. The characters each have their own demons they are dealing with and more often than not they cause problems for the cast. I found myself invested in the characters more deeply than I though I would become. Each one of them is both likeable and hate-able at the same time. I felt myself attached to each one because the feelings that they go through are relate-able and the characters feel real. I'm sure many of us have trouble saying what we really feel because we are afraid of the consequences of speaking our minds and this anime plays on that a lot. The characters really make this anime a worthwhile watch and I can't stress enough at how great they all are.  \\n\\n\r\nA lot of this show is focused on the psychology for the reasons why the cast does what they do. It goes very in depth about the psychological workings of society such as the \"One for All\" effect.* If everyone has a common enemy then it becomes much easier to band together and achieve what couldn't be done before. In the shows case this means that disliking a certain person and then making friendships based on that mutual enemy. More often than not the shows problems are solved using this method. In doing things this way it really shows the evil in everyone because you can see that just because you have someone you hate you can find friendship in others who feel the same way. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is focused on the characters and their lives rather than an overall goal they are working towards. I consider the \"story\" in this show to be about the feelings that each of the character has. \\n\\n\r\nThis show also has another bonus for it. No Sis-Con stuff. Yes Hikigaya has a little sister. No he does not want to fuck her. \\n\\n\r\nThe art for the show is ok. It really isn't anything to talk about. The backgrounds and characters are good looking but it really isn't going to blow you away with any incredible art.   \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great. You can really feel the emotion in the characters voices and the soundtrack really completes the tense atmosphere that constantly arises when the characters are faced with a problem. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this anime immensely. Its a great show for the genre and If you are curious or have this show on your watchlist, or are just looking for something to kill time, then do yourself a favor and watch this show.",

            "content": "Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Co-- bless you. Pardon, Oregairu takes things straight to the edge and even judging from the synopsis there's something different to expect for the RomCom School setting, even though every show that wants to be different has to take usual patterns and make them unusual, but later more on that aspect.\r\nThe anticipation of being in highschool's a big deal in nearly every country of the world. In such a school buildung exists it's own environment consisting of almost any type of people, the un/popular, un/sporting etc. and every here and now you encounter, from the perspective of the rest, theabsolute weird and all-time negative loner people. Meet Hikigaya Hachiman ( or 8man, 'hachi' => 8 ), the protagonist of this anime and the reason its worth to watch the story unfold. As for others who have dreams and aspirations of becoming someone in life Hachiman just wants to be nothing and let his existence pass by the couse of time. As this fact's public to the rest of his class and his often bad test results his teacher \"punishes\" him by forcing him to join a club, The Volunteer Service Club.\\n\\n\r\nNow back to the usual patterns; the club named The Volunteer Service Club is about helping people out with requests so that he has to work and do something while being in school. Strike one. The club president is Yukino Yukinoshita, easily considered the most beautiful girl in the school and now the loner has to deal with the lovely girl. Stirke two. In a little progress another girl named Yui Yuigahama joins the club making the obvious love triangle complete. Strike three and we're out. But the setting and characters won't behave like it's that simple. Yukino's a cold hearted and serious character with no sympathies for Hachiman as she teases him most of the time. A lot of great sarcastic humour resides in the conversations of these two. Yui's a lighthearted spirit and likes everybody, but it's not that everybody will like her back just because of that reason. Also there're several side characters contributing to the overall ambiance with different and fresh personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe story's neither too far away, nor too easy to catch. Oregairu takes place in school, but it's not based on episodics. Slowly parts of the past're revealed while the characters interact with each other and gradually connect to a bigger puzzle. The atmosphere and pacing turns like a tide in the middle of the storytelling, but it's so smooth and unpredictable hence the viewer'll experience a change of his emotions and that's whats makes this anime pretty different from the rest, in a good way. The methods used by the characters and their conversations're one of a kind, because they won't always do the obvious thing and think outside the box. A real inspiration.\\n\\n\r\nDon't expect a typical shining MC in Oregairu and don't expect a savior helping everyone out with their problems. Especially Hachiman has his own problems to deal with and doesn't even want to be dealt with by other people. Though in the course of action he takes a lot of effort to do something only he can do, something to change other people, because he's the hero this school desevers, but not the one it needs right now. So they'll hurt him, because he can take it. Because he's not their hero. He's a silent Loner. A watchful Student. A Hachiman. \\n\r\nIn the core he doesn't even want to fall in love with anyone and get out of highschool as fast as possible. What happens, when someone else falls for him and his unique personality ? Exactly this and so many other aspects make Oregairu an overall nice watch. If you can't relate to sarcastic humor you shouldn't pick this up, otherwise everyone else can happily begin to watch this. What are you waiting for ?",

            "content": "As the title would suggest, this little Rom-Com is different than your average one. We always see Rom-Coms from the point of view of the silly (almost oblivious), popular guy (or girl) who is subject to extenuating circumstances. Yahari comes along, takes this standard formula, and throws it out the window. It is a Romantic Comedy that takes place from the point of view of the polar opposite protagonist of most Rom-Coms: a loner who truly doesn't mind being loathed.\r\n*Story*: 6\r\nLike most Rom-Coms, there is no particular story or end goal. I'd say Yahari is unique in that it literally has none at all. Nocrush that the main character has, nor a crush that is explicitly stated on the protagonist either. There are hints towards romantic feelings between characters, but there is no explicit statements made, so it wouldn't be far off to call this anime simply a comedy, instead of a romantic comedy (as stated by the title).\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the school life of Hachiman Kikigaya, a loner who is forced to join the Volunteers Club. Essentially, the entire series consists of him and his two club mates helping others in the school, along with witty banter and incredible monologues performed by the protagonist. The instances of aid from the club are unrelated among one another, so other than character development and introduction there is no real concrete story LINE per say, but simply smaller stories of little importance to the overall picture. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, like most Rom-Coms, this series has a laid back story. However, the fact that there is little romantic development or correlation between 'mini-stories' almost makes the story of this series lacking in a sense. There is little conflict in the series, which is a shame considering that Hikigaya's approaches to said conflicts are the best parts of this series. I finished the series feeling as though it was entirely uneventful, and so much more could have been done with it. It's sort of a shame, really. Maybe the manga has more substance than the anime did.\\n\\n\r\n*Art*: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty standard for an anime, especially of the Rom-Con genre. The cover page used for the anime makes it seem like the anime has a particular style that differs from most, notably the faces and the coloring, but the style of the cover art is not carried over into the anime. The animation was very smooth and fluid, yet certain parts felt like work wasn't put into them (such as scenes were lips didn't match voices, or scenes were recycles or simply stills with an effect on them). The artwork isn't bad (in fact, it's good and modern), it just doesn't have anything to differentiate itself from all of the other animes. \\n\\n\r\n*Sound*: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe tone of the series can get very dark as Hikigaya goes on his rants or internal monologues, and the songs played during, or to lead up to, these points are very well chosen. They also have very uplifting songs during the lighter moments. All the songs were well chosen, however I feel as though certain dark songs were used to lead up to points that, in the end, were not all that dark. On a scale from 'white' to 'black', the scenes in question were 'light-gray' at best, but had songs with the same tone as a scene that would be 'black'. It would have been nice to see a little more variation in it.\\n\\n\r\n*Characters*: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe most important part of any Rom-Com is definitely the characters, and Yahari is no different. In fact, Yahari's characters are the one of the most noteworthy aspects of the series.\\n\\n\r\nHikigaya, Hachiman: The protagonist of the series, yet arguably the antagonist of the entire show. He is a loner, and proudly proclaims himself as such. He understands the depths of loneliness, and the trivial formalities and recurrences of society better than anyone. Therefore, his character becomes very relatable for obvious reasons. Hikigaya's internal monologues and rants are pretty much the climax of the show, and the best parts. They are what make this show so unique, and pretty much why it is regarded so well by most viewers, regardless of the lackluster story.\\n\\n\r\nYukinoshita, Yukino: One of Hikigaya's club mates and also a loner, although for different reasons. She is a complicated tsudere who is regarded as perfect, and is pretty much portrayed as such. She is unusually relentless in her jabs towards Hikigaya, yet she is shy towards her other club mate. In the end though, she plays no role other than to be a perfect tsundere, and there is nothing necessarily wrong with that except for the fact that her character doesn't really develop much more past that. \\n\\n\r\nYuigahama, Yui: The final of the trio within the Volunteers Club, and Hikigaya's classmate. She is an upbeat and lively girl, who is actually friendly and not a loner. However, she has the 'loner' type personality, and such characteristics are displayed when she interacts with other characters with difficulty. She is pretty friendly towards Hikigaya, calling him 'Hikki', so her presence is pretty much necessary as a main character; otherwise, Yukinoshita would just trash on Hikigaya all day.\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment and Overall*: 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed by this anime. It was a good anime, but its set up had the potential to be great. The characters were pretty standard; I enjoyed the supporting characters and the roles they played very much, such as Hayama Hayato or Saika Totsuka, but there could have been more development amongst the main characters. Instead, Yuigahama and Yukinoshita seem more like supporting characters than main, due to their lack of character development. The characters in this series were great, but the lack of character development is where this series seriously falls off. The biggest let down of the series is the lack of development of Hayato, even though they continuously hinted at it; however, this disappointment is pretty much the same for all characters. In fact, development as a whole is something that this series lacks, and as I watched it, I felt as though the series was locked in time, because it was never actually progressing. There was little conflict, and issues are brought up that are not addressed or resolved later on, so they feel as though they are in the series just because they HAD to be, and not because they had any relevance toward the story. There could have been so much more done by this series, yet in the end it failed to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nI think the series was pretty decent, so I round up to 'good' and give it a 7. However, this series is one of the few times I would ever say that it should have been SHORTER than it was, instead of longer. This is not because the series was 'bad', but the series felt drawn out and bland, and would have benefited more with a more conflict oriented story; compacting this series' conflicts into a shorter episode span would remedy this.",

            "content": "Youth is an evil hoax.\r\nI traversed into the show thinking it to be yet another High School Club comedy but Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy WA Machigatteiru or My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU transverses into one lovable show. The quotes Hikigaya Hachiman spouts are very thought producing and may \r\nperhaps show you the wrongs of society. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\n Yahari Ore follows Pessimistic Hikigaya Hachiman where he lives out High School hating the evils of society and thus he lives as a lone. A social club is formed when his teacher forces him and a stone cold beauty and they help those with problems orrespond to request. Solving these problems is done well, the Main Characters are not birds of a feather and all have differing solutions. The comedy is mostly taken from sarcasm but Yahari Ore does have hilarious situations. The Romance is handled quite well but in the long haul it really goes nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\n Yahari Ore\u2019s characters are a strong point producing characters that you\u2019ll probably remember quite well.\\n\\n\r\nHikigaya Hachiman is a friend-less, pessimistic teen. He has had quite the miserable experience with girls in middle school and when he recalls it he goes and secludes himself even more. He often spouts about the evils within social groups. He does progress and makes friends with those in his social \u201cclub\u201d. This character is very relatable if you've been a loner or still are.\\n\\n\r\nYukino Yukinoshita is the school\u2019s \u201cIce Cold Beauty\u201d and is incredibly smart. She doesn't have any friends at first. Unlike Hikigaya, she does strive to help the less fortunate.\\n\\n\r\nYui Yuigihama is a cute, cheery girl with an outgoing look on life. Yui was the first customer and the first new member to join the Social Club. Yui is somewhat popular and is very protective of her friends. She has had a huge crush on Hikigaya for quite some time and plans on confessing to him one day.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is fantastic, capturing the hate on Hikigaya\u2019s voice but also capturing the thoughtfulness of Yui. The sound score is swell and never that awful to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are done exceedingly well and oddly match the personalities of the characters. The backgrounds are also done amazingly well. The animation is quite smooth save for some instances\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is quite an amazing show with loveable characters and swell portions of comedy. Although don\u2019t solely watch it expecting romance, but the Experience Yahari Ore offers makes up for it.\\n",

After reading the title I automatically assumed it was going to be your typical rom com anime, whereas the main character would miraculously sweep the girl off her feet, and they will live happily ever after. I was proven wrong after watching episode 13, and I must admit; they most definitely left us on a cliff hanger. \r\nThe story starts off with Hikigaya, who basically becomes a loner due to bad experiences with society, mostly bad experiences with females.Getting rejected from one girl to the other, he came to the conclusion that the best thing for him to do is to keep to himself. His homeroom teacher notices that due to his lack in socializing, it's taking a toll on his studies. As a result she places him in a special kind of club that provides \"services\" for students. From there on his \"rom com\" begins.\\n\r\nI think that the art in this anime was well done. The characters were drawn almost perfectly. The background and the details for the objects was great, and the animation was smooth.\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I really liked Hikigaya and Yukino's personality. I thought they were very unique, and they made watching this anime very enjoyable, despite the fact they didn't have much character development due to the anime only having 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI think everyone should definitely give this anime a try. I wouldn't consider this a romance comedy because there is little to no romance in this anime (maybe there will be if there's a season 2), but it's most definetly a comedy. This anime will seriously have you laughing your ass off.",

            "content": "-Story 10/10\r\nThis is the story of a very introverted, unenthusiastic and somewhat idealistic youth by the name of Hikigaya Hachiman andhis everyday life, who was forced to join the Volunteering club by his teacher. Afterwards, what goes on is basically a slice of life anime, where Hikigaya and his clubmates have to go and assist the people who need help with their requests. Some of these requests had some drama in them as well, but seeing Hikigaya constantly solve all their issues with his own, twisted logic was always a fun and enjoyable thing to see.\r\n-Art 7/10\r\nThe art is standard, nothing special but not badeither, as expected from a slice of life type of anime.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound 9/10\\n\r\nFor sound, the OST in the anime is generally well suited to whichever scene it resides in, being able to bring up feelings of tension, joy, etc whenever required. Along with the background music for them during their \"normal times\" being very cheerful and enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\n-Characters 10/10\\n\r\nFor this section, i will only cover the 3 main characters in this anime. \\n\\n\r\n+Hikigaya Hachiman\\n\r\nPretty much one of the best and most complex characters I have ever seen. He is basically a lone-wolf type of character, who has so little presence and doesn't do much in his own class to the extent that his classmates don't even remember his name. For people who were/are introverts or tend to prefer to be alone, there is a very high chance that some may be able to see themselves reflected in Hikigaya. However, even though he seems bland, he has some of the most insightful thoughts on society's views and such. With him constantly disassembling sayings and quotes from historical people, making him a very thought provoking character. In addition, his extremely unorthodox methods in solving issues and dealing with people were some of the greatest highlights of the show as well, with his constant attitude of not caring about his own situation and being what seems to be tactless, but actually makes him shine even more.\\n\\n\r\n+Yukinoshita Yukino\\n\r\nShe is a multi-talented and beautiful girl who has been dubbed \"Ice Cold Beauty\"  in her school, a name which is very fitting for her. However, the main reason why she is alone most of the time is due to her sharp tongue, hence the Ice part in her nickname.  Due to her extremely sharp tongue, her and Hikigaya's bickering in the anime are quite entertaining, with her coming up with some of the best insults of all time. She is also very capable and has the \"Ojousama\"-ish aura around her. She is also presented as a very strong character, who has the ability to take a lot of hits (Figuratively). She is also much more thoughtful than she seems, as she also looks over the other two. \\n\\n\r\n+Yuigahama Yui\\n\r\nIn short, Yuigahama is the slightly more dull and stereotypical characters amongst the 3 main characters. In essence, she is a very joyous character who is always happy and cheerful. However, she plays a very important role amongst them as she is the only one in the group who is actually enthusiastic about doing her activities, along with her being able to cheer the other two up as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nFor me, this series had very witty dialogue, with some of the most interesting insults that i have heard especially from Hikigaya and Yukinoshita's interactions. Along with the constant amount of Hikigaya's views mixed in and him applying his views to solve problems, it was a very fun ride. \\n\\n\r\n-Overall 10/10\\n\r\nThis is a very entertaining anime, full of thought provoking themes, captivating dialogue and some of the best characters crafted. Along with the main character being more or less an outcast due to his nature, people who have went through the same position as him would find that this guy is one of the most relatable characters which one can sympathize with out there. If you're tired of watching too much moe, action and etc, you should try this. Even if you're not, you should definitely watch this anime.\\n",

            "content": "tl dr no spoilerino - its like a fat kid falling over; entertaining but rather shallow comedy.\r\nSo the best thing about the cartoon that stood out was the characters. The producers of this show really nailed the anti social main character. He is definitely a weird guy that does weird things but they managed to make him not a hated character and yet not a likeable character either. \r\nThe same can be said about the female lead with dark long hair. She definitely was a fucking weirdo but in a similar yet different way to the main character. This resulted in a refreshing dynamic betweenthe two main characters in which they get to know eachother in a non-romantic way. This pacing adjustment to not force the main characters together quickly/at all was well received by me and my fedora wearing meme club. It felt more real and not forced as fuck.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter development is definitely a flaw for this show. few characters have significant backgrounding and new characters are introduced and more or less thrown away. i wish they had taken the route of concentrating on a few side characters. specifically hayama aka sexy-spiky-does-no-wrong-man and the blonde bitchy girl and lead females sister.\\n\r\nThis show was a bit too harem-y for my liking. for a ugly AF loner, he seems tobe surrounded by girls that he could get on his tip after a few beers. there are like only 3 male side characters. 1 of them is a a hayama aka asian-channing-tatum, the other is oddly reminiscent of me; a manga loving fedora, trench coat and fingerless glove wearing memelord and a small boy which is pretty much a girl. the rest are all females with big bouncy melons that make my donger rise like my processor temperature when i edit my 3d virtual reality hentai in 4k.\\n\\n\r\nits more like a slice of life cartoon that is like okay man. at the end of the day, watch whatever the fuck you want to. you really shouldnt take advice from a 300lb neckbeard memelord late to his shiftat mcdonalds. \\n",

            "content": "My Teen comedy SNAFU is a series that takes us down a familiar path seen in the romantic comedy, as it tackles the anti social protagonist. But the real question is that in a crowded market, is this series able to stand out from the rest?\r\nThe story of the anime starts out by thrusting our self-described loner Hachiman into a club established for helping others, a loner's worst nightmare. The club's other member is the prettiest girl in the class, Yukino Yukinoshita, who has few friends due to her cold demeanor and that she is envied by other girls due to her looks and intelligence.The initial banter between the two as well as some hilarious deadpan delivery of lines is downright hilarious, and sets the tone for the rest of the series. The plot moves forward as the club helps others with their problems, and recruits another member Yui Yuigiahama, an outgoing and cheerful girl from Hachiman's class. The plot progresses each episode as the group will help someone overcome their problem, and we begin to learn more about the main trio and their philosophies and some interesting events that occurred in the past. It has several other elements typical to a romance school anime, such as an episode devoted to a field trip and the last episodes covering the cultural festival. as the plot goes on their are some slight hints at romance that begin to become more obvious as the show continues.\\n\\n\r\nThe main group of characters as well as their teacher are the really great part of the show, as they provide much of the clever humor and the best development. However, the supporting characters are all quite generic and some feel too forced, such as the normally quiet BL girl who is supposed to be played for laughs but comes across as annoying. The jokes surrounding the bishonen Saika also feel forced at times, and get stale quick, in a contrast to the humor in the rest of the show that flows quite naturally and quickly through the rapid fire banter of the main characters. The cliche of characters are present as well, such as the overly nice athletic guy, a healthy does of onii-chan, and an annoying stuck up blonde who says like every 5 seconds. The main characters really make up for the lacking supporting cast, as Hachiman is a surprising relatable character whose realist view is quite hilarious as it is applied to every day situations, but can also bring out some empathy as you watch his cringe worthy behavior in social situations. He is one of the funniest characters as he readily accepts himself, and the flashbacks that he often references are down right hilarious. He is also quite intelligent, and thinks quickly to solve some issues, but in a slightly twisted way that tends to alienate him from others. Yukino is also quite funny due to her deadpan delivery of lines and her quick wit, and we are shown interesting development of her character as we learn more about her family as well as the shoes that she has to fill, and dreams to surpass. Yui is best defined by her cheerfulness, and is a believable character who faces some realistic issues such as being unsatisfied with your current friend group, and embracing hanging out with \"that kid\" in public despite the fact that some would consider it social suicide. Her niceness and cheeriness leads her to some slight misunderstandings with Hachiman, but despite her setbacks she still is willing to try to get closer to him. Their sensei is another funny character who looks after the club and provides them with some advice, and tries to get Hachiman on the right track, and these scenes also provide some of the funnier moments as she has Hachiman try to explain his actions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall despite not taking the path less traveled the series is still an exception funny one with a great group of core characters, but has a lackluster supporting cast. The deadpan delivery of lines and excellent uses of flashbacks give the series a great sense of humor as well as an interesting look into the surprisingly relatable philosophy of a loner.",

Here is an anime following the perspectives of teenagers with limited worldviews. A Service Club is formed, for them to assist their fellow classmates with individual dilemmas. By doing this, they learn the proper means of communication, more or less, and secure the rules of friendship. Everyone's helped, at the end of the day.  \r\nI applaud this show's attempt for their unique approach to the trials and tribulations of teenage hood, and can even relate to the show's stoic MCs, but overallthis show lacks soul and the mediocre art got in the way of me caring for any of the characters.

            "content": "I am not a fan of the Romance genre especially rom coms. But this one caught me off guard. Today I'll be reviewing Oregairu one of the most praised rom coms existing.\r\nI personally connected a lot to this show. I went through similar circumstances as the protagonist Hikigaya Hachiman,that is.. I was bullied a lot and was alienated by my classmates. I was frustrated and angry and sad and dejected.. This anime exactly describes how I feel. However the main quality of this anime that made me fall in love with this anime is how he deals with those problems..\r\nSure he is pessimistic and highlycynical.. But is it really a bad thing??\\n\r\nIs the society wrongly labeling introverts and cynics as a nuisance to the society??\\n\r\nIs wanting to stay alone really a bad thing??\\n\r\nThe show raises many moral conflicts existing in the society like these.. I can relate a lot to him especially the way he has changed form being hopeful to completely hopeless and being a pessimist to the core.. when I say hopeless I am referring to how he lost hope when he realized the true nature of the rotten society we live in..\\n\r\nIt is a shame that a brilliant anime series like this has such a low rating while mainstream Shounen anime have way more rating and are way more popular..\\n\r\nAnyway.. lets get to the scoring part:\\n\r\nStory:10/10\\n\r\nI would've given this a 7 because it is just another typical rom com with a cold hearted bitchy(ahem.. excuse me) female lead and an all cheerful friend of hers who both fall in love with the same introverted socially awkward guy but I was wrong. The story is much more than just that. It is a social commentary on the lives of high schoolers. \\n\r\nArt:7/10\\n\r\nNothing much to explain.. just okayish..\\n\r\nSound:10/10\\n\r\nThe sound tracks were so full of emotion. Especially yui version of the ending is enough to cause tears in my eyes. Such beautiful lyrics and such a sweet voice are absolutely perfect. Although not as good as the ending(imo) the opening is pretty good as well.\\n\r\nCharacter:10/10\\n\r\nThis is the highlight of this anime. I don't want to tell anything about the characters. Just watch the anime yourself and I'm sure you'll love it. If i were to explain the main character itself then it would take me pages and pages and I would still not be done..\\n\r\nAlso note that the harmony betweeen the main characters and side characters is just perfect.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nThis anime made me laugh.It made me cry. It made me question. It left me wanting more of it..\\n\r\nOverall:10/10\\n\r\n*Stands up and bows down at the laptop* 100000000/10(8 zeros :P)\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review guys and I would appreciate it if you hit that helpful button :)\\n\r\nHave a great day :)",

            "content": "The sole reason I am writing this review is because this anime really 'hit home' for me, and it was frustrating that no one was as worked up. I watched this anime only because I was craving something light and pleasant, but what I did not know was this anime would change my view about the anime world all together. \r\nFirst of all, the characters. I spend endless days trying to connect the main trio, along with a few others, to already existing lifeforms or characters, and came up with nothing. In fact, a lot of other characters have been based on the characters ofthis anime. \\n\r\nHikigaya Hachiman is the kind of character you don't know whether to hate or love, whether to cry or laugh at everything he says and does. His character does develop, but his core doesn't waver, unlike other negative male protagonists.                                                                                     Yukinoshita Yukino is not your typical Ice Queen, or 'kuudere', in fact, she is miles away from being typical. She happens to be my favorite character. Her each action, each word, each thought, is precisely connected to both her past, her situation and her personality. \\n\r\nYuigahama Yui is the kind of character other animes would keep around for comic relief, yet in this anime, she is not your typical nice girl. Her existence doesn't just have a good purpose, her existence is the story too. Her usually normal, cheery demeanor helps the viewers ease of the dept in Yukino or Hachiman's situations.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the story. The name of this anime itself is just a trick to put your heart at ease, and as you watch it, continually shred it to pieces and sloppily glue them back together. At first glance, it seems like your typical 'boy-is-forced-into-a-club-with-extraordinary-girl' anime, but it dwells so much more deeper. This anime takes the simple concept of a love triangle, squeezes it hard so all that remains is the flimsy skin, and dips it into a bowl of poison. It focuses on the scary, not so funny things which lurk behind a love triangle, even a light one such as this. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI have watched this anime three times. The first time I watched it, I was a fool, and angered at the pointless fact that I never found out who Hikigaya ended up with. \\n\r\nThe second time, I actually understood the anime. My heart broke. I cried, believe it or not. \\n\r\nThe third time, the pain was much lesser initially, but I figured out the reasons behind everyone's actions, and this time, my heart shattered into a million pieces. \\n\\n\r\nThis may not sound like the happiest anime, but it has it's heart warming, and yes, heart wrenching moments. It will help you understand life just a little bit more, and also the fact that anime isn't just mystical worlds or bishounen harems.",

I gave this anime a chance since I've heard good reviews about it, but I was wrong to the point that I stop watching it around 4-6 episodes (was really trying to understand how plenty of people find this an excellent series.) \r\nStory and Character\r\nAverage hair strands falling a day is probably around 100 but watching this anime probably made me lose hair as twice as normal. A guy who hates humanity? Oh cool, just make him stay that wayalong with the other characters without further development. They may successfully combat the trust issue format but the next setting felt like they haven't changed at all. What? The storyline just gets boring. Additionally, I kept waiting for funny moments to tickle me to the bones but I ended up getting bored and confused throughout the 6 episodes. I must be very fun in parties. Great! Also, if you are looking for a romance you might be shocked that there is none in this series. On the other hand, if you considered a character blushing as romance then this might be up your alley.  Anyway, I wanted to give it 1 but for the apathetic MC guy, I'll give it a two. The rest of the characters, meh.  2/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall shenanigans\\n\\n\r\nI dunno! Beats me! I don't understand anymore. I am so drained. Guess, I'm part of the so-called \"haters\" at this point.",

            "content": "\"just so you know, it's not like I cant hold conversation with someone. I just don't hold pointless conversations.\"\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru is an anime with the cliched story and too common relationship. but anyhow, it was quite enjoyable for some reason. everyone except the main character has a personality that has been used hundreds of times: the cold and emotionless Yukino, bright and cheerful Yui, girlishly beautiful boy Saika and then the all useful little sister Komachi. as soon as I saw these characters, I know this is going to be a love triangle and they are going to facea lot of harsh situation and then overcome it which gives us a good ending of the main character hooking up with 2 pretty girls while not knowing it for some reason, everything is just so cliched and plain. but I continued watching it anyway, maybe after a day of everything, in reality, you just need something like this to brush them all away and enjoy the hell out of it.\\n\\n\r\nstory - 7/10: as I stated above, this is a cliched but enjoyable story, even though anyone would know the plot in the first or second episode, it will still make you sit down and watch it like there's nothing else in the world. I would say it's the peaceful feeling the anime radiates out that hooks me up. the story has no extreme moment or really bashful time, the entire anime worked through 12 episodes with nearly no climax, but anyhow it was worth the time I spent.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10: the art is generally wonderful so there is basically nothing to comment on. most slice of life anime these days have a similar art style which can be seen from works like Kokoro Connect or A Lull in the Sea which was both fantastic slices of life animes that don't just have comedy and romance.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10: the soundtracks and osts are all pretty good always peaceful and related to the scene. personally, I'm not really a soundtrack man, I don't focus on what music anime have but nevertheless, great music can make have some dramatic effect on the scene, so I think they did a great job. \\n\\n\r\ncharacter - 7/10: don't think 7/10 is bad, I liked the characters, but I only gave it a 7/10 because they are just so cliched. most of the character's personalities have already been used hundreds of times and have even been made into terms. but the focus of the anime is on the MC whom i think have quite a weird aura around him, so I guess its still fine. the MC is... how should I put this, unrealistic. a loner who has been alone for the past 4 years of his high school life who even developed a bible of quotes to stand up for his loneliness which he thinks is a thing to be proud of. then, in just half a year, he has made 2 girls who he has never talked to before in his life fell in love with him. what?? well, the only reasonable response you can answer is probably saying that 'dude, its anime.' \\n\\n\r\noverall, I quite enjoyed this series of anime, so after you finished this 13 episode, be sure to catch up on the next season. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. some recommendation for this anime: Charlotte, Chuuibyou and Gamers.\\n\\n\r\nthanks ;)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Is hard to write a review of the first part of Yahari Ore no Seishun or, as I will call it from here on to shorten it, Oregairu, since the first and the second series are deeply bound togheter. And while the first focues a bit more on the comedy, the second is way deeper. However, I will try\r\nStory -8- I will start by saying this: I'm not into romantic comedies, I had watched a couple of them, maybe, and they were mostly forgettable. \r\nBut Oregairu stands up from the very first episodes. I started watching it mainly for the main character, Haciman Hikigaya, whowas acclaimed in reviews for his particular and intersting characterization. I will talk about it later, tought\\n\r\nThe story is not so important for the plot: in fact, the premises are that a worried teacher forces Haciman to be part of the \"Service club\" of the school because of his nihilistic and pessimistic vision of life. She is worried that, with his loner behavior, this student will not acomplish anything in life, even if he is smart and resourcefull. And this is it, pretty much. During the first series, we see Haciman and his fellow Club Members interacting with other students, each of wich has his problems. While it can seem a dull plot, i guarantee that it's just perfect for the show. The story mainly focuses on Haciman and the people around him and the way they develop their nature and their vision of life and of the world. I give it an 8 because the author did exactly what he had to do; he could have tried to build a complex story that would have not been as realistic and convincing as it is the one we get. It's just good the way it is\\n\\n\r\nArt -7-Well, the art of the first series is not so great. Is average I would say but, just as the plot, it works well. This is a romantic comedy so I'm not expecting special effects, breathtaking scenarios and so on. The characters are fairly well drawn and I absolutely loved the the disinterested and detached expression that the main character wears almost for all the time, Yukino's compound and serious face while she deals with the daily issuess of the club, Haciman's sister \"cute little fangs\" and so on. \\n\r\nAlso, a minor detail that made me laugh a couple time: the contrast between the others character's eyes, big and coloured, as you expect by your average high-school anime character and Haciman's eyes, wich are small and cold. Now, this is a good way to extabilish a character's nature with drawings, I loved it\\n\\n\r\nSound -8-The opening is good and it mixes fairly with the atmosphere and the setting of the comedy. The ending theme is surprisingly good and I think that it completes the introspection of the protagonists. Maybe is only me, but the lyrics of \"Alone\" seems to fit just that well with the series. Not much to say about the background music, mainly because I didn't mind about it much as I was mainly concerned with the character's dialogues. The original Japanese dub is good enough, I watched it with Italian dubs that also were fairly well made\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -9-Now, here is where the series really stands out. And here you will understand if you will like this anime or not\\n\r\nThe characters are mostly credible and well depicted: you will feel that you are going back in your high school days in some moments, they are realistic. And this is one of the strong points of the show. You will never catch yourself thinking \"What the actual fuck? A high-school student that does this? Bullshit!\" as it happens in some other series. \\n\r\nThe characterization is way, way good. Let's start with the protagonist\\n\r\nHaciman Hikigawa. He is the opposite of your average romantic comedy protagonist. Is a loner, a guy who is able to read the real emotions and desires of people around him. His tendency to stay alone is justified by the fact that he has a realistic/nihilistic vision of life. Oregairu shows his point of view about life, the world, other people and other topics in two ways, mainly: ironicaly, showing his nearly borderline behaivior, such as when he relates himself to a \"grizzled veteran, survivor of many battles\" and in a deeper way, for example when it shows us his past experiences that made him the loner that he is when we meet him\\n\r\nConsider that you have to watch Oregairu contextualizing the way he thinks and acts: for example, you may think that a high school student cannot have had such terrible experiences as to want to become a loner. But think about yourself, back in those years. How many strange belives and point of views about life did you had back then? If you can relate even just a bit with Haciman, you will surely like this series\\n\r\nYukino Yukinoshita, the service club's president, is another good character. She has a vision of life that is closer to Haciman's one more than she thinks, but she is good intentioned and convinced that you have to work hard and commit yourself if you want to change the world around you and yourself, while Haciman says that \"Hard work betrays none because gives you the illusion that at least you tried\" and that he doesn't see a reason why he should change the way he is, since he doesn't have many of the problems that afflicts teenagers usually\\n\r\nYui Yuighama is the most \"normal\" person in the main cast: she is an easy going girl who roams with the \"popoular guys\" in her class. She initially takes a liking for Haciman and Yukino and becomes the third member of the club. As the series goes on, we see that, even if she is acting as a \"bridge\" between the lonely and pragmatic main characters and the \"rest of the world\", she is also a deeper person than it looks\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are good but they are mostly depicted in the second series so I will not talk much about them here\\n\r\nThe most intersting ones are the teacher Shizuka and Komachi, Haciman's little sister\\n\r\nShizuka is a late-in-her-thirties woman who tries to get our protagonist out of his particoular way of thinking, dragging him in the school's activities \\n\r\nKomachi is the only person with whom Haciman (initially) has not cut the bridges, since his parents are mentioned only. Her behaiviour may look annoying but you change your mind when you understand that she wants geniunely to help her brother, thinking that his life is not going the way it should. If you have a little sister like myself, the relationship between the two (expecially in the second series) will give you funny and heartwarming moments  \\n\\n\r\nEnojoyment -9-If someone told me that I would have laughed and felt moved by an Japanese animated romantic comedy, I would have laughed in his face. And, contrary to my expectations,  Oregairu managed to win a small place in my heart. I was genuinely absorbed by the show: I found amusing the subversion of the average love comedy, I actually laughed a lot during the show and found the scenes wich were supposed to be deep...pretty touching, indeed. And is not an easy job to make an high-school comedy moving and amusing at the same time. You always risk to fall into the trivial and pathetic when you try to deploy a show like this. But this is not the case, Oregairu manages to enterain the viewer better than a lot of more acclaimed anime\\n\\n\r\nOverall -8-I deeply reccomend this series. But, before watching it, you have to know what to expect, because you probably have read lot of reviews giving it a 10 or a 9\\n\r\nWell, I think that the anime deserves the praises it got. Is very good, is realistic, is not the usual, stereotyped anime that follows a generic teenager in the last years of highschool. If you are a deep person, if you remember with a shiver down your back your school days because they were so full of events, emotions and fun but also hard and lonely, under some point of views, the show will win your heart too, no matter how much you can be skeptical about it\\n\r\nMy advice is to watch it taking it for what it actually is, the convincing, both funny and deep story of a teenager with a realistic vision of life who finds himself confronted with the reality, where his perfect vision of life is daily tested by the life among others",

            "content": "I went into Yahari Ore no Seishun expecting your average, typical slice of life romance affair, and to a certain expect I was delivered exactly this. If I tried to explain the plot to someone who hadn't seen it, they'd probably turn up their nose and comment on how \"cliched\" and \"predictable\" it sounds. Even though I'm a fan of high-school romance anime, I'd be inclined to agree with them that once you've seen a few of this genre, you've basically seen them all. So, what exactly was it about this show that kept me defiantly glued to the screen in binge-watch mode until Ireached the frustratingly ambiguous ending to the second season?\\n\\n\r\nIt's certainly not the plot. As far as slice of life is concerned, this is quite literally as archetypal, as derivative, as unimaginative, as it gets. There's a high school loner who, upon submitting an un unforgivably terrible assignment to his teacher, is forced to join an after school club, thus putting him into a situation where he's suddenly interacting with several beautiful girls. This is probably the weakest aspect of the series and undoubtedly what will dissaude a non-genre fan from giving Yahari a chance; however, I'd point out that as tired as cliches can become at times, they become cliches for a reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and OSP isn't particularly inspiring either (I never felt an urge to download the opening songs in the vein I have other animes), and though the artwork is certainly above average, it's not magnificent enough to attract viewers by merit alone. Instead, what made the show so compelling is a set of characters that are surprisingly complex, multi-faceted and (to my unending surprise) genuinely three dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nThis is made even more staggering by the fact that such intriguing characters are all built up, again, from what can only be described as predictable frameworks. Hachiman is the traditional high-schooler lone figure who struggles socialising, and yet simultaneously, he's SO much more than that. In the same vein as Holden Caulfield, this is a character that changes and upsets your expectations of him just when you think you know him inside out. To be brutally frank, he's actually a pretty despicable character. He's egotistical, uncaring of the feeling of others (for the most part) and is entirely driven by a sense of self gain and preservation. But he's also undeniably inescure, and at times directly states that he loathes himself. How can a character be arrogant and have a low self esteem at the same time? How can a character be so rude and frustrating, yet also so devastatingly endearing in the same episode? I've seen all 26 episodes, and am still astonished by the quality of his characterisation and writing.\\n\\n\r\nTo make things even more staggering, he's not the only one. Even background characters, who would usually be utilised entirely for comic relief, have their own fascinating moral and personal conflicts (the resolution of which is the basis of the series). However, the true revelation for me personally was Hachiman's love interests. Yukino is something of a tsundere, whereas Yuigahama is clearly a cinnamon bun, but again, they manage to transcend these labels via the contradictory nature of their personalities. Yukino can be ice cold, confident, charismatic and is unapproachably beautiful, but as the show progresses an unseen layer of weakness, passivity and almost pathetic submission to her superiors is unravelled. Yuigahama puts on a fascade of cuteness in order to maintain her social image, and often comes across as easily manipulated and impressionable, but usually it is her that adopts the role of the glue holding the three protagonist's club together. It's a breath of fresh air to watch love interests who are intriguing because of their development as opposed to overt sexualisation and fan-service.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm not going to claim Yahari is for everybody, because it certainly isn't. However, I cannot deny that a set of brilliant leads (often in situations far below them) and some lovely themes of social isolation make this an addictive watch. Perhaps it's appropriate that these characters are trapped in such a mundane-appearing show- it is, after all, primarily about teenagers who are lost, unsure of their identity and desperate to find their place in a better world.",

Brillantly written, these dialogs (and sometimes monologs) are key to fully appreciate this anime. \r\nFluid, meaningful, and sometimes so snappy that you can - literally - 'hear' the punchlines hit the male main character on its face.\r\nIt can be a real pleasure to follow this anti-social disordered young man in its quest for anti-glory, making himself the common enemy of all in accordance to his twisted views on life. \r\nThe high-school becomes the battlefield for a change, the only way left for these anti-heroes to evolve into something new.\r\nWhilethis setting is overall a bit too much romanticized, and if you're not afraid of reading between the lines, this anime should provide some epic and funny punishing jokes mostly directed at our male character (when he's not craving for the cuteness of the very innocent tennis club captain), only bested by a smart cold queen, together shunned by all the others, while they're just struggling, in the end, to be accepted as they are.\\n\r\nWhich is, in this anime in particular, but also in real high-school life in general, what it's always all about.",

            "content": "I'll be honest, there isn't much that I personally liked about any of the main characters.\r\nThis anime revolves around a boy named Hikigaya, a loner outcast who has a very pessimistic view of the world and doesn't like being in groups. He is forced by his teacher to join the \"service club\" so he'll grow and change. In the club he meets another girl, Yukinoshita, who is also quiet and reserved but isn't as 'creepy' as Hikigaya. They are soon joined by a second girl, Yuigahama (who is the most enjoyable of the three main characters), and the three work in the club to helpother students with their requests.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime isn't a romantic anime, and while it has some pretty funny moments peppered throughout, it isn't really a 'comedy'. That's not bad in itself at all, however the main thing holding this anime back in my opinion is the lack of development of Hikigaya or Yukinoshita. Neither really grows as a character (either in a positive or negative way), and the two basically bicker at each other throughout the whole anime with neither one of them, especially Yukinoshita, showing any sign that they like each other at all.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps I view this anime in a bad light because I went into it expecting a rom-com and didn't get that, but I honestly think the anime had a lot of potential (almost all of its side characters are very enjoyable), however the fact that two of the three main characters aren't really relatable at all, aren't really likable at all, and have no character arc to speak of makes this anime not a very good watch.",

            "content": "Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru was one of the first anime's I have ever watched, and marked the beginning of my anime binge watching. At the time, I was only interested in the romantic comedy genre, and what better than to watch an anime that even had the phrase \"romantic comedy\" in it's name? But this title clearly mislead me, and watching this show was probably one of the best decisions I could have made.\r\nOregairu takes place in your generic high school setting, just like almost every other high school anime. It's narrated and led by the snarky and aloof character HachimanHikigaya, a lonely protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Hachiman turned in a clever, yet ludicrous essay, he is forced into joining the Volunteer Service Club by his Literature teacher, Hiratsuka-Sensei.  Once he arrives at the club, the deuteragonist of the story is revealed, in quite a cliche way. Character Yukino Yukinoshita is revealed at the beginning of the story as a beautiful, yet cold-hearted character who can't seem to keep her sharp tongue to herself. Normally, this is where the story would begin to become quite predictable. The male protagonist is somehow going to charm the female protagonist in the most ridiculous ways possible, while the two of them are alone in a clubroom. Except, this doesn't really happen.\\n\\n\r\nOregairu's story focuses on the realistic problems that high school students, both boys and girls, would face and have to solve. The title can be misleading because it's first impression is another cliche rom com, but it delves more into problems other than love. In fact, most of the individual story arcs throughout the anime are not focused on the main characters, but more on the students who request the club's member's Yukino and Hachiman and the soon to arrive final member Yui Yuigahama. With every passing story arc or request that the trio solves, the main characters begin to develop.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the strongest points of the story, as each character is very multi-layered and three-dimensional. Each character has their own ideals, beliefs, and backstories. Hachiman has pessimistic views of the human society, due to his pitiful(also sadly comedical) past life experiences being shunned by everyone around him. His ideals appear very often in the story, and can be very relatable in some ways. Hachiman uses his ideals and beliefs to help solve requests by other students.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong there are still small amounts of romance throughout the series, it's just not the main focus of the story, let alone any story arc in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and art of the series is quite mediocre, compared to its excellent story and characters. Studio Brains with its simple animation is not terrible in any ways, but perhaps the series could have been a lot more enjoyable if the animation was of higher quality. But of course, I would always take a better story over better animation.\\n\\n\r\nLike any light novel adaptations, the anime series is lacking compared to its counterpart. There are large amounts of dialogue and scenes from the light novel series that weren't implemented into the anime. But this is kind of an issue in all animes, due to the limited 24 minute per episode rule and the 12 episode rule as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Oregairu is a unique anime with many great characters and interesting stories. This anime definitely scores as one of my favorite animes, and contains my favorite character of all times, Hachiman Hikigaya. This series is quite difficult to understand, though, and does require some amounts of thinking. Many times ideals will clash throughout the series, and unless you understand both character's points of views, its hard to enjoy the series to its fullest. If you are looking for a clever and witty anime with drama and great characters, then Oregairu is for you!",

No typical romantic comedy stuff, no exaggerated expressions, no normal talk at all.

Loneliness, friends, society, and the \"methods\" of solving problems. You won't find anything interesting if you're not good with appreciating a philosophical approach to life.\r\nBut if you're like me and a bit different than the rest, THIS IS THE ANIME BITCHES.BETTER WATCH IT BEFORE YOU DIE AND THANK ME LATER.

            "content": "Story: ha, another one of these anime plots. the storyline reminded me of Sukunai, the two main characters are pretty much loners and were bought together due to the teacher the main character has. The other side character, Yui comes to the scene when she needs help baking cookies for someone. I guess the storyline basically talks about their experiences together. I actually dunno how to rate this since I didn't really like the anime for its storyline but more for the characters and the comedy it had.\r\nArt: In a nutshell, I liked the art style of this anime. I tend to base animes offtheir art style as a first impression, and this one definitely caught my attention\\n\\n\r\nSound: I never really noticed the sound, I do like the Opening however (Yukitoki).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: oh how I enjoy the characters. My favorite has to be the main character, \"Hikki\". The way he looks at life just amuses me with all the monologues he has at the end and throughout each episode. His essay that he submits to his teacher are also very enjoyable. Yukino, the president of the Volunteer's Club, I look at as an elitist that stands above the others, not that I dislike her, I enjoy her character. The other main character would be Yui, I feel like she bought more innocence to the anime and is just plain silly heh.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Again, I watched this anime for the comedic aspect instead of the storyline. If we're basing an anime on how funny it is, this is probably on the top of my list. most of the comedy comes from Hikigaya and his aspect on life and the different situations he comes across.",

            "content": "Yahari Ore is a romantic comedy that centers around an anti-social high school boy that has no desire to interact with the real world or make friends. Instantly the main character reminded me of Keima from The World God Only Knows... and he even plays a PSP. The reason why this anime managed to capture my attention was the main character and the situation around him, as it should be. I was interested to see how it would progress and I was not disappointed. This anime I wouldn't TECHNICALLY qualify as a harem anime, although there are two girls in the group and I couldsee him going for either one... but really I could see them also going for each other as well. \\n\r\nThe female characters are great and likable. Very likable and each is completely different. You don't need a harem of 10 girls, 2 great ones will do just fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe point where this anime loses some of its momentum is the story. While the opening premise is excellent and its execution is flawless... the series suffers from ADD and doesn't know where it wants to go. The other major issue I had was that there was no confession or romantic conclusion. I wouldn't have minded that if they hadn't set it up that there would be more explanation. He was supposed to take one of them out to dinner, I wanted to see that and how it went but it never happened as the show ended without mentioning it again. I also don't like that they didn't give enough backstory to the characters. The main female is anti-social but they never show specific examples of times she was picked on, only mention them in a sentence. She has no friends... because she just doesn't. That doesn't work for me, I expect more. \\n\\n\r\nThe redeeming aspect of this is the MC. He is cool when he needs to be, funny when he needs to be... and completely calm and detached 99% of the time. Nothing seems to fluster him... and that I like. There is also the matter of his amazing ability to be completely logical and incredibly cold. I got IMMENSE satisfaction from watching him completely destroy that (censored) (censored) lazy good for nothing (censored) (censored) of a (censored) (censored) (censored) chairwoman for the cultural festival. That verbal asswhooping was so good that I felt that it should have gotten its own spin off show. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: Good but could have been better with more focus on the romance between the characters and exploring what happens. I want more.\\n\\n\r\nART: Fabulous. Fluid. Smooth. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Loved the music. Intro and outdo were great.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: This anime really suffered from lack of backstory and lack of character development past the main characters... and even they didn't get much. There was an episode where they help a character and she is almost never seen again. Her unique appearance would indicate that she should probably have been in more episodes and a bigger part of the show. Fail. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Very enjoyable. Some things wrong but still a great time.\\n\\n\r\nREWATCHABILITY: Honestly? Zero. As good as it was, I won't watch it again.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Watch it. It is worth every episode and makes you have a good time. I just wish there was more. Virtus Signum gives this an 8/10.",

            "content": "Yahari Ore  is something quite different, though the synopsis makes it come across as something unoriginal - very typical, it separates itself from those mindsets and portays something.. painfully honest. Unusually cruel and realistic, it it shown from the perspectives of those who are shunned. Those who are disconnected and detached from society. How do they feel?\r\nThis anime explores those ideals, questions society and that status quo and to put my feelings in simpler words - really allows you to feel. While the show is masked in comedy, there is a sudden, almost grim tone to it. Almost it's funny nature is an excuse- so viewers are surprised when they pause for a second and think - holy crap, that's pretty terrible.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character of Yahari Ore is apathetic, unforgiving and certainly brutally honest. Underneath this persona, and most of the side characters calling him \"gross\" or \"disgusting\" we see that Hachiman's views are those of a boy who has been scarred and isolated, with wounds that have caused him to stray away. Using his own words - \"As a veteran on this battlefield of life, I've gotten used to losing.\" \\n\r\nUnfortunately, while Hachiman's sarcastic way of thinking can be humorous and almost a bit twisted, it is also something we try to avoid - the truth.\\n\r\nNow where I argue that this anime falls thin is its other female characters, Yui and Yukino.\\n\r\nYukino is an intriguing character, called the \"Ice-Cold Beauty\", she also has another view of the world whereby she believes she is \"exceptional\" and her job is to help the less fortunate. Known for her blunt and straightforward personality, she is able to find faults in others easily. This cold attitude has forced others to leave to her, to abandon her as they find her personality, too... cruel?\\n\\n\r\nIn that respect, I feel Hachiman and Yukino are \"two sides of the same coin\" both characters deserted but how they respond, how they react - how they change is what makes it truly compelling.\\n\r\nAfter all, everyone has a defense mechanism - how they cope when they are faced with absolute solidarity. Some fall in deep darkness, some learn how to adapt or more often than not, people force themselves to find a way to survive, unconsciously or not, people have a small habit of enduring everything - Hachiman and Yukino choose to manage by their own means.\\n\\n\r\nThere are quite many questions that need to be asked surrounding her, and only tiny hints can be found. She is seen to be very understanding and sincere especially around Yui. Still, her character did not get the amount of time it deserved to fully appreciate.\\n\r\nNow where it truly disappoints is Yui, a somewhat flat character which lacks in depth - I struggle to find a sense of realness towards her. How sincere is her character? I wonder. But this series could not have done this without her, kind of gives viewers a sense of warmth - the difference between her and the other two characters are large but we see how she interacts and feels and that is something I can acknowledge.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the storyline of this anime is not anything special, it's quite simple - very plain but how they delivered is the important part, and they did not fail. Relationships, feelings and people in general is a very difficult rope to thread onn but this series deals with it in both very interesting and entertaining way.\\n\r\nThe anime comes across as any comedy anime, hilarious and amusing but it will definitely surprise you.",

            "content": "Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru, or OreGairu, started as a series of light novels by Watari Wataru in 2011. It's gotten multiple manga and an anime adaptation from Brain's Base in 2013. Is this a romantic comedy that's worth looking at?\r\nStory:\r\nOur narrative follows a young introvert, Hikigaya Hachiman, who gets himself in trouble with his teacher due to getting overly creative with an essay assignment. As punishment, she forces him to join the Volunteer club, an organisation dedicated to helping students with problems. The leader, and only other member, is Yukinoshita Yukino, an introverted girl who believes that the exceptional, such asherself, should aid the hoi polloi. The two are quickly joined by Yuigahama Yui, a more extroverted girl who wants to be friends with both of them and quite possibly has an attraction to both of them. The episodes generally follow a pattern of the club getting asked for assistance and our three leads going to work on it.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest weakness with the series is with the \u201clove triangle\u201d aspect among our three leads. Here's the thing, Hikigaya has no real chemistry with either of these girls. There's a young guy in the tennis club he seems to have a thing for, complete with sparkly effects, blushing and other signals that would generally be indicative of him as the love interest, but it's pretty clear that the series is trying to push the whole love triangle and it just doesn't do it well. Of course, there is a second series. Maybe he actually does end up with that guy and the lack of real chemistry is deliberate. Pattern recognition says that it's unlikely, but that would be awesome. Even Yui's one-sided interest doesn't really do much. She has more chemistry with Yukino than this guy. There's also an issue with coincidence. Mainly, the set of sheer coincidences that go into tying these three together makes Steerforth constantly showing up completely by accident seem suddenly plausible.\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, there are things I appreciate about this series too. I like that two of the three major characters are introverted. It's not something that happens often. I also appreciate that the romance takes a back seat to the characters just getting to know each other and learning to get on as friends. I also like that, thus far, it's pretty atypical for a romantic comedy. It takes risks with the formula and does its own thing instead of giving us the usual tropes. The comedy also does generally work. It actually builds on the situation and uses a variety of set ups and pay-offs as opposed to a series like WataMote where the joke is always that she's socially awkward.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nA lot of these characters actually do get well fleshed out and have verisimilitude to them. A lot of them remind me of people I've actually known. The emphasis on that makes it kind of jarring when Hiratsuka sensei does things that would get any real teacher fired. It also makes the few more exaggerated characters, Zaimokuza & Hina being the primary examples, seem a bit out of place. Overall, though, it is quite a compelling group of characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is pretty good. A lot of it is pretty standard for this type of series, but it's well done and there are some nice details.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe casting is pretty good. Eguchi Takuya, Touyama Nao, and Hayami Saori all do well in the main roles. Even Sasaki Nozomi and Hiyama Nobuyuki are able to make their more exaggerated roles sound decent. The music is quite nicely done and suits the series well.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's quite a bit. I already mentioned the way Hikigaya and Saika have ample amounts of chemistry. There's also the stuff between Yui and Yukino. These two get really affectionate and there's a point where Yui mentions that she might like Yukino even more than she thought. Although she does clarify that she doesn't mean in that way. Methinks the lady doth protest over-much. Hina's character is defined by her being a yaoi fan-girl and she openly drags guys she knows into her fantasies on that front. I bet she's the type who writes erotic friend fiction.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nOreGairu is a pretty enjoyable series. It has some issues but it also gets a lot right. All things considered, I give it an 8/10. Maybe I'll watch and review the sequel series at a later date and we'll see if it improves. But next week is the start of a new year. This January I'm going to be looking at series and films that tie in to various things I've reviewed in prior Januaries. To start with, tying into Hayashibara Megumi month, let's look at All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku Dash.",

            "content": "Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru, with its super long title is a LN adaptation, a pretty famous one that is rated pretty high by light novel readers. This hype attracted me, so I decided to read it to see what's all the fuzz was about, and it did not live up to the hype, not surprising at all, cause the thing is hyped so much that anything short of a tatami galaxy wouldn't satisfy it. \r\nLet's get it straight here, Yahari is a harmless little show dealing with teenage life in a slightly more realistic tone than almost all other LN hadand have ever done, with quite good writing and solid characters.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, it have little to nothing else to offer for anyone who had went past the relate zone or never met the problems offered in the book.\\n\\n\r\nHachiman the protagonist is a kind of \"unique\" MC, that is more cynical than most anime MC, the quotation is to high light that the \"uniqueness\" is strictly restricted to anime, cause he is just your average kind of cynical high school student. This of course makes him more relatable to most of the target audience, but unfortunately I went pass that phase long ago when my teacher told me I need to go see a therapist or get expelled, so Hachiman is about as relatable as all the other MCs (ie. not at all).\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are more fleshed out compared to other LN characters, with nice bit of depth here and there, raising their likability.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is just teenage life with a bit of drama/romance here and comedy there. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Yahari is just a harmless show that is okay for what it is trying to do. It isn't offensive and if you like teenage life/romance or never gotten over it, you might like it a lot. Personally I never get the fascination with teen life, but then again I spent most of it climbing mountains, travelling around the world, and playing video games.",

BTW big fan of romance anime though.\r\nso here is my review about it.\r\nStory : 4\r\nWhen i first watched the anime i was like oh this is going to be a great anime\r\nwhat make me gave this rating is mostly the character development in this story\r\ni feel kinda down about the story because there is not much a development and after more episodesit gets kinda annoying and gets really boring.  There were little romance in it but its only for few seconds. i was like WHUT? Thats it?. I thought they would change and develop\\n\r\nThe anime is about Friendship, Society and etc. If you plan on watching anime about everyday life watch this. Its not much of romance and comedy though. or i would say it DOESNT EXIST.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound : 4\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime is just lazy doesn't give me much interest in it and the art is decent though. Well until they changed the art in Season 2.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 3\\n\r\nGod why does everyone the main two characters have to be so rude and negative feelings except for Yui what i dont like about the MC that is he is lazy as fk. Only cares about himself doesnt care much of the people around him. He sees every scene as Negative and all that shiz. And as for Yukino its like she thinks highly of herself which gives me a thumbs down for her. cold too. Doesnt think much people around her. or doesnt care.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall : 3\\n\r\nIts boring for me idk for you Its funny how it is Romance and Comedy when it doesnt exist in the story all the characters are boring for me. Overall the anime is Poor as hell boring though.\\n\\n\r\nBut for those people who wants a romance anime that is different not like the common romance story anime. Watch this.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When it came to choosing what anime to watch next I felt that I needed a little light hearted pick me up, and so I decided I'd search out a slice of life romcom. After finding this anime and reading the synopsis I couldn't help but feel I'd found my typical, safe bet, feel good romcom...but man, was I wrong! There is nothing typical about this anime.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nMale lead in Hikigaya. Forced into the Volunteer club against his will. Meets a pretty girl, Yukinoshita, who is the only member of the club. Story follows the club's members through their everyday activities solving problems forother students. Typical at first sight, yes, but the area that makes this stand out from all the rest is the way the problems are solved. Hikigaya and Yukinoshita both clearly have a somewhat distorted view on their youth and society, as well as holding obscure views on how to approach them. This formula makes for some very unique solutions to the varied problems brought to them. With this the typical romcom setting feels fresh again. I can't guess how each incident will be addressed, and that, to me, is what keeps me intrigued. The story doesn't really cry out to me as fantastic or mind blowing, but it does hold something on me. Although not mind blowing, it is still good and does, as I said, keep me intrigued, and for that I credit it. This different take on the romcom genre can seem a little strange at first, especially if you came to this anime expecting your average set up (like me), but it won't take too long to adjust, presuming that you give it a chance. The story can also seem a little slow paced at first, but once the characters have all been introduced it does start to pick up steam.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation is probably the area which I was most conflicting about. Maybe it was just me but the animation didn't seem to flow as well as I had hoped. It wasn't bad, but there were parts which I feel it had so much more to offer. Also I noticed that a lot of frames were being recycled in certain scenes. It would not really be a problem here and there, but it became regular enough that it became a slight annoyance. Having said that, I did really like the level of detail that went into the background art. The environments were for the most part very well made and pleasing to the eye without taking too much attention from the characters. I also believe the art style of the characters was well suited. It was neither too cute for seriousness nor too realistic for comedy. Despite the odd blip in quality, I'd say it is still easy to sit and admire this anime's art.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime never really jumped out at me. However, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact to me it means that the music was so well fitted to the anime to the point that it felt completely natural no matter what the mood of the scene. Although, at the same time that does mean that I personally didn't find anything spectacular either. The opening and ending themes were quite catchy, and I think it was a nice touch that the voice actress' of the two main heroines were involved. It puts a personal stamp on the theme as opposed to many anime that just take chart music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\nAs I touched on in my story section, the characters of Hikigaya and Yukinoshita are themselves quite unique with their views, which is another point as to why this anime stands out. Especially Hikigaya who as the male lead strangely tries to distance himself from the standard love interest development of a romcom due to his particular take on youth. On the other hand, the second heroine to appear, Yuigahama, contrasts by being more bubbly and girly, suddenly letting us know that we are indeed watching a romcom. She seems to bring balance to the main characters, almost a more natural approach to things compared to the likes of Hikigaya and Yukinoshita. The way they bounce off each other's personalities is a strong point of the anime, but it is not in my opinion the strongest. The character development is fantastic. Every character you meet has their own story, and as you go through the episodes you slowly begin to get a picture of how they really tick. Even the supporting characters build into slightly fleshed out beings as opposed to simply blending into the background. You never really start off with a full picture, which is good because it gives me another reason to pay attention. Of course, like in most anime, some of the character development is done through flashbacks (especially Hikigaya's past school days), but instead of them being an annoying detraction from the main story they are kept short and sweet; you get a deeper look into the character without having to take your foot off the gas.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10 and Overall 8/10\\n\r\nI can't really say that this anime does what it says on the tin...and I was looking for what was on the tin! However, I did enjoy this quite a lot. It was a different take on the genre. It was quite refreshing, the characters and the story were a joy to watch. If you are perhaps bored of the standard set up then this anime is definitely worth a shot. Hell, even if you aren't bored give it a shot. I'm sure you won't be disappointed!",

            "content": "The story is a good part of the show so I rate it 8/10. Basically the story is about a antisocial highschooler named Hikigaya Hachiman. He isn't afraid of speaking the truth or break other peoples hearts, hopes, and or dreams. After writing a essay about what he wishes to be in the future as saying \"Everyone that enjoys there youth should go die,\" depending on what version you watch. After handing in the essay His teacher hands him off to a club known as the \"volunteer club\" which takes any request and assists them in completing it hoping that he will become a normalhighschooler.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is at a good 7/10. Sorry can't describe it very well so skipping the topic.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is at a 10/10 because overall what made me want to give it a 10 is because of its opening theme song, placing one of my top favorite openings in all anime. The background music is also a really good part of the show because it seems as though they make a new sound track depending on every situation they have in the show and every single one is amazing in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nFinally the character 10/10 I absolutely loved it. Hikigaya Hachiman has all sorts of different famous quotes such as the one I'm using as a picture \"Fake people have a reputation to keep, real people just don't care,\" or my favorite \"On my first hand experience, you can't please everyone but its easy and fun as hell to piss everyone off,\" as his teacher describes him \"He is a smart antisocial freak with eyes of a dead fish,\" which matches him perfectly and that's why we love him. Everyone who meets Hikigaya Hachiman starts to love his way of thinking and destroying peoples hearts, hopes, and or dreams. Being a loner actually benefits Hachiman greatly by getting him into and or out of bad situations.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion you will love this show its my second favorite anime of all time.",

            "content": "Oregairu is an anime which presents a very different point of view from other romcom anime, from the perspective of a loner reject instead of a school idol or any other of that sort. But even so, it is a comedy after all, which I feel that is extremely effective and enjoyable, since you will find yourself laughing non-stop at the witty comebacks from Hikigaya despite the situation.\r\nInstead of gaining love and acceptance from the rest of the cohort, the protagonist, Hikigaya, gains even more hatred and reject from his schoolmates, only with a few of his close friends who understands and appreciates his character.I have come to like his character compared to the rest because he always gives the most practical and cruel suggestions, yet producing the best results. From his conversations and the way he presents his view, I learnt a lot from it than any other anime. For example, from his conversation with Yukino at the beginning of the anime about changing oneself, Yukino speaks of a point of view where many people will agree to, the courage to change oneself changes everything around you for the better, making it seem like change is something you have to accept. But in the case of Hikigaya, he feels that change is unneeded, there is no need to change yourself, but the courage to accept yourself for who you are, to love yourself no matter what surroundings subject you to. Hikigaya's comment \"I love myself.\", is the evident representation that he accepts himself for who he is. His personality and stand towards friends, \"helping each other\" and the idea of \"everybody\" is one which resonates within me. Even though Hikigaya may feel that he is a loner, and that he is okay even if others hate him since he is so used to pain, I feel that he deserves better than what any other girl can give him. I have come to like his character and that is enough recognition for all he has done.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite the good character development shown for Hikigaya, and also Yukino in a sense, the rest of the characters are seen with a sense of disapproval. Especially the popular group with Hayama and that bitchy girl, whateverhernameis. Hayama is a ultimate nice guy with his \"one for all\" ideals, to the point where it even seems fake. Primarily, I do not dislike his character, and I feel that his personality which seems to accept everything is commendable, I would have come to like this character even though he is the complete opposite of Hikigaya. But because of one line he said, that he would never come to like Hikigaya even if he knew him since young, and his apparent misunderstandings/unacceptance towards Hikigaya's behavior and character, I could not bring myself to like him anymore.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the magic of this anime, to feel that the norm of handling things may not be the correct way, and that the \"ultimate good guy\" character may seem irritating since it is too ideal. Like what Renge from Ouran Host Club would have said, \" Too weak! There is no darkness in the character!!!\" in the high-pitched and disapproving tone. On the other hand, Hikigaya would be a character with both light and darkness, making it a fully developed and attractive character.\\n\\n\r\nHence, I will highly recommend this anime to those who enjoy comedy as well as good character development. Since I am one who looks more at character rather than story plot, this anime has more than satisfied me in that sense.",

            "content": "Yahari Ore is a bit of a parody but it is also the kind of romantic comedy which takes an unpopular antisocial guys then gives him his pick of two girls who are attractive in different ways. Yukino is beautiful and intelligent, in fact she is so perfect that she is ostracized out of jealousy. While she comes off cold has a warm spot for Yui and our hero Hachiman, the latter which she expresses in fairly typical tsundere style. Yui is not an outcast like the other two but she tries too hard to make people happy and that sometimes leads to her beingtaken advantage of by her so called other friends. She is warm and sincere and sometimes a little clumsy she is the person who brings the whole group together. All three of them are in a club called the \"service club\" where they basically help random people with their problems.\\n\\n\r\nAs the name suggests this show derives a lot of its comedy from the main character comparing his life to the tropes of romantic comedies however it doesn't break the fourth wall. One of the problems that I had with this show was that a lot of the comedy is presented as witty banter between Hachiman and Yukino and honestly I think a lot is lost in translation. It can be very wordy and at least my translation (which I think is the official one) it was occasionally difficult to follow. Sometimes they would make counter arguments that quite simply didn't logically follow the statement before. I think maybe this is just a subtitle issue. I almost exclusively watch subs but I was thinking half way through maybe I would have been better off with the dub. There are also times where I feel they try to parody romantic comedies as a genre. Sometimes it works but sometimes it kind of misses the mark and ends up not really being much of a parody at all and just feels like a standard member of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nI did like the characters though. One of the nice things about this show is they do have a few characters you wont find in every anime ever. The main character is in many ways fairly standard but he wont always do what you expect. Likewise Yukino although she can fall into the tsundere cliche you can usually see where she is coming from and I buy her as intelligent.  I think Yui is the most atypical of the main cast and I ended up liking her a lot more than Yukino as we get to know who she really is. There are also a few surprises in the supporting cast but I wont spoil it for you.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I gave it five, its basically a solid anime but it's still a comedy that is not all that funny. The characters feel real and the art is really nice but I just couldn't give it any more than that because I just don't think it was enjoyable enough, it's a little bit boring. But it might just be the subtitles, if you go both ways maybe try the dub?",

            "content": "My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU abbreviated as Oregairu in Japanese is my 91st completed anime on MAL, it means something to me beside being almost to reach the 100th completed anime milestone. Oregairu is an anime about the importance about making friends and leave your only hiding place called loneliness.\r\nThe highlight of this series is skinny male main character with half-dead eyes named Hikigaya Hachiman, that guy you don't have any interest to interact with and just simply ignore whenever he shows some presence. I found Hikigaya Hachiman to be quite an interesting character, he took his negative tendencies and edginess into next level thathe is just not only your introverted cool guy in anime makes he makes a well anime main character yet most often he must to face those counterattacks of embellished words by the ice queen of the series is just godlike. The ice queen is Yukino(shita) the perfect yet not perfect girl in this anime, her background is not even interesting in any way but she makes the perfect combination of tongue battle with the least positive guy in the school. Without two of those characters this anime series would be just another regular school anime that i would really despise into the near maximum level of hatred.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the popular guys are kind of annoying and without them this show would be more bearable, it's just like in real life though. I guess one of those losers that really detest their crappy school life who read could understand what i mean.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a quite unique attempt in the school genre but also totally infuriating to watch most of the time and really fun at some moments. Whenever it tries to be funny it rarely fails and most often works well, that is really a good sign for an entertainment that claims to be comedic that majority of the comedic entertainment failed to be amusing at it should be. Oregairu had some potential to be actually great but most of the time i felt like watching Haruhi series without the character Haruhi and replace her with a lot of less alien school characters, which is not a good thing unfortunately in this case. I would still really like to recommend it to especially for people with mild nihilistic tendencies like the main character, but want to hear more of the painful honesty of the high school's only shunned loser lines. It's still sort of worth the time to wait those godlike moments in the middle of the sea of pointless scenes. I always waiting for the queen and the king duo of this anime to do their verbal offense phase in every episode, unfortunately not in every occasion it does bear the fruit. (6/10)",

This show relies heavily on character development. The characters are developing very slowly, but its actually what makes the development interesting and different.

His philosophies were somewhat accurate and on point as well, or in the least I found them that way. \r\nHis perception was really high, one of his 108 self-proclaimed skills. Not to mention his \"method\" for problem solving was fast, effective but not always preferable. (Guess lazy peeps find the quickest solutions) \r\nThat's a pretty unique thing, that this animehad imo considering the anime I've already watched. (Though of course some animes will have some similarities)\\n\r\nThe Drama part of the show was decent, not to bad just your usual or not so usual High School situations. (had its ups and downs) \\n\\n\r\nNow, for the the fun part. \\n\r\nPersonally, the BEST GIRL imo opinion (though is not a girl per se or possible for Hachiman to get) is Sensei Shizuka Hiratsuk. \\n\r\nMy Favorite Quote by Sensei \\n\r\nThink, writhe, struggle and agonize. If not, what you're going through isn't genuine. \\n\r\n(Shizuka Hiratsuka A.K.A. Best Girl) \\n\\n\r\nThe next best is Yukinon because anyone who has watched the series knows they both are a perfect fit for each other. (I'd still prefer Sensei though) \\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, a very entertaining anime, definitely worth the watch, and a good Slice of Life and as my friend says a good Rom-com without the Rom. Though one thing I absolutely HATED was \"Yahallo\" or \"Hello-Hello\", I'm sorry but everytime Yui said that was extremely annoying. Guess now I know what Hikki felt. (Though she wasn't a bad character, actually quite a good one) \\n\\n\r\nRATING \\n\r\nI'd rate it 8.3/10\\n\r\nNot a masterpiece but definitely the closest anime to being irl relatable.\\n\r\nOh, and I've heard a Season 3 is on the way, looking forward to that! \\n\\n\r\nSome wise words from 8man:\\n\r\nThe past makes you wanna die out of regret, and the future makes you depressed out of anxiety, so by elimination, the present is likely the happiest time. \\n\r\n(Hachiman Hikigaya)\\n\\n\r\nIf ya haven't watched it I'd Recommend it!

            "content": "Couldn't really get into this. I found the MC (Hachiman) rather unlikable - misanthropic, a loner, with a huge sense of superiority over others. He becomes better throughout the series, but this development occurs at a snail's pace and he's not much better by the end of the 13 episode run. \r\nIn a rom-com, I should want the characters to get together. But I don't feel that with Hikigaya. The self-willed loner character who eventually learns to rely on others is common in this genre, and there's lots of examples of likable ones (Mei in Sukitte Ii Na Yo, Touma in WA2, Tomoya to anextent in Clannad) but this series fails to show the MC is somebody you want to root for. \\n\\n\r\nIt may be because this series is more like 85% comedy and 15% romance - Hachiman's flaws are kind of played up for laughs - and he turns out a lot better in the sequel season, but as far as romantic comedies go this is the one I've liked the least.\\n\\n\r\nAll other aspects of the anime are fine - it's your typical slice of life high school anime: There's overbearing teachers who want the best for their kids, 'popular kids' the main cast gets into conflict with, an arc about the culture festival + performance. Nothing really stands out too negatively or positively, except the aforementioned flaws of MC.",

            "content": "This is my second review so please bear with me! \r\nQuick Review: I really enjoyed the anime. It takes on the very realistic approach to slice of life animes and the protagonist is in some ways the anit protagonist. Things dont always go his way and there is no Karma for the just in this anime world. Refreshing and frustrating at the same time no question that this anime with its sound and art style really make you have the feels. Characters are thorough and well thought out and the monologues are beautiful a good 8/10 for me maybe even a 9.\r\nFor the more detailedReview.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story was good. Unlike some animes I think the Characters really carried this one. The stories basis was very cliche but it was the way the events ended up that brought a fresh new perspective. Again quite opposite in the way most animes like this. Some moments make u feel frustrated and others questioning. If you can relate to the main character Hikki then you will either love or hate this anime. I myself related to him a little bit but not extremely. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Art was ok. TBH my fav art was Hikki the main guy with the fish eyes. I don't know why I just liked having the main character not look so cliche. Everyone else was very cliche in the way they were drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Wasn't bad wasn't good either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Probably the best feautre of this anime is Hikki's character. He is not your regular Slice of life anime protagonists and like I said before does not have the world's karma on his side. Many different scenes will make you realize that the typical animes you are used to watching don't have any effect on this one. You get the real insight of look of what life can be like for the lone wolf in a socially driven environment. I do think some characters need to be fleshed out a little more but there is a season 2 in the works so I assume the questions will be answered then.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime had me feeling good but I can't give it the full satisfaction it needs especially since a season 2 is in the works. So moments I felt were left unfinished and sometimes characters did things that seemed strange. Hikki is the target of alot of abuse throughout the anime and although he puts up with it you cant help but feel a little frustrated that he is being treated this poorly. I think my favourite parts of this anime are his monologues and the very opposite way things happen and how dark it can sometimes be. I dont like how things are left unsettled but thats just me.\\n\\n\r\ni give this anime a 8/10. Enjoyable and Philisophical but there are better ones out there at the moment. We will have to wait for season 2!\\n",

            "content": "This anime is about Hikigaya, the main character who was rejected by society due to his odd behavior and highly intelligent. He gets to know 2 girls, Yukino & Yui, his close friends. \r\nDirected by Ai Yoshimura and produced by Brains Base.\r\nThe animation is great and the opening theme song gives a relaxing vibe.\r\nHikigaya is a character which I can relate to. He is highly intelligent, socially awkward just like I am. I normally not interested in crowds but I think very well on my feet. However, he puts on that sulky look which I normally don't but he is very helpful and an interestingcharacter. Even though, he was rejected by society, he never complain and he was alright with it.\\n\\n\r\nYukino is cool, smart and serious just like Chihaya Kisaragi from Idolmaster.\\n\\n\r\nYui is energetic and very optimistic. She reminds me of someone like Yayoi Takatsuki from Idolmaster.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime focuses on building relationships between Yukino & Yui. They help to host shows, drama clubs, organise events and meetings. This anime is a bit similar to Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai in the sense that the characters are rejected by society due to their odd behavior. In fact, I really like all the characters. I like how they handle their situations without complaining one bit and that's good. In fact, there is witty dialouges. \\n\\n\r\nSaika & Shizuka are one of my favorite characters in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it's sad to say that Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai still stands out better than this anime. I love the opening song and the art was great. Even though, this anime is not the best which is Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, it is definitely worth watching. I would recommend people to watch this anime for those who haven't watch.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: (9)\\n\r\nART: (9)\\n\r\nSOUND: (10)\\n\r\nCHARACTER: (9)\\n\r\nCONCLUSION: (9)",

            "content": "Just a heads up for this one, it is actually my first romatic comedy (light novel manga based) anime I've seen, so it's like a whole new world! So keep in mind that I have no experience or what so ever, so look at this as a first time review!\r\nStory\r\nThis bit is quite interesting, even though I haven't coped to understand it fully yet. I gave it an 8 because it was really intriguing, I instantly wanted to see how it progressed and same goes for the different characters. Mind you I am at the second season. After watching the first season I wanted toknow more, know the answers to all the questions, and when you get that kind of feeling, that means that the story is good, at least good enough to have caught my attention!\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nIt's low, yes I am aware of it. It is because it's nothing special, it isn't bad, but it's nothing special. There is no originality to, or uniqueness, but it's not like it's the worst I've seen. It's OK, I'm still gonna watch it though, but that is the reason why I picked a 6 for this one.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nOh yes, not biased at all but, I really love the sound/music in this anime. Especially since I am a huge fan of pianos (I guess I am bias haha). How they manage to use the soundtracks in the right moment, how they manage to enhance the emotions in every scene. This makes every scene worth seeing in my opinion, they really did great on this part!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nWow, what can I say. There are a lot of personalities, it varies from person to person, so you never really find 2 characters having the same personalities. Which I find good, because that can be really crucial in an anime. Although I've seen some animes in my life, the main characters personality, or just over all the character itself is really interesting. It's not something you would expect.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this yes, hence the 10. As I clearly stated before, I got hooked the moment I start watching. Not because it's really good, but the story got me caught, and the different characters, I want to see how it all develops. I couldn't stop watching, especially when some of the episodes ends with a \"cliffhanger\".\\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\r\nNow the final summary, I really find it interesting how this anime works. Especially since I've watched so many fantasy anime, it's good to get some fresh air. I find that people can really relate to this one with their own life, not in a bad way, but I've seen some comments on some episodes and it really enlightened me on how much people agreed to the story, the characters and how they feel the same way and such. I mean you can't really relate to a character trying to save the world...\\n\\n\r\nThis one I really recommend, especially if you a re into these genres. and I will definitely keep on watching, and maybe some day read the manga, although for me I think it takes away 50% of the experience, but that's just me. So if you want a simple anime with this type of genre and wants to go on a roller coaster, I recommend you watch this one!",

This is one of the most well-rounded and well-done anime I have watched.

The story starts off with an emo who has no friends (just read the description for the story) in any case, it has some comedy scenes here and there and the drama for once isn't boring. The love triangle is interesting as how each character changes throughout the series. In addition, MOST IMPORTANTLY  A HAREM IS ON ITS WAY IN S3 (if they animate for S3) which will make the events and character reactions and actions much more interesting. TheMC's quotes are fascinating and epic in some way. So yeah , it's a good anime",

            "content": "Original Review: http://pokemaster12.blogspot.com/2015/07/my-teen-romantic-comedy-snafu.html\r\nThis romantic comedy revolves around an antisocial high school student named Hikigaya Hachiman with a distorted view on life and no friends or girlfriend. When he sees his classmates talking excitedly about living their adolescent lives, he mutters: \"They're a bunch of liars.\" When he is asked about his future dreams, he responds, \"Not working.\" A teacher gets Hachiman to join the \"Volunteer Service\" club, which happens to have the school's prettiest girl, Yukinoshita Yukino.\r\nDespite it's super long title, this anime is not what I, or anyone else who's watched it, would ever consider your typical romantic comedy. In fact, I would almostconsider this anime to be the complete opposite of a rom-com. While it starts out with that somewhat romantic comedy feel (you've got the anti-social main protagonist, the pretty girl ends up being in contact with, and the other pretty girl who joins up for reasons that are entirely her own), the gears of this anime quickly shift, and you're given the main characters harsh views on the world around him. While there are many moments of hilarity, there are just as many moments that will feel like someone just punched you in the face with a healthy dosage of reality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn this story, you have three main characters. The first is Hikigaya Hachiman. From the moment he is introduced, you get a clear feeling of his character. He's a pessimistic loner who dislikes everyone and has the most negative world views I have ever seen in an anime character. He tends to think a lot, and so you're often given a healthy dosage of his internal monologues, which can be quite funny at times. After him comes the second main character, Yukinoshita Yukino, the prettiest and most intelligent girl in school. Much like Hikigaya, she's a loner. However, unlike Hikigaya, she's not a longer by choice, but because pretty much every girl in school is jealous of her. She's beautiful, smart, rich. She's basically what every girl strives to be, and they despise her for that. Despite this, she has a much more positive outlook on the world than Hikigaya, and their personalities will often clash, leading to hilarious yet witty banter between them. The last main character of the bunch is Yui Yuigahama. Unlike the other two, she is not a loner, and in fact is quite popular. She's bright and cheerful and is, in many ways, sort of like a stereotypical valley girl. Or, you know, what passes for a valley girl in Japan. While at first, she doesn't seem to have much of a role other than being cheerful and somewhat annoying, you eventually begin to realize that Yui is very much the glue keeping this trio together.\\n\\n\r\nI've spoken a lot about the characters, and that is because I feel it is the characters that make this anime stand out so much. This isn't your stereotypical romcom filled with tropes and bothersome cliches. The dialogue between the characters, the growth they undergo as the anime continues, is probably this anime's strongest point in its favor. The characters in here aren't static, they aren't one dimensional archetypes derived from specific tropes. These characters feel real, and their problems feel real. I love watching this anime because I can actually get into the characters, because I actually care about what happens to them. Even many of the side characters are fully-fleshed out and get some good development.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is another strong point going in this anime's favor. While I have seen better, I have also seen worse. I would have say that, out of all the anime I have seen, SNAFU's artwork definitely places somewhere in the upper tier. The backgrounds are often bright and colorful, and the details are fully fleshed out. You don't have those half-assed drawings where it looks like someone made a few buildings and then decided to call it quits because they got lazy. The character designs are also very well done. Hikigaya's appearance, from his somewhat beady and bored-looking eyes to even his slumped posture and mostly expressionless face help lend credence to his character. He's a lazy, anti-social loner who would rather people ignore his existence than make friends, and you really feel like that's who he is just from his design.\\n\\n\r\nThis story does have one aspect against it. The story is sometimes too intelligent. Are you confused? You should be. While I found the intelligence of this anime to be delightful, many of my friends who watched this anime were lost. Why? Because a lot of the times, you have to read between the lines to understand some of the conversations. Sometimes, it's not what's being said that is the most important part about the characters interactions, but what's NOT being said. Unfortunately, not everyone can realize what's not being said, and so some people may feel a little lost, especially during the more serious conversations. That being said, don't despair too much. So long as you pay attention, figuring out what's being said, what's not being said, and reading between the lines to discover what the true meaning of each interaction, isn't as difficult as it seems. However, you do have to really pay attention. This isn't some mindless show where you sit on the couch and go, \"Der! Natsu just farted fire! That's funny!\" Overall, I feel like this anime was a breath of fresh air from the typical romantic comedies that litter the genre.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork: 8.5/10\\n\r\nCharacter Design: 9.5/10\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 10/10\\n\r\nStoryline: 9.5/10\\n\r\nMusical Composition: 6/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\r\nTotal Score: 8.85/10",

            "content": "Oregairu, an anime unlike any other I have seen. It dares to explore views and insights into the behaviour of youth that people tend to want to ignore. There is normally a loner or two at school, but they are mostly ignored. So what happens when you explore the mind of those in solitude? You get an amazing set of characters and scenarios which can seem almost too real at times.\r\nStory\r\nWhile this isn't the first anime I have seen with a volunteer club setting, it is the most memorable. It is the perfect set up for this anime, and a good way to introduce othercharacters, all the while growing closer to those in the club. The development of the relationships between the three main characters, and their individual 'helping' strategies go hand in hand to create a simple and understandable plot, but with elaborate and intricate side details which do have major affects on the story. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThere is nothing truly spectacular about the art, but also nothing terrible. However one notable positive was the consistency between the family members of the series. Too often do I see characters that are supposed to be blood related have no physical resemblance. However, in this anime characters do share physical traits.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nAverage sound quality. The voice actor of Hikigaya Hachiman did a great job with the ever-cynical tone, and the voice actress for Yukino Yukinoshita also performing amazingly providing a cold voice for a character seemingly made of ice. However, the intro and outro songs didn't fit, as they seemed more for a full romance based show, taking away from what the show is really about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe three main characters are explored wonderfully, providing sufficient information, yet not being overburdened with useless information. The way they talk, to the body language they exhibit and down to the looks they trade with each other provide more knowledge than an in-depth flashback could ever give. Hachiman is a unique character. A true introvert and hopeful house-husband. Rotten to the core, lazy and a narcissist.  Traits often not wanted by most, yet his character is so lovable it is scary.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAfter re-watching this a second time, I still love the series. If you are tired of the typical school romance anime, you will most likely enjoy this. A well executed anime showing the thought processes and emotions (or lack thereof)  of those not socially active may not seem like a good premise, but it is pulled of amazingly and provides you with more than you will expect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a great anime which goes against the standards of the romance genre and shows the other side of what happens in school life. Interesting characters and a self-explaining story which doesn't need to hold your hand for you to follow. I really do recommend the watch.",

But the thing I love about this anime is the characters, whereas most anime use archetypes to lazily form charachters this anime does not. These are real charachters! Yes the protagonist is the antisocial charachters and was partially molded by the archetype but there is substance behind him and his way of thinking that makes him completely different. You feel like this charachters is refreshing andnot what you have seen a hundred times cut and pasted over and over. The same goes for the supporting charachters as well, you can see the archetype they were built from but then there is just something more to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and  sound are good but could be better and the story is good for what the show is being that it is pretty much just a comedy/slice of life. Speaking of comedy this is definitely an anime that is good for a laugh if you like overly blunt opinions of people and things as well as charachters with an eccentric view of the world. This is definitely a good show and if you have not seen it your definitely missing out!",

If you read the tags and see the \"school,\" \"romance,\" and \"comedy,\" let me tell you that this anime is very different than most anime with that tag. Despite the comedy in its title, this anime highlights very mature themes in school and is different than the usual anime. The characters are great. The main character is different from most main characters in school anime and this provides a fresh new story to the genre. I must say, the humor may be for mature audiences and may not beunderstood but the story is amazing. The character development and social commentary on high school norms is what I really enjoy in this anime. If you are looking for a fresh new taste on school anime that does not have the clich\u00e9 story and characters, then i highly recommend watching this anime and continuing to the second season.",

Unlike most anime that have unrealistic one. Most people who're gloomy or somewhat kinda fond of being the bad side yet they're really good can relate to this.. This anime's protagonist follows the idea of \"The End Justifies The Means\" well set aside Niccolo Machiavelli's Political theory.This anime if not really the greatest.. will be one of the best in this season why? Once you've watched it you'll ask for more.. The characters are well made and the personality.. the Art.. and the Opening Theme \"Yukitoki\" by Nagi Yanagi who also sang one of my favorite Opening theme Kimi no monogatari shiranai. The story line.. Well despite all of this and the Title the romance is little.. I think because the novel is just halfway to end.. The Character's of the Service CLub.. Hikigaya the badass guy.. Yuigahama the sweet girl.. Yukino the Cold Beauty.. Well they really the same.. This anime made me feel that I should change because I do feel that Hikigaya reflects me.. Well this anime is a great one.. It's really enjoyable.. There's drama plot twist and the other.. It won't disappoint you.. It's the greatest season of School Romance Comedy Anime..",

Above average, but nothing too special. The music is actually pretty nice, especially the opening song. Probably my favorite thing about this anime, though, are the characters. They seem like completely different and unique characters, but the fact is, a lot of us can relate to the three main characters. They're written so well in that way. \r\nThrough them, we get to see a lot involving what it means to be lonely vs. whatit means to be alone and why neither is necessarily bad. Coupled with that is the comfort of friendship and what it means to belong somewhere. This portion of the characters and the story is written very, very well. It sort of makes you think without making you feel badly in the process. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the story, the comedy is another great thing about this anime. It's a very dry, almost meta type of humor, and I think it fits in perfectly with these characters and their roles in high school. Again, it's a very easy thing to relate to, though most of us might not identify ourselves to be like these characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe story really does teach through the characters, and I think that's the reason that you should watch this anime. If nothing else, it's an easy watch, and it's a good one to relax and laugh to. At the least, you'll get a funny, Slice of Life anime. At the most, you're getting something that'll change your views on friendship and solitude. Either way, watch this, and have great time!",

The Soliloquy-- that Hachiman processes was expertly and awesomely written.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n There are 3 rules of reviewing-\r\nFirst rule- No anime is shit\r\nSecond rule-No anime is shit\r\nThird anime-No anime is shit\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIt is based on the following parameters--\r\n1)What is good about it?\r\n2)(Probability of)Whom'll the anime appeal to?\r\n3)Questions that other reviews raised in your head.\r\nP.S.-If you don't wan to read the whole, readthe summary at the end of every question.\\n\r\n======================================\\n\\n\r\n1)What is good about it?\\n\r\n Each story has a flow meaning how it is presented, what it presents and why  was it even presented, so here you have a High School Average loner guy Hikigaya Hachiman -with the dead fish eyes- who has a crazy but quite logical way of thinking, \"Stay away from people, stay away from problems\". Now he is put in a situation where he has to help other people with their problems as club activity and ofcourse it is forced upon him by his over too friendly (but sexy) homeroom teacher. So that's that but now lets talk about what is special about it from other rom-coms.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all a (mostly true) fact, the anime that are adapted from light novels have kind of kickass dialogues but in this one each and every monologue and dialogue was skillfully badass-lly written and executed. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and music was good. It was quite suitable for a romcom and gave the characters a good overall. \\n\\n\r\nHikigaya-kun is faced with his rival Yukino-chan who is charming, beautiful, too smart, too rich and uhh loner..yea right... Now the smartass teacher has thrown them inside the ring to knock...no..no..no... help each other out. Here I would like to point out especially the conversation between these two is on the other level.\\n\\n\r\nChemistry. Now the special thing about the relationship between characters is their chemistry, do they react do a explosion or they just stay water. The chemistry between Hikigaya-kun, Yukino-chan and Yui-chan(who is the second cute girl) do quite a reaction.\\n\\n\r\nNow the weird thing, this point that I'm going to give I'm not sure is good or not so you better decide it for yourself. This youthful romantic comedy is fucking complex love story, I think its good, in my opinion it takes a dive into the depths of the characters to present them true to a human nature which is one of the unexplained mystery of the universe. \\n\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n Summary: Loner MC with a theory of staying away from people to stay away from problems, forced to join a club to help people, meets a girl who becomes his rival and potential love interest. Awesome monologues and dialogues.  \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\r\n2)(Probability of)Whom'll the anime appeal to?\\n\r\n As I have pointed out the show has its main dealings in its specialties in dialogues so people who don't like to listen to stuff you should probably skip it...nah I'm just joking around, in my opinion for this type of show you need a particular state of mind and anybody would love this show. \\n\\n\r\n3)Questions that other reviews raised in your head.\\n\r\n *Exaggeration of one's characters- Yeah maybe ..but who wouldn't in a romcom.\\n\r\n *Why are there not many question for this one-Go try it for yourself. :)\\n\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n Overall Summary-\\n\r\nStory-9/10\\n\r\nArt-9/10\\n\r\nSound-8/10\\n\r\nCharacter-9/10\\n\r\n==========\\n\r\n||Overall-9/10||    \\n\r\n==========\\n\\n\r\n Verdict: Crafty one. (Verdictified..lol)\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     \\n\\n\r\nQuestions and criticisms are welcomed.",

I'd watch this series OVER and OVER! \r\nHachiman being my favorite character is a no holds bar kind of guy who thinks no one cares about him, thus he doesn't care about anyone else. Also making him the culprit for petty things because it's easier to hate one person that everyone already dislikes than it is to hate someone that everyone once looked up to. I love that! He's the hero that school deserves. Amazingly smart and gets even the smartest girl baffled.\r\nYukino is pretty awesome too. Though her being generally \"smarter\" than Hachiman was the only thing goingfor her haha. Everything else seemed like a, \"yeah she should know this or that\" as an example she should know how people would react if someone should insult another. Then mediate the situation. Whereas Hachiman would make it more cynical by taking the fall and the 2 never insulted each other. Almost manipulating the situation to fit the students needs rather than facing the fact that there was a problem. \\n\\n\r\nYui is the chick I would have fallen for. She was the popular girl interested into many different things. Those are qualities you don't find in popular girls til their in college. Once in college girls aren't popular because the populous is gigantic. Which makes Yui that much more special. She was definitely needed in the trio for both Hachiman AND Yukino were viturally the 2 biggest loners in the school with Yui being the extrovert of the crew.\\n\\n\r\nthat teacher and Hachiman though...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway great story.",

I don't hate any of it at all.\"\r\nThat's a quote from Hikigaya Hachiman, one of my favorite characters in all of anime. Who knew that it would come from what is, supposedly, at least, a romcom? This quote summarizes why Hachiman is such a great character. Take the protagonist of Hyouka, a similar show. The protagonist of that show, Oreki Houtarou, is very similar to Hachiman. However, Oreki never smiles. He seems to hate himself, andhate other people. He thinks he's above everyone else, and that's why he's such an unlikable and uninteresting character. I've only seen a few episodes of Hyouka, but this is what I've gathered from the small time I've spent watching it. However, Hachiman likes his loneliness. He relishes it, and he supports his points of view, a much more realistic take on the antisocial protagonist. His deadpan delivery and dark wit help make his character have a sort of twisted charm. In later episodes, he uses this to his advantage, especially in the second season. The way he grows as a character is also incredibly interesting as well. He doesn't become a flawless ladies man with a harem (cough cough Toradora cough cough) by the end of the second season. He is still a very flawed character and opens up his heart in a very unique way by the end of the show. However, the show needs at least another interesting character to make it truly great. And that's where Yukino Yukinoshita comes in.\\n\\n\r\nYukino is interesting because of how similar she is to Hachiman. I'm not going to go into specifics here, but just know that she is a very interesting character, and leaves a lot of her past up to interpretation. Her past is what shapes her character, and if I'm right, I'm guessing that her character arc will finish by her freeing herself of her past and heritage and finding her own way.\\n\\n\r\nThe other aspects of the show don't hold up as well, though. The music, art, and story are all run of the mill. The characters are what really make this show. If you're not convinced yet, look up the nice girl's rant from episode 5. That should do it.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season is even better than the first as well, so definitely watch that after this!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

What makes the story interesting though, are the impressive cast of characters. Although they seem rather bland and generic at first, they actually go through some real development, making you wonder how it impacts their decisions. You can see our main character slowly breaking out of his shell, making an originally bland character actually pretty interesting.\r\nThe art is fairly good andimproves the overall quality of the experience, although I found the soundtrack to be rather forgetful.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy drama, comedy and a slight touch of romance, you will definitely enjoy this one. Just don't expect too much, because other than the characters this anime doesn't really has much going for it.",

            "content": "Warming this review may contain spoilers.\r\nFirst impressions, ok to be completely honest I only originally checked out this show because it had a trap it in and I liked all the memes that where coming from this series was what originally got my interest, but of course once I started watching it there was a lot more than to the series than I first thought.\r\n(Also quick Side note i will be covering both seasons of the anime in this review)\r\nStory, 6/10 \r\nSo in today's modern anime where half the series that are coming out are about ether about high schools or cute girls doing cutethings how dose a series My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU stand out in a market which at this point has already reached peak inflation, besides being about a bitter, anti-social teenager named  Hachiman forced into a school club called service club, the  that help people fix their problems, totally haven't  heard about this before a seruies about a high school student being  forced into an excuse  for plot club  with cute girls and sarcasm aside.\\n\r\nThe story is basically the three of them trying to fix poor, poor Japanese high school students problems and there some sort of love triangle forming because light novel. which at first thought I figured this is just going to be another generic school romantic comedy that I would forget in a week, and considering  my experience with the medium you can't exactly blame me for having that viewpoint.\\n\r\nBut i was very surprised in how even though this series is mostly about  high school bullshit, i did find it interesting that this series actually talks  and criticiszes human  society. Well to be more specific it's more aless  socal commenty  and the problems that can arise  which i find very interesting and the fact this series trys to more thought provoking than your average romantic school comady with teenagers is really impressive to say the least.\\n\r\nThe ideas of don't always go with the crowd, be yourself and some people are going to be two-faced assholes.  the fact it doesn't devolve into otaku culture to get it point across just adds weight to the commentary because whoever wrote this dose has this understanding  of how people tick and doesn't use it for an excuse for edgelord bullshit, but more a less is telling you this is normal human behaviour and it isn't perfect, but that's fine because even if problems do come up there are ways to fix them to get around them. \\n\\n\r\nBut the major prolem is even though it's a lot more thought provoking and actually trys to be interesting with its messages and etc,  it is sadly constrained by the fact that at the end of the day it is still a teen romantic comedy in  high school and you can only take it so far intill it implodes on itself, and another prolem I have with this series is that it has this meta commentary  asspect where its makeing  fun of the tropes and cliches of its genre, but also realays on sied tropes and cliches for its plot beat.\\n\r\nSo comes off more like its mocking itself rather than any meaningful commentary on the subject and I for one hate that kind of humour in anime with a passion because it just isn't funny. When Hachiman is being an asshole that's when I find the series funny because I find his brand of no fucks given just comedy gold and this meta humour or references to other series just feels very forced. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of forced the love triangle in this series between Hachiman, Yukino and Yui is the most forced thing In this series, because even though I find the \"friendship\" they forms together really sweet and endearing. But at the same time, I feel the romantic dynamic to there relationship feels tacked on for the sack of waifu wars or stretching out the story longer than it has to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, 6/10 \\n\r\nWhen it comes to main charter Hachiman, he is a breath of fresh ear if you are used to the generic Japanese high schooler template that may series use nowadays.  Becuase What makes Hachiman so great as a character is that he has a personality that you can define and isn't a just a blank self-insert.\\n\r\nHe is this cynical,  anti-social asshole that just doesn't give a fuck, and what him really interesting as a character is that despite the zero fucks personality. There is a part of him that does care for people, it's just most people misunderstand his intentions. Becuase Hachiman is basically an anti-hero in a way because he is willing to shower the burdens of being hated in order to shit done.\\n\r\nI feel as far as teenage characters go Hachiman is very feel written for what he is, at times he feels almost human in a way instead of being this cardboard cutout.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the other members of the service club Yukino and Yui.\\n\r\nEven though their personality is kinda standard fare, there is a lot more depth added to them and a lot more thought put into them so they come off charming than anything else. But besides that there not really that memorable when compared to Hachiman.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters are in the same boat as Yukino and Yui but worse.\\n\r\nTheir personalities are really watered down even if there is a tad bit of depth to them. I don't remember their names and I will forget they even exist within a week because I found them so boring. \\n\\n\r\nNow I will say that the dialogue and interactions between the charters are a lot more intriguing than the actual charters themselves. Because this series likes to dive into social interactions into more depth and thought than most series of its genre. For an example, there is a scene where characters could seem happy on the outside, but inside there really angry and are dropping this passive aggressive comments. Which I liked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, 6/10\\n\r\nThe animation runs quite smoothly and the art keeps up a decent quality,\\n\r\nBut background looks like they were painted on at times. Of course, the second season lessens these issues I have to a degree with everything looking a lot more polished and slighty more detailed.\\n\r\nArt style is basic and the character designs are pretty standard fare, but I will say that the main charter little sister would look really great in some doujins though.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound, 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe first oping song was pretty good, but everything else hoping and ending wise was kinda lacklustre at best. There nice to listen  to i guess but they didnt really get my interest. The ost was done my some japanese music studio named MoNaca who have some very fumous people under them  like for example keiichi okabe, satoru kosaki and kakeru ishihama who from who i can gather so far  was the main dude behind the ost for this series.  Its not that bad of an ost to listain its just nothing really got my interest and make me feel like woh i need to download this and listain to it over and over again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSo when it comes to enjoyment, i enjoyed this seruies for what it was and i have even got 10 volumes  of the light novel. I think what really got me into this series it that it actually tries to provide some sort of thought-provoking content, which is very impressive for a series that is about high school bullshit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 6/10\\n\r\nIf you like romantic comedies I would say that my romantic comedy snafu is worth at least checking out, because it tries a lot harder than most of its genre. Which I think the effort alone should be prised to some degree But that doesn't mean it is the masterpiece that some people would claim it to be.\\n\r\n Because it is highly limited in what it can do because of the high school setting, if its setting was in college or maybe the Japanese workplace it would properly have a lot more impact in its social commentary and it could talk about more things.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Here we go again with another Rom-Com series. It's going to be another one of those cliche and usual shenanigans that we see commonly. I see why it's not recommended or overrated by most of the community cause it's probably something that we've already seen already. Episode one, aha... let's see yeah seems typical.. the main character is only a bit bitter yeah.. so that's it? Hmmm... well ok.. I'm sure he's going to be in a Rom-Com situation soon.. \r\nFew minutes in... and ahh.. it seems the story is taking a bit slow.. but I know I feel those cliche moments coming anytime now....\\n\\n\r\nMore minutes in.... Ohh there it is... wait.. no.. that's not it.. well that was unexpected but I'm sure the cliche plot is gonna happen soon.. maybe in the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nFew episodes later... why does it seem like something on and off or something like that? This doesn't feel like Rom-Com.. Why is there so much heavy thinking? Why is the main character and other heroine too bitter with life? Isn't this Rom-Com? \\n\\n\r\nWell my fellow viewers, it is high time to start with the actual review. You see, it's never good to judge a series based on the cover or synopsis. The synopsis is correct but I think there's more to that. Yeah this series with a dastardly long name seems different from other related series of the same genre. Recently I have seen a lot of happy-go-lucky Rom-Coms so I was still adjusting while in the midst of watching this series. The usual shenanigans and tropes of the cliche Rom-Com genre are nowhere to be found here. Though there may be some parts related to those, the most you can get out of is only a glimpse of it. Though, paying attention to what the characters say is probably what you should do for this series cause those are the main points of the plot. The story is a bit of a rollercoaster or maybe just a train so I guess you'll have to see for yourself what I'm trying to point out here. \\n\r\nThe art is decent that's probably what I can say about it cause there isn't anything too special or too bright about the illustrations and backgrounds. \\n\r\nThe sound is just right and not too upbeat for the theme. The characters are unique. First I have seen psychological characters in the Rom-Com genre. Though bitter as they may be, their development is excellent and that adds points to my book. From my point of view, I think this is not a series that is meant to be enjoyed from the start to the end. It's something that develops throughout the series so you have to be patient and watch it thoroughly. I enjoyed the last parts of this season so maybe it was worth watching after all. This is my review for the first season and I'm maybe looking forward to the improvements on the next one.",

            "content": "\"If you can't get along without putting someone else down, it can't be real friendship.\"\r\nI think most people\u2019s high school experiences were pretty much similar. Sure, there\u2019ll be exceptions, but a majority were probably loners, who either kept to themselves or kept up a \u201cfacade\u201d to hide their \u201ctrue self\u201d among their \u201cfriends\u201d; or maybe they were the type who would try to associate themselves with the \u201cright people\u201d, not caring who they\u2019d step on as they climbed towards popularity.\r\nOregairu kind of deals with these things, in it\u2019s own little way, making comments on how humans interact, and how society works...\r\nStory: (7 / 10)\r\nThe seriesstarts out with our MC, Hikigaya, being forced to join a \u201cVolunteer Service\u201d club, in order to change his view on society, or even his entire personality, and this is where he\u2019ll meet the other main characters of the show.\\n\\n\r\nFrom here on, however, the anime is basically episodic, dealing with whatever request the club receives, or simply about what the characters do on their off-days.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the time, it\u2019ll all revolve around (or atleast come down to) how Hikigaya is able to meet and communicate with other people, as this is somewhat of a pretense for the series.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, even if there are moments where he is shown developing a sort of friendship, and changing himself, it\u2019s also somewhat \u201cdropped\u201d, as he often explains that there\u2019s nothing wrong with solitude, and nobody should have to change who they are.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I thought the contents of each episode was rather good, whether it was about going shopping, playing tennis, or baking, it was done in such a way that it\u2019d be kept interesting, which is (obviously) important in an episodic anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (7 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nI thought the overall art quality was pretty good, although nothing amazing. Character designs are also very good (and oh god pigtails), though I sometimes thought the side-characters could look a little bland. Still, it\u2019s not really a big problem, and is easily overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I\u2019ve come to expect in anything involving lots of girls of any shape or size, is obviously fanservice. However, there isn\u2019t really much of that to find here... Sure, there are some slightly oversized body parts here and there, and of course there\u2019s the swimsuit scenes, but it\u2019s really nothing obscene, which I thought was nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (7 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nI thought the voice actors did a very good job in portraying their respective characters; Hikigaya as a cynical loner, Yukino as a sort of cold \u201cknow-it-all\u201d, Yui as the innocent cute girl, etc.\\n\\n\r\nIt really does add a lot when you\u2019re able to provide such personalities without say, needless screaming and constant exaggeration for the cute girl.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, well I personally didn\u2019t like the opening or ending themes all that much, because they were either not really my thing, or I didn\u2019t really like the singers. However, I have to say that the background music was very well made, and it all fit very well with the anime overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (9 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nSo, this is where this series really shines. Relying heavily on its \u201ccynical, loner\u201d main character, it makes for a very relatable experience (at least for a lot of high school boys, I\u2019d say).\\n\\n\r\nInstead of your typical friendly, \u201cwants to help everyone\u201d type of character, you have one who\u2019d rather not get involved, and looks down on society, and the way it does things.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, you have several other, rather fleshed out characters, who all interact with the MC in different ways, and this is what really makes the anime. It\u2019s not the complex story or the amazing artwork; It\u2019s the interactions between all the different personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThey really did a great job in portraying a lot of common \u201chigh school personalities\u201d, I think, and while not many characters get much character development at all, it\u2019s really not needed to make it an enjoyable experience. In fact, it fits rather well with the theme of \u201cone shouldn\u2019t have to change just to fit it in\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nAlthough sort of slow at times, this was a really enjoyable show. The characters make for a very relatable setting, the music was good, and it had its fair share of funny moments.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, two major complaints I have are that first of all, this is said to be a rom-com, yet it barely focus on any romance at all. Sure, it\u2019s obvious that some characters feel a certain way, but it often seems pretty one-sided, and most of the \u201clove\u201d from the MC seems to be directed at this cute little guy instead, which ofcourse makes for funny moments, but doesn\u2019t help a lot in the romance department.\\n\\n\r\nMy other complaint was the final episode. I understand that it might be hard to wrap up a series in which there isn\u2019t really any sort of story to wrap up, but seriously, the last episode didn\u2019t have any form of closure at all.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, it actually felt like more of a filler episode, which they just kinda realised they had lying around, but had forgot to release...",

            "content": "Before starting My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU (which I will shorten to Oregairu for the remainder of this review), its name and the synopsis given here on MAL made this anime sound like a typical harem romantic comedy that combines a generic storyline with overused jokes - at least in my opinion - despite the lack of a harem tag. What a surprise it was to me after the first few episodes when I realized that Oregairu was different and much better than I had anticipated - despite not having much of the romance and comedy as suggested by the title.\r\nNOTE: This will probably bea review of both the first and second seasons since they essentially remain the same aside from the shift of the main focus from the first to second season.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with high school loser loner Hachiman Hikigaya who is forced into joining the Services Club which aids students when they need it - and whose only member is the extremely gifted and beautiful but antisocial Yukino Yukinoshita - by his teacher, and in my opinion, parent-like figure Shizuka Hiratsuka in order to help him remedy his broken social skills. Their first request for help comes from Yui Yuigahama, who eventually joins the club, and it is through this first request, that it was made apparent to me that Oregairu was better than your typical rom com.\\n\\n\r\nOregairu doesn't tend to focus on comedy, yet still remaining hilarious, nor does it focus on romance, yet always hinting to us the possibility of a relationship. Instead, it focuses heavily on more complex issues of friendship and human behavior - which often isn't explored in very many anime - often putting the characters in realistic situations in which they have to make decisions about such issues, and giving us a taste of the thought process and psychology behind Hikigaya's seemingly cold and detached exterior, which is pretty realistic (trust me, I experienced it for a while myself).\\n\\n\r\nOregairu explores these topics extremely well while telling us an engrossing story of how our three protagonists in Yui, Hikigaya, and Yukino help other students with whatever problems they might have, despite occasionally clashing in how they want to achieve it, an issue which is the main focus of the second season.\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to praise the boisterous subtlety of this anime. Though what I just said may sound oxymoronic, this anime does a fantastic job of telling us a story that is deeper than what it actually appears to be, without having to state the complete obvious, an unfortunate problem I find happens with many anime. However, and this being the only problem I found with the anime, this subtlety does border on cryptic in that at times, and especially during the second season, I could not for the life of me comprehend what the characters were implying during some of their conversations until I had read the episode synopsis on Wikipedia.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus, on this more subtler note is how the relationship between the three characters develops, and by the end of the second season, during which the development of their relationship is explored on a much more prominent note, it brought a tear to my eye when I saw just how much closer they had gotten as friends, despite the rocky paths they went through to to get to that point.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of this brilliant development in their relationships can be attributed to the strong development in their individual characters, which is, again, pretty subtle for most characters.\\n\\n\r\nHikigaya's development is the most evident, provided he is the main character. For the entirety of the first season and for part of the second, Hikigaya pretty much sees his inclusion in the Services Club as some sort of punishment imposed on him by Shizuka - as seen by the unorthodox and self-harmful manner in which he solves peoples' problems - but eventually begins to open up to the other members - essentially going from happily being the loneliest and most detached guy in the world to actually desiring friends like Yui and Yukino, who both end up caring very much for him despite his constant skepticism regarding their relationships, even if it means having to suffer.\\n\\n\r\nMore subtle are Yui's and Yukino's developments, both of whom open up very slowly to each other. Yui tries to act cheerful and constantly put on a smile, something which is completely forced at the beginning and slowly becomes less and less forced as the anime continues. Meanwhile, Yukino's past and her present are pretty much shrouded in mystery, one huge driving factor in her development, and which is constantly emphasized by her seemingly bitch of an older sister, Haruno. And yet her subtle and eventually apparent inclination to try and open her heart to Yui and Hikigaya towards the end of the second season really highlights the struggle that each character suffers to make their friendships \"real\".\\n\\n\r\nAnd it isn't just the trio of main characters who should be praised but also the large cast of supporting characters - though I have to say I'm not a fan of the few who are there essentially for comedic effect like Saika Totsuka, the guy with the appearance of a girl, Hina Ebina, the girl with the homosexual fantasies, or Yoshiteru Zaimozuka, the guy who suffers from chuunibyou. On the other hand, there are characters like Hayama Hayato, the ace of the soccer team and who everyone has high expectations of, Shizuka, the teacher and parent-like figure who really seems to hurt whenever she sees Hikigaya do damage to his own reputation and feelings, or Komachi, Hikigaya's lively and adorable little sister. Whether these supporting characters receive development or not, they highlight some of the problems facing our main trio and really drive the story and their friendships forward throughout the anime, and for the most part are really like-able.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't got much to say about Oregairu's art or sound. For the most part the art was really detailed and looked pretty darn nice, the background music suited their respective scenes, and the openings and closings are pretty freaking amazing (it's a shame I can only find the second season opening on YouTube).\\n\\n\r\nOregairu is a personal favorite, possibly being a top 5 or 10 anime for me. It definitely surpassed any low expectations I had for it, dragging me into a story which really had my full attention from start to finish as I desperately wanted to see Yui, Yukino, and Hikigaya truly become friends. I would laugh when Yukino made insulting comments about Hikigaya or when Hikigaya would instinctively say something to himself based on his own past experiences. Oregairu requires you utmost attention, particularly in the second season, when you have to infer what the characters are implying during their conversations. I absolutely adore this anime and though everything I've said in this review may be due to bias on my part (I sincerely hope other people also share my views), I strongly recommend everyone gives Oregairu a try.\\n\\n\r\nAny feedback on my reviews is much appreciated! Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "Favorite Quote: \"Hard work betrays none,  but dreams betray many.\" -Hachiman Hikigaya\r\nThat quote is one of my favorite quotes spoken by an anime character.  I personally believe that this is somewhat true for alot of us.  So before I would like to go on with my review, I was never a fan of the romantic comedy genre.  I always thought of them as being cheesy and painfully predictable.  However, Yahari Ore no Seishun definitely took me by surprise.  Here's some of the main reasons why I believe this anime is such a masterpiece.\r\nStory: The main storyline can be prettymuch summed up in the anime description.  Initially, when reading the summary I felt it was gonna be a very generic, but I realized the romance in this series isn't thrown s right into your face from the very beginning.  To be more precise, the romance is pretty light in the  entire series.  There are only hints of romance between character now and then.  Overall, the anime does a fantastic job of romance through the services completed in the club.  I thought this was a really cool idea to implement rather than simply throwing the obvious romance to the audience.  This allows the romance to develop at a great pace and makes us wonder who the main character will fall for if any.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: There wasn't anything particularly unusual about the art.  I thought everything was pretty well done, nothing out of the ordinary in this anime.  I liked the colors that were used in the opening theme and for the ending as well.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: I loved the opening theme and the ending theme alot when I watched the series.  In my opinion, the ending theme sort of explains the complications of the romance that is experienced throughout the anime.  The OSTs played during each segment also made it very comical and enjoyable to watch.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in this series was what intrigued me the most.  I found the characters very unique, interesting, realistic throughout the series.  For those new to the anime you might be wondering how are the characters different from other romantic comedy series?  To respond to this, I would say that the main character in this series was what made it so unique.  He isn't the boring, dull, and extremely dense type of person, but actually the complete opposite.  In fact, I would say confidently that he is well aware of the ongoing romance, society, and his overall environment.  What makes it even more interesting is his ability to think very critically about others and situations presented at the moment.  Not only is it very critical, but the way he says it in his thoughts makes it way more engaging and realistic.  Alot of characters in romantic comedies cannot do this.   I understand that it has to do with the writing of the developers, but it was done very well.  This anime also perfectly illustrates, in my opinion, the different kinds of people there are in the world.  From socially distant type people to arrogant ones this series has it all.  Excellent pacing for character development made characters extremely likeable and it made you feel as if you can identify with some of them.  It also made room for characters to change their initial attitudes as the series progressed.  In my case, I identified perfectly with the main characters point of view and philosophies. \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nMy Opinion: It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.  Batman can be related to the main character. Throughout of the series, I find that the he is a kind hearted person, but he isn't concerned about that.  I feel what he is concerned about is the society around him and how it is pretty messed up according to him.  As someone who holds similar viewpoints as the main character, it is one of the reasons why I really appreciated this romantic comedy masterpiece.  This show has tons of comedy, a bit of romance, and tons of theories and philosophies about life.  I fully recommend watching this anime not just for the romance, but for what it can offer to us as humans.  Seriously, this anime actually got me saying \"yeah that's true\" alot times and \"hey the main character is actually right, it's so true about what he said about people and society.\"  Yahari Ore no Seishun wouldn't be on my top five best romcoms of all time, it would fall in my top five of all time.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was helpful for you guys.  Thank you for reading and I hope you guys will enjoy it as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 10/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Slice of life/Romcom anime seem to always follow the same layout. It was honestly a genre that I started to get bored. Apart from the very few unique anime in that genre I didnt care for the majority. Then Yahari came along, which breaks all stereotypes of the SOL/RomCom genre. You have a MC who seems like he couldnt care less about others and he doesnt fall head over heels over any of the girls. Hachiman might be one of the best MC's to ever hit this genre, along with an amazing cast of characters, Yukino who in some ways is like Hachiman in thatthey distant themselves away from everybody but they still conflict again each other. Yui who breaks the tense moments with her bubbly, over the top personality. And lets not forget about the supporting cast, Saika who everyone loves. Theres not one thing you can dislike about him. Everytime him and Hachiman are on the same scene you can expect some laughs. Komachi, Hachiman's little sister who at the beginning is probably the only person that cares about her brother. Even if she pokes fun at him, she still cares very deeply about him. And last but not lease, the sensei, much like Komachi, cares about Hachiman but shows it in a way more aggressive manner (by punching hachiman a few times). An anime with an amazing cast that breaks most stereotypes, good music, and of course Hachiman's monologues which are incredibly easy to relate to especially if at any point in your life you might of considered yourself a loner. This anime ended in a open ended manner. it was a satisfying ending but you still wanted more. Luckily there will be more novels, and maybe in a year or two, we'll see a season 2 and see a final conclusion to this amazing and unique SOL/RomCom",

Another school settings life anime besides Hyouka I've been enjoyed so far! \r\nOregairu brings you to see a totally 'nother point of view about society and reality behind them. I really am impressed by how Hikki solved all the problems by his own way. He always tells the truth, it's all for the sake of that people, he never care (or almost get used to) getting hurt. In the few first eps you will feel that what he's doing is rather stupid. Who wants to make yourself a scapegoat for other's sake ? but then along the story I came inlove with him! \"He's, like, a nice guy\", yes and that's why it hurts seeing him got hurt.\\n\r\nThat, about Hikki but all the characters sticks to their own impression till the end! The personalities are all interesting, getting offered by such a beautiful relationships among all the possibilities can be happen between them is what makes me happy the most! It's very natural and almost feel like reality, no unnecessary cliche!\\n\\n\r\nThe story plot is also amazing! perfect, neat,simple and flawless! everything gone smoothly and felt like the way it is! I never get bored at all when watching the entire eps!\\n\\n\r\nI really wish it to be on second season soon. Totally recommended to watch!\\n",

            "content": "Probably the most surprising anime I've watched in a long time. And I just recently finished Higurashi so that should mean something.\r\nAs a strict shunner of the harem genre, any anime with a \"so-and-so best girl\" mantra is one that I do not want to be any part of. And oh boy were there a fair share of hints eagerly putting me off \u2013 the generic looking poster of a guy standing behind two girls of different archetypes, the synopsis: Romantic comedy? An edgy, lethargic loner? Forced into a club with the PRETTIEST GIRL IN SCHOOL? Dear Lord.\r\nWho knows what it was that drove meto check out that first episode, but whatever it was, I'm kinda grateful.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you have a protagonist so cynical that he points out a godawful romcom clich\u00e9 the moment the viewer notices it, you know the series is going to have a healthy dose of self-awareness. Then, the series even takes a step further, becoming so sardonic it turns into brutal honesty. So in additon to the entertaining interactions amongst an amusing cast and its mellow slice-of-life tone, there is a bitterly candid and unapologetically blunt narrative on society.\\n\\n\r\nSo, no, this series is certainly not a harem, or at least not the brand of atrocity we've linked the term with. It is very much a comedy, with a few romantic (borderline josei) elements, none of which bog the pacing. The romance doesn't really get anywhere until the 2nd season, where even then it's barely prevalent.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is, thankfully, not the 2edgy4u people-hater he's made out to be. He's simply a slightly pessimistic wallflower, but at all times conscious of himself and his surroundings. And a lot of the characters actually have a third dimension! Some depth! Cancelling out what is undoubtedly the greatest vice of most love triangle centred anime \u2013 the need for appealing characters, not interesting ones. Although many side characters are admittedly not as fleshed out (in the first season), they do well in their role as societal representations. All in all, it's a pretty engrossing show with some ...genuine... laugh out loud moments.\\n\\n\r\nBonus: Episode 11 has what is very likely the greatest clapback in anime history",

            "content": "It's really sad to see that this anime is simply flying over people's head just because they think this is going to be a typical rom-com anime that we have seen over a hundred times. I can assure you that it's not. \r\n(There will be SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (8/10) (SPOILERS)\r\nHikigaya Hachiman, an anti-social and a loner high school student is forced by his teacher to join the Service/Volunteers Club. There, he meets Yukino Yukinoshita who is also a loner but for a different reason and Yui Yuigahama, an extremely energetic and cheerful girl. \r\nThis is probably one of the major reasons why some ormost people skipped this anime. This anime doesn\u2019t have romance..At least, for the first season. It doesn\u2019t even focus on romance at all. So if you\u2019re expecting an anime like Toradora where the 2 characters get together and starts dating then this is not the anime for you. I'm a big fan of romance anime but I still love both seasons of this show, even though the romance wasn't really there.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is not your typical Rom-Com anime. It didn't even feel like a Rom-Com anime. It felt like a slice-of-life show....a different kind of slice-of-life show. The show mostly focuses on the members of the Service Club helpi.........trying to help out other characters' problems like Hachiman and Yukinon teaching Yui how to bake cookies or volunte.......being forced to volunteer at a summer camp along with their classmates. \\n\\n\r\nThat's just the outer layer of the show. What makes the show really unique and interesting is the inner layer. What's this inner layer you ask? Hachiman's view on society that's almost realistic and his monologues that deals with interesting issues in our life. I've been a loner myself (4 years ago) and half of Hachiman's monologues are true like how he talks about social hierarchy in today's youth or how girls are nice to you but in reality, they just don't care. Unfortunately, I've experienced these moments myself...Especially the latter. The other half contains Hachiman's hilarious (and sometimes ridiculous) monologues. \\n\\n\r\nI did say that the show \"mostly\" focuses on the members of the Service Club right? Of course, I did..The show ALSO focuses on the character interaction between the members of the Service Club (i.e Hachiman and Yuki spouting some ideological crap at each other, etc.). No love triangle here though....\\n\\n\r\nI can tell you right now that the show moves at an incredibly snail pacing in terms of romance. The show's pacing itself is fine but if you're expecting the characters to start realizing their feelings towards each other in like 13 episodes then you've got the wrong anime. That doesn't even occur until the Second Season. Hell, none of them starts dating at the Second Season...I won't spoil anymore contents from the Second Season. \\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, I now want to focus on the comedy part of the show. In short, the show is extremely funny...but then again, it all depends on the person's sense of humour. As someone who has a great sense of humour, I can tell for the fact that the show really is funny. There's a bunch of reasons why I found the show extremely hilarious. Firstly, Hachiman knows fully well how rom-com moments goes so when he see's one, he doesn't fall for it. On the other hand, the gods of rom-com constantly puts him in what seems to be situations that you only see in Romantic Comedies..For this reason, he curses the gods of rom-com. I love how I wrote that sentence..That one definitely scored high in my book. \\n\r\nMy point here is the show doesn't have one of those romantic comedy cliches that you usually see these days. The show, or rather Hachiman instead makes fun of those cliches. I did spot one cliche where Hachiman walked in the club room and saw the girls changing. This was, however, used as a joke. Or in Hachiman's words \"Now this is how romantic comedies should be\". \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, there are loads of Yaoi (Boys Love) moments here. They are obviously only used as a joke. Let me tell you right now, I'm a straight person who likes girls. I'm not a gay person, therefore..I completely abhor Yaoi anime shows. For whatever weird reason though, I \"secretly\" enjoyed the Yaoi moments. I also *ahem* \"secretly\" ship Totsuka and Hachiman. Hachiman's monologues and how he reacts when Totsuka is around him makes the Yaoi scenes even funnier. There's also that female character named \"Ebina\" who is a big fan of Yaoi. I like her...she ships the main characters (i.e Hiki x Hayato, etc.) and she has passion. She also adds a bit of hilarity to the show. \\n\\n\r\nBy episode 9 or 10, the show starts to get serious and the show's atmosphere will continue on towards the entirety of Season 2. So if that's what you were expecting then you will love the late 2nd half of the first season and season 2. Revealing more will take me another paragraph so I just want to stop here.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________ \\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (7.5/10)\\n\r\nThe show's animation is not the greatest but it is fairly average. I didn't have any problems with the environment or how the surrounding areas look. I did have some minor issue with the character design though. They lack details and most of their eyes just looks so big and out of place...I can't really explain it properly. The characters are not joking when they said that Hachiman's eyes looks like the eye of a dead fish. It really does. Whatever, I got used to the character design in like 2-3 episodes. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe show did a pretty good job on the soundtrack department. The theme that usually plays in the background fits really well depending on the show's mood and atmosphere. Now the OP and ED theme song(s).\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Yukitoki\" by Nagi Yanagi and the ED theme song is \"Hello Alone\" by Yukino and Yui. The ED theme song has 2 variants. First is the Ballade version sung by Yui and the second is the Band Arrange version sung by the same two characters. I like the Opening theme song. The singer's voice sounds great and the song itself is pretty catchy. I also love the ED theme song and in my opinion, it is a lot better than the OP theme song.  The variants also sounds great..2nd variant being the best out of the two. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9.5/10) (SPOILERS)\\n\r\n\"A Hayo x Hachi is a must buy...No, a must GAY! -Hina Ebina\\n\\n\r\nNow this is where the show truly shined...The characters. There were a lot of characters introduced in the show but most of them weren't introduced all in one episode. It was across the first half of the series and the way they are introduced is if they have a request that needs attention then they go to the Service Club. I mean, that's how Yui Yuigahama or that guy who has an eight-grade syndrome got introduced. Anyways, here's my opinion on some of the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nHikigaya Hachiman, a self-proclaimed loner and an anti-social high school teen. Being a loner is nothing new in anime. In fact, it's overused. A bad-ass loner seems to be a hit in anime today for whatever reason. Hachiman is a different kind of loner and he's someone that you should focus on. The ideals that he spouts out are somewhat realistic and I actually share some of those ideals. He avoids social situations whenever he can and he's not an idiotic pervert like most of the protagonists these days. His monologues are also pretty damn hilarious and dare I say..insightful? The guy really understands how youth works. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Yukino Yukinoshita, a loner but for a different reason. She simply doesn't want friends. She's a smart, extremely talented girl and belongs to a rich family. Whenever someone wants to argue with her (in this case, the arguments between Yukino and Hachiman) then they better give up the second they start because she doesn't hold her tongue back. She's also a funny sarcastic girl. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Yui Yuigahama, an energetic, cheerful and talkative high school girl. Unlike Yukino and Hachiman, she's not a loner. She's outgoing and she socializes all the time with her peers. She's actually the main driving force of the club..Otherwise, the club would be boring or it would contain repetitive arguments between Yukino and Hachiman. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the rest of the side characters.. In my opinion, they're great. It adds variety to the show's cast and their personalities are all great..even though they all have cliched personalities. For example, Hayama is the most famous guy on the school and is \"nice\" towards everyone. I put a quote on the word \"nice\" for a reason. Another example is one of Hayama's friend, Yumiko. She has that \"whatev's\" personality that you see in most characters these days who thinks they are all \"high and mighty\". \\n\\n\r\nI really love the show's character progression and development. Just by watching the entirety of the first season, you will see the main and side characters change..from huge changes to small changes. Most noticeably is Hachiman's changes. He's still the same ol' loner but what's different is how he looks towards his friends and peers. Especially Yukino and Yui. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed this anime. It's something new and fresh. It's also different than your typical rom-com animes. Hachiman's monologues and his interactions with some of the characters added hilarity to the show. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU\" or SNAFU (Oregairu) for short is a Romantic-Comedy anime that should not be skipped nor missed. It's different than your typical rom-com, the characters are great, fleshed out, and their actions are believable and the comedy is hilarious. The show also doesn't have one of those rom-com cliches like a protagonist tripping and falling on top of the main girl, boob grabbing, and the fanservice is either kept to a minimum or is non-existent. The only downside to this show is its inconclusive ending. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Not your typical Romantic Comedy show\\n\r\n+Tons of Funny Moments\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Great OP and ED theme song\\n\r\n+Character's actions are believable\\n\r\n+Hachiman and his monologues\\n\r\n+Contains no Rom-Com cliches\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Mediocre Character Design\\n\r\n-Inconclusive Ending",

            "content": "Ever wonder about what is real life for people going to school  and that arent popular?. This anime shows basically how the society creates the difference between those who are truly kind and those who pretends to fit into the it. The characters are some of the most fun parts in this anime specially with hikigaya Hachiman and his more or less real perspective of how people creates their own societies or packs in at school. Also his , one might say counterpart Yukino Yoshita who has similar views to hikigaya but has different solutions to them than Hikigaya. Combine the fun characters andstory with a good music that always gives of the right feeling then what is there not to like. Granted if you were popular through school this anime might sound wrong for you but it might also give you the other perspective. Basically this anime has some general good points that certain people in the world are too kind for too many of the bad/lousy people in it. \\n\\n\r\nTo my conclusion this is an anime with a realistic and funny view which i can find nothing bad with only that within it they still manage to put some of the relative cheesy love triangle. Other than that this is a must watch in my opinion since its unique and funny in its conspect and character creation.",

            "content": "Now, when this show was aired back in 2013, I REALLY thought it was going to be a generic RomCom. Why was this the case? Well, if a story revolved around a high school student who was forced into a club by his teacher, and ends up meeting a ice-cold beauty who is the president of said club, who wouldn't think this was a gonna be another RomCom. However, that said, this show really blew away my expectations and eventually became my personal favorite title.\r\nStory - 8\r\nAs said previously, this shows revolves around the members of the \"Service Club\", Hikigaya Hachiman, a loner who loathesthe idea of \"youth\" as he is affixed that it is a lie. Yukino Yukinoshita, an intelligent, seemingly perfect, beauty who is cold and brutally honest, and the last member being Yui Yuigahama, a girl who is seemingly all sunshine and rainbows. Together, they help people who come to the club with their issues. Now, this already sounds generic with this premise of the plot revolving around a club being run down to the ground with whats atop of my head right now, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumya, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, Gj-Bu and many other series that I am not gonna mention that revolve around a club. However, what this series does that defies the stereotypical is the characters. Even though all the club does is solve problems, what makes it entertaining is how they do it and come to that point. If it were any stereotypical protagonist, I wouldn't enjoy the show as much as I would have. But with Hikigaya Hachiman along with his viewpoint of the world, makes it entertaining. One thing to take note however, is that the series does not proceed to make the romance as major plot point in the series, as that is what would normally be expected in a RomCom. The romance is certainly is there and can be seen, but it is more of a sub-plot point and doesn't make a big deal out of this, but more rather, focusing more on the cast and their chemistry all together rather than 2 people. I sorta wish that they give that more focus, but it still was great either way.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe art is really distinctive among other RomComs I have watched due to Hikigaya's prominent feature, his fish eyes. The show's art is really nothing special but it it got the job done and that it suited the series very well, with it's vibrant and radiant colours and immediately changes it's tone very easily when Hikigaya delves into his monologues.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nI definitely liked the OST as it the situation the characters were in whether it was a dramatic moment, or if it was a moment of it's routine based comedy, and yet entertaining moments among the cast, the soundtrack did it's justice for the series. The voice actors were also chosen really well, with Hikigaya Hachiman being voiced by Takuya Eguchi, who played him very well, especially when it came down it the monologues, he portrayed the character really well when I compare it to the Light Novel. Nao Touyama and Hayami Saori also did a great job with their respective characters, Nao Touyama voicing Yui and Hayami Saori voicing Yukino.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the characters that had been written in this series with them being written more realistically then what is stated in the synopsis. \\n\\n\r\nWith Hikigaya Hachiman, he is probably the most relateable character and the most realistic I have seen, and without him, this show wouldn't be that good. His cynical and pessimistic mindset of society is always entertaining and yet, it contains truth among the words that he speaks. It truly kept me wanting for more as I hear more dark, truthful and humorous comments about society. The interactions he has is humorous and fun to watch, especially when he is in the club with it's members, being one of the best chemistry between a trio ever.\\n\r\nYukino more or less counteracts Hikigaya's personality as they both have opposing ideals. However, this makes their interactions more interesting as they both continuously both exchange their own verbal fists against one another. To see who's ideology is better. \\n\r\nThere is not much to say about Yui, but I really liked her character as well, although she was the least prominent member out of the trio. However, she plays a vital role amongst Hikigaya and Yukino as she is the glue the holds the club together and without her, they will more or less argue until one other wears each other out.\\n\r\nEven though there is some amounts of development, it certainly was there as Yukino steadily broke her icy shell, Yui became more independent and at the end of the series, Hikigaya started to grow more fond of the interactions that he is involved with Yui and Yukino, no matter how pointless it seemed. \\n\r\nEven the side characters, such as the delusional otaku, Zaimokuza, gender ambiguous Totsuka and The Joker of Hikigaya, Haruno, was very entertaining to watch, as they interact with Hikigaya and the club members and their reactions towards each person.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nOverall, I was always hoping to come back for more as having to see this club continue with its pointless and yet oddly charming interactions were fun . I always liked having a good cast in any anime, and this certainly did what I wanted fulfilled. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nThe series could've done with it's animation and done a little more with the plot, but what totally threw all that out of the bus was the characters that had been realistically written, which I had enjoyed throughout the series. This show was definitely not your stereotypical romantic comedy that throws the norm out of the window, which I personally think is a spectacle. This show would definitely be recommended to people who wish for a different spin on the romantic comedy genre and for people who loves anime that is dialogue-heavy instead of the shounens.",

            "content": "This series is unlike any RomCom I\u2019ve seen, instead of making the protagonist change their actions in order to appeal more to the viewer the protagonist slowly grows on you and I found myself not wanting him to change because I liked him just the way he was. \r\n\tThis series stayed light and comical till the last episode. With a bit of Shounen Ai humor and some awesome pessimistic quotes from Hikigaya I don\u2019t think the series could have improved its comedy even if it tried. \r\n\tThe characters all had complex personalities and ideals that really made me stop and ponder instead of just staringat the screen like a zombie. The views that Hikigaya possessed were both refreshing and oddly enough, correct (most of the time). The simple fact that Hikigaya is able to read between the lines and stay detached from the mainstream of society was exciting and thought provoking. \\n\r\n\tWhile Hikigaya comes across as harsh, pessimistic, anti-social, and unfeeling he\u2019s actually quite sensitive and caring. He frequently sacrifices himself in order to help improve the way others think, defuse a situation, or fulfill a request. While his methods seem overly harsh he employs the method of \u201ccommon enemy\u201d in order to unite his classmates and strengthen relationships regardless of how much it actually hurts him. Truly this is one of the most intriguing characters I have ever had the pleasure to watch. \t\\n\r\n\tThe OP and ED were both fun and lively just like the series. The VCs were also excellent and the animation was bright and fit the flow of the series well. The witty dialogue between characters was comical while still retaining the ability to make you really think about what they were discussing. \\n\r\n\tOverall I really enjoyed this series and would recommend it to anyone who likes RomComs. I can\u2019t say the same for the second season so if you really enjoyed this series and have a happy end of series hangover I would refrain from watching the second season.

Or if you prefer to stick with me keep reading:\r\nIt starts off with a premise similar to Haganai, but is completely different. To start off, it's not harem. Also it's way more serious. Primary reason why this is awesome is clever character dialogue, and a touch of philosophy. Story-wise it's quite ordinary high school stuff, but it's characters and their personalities being clever that make this stand out, and that make it really enjoyable. Relatable protagonist and plot also help, but that's assuming you weren'tthe popular kid in class. OP/ED are great. There's definitely hints of romance being thrown around. Though with ''romantic'' being part of the title, one could expect a bit more romance overall, or if not that, then at least that show would be more oriented towards resolving those tensions in more fulfilling way. However, this was based on an ongoing LN so it's understandable.",

            "content": "Let me start by saying that Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. or Oregairu for short, does many things right. Coming out of the show, you know that what you\u2019ve just watched was a cut above the typical rom-com you expected. Why? Well, that\u2019s easy\u2014because of the unique cast of characters that can be found within Oregairu.\r\nIn particular, it is Hikigaya Hachiman who deserves the MVP award. It is through him and his fantastically cynical inner monologues that we are granted a much more realistic, and therefore relatable perspective on youth. Time and time again, anime gives us these clich\u00e9d protagonists, whose idiocyhas us screaming at the screen. Well, not this time, as unlike with those guys, Hikigaya actually says what you are thinking, which can be truly rewarding to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not just Hikigaya who\u2019s worthy of praise. Sure, some of the characters definitely play up to anime tropes more than some would like, but others, such as the minor antagonists (Miura Yumiko and Salami Minami) are very true to people we have all encountered in our everyday lives. At some point, we have all met people who are unnecessarily mean to others, or who use other people for their own personal gain, so the way in which this show handles and punishes such characters is incredibly satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nIn relation to the story, art, and sound, they were all good in their own rights. The story might not have wrapped everything up, and it may have been littered with the standard scenarios (the vacation episode, the test of courage, and the cultural festival) that we\u2019ve all seen a hundred times before, but it was never once a chore to sit through, and that's because of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in particular was nice and colourful, with character designs that were fittingly appropriate. At times, there were noticeable drops in animation quality, but they were never enough to detract from my enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, the OP and ED did their jobs amicably, even if they were never personally memorable. The OST on the other hand was used very effectively, with Episode 5, during Hikigaya\u2019s inner monologue about \u2018nice girls\u2019 being a prime and touching example.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pick one flaw with Oregairu, it would have to relate to the consistency of its realism. What I mean by that is that whilst the show handles a lot of serious issues brilliantly, I couldn\u2019t help but feel like it played it safe on others\u2014in particular: romance. It honestly felt like a step back to the clich\u00e9d protagonists of lesser shows, when Hikigaya fails to acknowledge how he feels about a girl he knows likes him, but I digress. I\u2019m simply nitpicking.\\n\\n\r\nIn truth, I would recommend Oregairu to anybody. Whilst it may conform to well-trodden anime conventions in places, it still stands high on the shoulders of other high school-based dramas. So much so, that I may have to revaluate some of my past scores\u2026 Enjoy!",

            "content": "\"Being alone is perfectly fine. The problem is that she's forced to be alone due to other's ill will.\" Solitude is something that most people find \"lonely\" but in all honesty, it's more rewarding than you thought it could ever be. I guess one just need to find their own \"definition\" to it. Life in general is mostly on what you make out of it. Everyone eventually realizes it, in their own pace of course.\r\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteire is one of the anime that I put on hold for quite a long time. It took me almost 5 years to finallydecide to watch it again. I guess the title made me stay away thinking that it has harem in it. And I've always found harem as sth revolting. Instincts says it's rubbish and so it must be ignored but I guess I was wrong in this. I shall really stop with this stereotyping especially in anime.\\n\r\nWell, overall I enjoyed watching it to the point that I even dreamt about it. Weird but that did happen. The sarcastic humor is definitely one of the things that I've enjoyed here. Going further into details, here's what I thought. \\n\r\nArt is outstanding in my opinion. I liked it. I watched it on hd though so that's perhaps why but at least it had less fan service. This is also partly the reason why I had such judgement before. Harem anime gets good animation most of the time. Oh well, that's like a personal conflict that must be disregarded. In short, it's a 10 for me.\\n\r\nCharacters are interesting too and the plot is surprisingly engaging. Although as much to my amusement, I didn't find myself shipping Hachiman between the two leading ladies to which I sometimes find their blushing uncalled for. Their individuality though, each character has their own personality that is somehow close to the realistic personalities of the people that you'll meet in real life. I deem hachiman's self deprecating statements as one of the things that made the show interesting. His pessimistic point of view is sometimes so real that you'll just find yourself thinking and somehow, agreeing on most of the stuff he say. Just mostly, 'cause not everything of it for me seemed acceptable. He's still young and has yet to experience stuff that perhaps he already had his own judgement to. Yukino, on the other hand, perfectly complements his attitude and personality. Basing on what I've seen and observed, he's not actually a bad guy or the lowest. Hayato is sometimes the lowest in my perspective. Hachiman is actually a good man, in some sense. Hmm, I don't know. Nice guys are always something to be wary about. Well niceness in general is something to be wary about and thus I find myself agreeing to some of the lines he said about it. \"Anyone nice to me is nice to others too.\" and also, \"If the truth is a cruel mistress, then a lie must be a nice girl. And so, niceness is a lie.\" Self centered as it may seem but somewhere in between, the truth lies in it.  Niceness is something that you could staged and thus the line \"Everyone can be nice\" is rather the real truth and could be considered as a fact. I believe that too. And thus my enjoyment on watching it is obviously seen through the wall of text that I put here.\\n\\n\r\nI have relatively high hopes on the second season. If you wanted something let's say a bit close to the usual life of people but had a lil bit of fiction and exaggeration on it, watch this.",

            "content": "Hikigaya Hachiman is now one of my favorite anime protagonists. Besides his wit and keen perception of society\u2019s workings, his proud introversion and disdain for people in general remind me of myself. Having grown up with few true friends, I can empathize with Hachiman and how he became who he is. I, too, don\u2019t see my fellow humans as being particularly noble, and I admit, I also feel a sort of twisted satisfaction in my being solitary. I, too, recognize the futility in seeking hope in a girl\u2019s interaction with me, as it most likely means nothing more than simple friendliness.\r\nHigh school for many isa time of what I will dub \u201cperfecting the mold\u201d. Students invest so much importance on getting good grades (i.e. all As), meeting the perfect boyfriend/girlfriend, having that divine first kiss and later first time, and so on. Too often, I feel, high school students raise the bar so high that when it\u2019s not reached, they despair. In other words, it\u2019s overhyped.\\n\\n\r\nHachiman lives through high school with the completely opposite perspective. He doesn\u2019t expect anything and, sort of akin to Okazaki Tomoya, just slogs through life without much of a care for the world. And like Tomoya, he is able to change, albeit very gradually, after befriending Yukino and Yui.\\n\\n\r\nYukino is similar to Hachiman in that she is also friendless, although for different reasons. Known as the \u201cIce Queen\u201d, she appears cold and aloof, although this is due to certain family circumstances. Yui on the other hand is bright and ebullient and she treats Yukino and Hachiman with an affability that, in part, weakens their antisocial shells.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus we have a sort of love comedy/triangle, whose specifics I won\u2019t go into. But unlike other romance stories I\u2019ve seen, whose developments are predictable and thus lackluster, the \u201cdevelopments\u201d in Oregairu are not so fast. That is, guy gets girl doesn\u2019t happen that quickly. The interactions among Hachiman, Yui, and Yukino are incredibly realistic. Reluctance to advance, hesitation to call another friend, a slow desire for something that one hasn\u2019t had -- friendship. I can tell you from my life that reaching out to people and emerging from my introverted shell is difficult. And for Hachiman and Yukino, who are even more extreme cases, you can only expect the social barriers there.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s precisely what made watching Oregairu so\u2026 resonant. Watching this quasi-love comedy play out, narrated by Hachiman and his unique life philosophy, reminded me of my own failures at romance back in middle and high school. Hikki reminded me of my own introversion, and my pride at being alone. Much of what he says is true. Politically and socially incorrect to point out, but true all the same. Hikigaya Hachiman is, essentially, the Holden Caulfield of anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow most people don't grow up like Hachiman, so don\u2019t be surprised if you can\u2019t really empathize with and understand him and Yukino. Even so, Oregairu provides an intriguing and well-written look at the consequences of societal ostracization on one\u2019s outlook on life and the world. And how the simple fact of making friends, however long that process, can influence and shape that outlook.",

The later may happened for the leading female, though there were many girls around our boy, even cute girl like boys.

            "content": "Whenever I start a show, there are a number of things that I like to look for which are important to me. One of the things I like to look for is when the characters reveal to us the reasoning behind an activity or behavior they engage in (or lack thereof) so that I have a better understanding of how that person thinks and behaves (I\u2019ve noticed that this happens a lot in the form of internal monologues). \r\nIt has been my experience that characters who exhibit cynicism and skepticism are an excellent source of the portrayal of this kind of behavior, as it usuallygoes without saying that those characters are typically damaged or have experienced some kind of hardship or misfortune in the past that would cause them to become jaded in their own way. They wear masks. They lie. They sometimes have twisted reasoning. And we are often left wondering \u201cWell, why is he/she like that?\u201d But as we learn more and more about a character and their past, we begin to fully understand and appreciated them better not just as a person, but as a collection of their values and what they hold dear. And sometimes, if we take the time to compare their values to our own, we have the rare opportunity to reflect on ourselves and ask the age-old question \u201cWhat is important to me, and how important is it?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nOregairu offers all of that. As we follow the story through the eyes of the anti-social protagonist Hikigaya Hachiman and his attempts to navigate the uncertain world of society and high school life, we soon realize that there is a certain, unapologetic realism to the whole story revolving around this romantic comedy, which goes against what a lot of your typical rom-coms tend to do. There is a lot of focus given to the choices made within the story, and the choices we make in life are usually made from our experiences; I won\u2019t touch a red-hot stove because I know it will burn me, and I switched my major from Biology to Biochemistry because I realized how much I liked chemistry while simultaneously realizing how little I enjoyed learning about plants and animals. While some of these decisions I\u2019ve mentioned may or may not be relatable to you, the choices Hachiman makes in this series are backed with his own set of reasons. And while we may not necessarily agree with his thinking at times, we understand where he\u2019s coming from and can clearly see that he is simply acting out of his own experiences and out of necessity.\\n\\n\r\nIt is therefore interesting to see how different people choose to deal with failure, as well as the lengths people will go to in order to fit into society. Some people can shrug off failure and see it as a learning experience while others carry it around like a sack of potatoes. Still others choose to stay away from people, to keep their interactions professional and polite, or to go along with social behavior and laugh at \u201cLarry\u2019s \u2018funny\u2019 joke.\u201d The real world is often unforgiving to those who can\u2019t play its game properly, and it is interesting to see how Hachiman, Yukino, and Yui, with their own set of unique experiences, navigate and struggle through the confusing world of relationships and society.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be a mistake, then, to assume that with all its realism, this series is lacking in humor - this is a comedy, after all. A lot of the humor in this series actually stems from Hachiman\u2019s monologues and warped, twisted personality which is often challenged by the other main characters (usually Yukino and Yui), and which, if nothing else, are often quite amusing to listen to. The humor is delivered dryly, deadpan, and satirically with a healthy dose of self-deprecation (which fits my style). Because after all, you are simply getting a ridiculous take on how the world works from someone cynical and damaged.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps what makes the show\u2019s characters so strikingly unique is that despite everyone\u2019s intentions, no one is really innocent in this show. Like most character-driven stories, everyone is trying to act on their own accord, trying to shape the world to fit their needs, and ultimately trying to fumble for meaning in this uncertain place we live in (sounds kinda like us, huh?). There is an abundance of situations that cause the main character to try to rationalize his behavior and find meaning in his perceived circumstances, and these situations often involve the people around him. I\u2019d like to place emphasis on this last point because this show serves as a testament to how relationships, whether real or virtual, should ideally be formed: they should grow organically. Nothing seems rushed. Nor out of place. Nor unnecessary. It is the organic nature and progression of everyone\u2019s relationship with each other that makes every character feel real in their own way. This is crucial to any show\u2019s attempt at trying to get the viewer to connect with its characters. And in this respect, Oregairu does an impeccable job.\\n\\n\r\nBut what makes this show so attractive to me is not just the characters or delivery of humor, but that it allows us to take a lighthearted approach to something that is both relatable and a serious issue to millions of people around the world. Most people have experienced some kind of loneliness in their lives (or at least, the uncertainty surrounding it), and this show gives us a chance to laugh (sometimes bitterly) in the face of it all through the lens of Hikigaya Hachiman. It gives us a chance to laugh at our own masks that we\u2019ve created and worn. To laugh at our own possible loneliness. And to reflect on our own wounds and scars, pick ourselves up, brandish a smirk on our face, and say in an empowered manner to the world \u201cis that all you\u2019ve got?\u201d It reminds us of the old adage \u201ccomedy is just tragedy plus time,\u201d and it is often up to us to determine how much time we need in order to move forward. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a beautiful anime brimming with wit, meaning, and attention to detail, and if anything I mentioned above seems interesting to you, then I highly recommend that you give this series a shot. But for those simply looking for a quick and easy laugh, it would be hard for me to recommend this series to you for the following reasons: Despite the humor in this show being largely accessible, this is really not your typical rom-com chock-filled with gag humor, fan-service, innocence, and plot-driven antics (do not confuse this with complete absence). This show\u2019s approach to romance feels quite real, with all its complexities and hardships. Relationships are often not clear-cut or as simple as we\u2019d like them to be. They take mutual effort to form and maintain, and this show understands and illustrates this very well. Furthermore, this show (especially Season #2) demands a certain level of attention to detail and the ability to read between the lines if you\u2019re attempting to appreciate it to its fullest extent. Wataru Watari\u2019s attention to detail is, for lack of better words, simply stunning, and it wouldn\u2019t do this series enough justice to watch it with casual abandon. \\n\\n\r\nIt would also be hard for me to recommend this series to people who have never experienced or struggled with loneliness or who have trouble empathizing with others. This is because I think it would be hard for you to find yourself relating to the characters (which is kind of the whole point of a character-driven series, in my opinion), while simultaneously running the risk of becoming impatient with them. \\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, this show offers you a safe glimpse of the life of a loner as he struggles to deal with the demands of relationships and society. I therefore encourage you to look at the world through the eyes of Hikigaya Hachiman and laugh at him (and possibly yourself) while doing so.",

            "content": "School life might just be the best time of anyone's life. You hang out with your friends, establish priceless memories together, and you even fall in love with those who seemed like they were never going to love you back. Yahari Ore no Seishun addresses this in an extraordinarily beautiful manner.\r\nLet's break it down, shall we?\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI loved the story. At first glance, you're already drawn in by the unique concept, yet it just keeps getting better and better. Meet Hikigaya Hachiman, a loner. Meet Yuigahama Yui, a girl who makes any situation three times brighter. And then meet Yukinoshita Yukino, cold-hearted yet helpful. Onceyou meet these three characters, you start to think \"How in Hell are they going to make an amazing story out of this? These three have almost nothing in common, with even the main characters not being friends, the series can't progress at all.\" Well, you're right on so many levels, except for that last bit. Wataru Watari, the light novel writer, has managed to put in such an astounding story that I don't even know where to begin.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's start at the start. This anime is a RomCom, an anime focusing on romance and comedy at the same time. These two are the main genres of this anime, keep that in mind. Each new episode gave the Service Club different tasks to do, in hopes of aiding the student who requested the help. This idea is really unique, I've never seen such a thing before. But, that could just be my narrow view of things. Through the process of the tasks comes the comedy, through screw-ups or funny moments the characters encounter. The addition of more characters, from the stereotypical \"popular kids group\", gives a more realistic situation. Through these tasks, the characters also began to slowly realise their feelings for each other. This is where the romance comes in. And as time progresses, so does the intensity of every new conflict. In the end, only one conflict arose: their romance.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance in this anime might be one of my favourites due to the inordinate amount of conflicts in every characters' emotions. The ending was flawlessly executed, because it was very thought-provoking and heart-breaking. The people whom you ship together might start to go against their own love, for their own good or for the sake of other people. All-in-all, the story here was astounding and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the art. Colours were iridescent, characters looked great, sceneries was vibrant, and movements were smooth and accurate. Well, all these compliments above happened most of the time in the series. Sometimes the art strays slightly off flawless, which is why it's still an 8.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nAlright, the characters here are interesting. Like, REALLY interesting. Loner Hachiman seems to be the protagonist of the show, but he plays many different roles: the hero, the villain and the middle man. This alone grabs the watcher's interest, as protagonists are always \"supposed\" to be the good guy. But when conflicts arise when being the good guy might lead to more problems, Hachiman steps in and blows minds. Let's talk about Yukinon, Miss Ice Queen. I loved the way her character developed over time, from the strict and inferior demeanour at first, then she gets softer as time progresses when she realises she was pretending to be inferior this whole while, when in fact she's the same as the rest of them. This sort of development intrigues me and I'm sure they intrigue many others. As for Yui, she comes off as a cheerful happy-go-lucky girl, who is also helpful and friendly to those around her. Yet, as time goes on, her personality grows darker, and she doesn't play around as the nice girl anymore. And maybe, to be helpful, you have to contradict your own emotions.\\n\\n\r\nThe other supporting characters from the popular kids' group also had interesting personalities. Hayama, for instance, seemed like the kind and hot guy, but isn't as nice as he acts out to be. In the end, the character development and their contradictory personalities are just what makes this show wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThere's nothing much to say about the sounds, other than the fact that all the openings and endings were BEAUTIFUL.\\n\\n\r\nYukitoki, the first opening, has a cheery and upbeat tune to it. This shows how the series is all cheery and happy at first. The first ending, Hello Alone, is also upbeat because the romantic conflicts haven't started yet. But the two vocalists sound like Yukino and Yui, raising some eyebrows about those two. And the title is probably a nod to Hachiman's loneliness. The second opening is Harumodoki, which has a slightly sadder tone to it. This is when the conflicts start to arise. The last ending song is Everyday World, also having a slightly sad tone to it. Along with two singers, both of which sound like Yukino and Yui, you feel nostalgic. These songs are a perfect pick for the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyed it, loved it, will be one of my favourite romance animes. The thought-provoking story, the vibrantly coloured art, beautiful songs and intriguing characters, all of them play a part in the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nSchool ends, you and your friends take different paths. And one day, probably a few years or even many years later, you look back at the school days and wish for another event like that again.",

            "content": "It\u2019s no secret that many slice of life or rom-com's are often pigeonholed and derided in the anime committee for never going anywhere, bereft from subsistence and having an oversaturation of them. As someone who is a fan of this genre and has seen a fair share of romantic comedies (rom-coms), SNAFU is certainly a standout. For a summary of this review, scroll to the last two paragraphs.\r\n[Setting]\r\nWhile the setting to most slice of life shows typically aren't anything more than just a backdrop for the characters, I feel that there was a bit more nuance and thought that went into SNAFU\u2019s. High School Clubsare often just plot points to unite your main characters who wouldn\u2019t normally talk to each other or socially interact in normal circumstances. However, the use of clubs here, while itself a cliche, is used a little different context wise. In SNAFU, it serves to highlight the positive attributes of characters who would normally be considered unlikeable. It also serves to help others help themselves, something far more useful long term than just helping them. That in itself matches with the less idealistic and more practical viewpoints of characters like Yukino and Hachiman, which I thought was clever.\\n\\n\r\n[Writing]\\n\r\nThe writing is both strong and falls short in a few areas. Its greatest strength lies in its way to handle very pessimistic social commentary on interactions between high school students that can feel both relatable and true. Many situations that are written seem considerably more realistic to what happens in high schools than other conventional high school rom-coms. This also makes for some good comedy that incorporates Hachiman's unique perspective. Both the social commentary and comedy is told in a straightforward manner and there are plenty of times where the dialogue gets profound.\\n\\n\r\nAs good as the comedic and dramatic writing is, it falls flat when it diverts to romance occasionally. While the title of the anime (My Youth Romantic Comedy is Wrong as I Expected) itself does admit this, the romance aspect in this first season is honestly lacking. I understand the intention was to create a less typical romance anime, but scenes with romance are too sparse to hold any real weight in the grand scheme of things. Additionally, said romantic scenes are usually interrupted by some typical plot device or event (like a phone call). It feels a little out of place when SNAFU is clearly separating itself from the typical shows in its genre by clumsily using conventional and cheap ways to withhold romantic development. \\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters themselves, the leads are handled very well, particularly Hachiman. Not only is his own very twisted, negative view vastly different from the homogenous crop of stereotypical romance protagonists the genre is accustomed to, but he, later on, will show in a unique way that he isn\u2019t as selfish and self-minded as he appears to be. Additionally, when he does display traits in line with your average male lead in a rom-com, like his density regarding obvious signs of females being attracted to him, it makes sense when you learn about his personal life experiences. He is refreshing, well-developed and plays up the anti-hero role quite well. \\n\\n\r\nThe other two leads, Yuigahama and Yukinoshita, also help bring some balance to the otherwise pessimistic and facetious tone of the anime. Yui helps achieve this while also being a great character foil for Hachiman. She is more or less the bubbly, kind hearted member of the club and as such, brings some needed (even if misplaced) optimism and charisma. Yui also has her own social issues, being blindingly obedient and submissive to popular classmates whims. Her social shortcomings to the club make for a believable and clever way to bring the three together. Yukino also adds really nicely to the dynamic of the three, by being very similar and dissimilar to our protagonist. She too is rather intelligent, can seem cold hearted and ruthless, and is ostracized by her classmates. Unlike Hachiman though, she is very kind deep down and is being alienated for her beauty and allure; And despite her and Hachiman being loners, they clearly have vastly different viewpoints, which makes for some intriguing situations later on. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the main three characters are very well written and developed, unfortunately, I feel like the side characters were far too neglected and relegated to comedy roles. Characters like Yoshiteru and Totsuka were likeable enough, but had little development and could have sufficiently added to SNAFU's themes by revealing the underlying negative feelings of both characters that are associated with their stereotypes. \\n\\n\r\n[Soundtrack/Audio]\\n\r\nThe music, for the most part, is good, though I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s magnificent. It sufficiently matches and even at times adds to the mood of the scene as background music is supposed to do, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily have many tracks that stand out and help breathe life into a scene. The voice acting (at least for the sub) is very well done, as each voice actor gives an excellent performance and creates a strong association from character design to voice.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]\\n\r\nThe art style and animation are good overall, though personally, I thought that the eyes of Yukino and Yui at times felt a little too close together or awkwardly placed. I will give praise to Hachiman's character design, as it perfectly fits him and is drawn in much less detail than his classmates. He has a distinctive feel compared to everyone else and this helps him stand out all the more. There is some nice art direction touches in this season, like having both Yukino and Hachiman at opposite sides of the table, serving as a metaphor for their opposing viewpoints and having Yui in the middle trying to bring some balance to the two.\\n\\n\r\n[Summary/TL;DR]\\n\r\nSNAFU is an overall great rom-com/slice of life/drama anime that is akin to a breath of fresh air compared to many animes in its genre. Easily the biggest draw to the show is the main character Hachiman, who is very different from a typical protagonist in this genre with his loner demeanor and nihilistic attitude. The other two female leads are equally well done, providing extra depth to SNAFU's characterization. The writing is another draw, as it often depicts and makes commentary on social interactions in high school told by Hachiman; Doing so uses his own character bias to full effect. It also develops and changes from a comedy to a character focused drama as the show progresses. It is a little unsatisfying in the romance department, as though they attempted to handle romance in a different way, there were too few romantic scenes and those were dampened by incorporating phone interruptions or other similar tropes to halt romantic development between characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting, while nothing especially unique, is a considerably more realistic depiction of high schools. The use of the club helps bring out the relatable and kinder elements of the main cast without betraying their characters entirely. The art is decent and the soundtrack, while mostly forgettable, utilizes softer songs rather well and has a solid OP and ED. Those looking for a rom-com that goes against the grain and provides great characters, some profound dialogue, and unique writing would likely enjoy this. Score: 7/10.",

            "content": "I love this show!\r\nIf it's anything about this show that stands out from the rest, it's its cast. They just have so much depth and so much thought poured into them. They aren't just one dimensional unlike many other slice of life shows.\r\nThough, I don't necessarily like them because they're intelligent and philosophical characters, but I like them because they are flawed. They carry actual weight and their behaviors are understandable and sympathetic. Despite carrying the classic tropes of a harem anime, they are well deconstructed\u2014almost to the point that one can begin to wonder if it's a harem anime in the first place.\r\nThe charactersin this anime are open up for different interpretations. The show itself has an intellectual edge that many can appreciate. You may find yourself agreeing with one side of the argument over the other, but others who watch the same show may not be so inclined to agree.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the chemistry between characters here is what really sells the show.\\n\\n\r\nI for one find the main character, Hachiman Hikigaya, to be unique in his own right. I have never seen a protagonist like him before. Everything is written in his point-of-view so he's much more sympathetic than he normally should be. And no, he isn't the overly skilled, overly cool, and overly glorified main male lead that get's all the girls for shallow reasons that we're so used to getting in more recent anime of the same genre. His background isn't just some lip service to justify his analytical skills and attitude. We can genuinely find his monologues to be amusing, so he isn't anything like the too obvious wish fulfillment protagonist that we frequently get.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are no less than interesting themselves. Despite them playing the roles in what you'd normally find on a harem genre, they aren't one dimensional. Many of them don't just suck up to Hachiman immediately and they all have interesting qualities that will keep you entertained with them.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to talk about the show's finer points, I might as well be writing for the whole page. My recommendation? Watch it.",

Nothing is really fully explained, we don't know why the main character has that personality, what past relations the female lead had with the supporting cast; nothing is really resolved in the story, side elements are mentioned and then cast aside never to be mentioned again.\r\nArt- The animation and character designs are all good, it won't blow you away, but Iwouldn't expect much more from a Rom/Com.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The opening song isn't bad,  but it's not really good either. The music throughout is nice though it's nothing memorable but it works. A few songs towards the end are pretty good though,\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- A pessimistic main character, a smart and ruthless female character, the innocent and bubbly female character, and the boy that looks like a girl catching characters off guard; this anime has most of your Rom/Com  stereotypes they won't blow you away, but they probably won't dissapoint either. As far as character development goes this anime does a pretty good job of showing the characters progress, though I thin given another season the characters would really start to break out of their shells and start to shine as they were meant to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I didn't really go into this one expecting a whole lot out of it and I'm glad I didn't. I wasn't really disappointed nor impressed the whole thing was kinda just meh. There's not a whole lot of romance in this anime which is pretty odd considering it's genre which left me pretty disappointed. Though the whole thing is pretty light hearted laughs are few and far between. As a whole I thought the series was pretty fun mostly because of the character chemistry and the tone of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- This anime knows what it is, it's just that it doesn't do it that well. Both the romance and comedy are lacking, if the side stories weren't forgotten and characters pasts and motives were better explained it might be a bit better. The core elements just don't really come together on this one. If you're into Rom/Coms you could give it a try, just don't go into it with high expectations, or you're looking to be let down.",

            "content": "Firstly, i'll say this, i'm not usually the type who goes out of their way to watch so called \"rom-coms\" however i'd heard some fairly good things about it prior to viewing it so i decided to take it for a spin. And... well if there is anything to say i'll say that it surpassed my expectations, heh you could even say that my views were wrong as i expected! eh? no? (i'm not funny). The best thing about this anime, however, were the characters - specifically Hachiman Hikigaya, the so called protagonist of the series. Putting a \"pessimist loner\" into the middle of atypical - yet extremely skillfully written \"rom-com esque cast\", resulted in a bundle of both genuinely funny and soundly relatable moments throughout (despite the odd one being a tad cringe worthy or a little too close to being straight up clich\u00e9). The art and sound did their jobs fairly unexceptionally so if you really care about those you won't find much you already haven't seen here. But despite all that I've gotta say that as far as \"vanilla\"* rom-coms go, this is most certainly up there with the very best. (*not sure if vanilla is the right term but to clarify I simply mean it doesn't have any major elements from other genres mixed in with it. I think).",

            "content": "I always dread when I start shows that contain one or more of the following:\r\n1) A huge fanbase that I'm terrified to disagree with on anything\r\n2) A romantic comedy for fear that it will focus too much on one aspect over the other and make the show boring\r\nor 3) A show with more than 1 season, because there's always a chance the following season won't live up to the previous one.\r\nSo going into Oregairu or SNAFU or whatever you want to call it, I was terrified. I had heard amazing things about the show from its fans. I knew it was a romantic comedy cuz,duh, the name. And I knew it had a fairly recent second season released. Luckily I came out of the experience mostly unscathed, the few times where I wanted to die mostly being from the emotional moments of the latter first season and entire second season. While I think the Brain's Base season was slightly better in its approach at this show, the Studio Feel season also had a lot going for it. So I'm glad to say that watching this show was totally worth the fear I had going in.\\n\\n\r\nI think I immediately was drawn to the show because of the idea of the main character. Hachiman is a loner. Like, a HUGE loner, to the point where he essentially mocks people for living their lives, though he doesn't say such things out loud. Anyway, I too connect with the loner persona, though not nearly to as much of an extreme as Hachiman. But the idea of a loner being put in a romantic situation and dealing with that, THAT was the thing that hooked my attention. The other great thing is that it's not even much of a romantic situation to begin with. Hachiman is forced by his teacher to join the Volunteer Service Club, who only has one other member (at first). Yukinoshita Yukino, much like Hachiman, is a huge loner, so it seems to be a match made in heaven. That is until you consider how much dislike she has for the main character right away, combined with the introduction of Yui, the bubbly 3rd member who seems way more interested and likely to date the protagonist by the end of season 1. Getting to the plot, basically it's a slice-of-life where students and teachers alike come to the club to ask for advice or assistance and the club then provides. It's a standard formula to say the least, but I didn't mind because it worked. And instead of every episode or mini-arc being resolved with some stupid \"the real key was friendship\" crap, the ways that the club arrives at its solutions to people's problems are well though out and work very well.\\n\\n\r\nSo the club member are Hachiman, Yukino, and Yui. Again, the first two are loners, with the latter being the perfect student who people hate for being perfect and the prior being a nobody, and Yui is the cheery one that lightens the tension between the other two 'unique' club members.\\n\r\nBut I don't care about the main characters this time around. Hachiman's views are really interesting and something I haven't really seen before and they're cool, and the main characters as a whole are developed phenomenally. But I LOVE the side characters in this show, mainly for one reason:\\n\r\nTHEY ALL GET SCREEN TIME.\\n\r\nI'm so tired of shows introducing a character and then shoving them aside for a key plot point 5 episodes later. SNAFU introduces characters and they're there almost every episode and I LOVE IT FOR DOING THIS. The friendly, pretty boy Hayato, the Skater boy Tobe, the VERY feminine boy Saika, the hardcore geek/otaku Zaimokuza...really the list goes on, and these characters all get screen time, are all important, and are all very fun and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is hard to talk about with any show that switches studios between season. Brain's Base is my favorite animation studio. I love Durarara!! and D-Frag! and Baccano! (these guys really have a thing for exclamation marks) and I really liked how the first season looked. The first season doesn't dwell on romance nearly as much as the second, so the more loose style of Brain's Base fit the show very well for that part. When it switches over to Studio Feel in season 2, things look a lot more moody, more realistic, more bloom-y (seriously, so much bloom lighting) to connect with the more emotional tone of season 2, and yet they manage to maintain the core look that Brain's Base developed. It is a weird switch, especially for Hachiman who looks both barely and drastically different at the same time, but it's manageable and it works.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is....'aight. There's nothing truly spectacular in this show that caught my ear. The openings and endings were all really nice, but again, nothing too outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest issue with this show is the change from season 1 to season 2. Let me preface this by saying that both seasons are fantastic, season 1 being my preferred. In order to progress the love story that the title promises, I realize some things had to change. But where the first season gave us a bunch of new characters and many different tasks for the club to do, there was just one main new character who showed up repeatedly and the shows was far more focused on the angst and relationships between the three main characters. Again, it's not bad by any means, but it's a shift that's big enough to notice that I didn't like it as much as what the show started out with. It almost felt like it devolved into a romance story rather than grew to become one. Either way, amazing show.\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n+Decent openings and ending themes\\n\r\n+OMG THE SIDE CHARACTERS\\n\r\n+Animation (particularly Brain's Base's, but that's just my opinion)\\n\r\n+A well-done shift between first and second season\\n\r\n+Hachiman's ideals and thoughts are different and thought-provoking\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n-The switch in seasons wasn't as smooth as I'd hoped for, but they did their best given what they had\\n\r\n-Plot was fairly standard, though executed decently\\n\r\n-Really cliffhanger-y ending. PLEASE stop trying to force me to read the manga, Anime\\n\\n\r\nSNAFU is a romantic comedy as the name implies, with the first season taking up most of the comedy and the second being more focused on romance. Each season has its merits and drawbacks, but altogether, it forms one coherent, beautiful show that I really enjoyed, as I'm sure any slice-of-life fan would.",

            "content": "*CONTAINS SPOILERS? *  AND DEFINITELY REFERENCES\r\nI'm kinda nice in telling people about it.  \r\nSo Hachiman.  The protagonist who acts like an antagonist.  The vilian that no one asked for, but the one we need in our perfect little lives.  (Not my words btw)\r\nAnd I'm sure many who enjoyed this show could relate to Hachiman in some twisted way or another.  But if you really think about it, isn't it just a show about a high school teenager with a cynical attitude towards his surroundings based on his somewhat poor 3 years in junior high?  So how did he,and the show get so intersting?\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, his cynical attitude is practically the glue that holds most of the comedy, the perspective and answers to the problems in this anime.  And this is what stands out from all the animes out there.  It doesn't have your pretty boys (unless you count Totsuka) with a happy go lucky trait, a harem nor everything will go well for the protagonist kinda plot.  And I have a feeling that is the reason why people love it.  It's so different from the wild sci-fi, action anime.  So different that it can relate to each individual viewers.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat's so great about the setting?  It's set in Chiba!!!  The prefecture well known for peanuts!!!  (In reality, it's actually a residential prefecture with little tourist atteactions)  \\n\r\nBut seriously, we all know (well, the ones that are in or went to) high school.  The social ladder, the loners, the stress etc.  And for the first time in any medium, we see the life of being a high schooler in the eyes of a loner.  (Without any gruesome twist)   And we don't get that in any medium.  It captures the reality so painfully true that we love it so much and can understand what it feels like. So Kudos for that Watari.\\n\\n\r\nIf you think about it, this show is lead by the characters and their development.  It's not like a show where people are trapped in a game and get out after x episodes.  No, we witness these characters almost from a day to day basis.  They grow, they have a change of heart, and most of all, they all have a strong sense of personality.  It's more the in-game experience we witness here.  And personally, this is missing in a lot of entertainment.  Just the idea of characters driving the plot, and not vice versa.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, the art is fairly unsightly, like Hachiman's dead fish eyes, foul mouth and twisted mind.  Okay, maybe not THAT bad, but you get me.  But that should not have been a reason as to why anyone didn't not finish this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think it captures life, questions its illogical society and how everyone just follows these unwritten rules of life.  And to top it off, we have Hachiman laughing at it and openly expresses his hatred towards it.  He is the \"antagonist\" that no one asked for, but the one we need in our perfect little lives.  Some would say, he is even Batman.  But no, he is 8man.\\n\\n\r\nOops, forgot to mention the subtle, but suffifient romantic scenes between Hachiman and Yukinoshita, Yuigahama, Totuska and Hayato? (In the eyes of Ebina at least).",

            "content": "\"There's never a reset button for life.\"\r\n Hurting others is bad, but did you ever think about hurting someone because you want to help them? Surely you think I jest. NO. Well this series tells you how hurting someone can help them(well I'm not telling you to do it yourself.), even if it makes you the villain yourself.\r\nWell, this will be my very first review. So I really do hope It'll be of help to YOU who's been reading this. I dunno how veteran reviewers do it. But hey! No harm trying it out myself. So I'll go with the formats I've read so far.Well enough of the BS. First ill start off with what's this anime is about.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nI'ts about our main guy who happens to be a emotional-loner-don't-talk-to-me-type of a guy. The story starts of at him telling what his ideals are. And then her teacher does not agree with his ideals, forces him to join the volunteer club, where his misfortunes or whatchamacallit happenings will happen, so that's basically the plot is about(at least on episode 1, don't want to end up spoiling the rest of it to you.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art in this one is pretty good. Well we rarely see series that come out this year with shitty-half-assed art on it. The coloring of the backgrounds are great, not to mention the passers-by characters are well drawn too. And the main guys can be easily distinguished because of their appearances.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic: ??\\n\r\nI dunno?! Yeah yeah, what kind of reviewer am I for not paying attention to the music. Well I usually don't know how to judge this kinds of things. So I'll base it off on the OP and ED theme, the OP is pretty good. And the ending theme is so-so. Well music varies for every person. So the best way to know if its good is to listen to it yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall  :\\n\r\nI'd give this series an 8.  Its been a while since I finished a series in one go, I must say, this series is pretty good. Even if its quite short. There was never a dull moment for me in this series. Since the ever so alone protag uses unorthodox methods to solve problems and in undeniable cool fashion too. So I'd say this series is a good one. Its definitley worth my time. It's obviously going to have another season. So try watching it yourself. Then curse me if it wastes your time!\\n",

It's been a while since an anime has stepped out of the \"herd\" of the generic mass produced shows with empty plots and hollow character development.\r\nHikigaya Hachiman and Yukinoshita Yukino are by far the best anime characters made till date. \r\nI personally feel that this show is extremely underrated and should atleast be in the top 20 althoughi do understand that this show will not be enjoyed equally by everyone due to its realistic and calm nature unlike some of its counterparts present this season which has a lot of high tech \"3D\" action (you know what i'm talking about). This show definitely falls under the seinen genre so i can understand the lack of popularity. \\n\r\nAlso, I believe that this show is being misunderstood by some people as a love triangle perhaps due to the picture depicting to girls and one guy, but I can assure you, its not even close.\\n\r\nI won't go into any details regarding the characters and the story since it ruins the excitement but i can assure you that this anime is something that should not be missed.\\n\\n",

Yahari Ore no Seishun yada yada- the name alone sounds like a mouthful, and to be frank I wasn't expecting much other than a stereotypical harem with forced comedy, so this one turned out to be a breath of fresh air. There are pessimistic characters abound in anime, but the protag in this one, Hachiman, pulls it off nicely and manages to inspire hilarity as well as a sort of reluctant admiration for his straightforward views on life (I'm more of a pessimist myself, so I cansort of relate.) The fact that he harbours such views and retains such a high degree of self-confidence (narcissism, more like?) is refreshing too- it's a different take on a character otherwise similar to that of Oreki from Hyouka.\\n\\n\r\n(a few spoilers ahead)\\n\\n\r\nThe romances portrayed are both typical and atypical- we have both female protags somewhat vying for the oblivious male's attention- which is mostly directed at another male?! (who is admittedly very feminine). There are scenes where both female protags are hinted at being more than platonically affectionate too. Personally I don't think this anime will ultimately stray from the typical guy/girl romance, so don't let that put you off (or let you down, as it may be in some cases), and just kick back and revel in the hilarity that this entire show entails.",

            "content": "Too often does an anime fan, while watching a show, get that pesky sensation of \"man... this show again? Is it  so hard to have a little originality?\". I find this happening most oftenly with the so prevalent and seemingly worn out schol life genre, specially when we tag RomCom along with it. On that note Oregairu felt like a real breath of fresh air, due to the way it set's itself apart from the rest of the genre.\r\n       While the show doesn't exactly stand out through its animation , artor soundtrack, this components where in no way a hindrance to the quality of the overall product. The animation is pretty much on par with modern slice of life titles that aren't produced by Kyoto Animation, without much more that can be added to it (wether that is satisfactory or not i leave up to you). The soundtrack follows the animation in a way, While not memorable, it did it's job seting up the mood for the several scenes, but not much more than that. As for the art, it was preety much as you would expect from a modern school life anime, however i would like to highlight the character design in Oregairu, for i believe the way the charecters' personalities  stand out through their design is truly a sign of an outstanding work.\\n\r\n       This anime follows an episodic format, and while it does have a story arc that persists throughout its entirety, the main focus of the show is its characters and the interactions between them, and it is here that Oregairu shines. The writing in this show is by far one of the best i've seen, The pacing is impeccable, and the dialogs are some of te most entertaning out there. However,  the big diference between this show and the other RomComs out there is the main character. For a while has the genre, and even the industry been plagued with bland main characters that lack any sort of personality other than the line \"I'll never give up\" or alternatively, and in this case more relevantly, the \"i don't have good grades, not good at sports, and not particularly good looking\" personality wich is often used as the main character for RomComs so the viewer can insert himself in the MCs shoes. Our MC however, Hikigaya, is an antisocial, pessimistic, almost nihilistic high school kid that actually behaves like an antisocial, pessimistic, almost nihilistisc high school kid, wich leads to great setup for a RomCom that's looking for a fresh approach.\\n\r\n       With everything in mind i'd recommend this show to any fan of the genre or any anime veteran looking for something fresh. For a more specific reference i'd recommend you this anime if you also liked Haganai (similar setup as well as having a similar feel to it, although Oregairu may not be as sentimental), or Bakemonogatari (the MC's monologues and his interactions with one of the heroines defenitively reminded me of the writing in this Shaft work).\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 8\\n",

            "content": "When first watched this anime, I didn't even bother to finish the first episode. I felt at that time that it would become a trap; a generic light novel adaptation to make people read the rest of it in the book. I had some clashes back then with light novels. I decided to watch this anime for the second time when I was in the mood for romance anime. I can't find any good anime, so I decided to watch it again. That's the only time I realized how I was wrong with my judgement in the first time. It's been awhile since an animewould make me laugh so much. It made me love romcom animes all over again. \\n\\n\r\nI like how witty its comedy and lighthearted the show was. Also, the characters' interactions and developments are well done. They are very relatable and fun to watch. That's what I love the most in watching anime, developed characters. I had to admit that sometimes I think about the topics that the characters talked about. I also had same experiences in the past that some characters encountered. It showed me a realistic portrayal of high school, that's why, the story itself is so fresh and unique. I think if you're tired of watching generic high school romantic comedy anime, and still want to watch something similar but has to be different, I recommend you to try watching this anime.",

            "content": "Although Yahari isn't my typical romance, I really enjoyed this. If you're looking for a super cute, sappy romance anime than you probably shouldn't watch this. Hints of romance are seen throughout the show, but that's pretty much it. I'll admit I'm one of the girls who looks for that beautiful \"first kiss\" or \"confession\", but even though this anime lacks those two elements, I really enjoyed it. \r\nThe anime revolves around three characters - Hikigaya, Yui and Yukinoshita - and how they work together to solve various issues that are presented to them. Their differing perspectives are the main points of the show. Hikigaya,the main character,  is definitely a pessimistic character, but his reflections were deep and analytical and surprisingly mature. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing things from his point of view, even though I'm more of the sweet, innocent character type.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThe only reason I'm giving this Yahari an 8 is because not a lot actually happens in the \"romance\" department, if you know what I mean. I don't want to spoil the show - like I said, hints of romance are present, and I was satisfied with how the show ended. The pacing is decent - the problems that arise aren't very related, but they do contribute to character development, which I'll expand on later. I enjoyed this story specifically for its unique perspective on life and relationships. Some of Hikigaya's quotes are relatable, even if he is greatly disliked in the show. This show made me examine different dynamics in my own life - I don't necessarily look at things from Hikigaya's pov, but I do examine things more critically. How often can you say an anime makes you do that?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art was actually pretty good. I think the character art was a bit better than the background art, seeing as I recall very little of the background art. I liked how the characters were drawn, specifically Yukinoshita. She was so beautiful! I also really like Hikigaya, even though he's not handsome like other male leads. His fish eyes were even kind of attractive, in a weird way.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI really liked the opening theme. That's all I've really got to say on the subject lol.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nI applaud every character in this anime. Even though you don't get to know most of them very well - like I said, Yahari revolves mainly around three characters - what you do get to see of them is enjoyable. I mentioned before that several issues are presented to Hikigaya and the rest of the club, and every character contributed and grew a little from each of these issues. Most of the issues aren't related, but you see a lot of character development from each. Personally, my favourite characters have to be Hikigaya and Yukinoshita. Their relationship is so bizarre, and their conversations are hilarious and strangely refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/ overall: 8\\n\r\nLike I said, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime even though it isn't the typical kind of romance I'm attracted to. The story altered my perspective on a lot of everyday situations, and it's because of this I applaud the deeper threads in this anime.",

Due to the name of the show I was expecting this to be your typical high school harem comedy show for the season but how wrong was I. It's a great take on the high school genre that had been overdone since the dawn of the anime. All the character were well written very intriguing story line. Really hope there's going be a second season.",

            "content": "Yahari is similar to most rom-com, but one important spice separates it from most of the genre. Hikigaya. Is the best.\r\nOverall:\r\nThe story of Yahari is pretty standard. It's pretty good, but it's not outstanding. It's like that of a Rom-com, but Hikigaya somehow manages to twist it in such a way that the romantic comedy premise becomes something that's not romantic or a comedy. The art and sound are pretty standard as well. The characters are abso-frutolicious though. Not only is Hikigaya a very unique and interesting character, but Yukinoshita is also pretty unique, and Yui's fonny. I have to say that I enjoyed thisanime so so much, like there was no tomorrow. The way that Hikigaya behaves is so refreshing in a genre full of sappy romance and ecchi comedy. It's like a refreshing breeze in the genre. Yahari features unique characters and a story NOT filled with romance. As the title suggests, this \"youth romantic comedy is wrong as I expected.\"\\n\r\nStory: 8.5\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5\\n\r\nIt's very good, nearly great. I need a season two. Good thing a season two has been green-lit so yay I am have hi hopes 5 the future.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story's pretty average, but also immensely entertaining. The story's events help bring out Hikigaya's character, so the two, character and story, go together very well. Sometimes it feels slice-of-life-ish but there is an added mystery. What exactly happened the first day of school that led to Hikigaya being alone? And how do the other characters fit into that? Despite that, however, the story isn't anything special. The plot isn't predictable, which is good, but it's not exactly mind-blowing either. So the story gets a 7 in my book.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Well, it looks good. Nothing really stands out as amazing to me, but it definitely looks good. Another 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound: No soundtracks really stood out to me as outstanding, but the sound wasn't bad. It was just average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This really is the highlight of the anime. Hikigaya has a pessimistic outlook on life that, even if you're optimistic, you oftentimes nod along with him in agreement. For example, he has this speech explaining why he hates nice girls. Because they are nice to him, Hikigaya thinks they're looking at him romantically. But he knows that they're being nice to him not because they love him, but simply because they're nice. It breaks his heart, and that's why he hates nice girls.\\n\r\nAlong with his \"moments of wisdom,\" he's also quirky, interesting, and funny. His unique character is refreshing, because in the rom-com genre, nearly all male protagonists are \"stereotypical good-natured guy.\" Hikigaya is not good, and we all like it. The other characters are interesting too, for the most part not fitting into a trope.",
