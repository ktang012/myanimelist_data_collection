            "content": "As this is a review of a sequel, I believe that the reader is already familiar/has watched the first season of Code Geass.\r\nCode Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2 is both more of the same and yet a departure for the series in several ways. On one hand, it\u2019s often even more ridiculous and over the top than its predecessor, and on the other surprisingly dramatic, with an emotional resonance not found in the first season. This results in the show feeling more like a reboot/reimagining of the series rather than a simple continuation of the storyline. Now to be sure, many of the classic Geassmoments of the first season are present, however, this time around things feel very different in ways that are superior to the original even if R2 itself can't quite top the overall impact of its predecessor. Some will feel that R2 wasn't as good as the first season but it does live up to the Code Geass franchise.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Code Geass R2 continues the story of Lelouch Lamperouge and the Black Knights as they continue their fight against the Holy Britannian Empire. We are introduced to more characters including new allies, enemies, and Nightmare Frames. As the series progresses new factions are introduced and new alliances formed, with plot twists abound. The plot twists in R2 are even more abundant, and at times even more implausible and unexpected than the first season, with every episode essentially ending in a cliffhanger. However, the characters this time around are far more likable, even if they are so numerous that many of them, unfortunately, end up being underdeveloped. And while the show starts off slow, the plot eventually moves forward very fast and while stumbles somewhat near the climax, manages to pull off a remarkably well-crafted resolution at the end. Fans who were disappointed by the way the first season ended will undoubtedly be satisfied with the bizarre ending of R2.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Here's a series that has real emotional depth and dramatic resonance. Now to be clear, by no means is this a primary focus of R2, however, the actions and motivations of the characters and the events themselves seem to have greater meaning and purpose. The range of emotions felt by the characters is better conveyed: we feel their desperation and determination, their sadness and joy, their anger and regret. Characters that seemed so empty or clich\u00e9d in the first season are given greater depth and expression, with exceptions of course. Lelouch, in particular, is a far more interesting character this time around, and his inner conflict and desire for self-resolution. He'll do things that you wouldn't expect him to do. Also, his changing relationships with his comrades and enemies alike act as a drive that propels the show from a mere continuation into a rejuvenation of the series. Lelouch fans will definitely find him more interesting and amazing as well as the other characters. Especially Kallen.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: SUNRISE and CLAMPE have definitely outdone itself. The visuals of R2 are not just better than the original, but are also some/one of the best I've seen (though somewhat expected considering them using an extraordinary amount of budget.) R2 is definitely more flashier and colorful than ever before, the high quality of the visuals consistently impresses from one episode to the next. The characters and backgrounds are incredibly detailed and the large-scale action sequences are spectacular to watch. The only gripe I have is that the animation itself often lacks fluidity, especially during some of the more hectic action sequences. This didn't really take much away from the actual quality of the visuals but it is rather noticeable nevertheless. Actually, with the action and everything going on, you won't even notice the lack of fluidity. And while SUNRISE doesn't quite stand at the absolute top-tier level in terms of overall animation quality, R2 represents their best work since their old age of shows like Cowboy Bebop. In terms of the animation, Code Geass R2 sure have one of the best this year.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The audio is just as impressive as the visuals, with great sound effects and the solid voice acting (Jun Fukuyama, Ami Koshimizu, Yukana, etc)  you've come to expect from the first season. The music, on the other hand, is more of a mixed bag. The soundtrack itself is solid, a score that is well suited for the mixture of tones that a series like Geass goes through. The theme songs, conversely, are merely mediocre and all but one remains memorable. The pop theme surely is one of my favorite having listen to the songs many times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While watching, you'll be hooked onto the episodes and you might even finish the whole series in less than two days. This show will leave you wanting more and more till you have completed it. You might even want to re-watch the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Code Geass R2 is a series that almost every Code Geass fan will be happy to watch - for newer fans watching the first season is recommended. While its approach is often divergent from the first, it shares enough absurdities and overindulgence that those who didn't like the first series will most likely detest this one. Yet for all its flashiness, its superficiality and its dangerously complex back-story, this is still a far more entertaining series than most of the other shows out there. Again, Code Geass R2 proves that entertainment doesn't always have to be meaningful, just enjoyable. If you didn't enjoy the first season, then you most likely will not enjoy R2.",

            "content": "Code Geass is the dumbest show to ever take itself seriously. It is essentially a hackneyed amalgamation of clich\u00e9s and overused plot devices that clumsily attempts to disguise itself as something greater. Hell, it stole Death Note\u2019s whole shtick, and ruined it completely, before the anime version even finished airing. It blatantly stole from Evangelion, the most popular mecha anime and deconstruction there is, to make one of the weakest and most clich\u00e9 mecha series ever. Both of the series Code Geass stole from were dark and had at least some depth; Code Geass, on the other hand, juxtaposes pseudo-dark scenes with light school-life haremromcom. Plot develops with a marked carelessness; people die and are inexplicably brought back to life, even though they were either shown dying or there was clearly no way they could have possibly lived. Plot armor at its finest. Oh, did you want an epic and dense war story? Too bad, instead you\u2019re going to get aimless filler, centered on a bunch of people who probably shouldn\u2019t even be in high school, including an episode dedicated to catching a cat. This anime is most notable for having one of the highest concentrations of plot holes and loose ends that I have ever seen. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the supernatural aspect of the story is just ridiculous and, by extension, the story is as well. This \u201cGeass\u201d ability is completely inconsistent. Sometimes it can be deterred with mere willpower, or even the power of kisses (no joke,) but most of the time it appears to be pretty much undefeatable. There is a Geass canceller that is developed, but it is inexplicably given to only one dude who just pops up whenever he feels like it, with a different personality every time. A weakness, where the ability becomes uncontrollable, introduces itself at one point, but this plot point is quickly dealt with and forgotten. Every Geass user has one single ability granted by their Geass, except for one guy that inexplicably has several, but I won\u2019t even get into that. The biggest issue is that the conflict is all entirely pointless, as Lelouch\u2019s ability allows him to give anybody a command that they must obey. Hell, it can apparently even work on God. This command only works once, but the show makes it entirely clear that he could simply give a command along the lines of \u201cyou will be my slave and do whatever I say, until I do x.\u201d So why doesn\u2019t he do that from the very beginning? Because the story must be milked for two seasons, I guess. The whole anime could have ended in episode 1 had Lelouch, the supposed genius, made better use of his ability. Despite this, everything that was built up in the first season is destroyed in the most anticlimactic ending I have ever seen, the show returns to square one, and we have to go through the same style of drawn-out story arc in season two. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization is probably the biggest flaw in Code Geass. The characters are irritating, flat, inconsistent, contrived, and they alone destroy any possibility of this being even a decent anime. The main character, Lelouch, is good at chess and inexplicably predicts a lot of minor events a bit before they happen. This is how we know he\u2019s a genius. He makes a lot of dumb decisions, he wastes troops and resources, he kills potential allies, he spares enemies, he gets caught in needless battles, he makes emotional decisions in battle, he accidentally orders massacres, he never makes a proper back-up plan to deal with things he knows are like to happen, and we never get any indication that he knows the first thing about proper tactics, but he somehow wins battles and he\u2019s somehow a genius. Go figure. Luckily, all \u201ctactics\u201d were just replaced with boring beam spamming in the end, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really much better. Any development in Lelouch\u2019s character is completely contrived and comes out of nowhere. Additionally, he has the inexplicable ability to teleport; at least, that would be the only explanation for how he travels such huge distances so quickly. Suzaku, the kind-of antagonist kind-of not, is probably the dumbest anime character ever created. He is Lelouch\u2019s friend, and if he was a Jew during the holocaust he would do his very best to argue that Hitler is actually an okay guy after all. He believes that the corrupt government should be changed from the inside. So does he get into politics to accomplish this? No, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really allowed to; instead, he (inexplicably) becomes a mecha pilot for the military that is slaughtering and oppressing his people. He fails to see how this is not helping them. He also moves like a ninja, and dodges bullets, despite being quite clearly anorexic. I\u2019m not even going to talk about their goddawful character designs, just look at some screen shots for that one. All I\u2019ll say on that topic is this: if you\u2019re going to act like a character is hot, then don\u2019t make them an extraordinarily and inhumanly ugly emo anorexic with a ridiculously pointy chin. As for the other characters, there\u2019s some annoying racist yandere lesbian who sexually assaults a table at one point. Seriously. There\u2019s also some immortal chick with green hair who likes pizza; not much else to say about her. There\u2019s an irritating crippled chick, with a completely inconsistent personality, who mostly serves to be useless and need constant protection. Really, for about 90% of the plot, her character just exists to get kidnapped. There\u2019s also some redhead with big tits who loves the main character and has big tits, has a drug addict mother who we forget about for most of the series, and can inexplicably pilot mechas with her big tits and has big tits plus a pair of large breasts. She has a nice ass as well, and you should expect it or her bosom to be the main focus whenever she is in the shot. The \"bad guys\" are horrible characters as well; one of the main antagonists is eventually revealed to be \u201ca good guy after all, yaaaaay\u201d and the audience is expected to ignore all the horrific atrocities he oversaw. Do these characters sound compelling? Well, if not, then it is because they are not characters at all; they are merely inconsistent and clich\u00e9 plot devices. Especially the women, who are all objectified to pretty much just get protected, cry, and provide fanservice. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWatch Code Geass if you have a weird Deus ex Machina fetish, but otherwise stay away. It does nothing new and it does nothing well. It doesn\u2019t even fail in an interesting or original way, destroying any chance for campy \"so-bad-it's-good\" appeal. As a result, I can't think of a single positive thing to say about it, and I have no choice but to give it a 1. \\n\\n\r\nAdditional comments: \\n\r\n1. This review covers both seasons. It would be pointless and unnecessary to write a separate review for each. Some manga series have over 40 volumes and we just write a review for them as a whole. I also fail to see why separate reviews should be written for each season when I'm just going to give each one the same score. The second season would be the inferior one due to even more plot holes, worse characters, more fanservice, and inconsistencies, but it also is more entertaining because there\u2019s less aimless filler, just in case you were wondering. The two are both 1s though. \\n\\n\r\n2. I didn\u2019t mention Shirley or Rolo when I discussed the other characters. Why? Because I\u2019m trying to forget those fuckers exist. \\n\\n\r\n3. Among my most used words for this review were \u201cinexplicably/inexplicable\u201d and \u201cinconsistency/inconsistent.\u201d Yeah, there\u2019s a very good reason for that.",

            "content": "Put on your seatbelts and brace yourself, for you will be taken on a rabidly-paced and concluding journey, slaloming through plot twists and character development at a tempo that will leave you longing for a new episode at the end of each one. Save a lot of time, for this is obnoxiously addictive. This is... Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch... R2!\r\nDid it jump the shark? Was it flawlessly executed? Could it have been improved on? Was it outright horrible? That I will not answer; such a question is for you to answer yourself. To me, it was great. It was awesome. While reluctant at first,I always ended up thinking that each change the series brought about, every little plot twist, every character development; it made the series even greater than it was. Every step that it took made it better; that is the undeniable truth for me. However, its pacing made it take too many steps in too short an amount of time, and it nearly stumbled at times. Details could be overlooked, minor events skipped, that wasn't too much of a problem. But it spent too little time on some of the major events, and in the end I'm not satisfied at all by that.\\n\\n\r\nThe previous season took care of the introduction of most of the main cast, which left an opportunity to extensively develop the cast during the second season. This was an opportunity that the creators took, used and drained to its full potential. With its 25 episodes, it does of course not have time to develop the entirety of Code Geass' cast, which is extremely large for its length - close to 80 named primary, secondary and tertiary characters. However, they developed the main cast extensively, did a great job with the supporting characters, and the new ones that were introduced were really cool too. Some may classify Lelouch's development as jumping the shark, but personally I felt that they did a great job, and that he is a great character; one whom I could believe in when it came to his development and actions, all the way to - and especially during - the very end.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect that Code Geass brings into perspective is love. There's a lot of loving going on between various characters, and this allowed for both drama and comedy to be played out, and it was done so in a very good fashion too. Several characters\u2019 love stories revolve around Lelouch, most notably those of Shirley and Kallen; both who obviously like Lelouch quite a lot. This is given both comedic and dramatic effects, and eventually plays an important part in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation superseded the previous season's, improving on nearly all points. By now you are probably used to the CLAMP-styled character designs, and who knows, you might've even grown to like them, in spite of their lankiness. Backgrounds and sceneries are done with good detail, and were enjoyable to behold, and the same can be said about the Knightmare battles. Animated in a perfect juxtapose of fluidity and chaos, mixed with great special- and ligthing effects, the battles were enjoyable aesthetically in addition to everything else they provided the viewer with.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was perfect for the series, this season as well. Keeping some old ones, introducing new ones, the soundtrack was refreshed, yet it kept the same tone it had during the previous season. The background music, while nothing especially noteworthy, provided an amplifying effect to the atmosphere; be it battle, thought, love, comedy or something else. The opening and ending themes were good this season too, with the second opening theme standing out as the best one. The final episode ended nicely with an insert song that made the scenes that unfolded before my eyes make me cry - I'm a sensitive person. They did one mistake however, and that was by not ending it after that insert song; of all things they had to fire in the Ali Project ending, which completely ruined the poignancy that had been built up.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 provides an highly entertaining sequel that has fallen into the hit-or-miss pit-trap, with hating on one side and loving on the other. How you will react to it, only the gods know that, so all that I can say is: watch it to the very end and see for yourself. The constant plot twists may sway your opinion up and down multifarious times. It did with me, but in the end, everything fell to place and all went well.\\n\\n",

            "content": "*A great sequel to Code Geass, but not quite a masterpiece.*\r\n\"Jaw dropping plot twists. Wonderful animation and soundtracks. Skillfully woven storyline with the first season. Cleverly executed ending.\"\r\nCode Geass - Hangyaku no Lelouch R2 is the long awaited sequel to the masterpiece Code Geass - Hangyaku no Lelouch. Although it was generally perceived as a piece of trainwreck, especially during the latter half of the show, there is absolutely no doubt that it has made its mark in the anime industry. To be honest, I was pretty depressed after reading some of the interviews with director Taniguchi. He acknowledge the fact that Code Geass R2is a series of \"not-as-planned\" for him and his production crew due to demands from higher up contrasting with the original plot. However, from a business perspective, Taniguchi pointed out that R2 is very successful (with the Blu Ray/DVD sales and other miscellaneous merchandises). \\n\\n\r\nIn brief, Code Geass R2 turned out to be FAR from what the director envisioned it to be. For instance, Rolo was a new character added not because Taniguchi wanted to, but rather it was due to pressure from the Sunrise executives to \"ease new viewers\". Also, Suzaku\u2019s relation to the Geass which was suppose to be a lot deeper, Kallen\u2019s father (who was mentioned in the first season), and Cecile\u2019s relationship with Suzaku (there was evidently some sort of affection between them in season one).There are many many other things that can be added to the list, but you get the drift. Despite all these train wrecks, R2 is still considered extremely successful (just like Gundam SEED Destiny) in the world of business. The main reason is simply that the companies can milk money out of our pockets due to the FABULOUS models, DVD (and re-mastered Blu Ray DVD), and other accessories. However with all that being said, who is to say that we will actually like the \"original\" Code Geass R2 more?\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nPersonally, I feel the story started out quite nicely following the events at the end of the first season. However, as the story progresses I get the feeling things are proceeding too rapidly (maybe due to time constrain?). This in turn leads to confusion for many viewers, especially those of us who rely on fansubs. Some viewers even claim that the anime is going overboard with the immense plot twists each episode. However, despite all these negative comments by some people, most fans still enjoy the \"epic-ness\" of R2 with its jaw-dropping episodes. Another way of saying it is the plot twists help drives the show! \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nI assume most viewers of R2 have seen the first season and must have, to a certain degree, be familiar with the character designs by now (and hopefully have come to accept them as well, else it can be very painful to watch). Other aspects of the animation are also very amazing even when compared to the prequel. Great CG effects tie in with detailed character design, detailed environments, plus smooth fluid animation in HD all makes R2 an outstanding piece of art. *edit* Okay...ignore the animation for 20 episode, that episode deserves like 6/10...\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nBlame ALI PROJECT for not getting a 10/10. Honestly, if they take them out, I would gladly give them perfect rating. The other OP and ED are all great and does not hurt your ears listening to them. Soundtrack-wise, they are all well done as with the first season. Sadly most of the amazing insert songs are near the end of the series though. Overall, if you liked the sound track from first season, you should not be disappointed with this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThanks to season one there weren't too many new characters that need to be introduced in great detail. Hence we get to see more character developments that was a bit lacking from the first season. It is always nice to see more \"colour\" added to each distinctive unique characters.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Impression:\\n\r\nJust because the story was completely re-rewritten for R2 doesn't mean it is horrible. In fact, I love the plot twists very much (though sometimes it does give me some overboard feel...like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann). Now let us all \"play this game of democracy, shall we?\"",

            "content": "On the surface, this looked great - promising setting, themes, characters, world. Unfortunately, all things that were clever about Season 1 were scrapped in favor of... well, I don't know, really. Shocking the audience? Misplaced fanservice?\r\nThe most glaring and obvious problem is that the cool antihero protagonist that was so refreshing in the first season got derailed into a wangsty Canon Sue. No clever tricks, determination, character growth or development, nothing but the endless loop of Oh Noes Nunnally over and over. And yet for some reason the camera refuses to leave his immediate proximity, so while the other characters and settings might have interestingpotential, all that is ignored in favor of more Lelouch-angst. And yet despite the fact that the only thing consistent about the character is his self-centered wangst and hypocrisy, every major character magically finds him loveable and sympathetic even when he's unrepentantly destroyed their lives. It's like reading through some particularly bad piece of fanfiction.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the narration then ignores are things like character development and narrative causality. The clever tactical ploys of the first season were pretty much nonexistent, relying instead on beam-spamming Super Mecha duels (y'know, the very thing that people complain about with Gundam?) and liberal application of plot-induced stupidity to the opposition, or just reiterating the exact same plans used in Season 1. Deus Ex Machina doesn't even begin to cover this. The Geass mystery that seemed so important was given no resolution and pretty much written off as a footnote.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization was about as consistent as Swiss cheese, with characters seemingly completely forgetting what they'd said or done just one episode ago and doing 180 turns with little to no exposition. Surely they could have spent some of that time wasted on fanservicy hijinks or the Endless Angst Loop fleshing out the supporting cast? Forget actual development - the more screentime a character got the less consistent their actions were, and the only characters who didn't act like they had multiple personalities were the ones too insignificant to matter. If you're going to have characters acting in ways utterly opposed to everything we've seen about them up to this point, you need to spend some time explaining to us why. Part of this can be blamed on the introduction of a whole batch of new characters while refusing to leave any of the old ones, resulting in neither old nor new characters getting enough screentime. Old characters who had outlived their story role hung out in the background but were not given any new purpose, while new characters that looked promising in concept never got enough exposition to actually live up to that promise.\\n\\n\r\nThe only really positive things I can say about R2 is that it's got pretty animation (mecha combat falls short of Macross Frontier, but it's not like Code Geass focuses much on that) and the background music, particularly the vocal pieces by Hitomi, is gorgeous. It generally manages to surprise the audience in its unpredictability, but unlike Season 1, often crosses the line into unbelievability instead. &quot;That was unpredicted but it makes sense&quot; is different from &quot;that was unpredicted and killed narrative causality&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the ideas, characters, and setting were interesting, but the script appears to have been written by a particularly indecisive committee of retarded monkeys. It's not a fault of the premise itself - the spinoffs such as games and novels manage to take those same settings and characters and actually make them interesting, or at least make sense, so I'm not sure why the supposedly high-budget anime fails so badly at doing so. It is not, of course, universally bad - there are moments of cleverness and good writing, but those moments are overwhelmingly outnumbered by the bad writing.\\n\\n\r\nR2 is fine to watch for the lolz if you turn off your brain and try not to think too hard about it, but those expecting the cleverness of Season 1 should probably stay away. If you're really into the series, read the novels/manga or write your own fanfiction, I guarantee you it'd make more sense than this drivel.",

            "content": "Code Geass R2 is, in essence, the most resounding travesty in the history of Japanese animation, and proof that anime fans will watch anything if it panders to them enough. It is to anime what Heroes is to US television, except that when Heroes became terrible midway through the viewers abandoned the series. This monstrosity only got more popular in the same situation. It's truly baffling.\r\nTo start, the story picks up right from R1(and by \"pick up\", I mean reset the whole plot), but manages to go absolutely nowhere for at least 10 episodes. The titular \"rebellion\" is cast aside into the domain of minorsub plots, like Ougi's relationship with that brown woman in the first season. Instead we get the genius Lelouch running around in meaningless fanservice episodes and battling characters with sorcerer's eyes. Remember how in season 1, the story revolved around interesting characters in a semi-realistic war in an alternate timeline of Earth? Ha. That much time into this season and the most important and game-changing thing you'll see is a C.C. upskirt. Then halfway through it meanders around some outlandish garbage in a plot entirely about two characters that for all intents and purposes died in the first season. Hell, the middle section of the show is so tacked on and meaningless I honestly can't comprehend why it was ever there to begin with. Finally, for the last half of the series the story turns at a 90 degree angle by the end of each and every episode. Lots of completely pointless and boring battles happen near the end, but it doesn't matter since the circumstances don't make much sense, no sane viewer has any emotion invested in the characters fighting, and the battle tactics that were once the high point of the series are now something you'd find Zapp Brannigan doing. This amazing torrent of plot holes, bad pacing and meaningless events reaches its climax in a contrived copout that probably wouldn't have even been that bad if the rest of the story were consistent. Or tolerable. Or comprehensible.\\n\\n\r\nAnother horrific aspect of the series is its characters. Actually, this is probably the worst part of the whole thing. The entire cast of CGR2, save for roughly four characters, is so badly written that the people on the screen can't even stick to the single sentence that defines their whole persona. Or their character is moronic. Or their main purpose is to pander to a certain sect of otaku. Or they're just boring. Or they serve no established purpose in the series at all. If someone can comment on my profile and explain why Gino, Xing Ke and Jeremiah were in this show(Crispin Freeman shouting LOYALTY is not a valid excuse for Jeremiah. Even Crispin himself doesn't know why that guy exists or is popular), that would be dandy.\\n\\n\r\n Oh yeah, and no one dies in this show except  for the obvious. Everyone else, be they exploded or hurled off a cliff, inexplicably lives for no reason other than to annoy the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's discuss the good characters in this show: Lelouch, Suzaku, Rolo. Yes, that's correct. Out of CGR2's enormous cast of about 40 recurring characters, only three are anywhere near being decent. You'd think C.C. would be on this brief listing, but she doesn't exist for half of the series and as soon as she shows up her character is completely rewritten after her only story-relevant sequence. \\n\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 is Lelouch's story, first and foremost. He is the only consistent part that holds all of this garbage together. That might've been intentional, but I'm not entirely buying it. Even so, Lelouch's character is boring, his motivations change constantly and all of his \"intelligence\" from the first season has been relegated into performing \"miracles\"(cheap/contrived/ridiculous plot twists) and sending in waves of dudes to clog the enemies' cannons. His master plan and endgame strategy seemed genius enough to thousands of idiots across the internet to give him incredible praise, but it really was just as much of a joke as the rest of his iceberg summoning and floor collapsing  antics. Think Watchmen, if it were written by a 12 year old.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have Suzaku. The Ryuho to Lelouch's Kazuma. He doesn't exist in this story until a little ways in, and doesn't do much until halfway through. He spends a lot of his time angry over what happened at the end of last season and struggling over his tool-ish idealism. In fact, all this guy does is angst about Lelouch for a majority of the time he's around. This one time he was told to protect someone, but she wandered off and died. So Suzy blamed Lelouch, because that's how he rolls. He's basically Kira Yamato with a bipolar personality and even more immortality. Suzaku's actually a rather unlikable character and his personality swings around like a pendulum, but that's about as good as it gets in this series.\\n\\n\r\nExcept for Rolo. Rolo is the best thing to come out of this trainwreck. His character, despite being introduced solely as yaoi fanservice in Suzaku's absence, is the most consistent and well written in the series by a good distance. He develops, never contradicts his purpose, and was a key point in one of the most memorable and non-idiotic scenes. Ultimately Rolo was totally unimportant, almost as if the writers set him on a shelf next to the series so he didn't get covered in the sticky, smelly substance it was leaking all over the place. So sad.\\n\\n\r\nThe final aspect of this tripe I'm going to talk about in detail is the focus. Code Geass has none. What is Code Geass about, in the end? What is its genre? Who is it marketed to? Respectively, those answers are: Nothing, All of them, and Everyone. The only unifying thing in Code Geass is Lelouch's character, but he isn't a good character. He's not as interesting as Light Yagami in terms of personality or his goals and he's not as well written as someone like Kenzou Tenma. So really, all you have is an entire story centered around this barely-above-shounen-writing guy with no prominent driving themes, commentary or anything like that.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass also attempts, and apparently succeeded, in appealing to every kind of anime fan. The series was fairly consistent and balanced during its first season, but the follow-up did nothing but shine spotlights all over its cliches and pandering features. The character designs become more fanservicey and CLAMP-y, drawing in boys and girls. The robots suddenly evolve from bipedal tanks to laser-spamming, transforming, energy shield-bearing monstrosities. The genre fluctuates between melodrama, politics, comedy, fantasy, romance, science fiction, psychological thriller, school stories and what have you depending on the episode. It just doesn't work. Taniguchi and the writers had no interest in being original or telling a cohesive story here and instead set their eyes on making tons of cash for Sunrise. \\n\\n\r\nBut yeah, the animation on the DVD versions are pretty good and the soundtrack is by one of the better guys in the business. At face value, Code Geass isn't a bad series. It's mindlessly entertaining, but the issue here is that so, so many morons think it's anything more than that, which does a disservice to people who watch good, original and well crafted Japanese animation and to the industry as a whole.",

            "content": "Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion Review:\r\nFirstly I would like to say that this review is for the entire series as a whole, NOT just for season 2. Now then....\r\nI am not a fan of mecha. There, I said it. This was the main reason why I ignored all of the suggestions and decided to put off this show for so long. However, this decision of mine to put off this show was just plain stupid and I now realize why everyone likes this show. Code Geass has become one of my favorite shows of all time and has joined Clannad and Steins;Gate on thelist of shows that I believe are truly on a different level from the rest.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10:\\n\r\nPolitics. The primary focus of the plot is politics. This is true with most shows in the mecha genre. However, Code Geass does not limit itself to just this focus. Code Geass dives into the morals of humans and the true nature of people. This is primarily seen with the main character Lelouch who is granted the ability to control other people that he makes eye contact with. With this power (and Lelouch's extremely high intelligence), Lelouch forms a rebel group known as the Black Knights to fight against the tyranny of Britannia. To add on to this, there are school life, and other non-war related plotlines that are well placed throughout the show to give you a break from the action. Now, before I watched this show I had already read about this, I thought I knew what the story was going to be like. I was wrong. The story isn't your typical rag tag group of kids trying to fight against an empire story. The story is about Lelouch. It's about Lelouch and his successes, struggles, mistakes, and changes. Although he basically IS the storyline, I will refrain from diving in further and go into more detail in the character section later. The story is one that is packed with plot twists and unexpected events (some admittedly can feel forced or leave plotholes, especially towards the end of season 2). This is more so in the first season, where the second season changes it up a bit and focuses more on the emotional aspect than the suspenseful one. Although the dynamic of the show changes between seasons, this change was necessary and really makes this show multidimensional. The writers tend to use the \"because I said so\" and \"oh it all happened in the past and we just never told you guys\" plot devices to explain a lot of events but for me this wasn't a big deal. However, I know that others absolutely hate this kind of writing so it does have to go into account in my review, dropping the story from a 10 to a 9. For all you fans of closure, the first season provides none, but the second season provides one of the greatest endings I have seen in a long time that is a lot more complex than one might first assume. The story was nothing short of brilliant, and the show's ending only justifies this, however the plot holes and poor explaining that went with some events prevent this story from being a perfect 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nAnother reason why I hesitated in watching this show was the art. I just didn't like the way all the characters looked. After watching it however, I have changed my mind. The art direction was very good, providing a wide array of characters, settings, and action. At times the action could suffer from the animation, but this was uncommon and for the most part the art was very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nLelouch's voice actor was nothing short of brilliant. Without him, I'm not sure if Lelouch would have been as interesting of a character as he was. The rest of the voice acting was solid for the most part as well. The music for the most part did nothing to stand out in any particular way. It wasn't bad. But it wasn't anything special. It served its purpose effectively and that's all that matters. The exceptions were the vocal tracks in this anime such as \"Stories\" \"Continued Story\" and \"Innocent Days\" as well as \"Madder Sky\" due to it being used during a crucial part of the last episode. Overall the sound was very good due to the voice acting however the soundtrack was hit or miss, at times it was average or not good, while a few other tracks were actually fantastic. The inconsistency prevented the sound from getting a 9 but it was great none the less.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\r\nEverybody seems to want to compare Lelouch to Light from Death Note. I can see where they're coming from (extremely smart, granted amazing power, seemingly very selfish at times). However, Lelouch has a trait that Light seems to completely lack, Lelouch actually has morals. Sometimes it is hard to see, but Lelouch fully intends to make the world a better place. He makes countless mistakes that harm others throughout his journey, and when these kind of things happen, you can clearly see Lelouch being effected by these mistakes. He may put on a face as if it is all fine, but by paying attention to his initial reactions, and the final decisions that he makes towards the end, you can tell that he fully accepts his mistakes as sins that will most likely never be forgiven. But moving on from Lelouch there are plenty of other characters. Most notably there is Suzaku. Suzaku was a character that I had strong opinions towards. What was weird however was that the writers somehow made me like him one minute, hate his ass the next, sympathize with him another, and then love him again. This of course was intentional and very well done. Suzaku is similar to Lelouch in that he has good intentions but goes about the wrong way of trying to achieve them. It's hard talking about these two without any spoilers, but realize that they are without a doubt the two most important characters, and following them both was definitely a treat. Other important characters were C.C. (aka little miss plot hole maker) and Kallen (aka fanservice). Beyond these four characters the others weren't too developed due to the sheer fact that there were so many of them. However, none of the characters were really \"bad\" besides maybe Nina. Ok yeah, Nina was awful. The fact that Lelouch was so brilliant and that, for the most part, his supporting cast was relatively strong, I really can't give the character section anything less than a 9.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nThis may be because practically every episode ended in a cliffhanger, but I could not stop watching this show. From the first episode to the last I could not stop myself from watching. I wanted to know what happened next. I wanted to know the consequences of Lelouch's actions, and how he would respond. I wanted to see in what unique way he would tactically take down all of his opponents the next time. I wanted to see how Lelouch and Suzaku's friendship would pan out. The show provides you with countless small and large desires that can get fulfilled within minutes, or not be answered until the last episode. This recipe of teasing and rewarding made this show addicting as hell and was beautifully crafted. The intriguing plot, interesting politics, and fantastic characters were melded beautifully by the writers to create a show perfectly executed to entertain the viewer. The two seasons differ in their approach, but the basic tease and deliver equation was still in place throughout it all. The first season contained a stable goal for the characters filled with shocking surprises and twists. The second season was far more inconsistent with its objective, but really delivers massive emotional punches, and eventually steers itself up for the grande finale. Code Geass was filled with practically everything you could ask for in an entertaining anime, and all these tools were utilized perfectly with fantastic execution. If there's one thing Code Geass did right, it was that it kept me entertained.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.2/10:\\n\r\nThe plot, pacing, characters, emotions, and most importantly the execution of it all are what pull Code Geass out of the crowd and make it truly something else. The plot can push towards over the top at times and trip over itself, but the overall story and the characters within it make Code Geass one hell of a ride. This show has joined Clannad (10/10) and Steins;Gate (9.5/10) as the three lone anime series that I have given a 9 or higher rating to, and is a must watch for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\nMore addicting than crack, and without the deadly side effects! Ranging from action packed, to funny, to convoluted, to tear jerking this show is something else. Truly a joy to watch and a must watch for all.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Main character is a legend\\n\r\n+ One of the greatest endings ever\\n\r\n+ Extremely addicting\\n\r\n+ Story is fantastic\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Plot holes/Writers' tendency to use the \"because i said so\" explaination\\n\r\n- There may have been too many different characters, resulting in some unnecessary or just plain weak/annoying characters (Nina)\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Code Geass, watch...\\n\r\nGuilty Crown:\\n\r\nThe shows are extremely similar in almost every aspect and both are very entertaining. However, try to keep your brain shut down a bit while watching this show because there are plenty of plotholes.\\n\r\nDeath Note:\\n\r\nThe most obvious choice mainly because of the Light/Lelouch comparison. They are both extremely intelligent and enjoyable to watch, and the shows are both intense.\\n\\n\r\n9.2/10 - Brilliant\\n\\n",

            "content": "Code Geass R2 has provoked conflicting reactions among the fan base, just like the original series did. Viewers still loved or hated it outright, even as many others laughed, and once again it's not hard to see why.\r\nI think R2 was a disappointment but not without redeeming qualities. It is an enjoyable sequel that could have used more foresight and additional planning. Maybe a little less ambition, a smaller cast of characters or better pacing would have been very welcome improvements. In the end, I appreciated Code Geass as a whole in spite of its flaws. Not the best show out there, but then againit doesn't need to be.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nAfter having to go through strangely familiar territory, Code Geass R2 finally reaches a grander scale. What began as a local rebellion ends up having larger repercussions, both directly and indirectly. And that is just the big picture. The protagonist, Lelouch, continues to keep everything together here. What remains at the core of Code Geass and its themes is his development as a character. But it is, admittedly, the kind of development that tends to take him in a far more destructive than constructive direction and this can be hard to watch, let alone swallow. Nevertheless, I believe the main plot was brought to a rather fitting, if not absolutely satisfying, conclusion as far as those terms are concerned. Unfortunately, this central focus on Lelouch was a little too dominant in the long run, at the expense of other elements.\\n\\n\r\nWe are taken through many more twists and turns this time around, which is both good and bad. From the exciting to the absolutely ridiculous, from the dramatic to the cheap, most are at least amusing. Yet there are clear pacing problems, especially towards the second half of R2, and that did affect the overall flow. I never felt really lost, but certain events were dealt with too quickly, including one climatic confrontation in particular. In retrospect, several early episodes were ultimately unnecessary and wasted valuable screen time that later developments could have used. As things stand, the show is rather messy and certain ideas received uneven amounts of attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing and direction are competent, at heart, but evidently suffer from trying to do too much, too quickly and thus may have shot themselves in the foot more than once. The first half of the series has increased fanservice, which can be occasionally distracting. Some mysteries were resolved but, unfortunately, a few unanswered questions of varying importance were also left behind and this can be annoying if not actually crippling. The show's mecha action is acceptable but lost some of its appeal due to accelerated technological progression. It's still not as much of a factor here as it would be in other series though, from my point of view, since it isn't really meant to be the main focus.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the last story arc seemed out of place at first and its very existence remains quite controversial in light of other possibilities. The ending itself, on the other hand, benefits from markedly increased attention to detail by the production staff and packs a strong emotional and thematic punch, even if the epilogue that followed it was probably too short. The final episode of Code Geass R2 gives the viewer the ability to make up his or her own mind, which is a double-edged sword. I can say the resolution worked for me, but there are different opinions. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nProduction values are still well above the average. The animation was generally alright and, in specific places, even great. Some background frames did lack quality, but not to a bothersome extent unless you know where to look. Even then, it must be pointed out that some of the worst sequences were reanimated or redrawn in time for the DVD release. The original character designs by CLAMP continue to be fairly effective and the mechanical side of things was also quite competent overall. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 had good music and, for the most part, it was used well within the show itself. Some pieces are bombastic, no doubt, as one would probably expect from a tale so intrinsically linked to having a flair for the dramatic. Several tracks from the first season make a comeback here, but there is plenty of new material. The insert songs, in particular, were very nice even if a little more elusive. The opening and ending themes are a little less memorable but certainly not bad. With one exception, maybe, as opinions may easily vary here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nLelouch is what drives Code Geass and he was still fairly successful in this regard as long as you can tolerate the story's overall direction, but he wouldn't be nearly as interesting without the ongoing dynamic between him and Suzaku, who once again played the most important supporting role. Kallen and C.C. got some attention and closure in their own right when they were given enough screen time, even if certain expectations were not met. Overall, these four characters received some development, though not without problems here and there. I suppose Rolo, Shirley and Nunnally also had their moments too, all things considered, but just barely.\\n\\n\r\nThat sounds fine, so what lowered the score then? An old issue which wasn't helped by rushed pacing: the huge cast was often misused and certain plot threads were left unresolved. Too many minor characters were introduced without giving them enough weight to stand on. Many of them didn't require much attention in the first place -I can see that the story works regardless- but others did seem to demand either more screen time or more convincing motivations. The show's antagonists, some more than others, were noticeably lacking. In the end, the picture is definitely mixed here and I can't help but feel that a lot more could have been done with a smaller number of characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 was an entertaining show, in many different ways, and I do not regret watching it. From the serious to the absurd, from cliffhanger to cliffhanger, the series succeeded in making me anticipate almost every upcoming episode. There are specific events which can't be taken seriously, at all, and the staff must surely be aware of this. But there are also some genuinely effective moments in the mix, depending on what the viewer is willing to put up with, and while the series can be rightfully accused of being emotionally manipulative it isn't nearly as senseless as it appears to be on the surface. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, R2 benefits from simply being fun to watch, even though it is very true that there were problematic issues along the way. Many of the show's flaws could have been avoided with a tighter narrative, more explanations and a far more reasonable pace. As a sequel, Code Geass R2 feels appropriate yet also disappointing. Not everyone will be happy with the end result and I have my own complaints, but Code Geass, as a whole, was a worthwhile experience.",

            "content": "I'm going to write a review about R2 that may not be well liked among Geass fans, for the low score I give it, but I ask the reader to hear me out and read this in an impartial light. \r\nFirst off, I would like to say that \"R1\" was an amazing premise, with massive twists, good characters, good plot, interesting premise and overall good execution. I did honestly like R1. R2 keeps the crisp artwork and sound style of R1, so I give those a high score, but R2 has some deep recurring flaws that pretty much butcher the series in my opinion. \r\nAllspoilers are appendixed, you can read through without spoilers of this or the first series, but some spoilers will be included to show where I'm coming from at the end of the review (but will be forecast in advance)\\n\\n\r\nThese are the two biggest elements of a character-driven story: The character development and the plot progression.\\n\r\nI'll begin with Character development, and quite frankly, there was none. I used my basic litmus test of character development and every single character failed. This test is simple, I ask \"would this character have done anything at the end of this series that they weren't willing to do at the beginning?\" Note: WILLING, not ABLE. for example, Lelouch may have been willing to do all the things he did, but unable to do them until he gained his Geass. However, his objectives, his desires, did not change at all during the whole show. This applies equally to the whole cast. Not a single one of them changes their opinions about anything, they simply change in the methods they use to achieve their goals (if even that), which is indicative of a plot without development. Now this wouldn't be such an issue to me if development hadn't been the writer's goal. When a certain character dies halfway through the series, (1) there are effectively no ramifications on the characters who should have been deeply influenced by the act. Now what this said to most viewers would have been \"this was proof of Lelouch's inner strength, a test of character\". However, to me it plays out like such: the character died, which the writer had intended to happen. The death did not have a significant impact on the plot. Thus, the character was only included to be killed off and prove Lelouch's strength. However, this also means that the character who was there was only there to be killed, which means this character was effectively treated like an object to be played with by the plot, and I feel no need to sympathise with an object. When viewed in this light, the fact that Lelouch's inner strength was tested is a moot point, because his character could have been tested in so many other ways that did not involve the writer using a character as if he/she were an object. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the biggest problem with R2, the complete lack of character development. They \"explain\" characters, they \"test\" characters, sure, but they do not \"develop\" them. Essentially, the only development that does occur happens about 10 seconds prior to the credits rolling, which is far too late to warrant me giving this series a good mark.\\n\\n\r\nThe second major problem is that R2 broke my willing suspension of disbelief. There are three main examples of this: one, where a cliffhanger fell into a cliche and overused trope area (2), which from that point on, trivialised all other cliffhangers and was a major detriment to the series. Two, the fact that a certain character survived halfway through the series despite the fact that they should have died (3), this trivialised death- if one character could survive, then they all should be able to, but they did not, which further proves to me that the writer was only killing off characters to try and induce character development, which again, proves that the writer was objectifying characters, which is the exact opposite of character development. And thirdly, the fact that there was two recurring elements effectively ignored (or \"handwaved\") as the series concludes (4/5), which shows to me that the writer was putting stuff in to make the series more interesting, not because they were actually useful as plot devices in of themselves, which trivialised the role of almost every nonmajor character and filler event.\\n\\n\r\nThe final biggest problem is the plot. In essence, about a dozen or so episodes of R2 are filler. While the series always seems to be doing something, apart from the final arcs, all it really does is tread water. Most of the subplots are irrelevant to the final outcome, as (6) shows. Basically, the plot waves its arms and creates a lot of fuss, but doesn't really *go* anywhere for almost the entirety of R2. And when it finally does pick up, it fails to have any twist at all. Cliffhangers, sure, twists, no.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, R2 took the brilliant effort of R1, but failed to run with it, effectively adding in a whole bunch of filler arcs, characters and subplots that really were irrelevant to the main plot, and failed to really develop any of the charters. As such, R2 was a major letdown for me, as it basically undermined all the efforts of R1 apart from the artwork and soundtrack.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWARNING++++SPOILER APPENDIX++++WARNING\\n\\n\r\n(1)Shirely's death, Lelouch doesn't so much as mourn, which is fine, if it weren't for the fact that they had no need to kill her, so the lack of mourning is effectively a double-negative, they cancel out the contrive death by having a contrived funeral, which breaks my willing suspension of disbelief and still fails to deliver any meaningful development.\\n\r\n(2)When the \"double\" turned out to be a \"latex perfection\" (Tvtropes term) ie: a chick wearing a mask. Pretty much a completely trivial and very unbelievable (where did they get it, why doesn't anyone else use them, etc), bending heavily my willing suspension of disbelief.\\n\r\n(3)The maid, she was ON the ship that was destroyed by the \"FLEIJA\" blast. Sure, Nannuly should have survived, but how the heck did she? She may be ninja, but come on, seriously? This SHATTERED my willing suspension of disbelief. Bandages do NOT solve all problems. She only survived by plot induced invulnerability, which completely trivialises the many deaths in the series.\\n\r\n(4)Li's recurring cough. essentially not mentioned at all by series end. What was the point of even including the thing? Fake drama, that's what. Pretty much sums up this whole series.\\n\r\n(5)The fact that \"if Lelouch's geass gets stronger....\" Well, he just puts in two contacts lenses. Again, fake drama. That's not interesting, that's disappointing.\\n\r\n(6)He TOLD THE VIEWER THE PLAN in R1. Like, literally. Sure, it wasn't for long, nor was it step-by-step, but he still did it. Pretty much forecasts the ending perfectly to someone who'd been paying attention and knows even the first thing about how martyrs work.",

The story is past-paced and compelling, in no argument it is the best factor of this anime. Code Geass R2 is filled with complex plots and subplots along with its story line that will keep you hook until the very last episode.\r\n    The setting is set in a sort of near-future war set on earth. The Holy Britain Empire, a dominate power that holds controlfor one third of the world. Even Japan has been taken over by the Britian Empire, the freedom of Japan has been lost, even its name has been replaced with a cold number, &quot;number 11&quot;. The Black Knights, which is a rebellion organization lead by the intelligent high school student, Lelouch also known as zero, has set its goal for the freedom of Japan and the downfall of the Britain Empire. Although it is fantasy, most of it reflects on the reality of today and interchanging historical events. It focuses on the negatives of autocracy government, which is the Holy Britain Empire in this case. Also it deals with the corruption of power today, and the manipulations of the media.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\n    No doubt Sunrise has spent a hell lot of money on the animation, the battle scenes are greatly done, all the movements are presented pretty smoothly. The character designs are also pretty detailed and unique. The Mechas, known as the Knightmares, are also well done.\\n\\n\r\n    The original character design is illustrated by CLAMP. The characters are then converted into animation character for the series by Sunrise's character designer Takahiro Kimura, but it is done in such a way so that the character still shows much of CLAMP's original art. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\n    The characters have distinctive personalities. There character development from the first series of Code Geass wasn't too detailed, but in R2 it shows much more colors from these characters and especially Lelouch who had to deal with responsibilities and the moral of humanity, his relationships with Nunnally, Rolo, and Suzaku are all very distinctive.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\n    With the story line, the art, and sound put together, I'd still say it's the story that stands out the most. The battle plots are thought out well, it's like rather than killing two birds with one stone, the stone would kill the birds, manipulate the nest, destory the bough, cut the tree in half, and blow up the shit hell out of everything.\\n\\n\r\n    The animation and sound are put together greatly. This anime gives greatly enjoyment indeed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNone the less, it is very enjoyable for anyone who is looking for some entertainment. I praise for the revolution.",

It is here we see the revolution come full circle. I know there are a lot of complaints about plot holes, and some extreme plot twists, but I did not see reason to complain. In anything, the impossible can be madepossible, absurdity can be made reality. Code Geass did not rip to shreds what the original series had created: it created its own. That may upset some viewers, but for the sake of storytelling and plot, I couldn't find a flaw with it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was colourful and unique, as before. There are nuanced differences, but they aren't very noticeable. If anything, it just got more colourful and crisper looking. The animation also improved.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were more developed and interesting. We see what really makes every character tick. In the first season, a lot of people were introduced, and they are fleshed out further in the second season. There is a wider cast in the the second, but these new characters are all interesting and unique as well. The entire vi Britannia family is intriguing, and you get a lot of history, development and backstory to this bunch especially.  \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed every minute of this. \\n\\n\r\nIs it good?

            "content": "I've been trying to review this series since it ended, but it's proven difficult because while I want to treat it as impartially as possible, there are a lot of factors that went into the decision-making of the series that make it hard to judge in just one way. I'm sure that that's true for a lot of series, but it's simply that I've been made all too aware about everything that had to do with this one. Being a huge fan of the first season doesn't help either.\r\nThis review may contain spoilers for the first season of Code Geass.\r\nSTORY - A lot has beenrevealed about the executive meddling and general &quot;not as planned&quot;-ness that affected R2. Suffice to say that the producers had to change many things around, not necessarily in ways they wanted, and this second season likely turned out very different from the way it was originally planned. Unfortunately, I can only talk about the final product, regardless of intentions; this has led me to feel as if I'm being unfair in any criticisms I make as far as story and character go. I guess I really have no choice in the end, but I think it's important to keep in mind that some of the more poorly executed points of this series likely resulted from the aforementioned.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 starts one year after the &quot;ending&quot; of the first season and the first episode is the first of many that invokes feelings of deja vu. Neither Code Geass nor Code Geass R2 present many themes or storylines that haven't been covered before, but the plot does do a lot of evolving and changing between the seasons. The ex-prince that wants to destroy his homeland and discover the truth ends up leading the war to end all wars, a theme especially prominent in various Gundam series. But the series' greatest strength has always been its ability to tell the story in a new and interesting way, regardless of the barebones storyline. To that end, R2 doesn't quite live up to S1's standards -- indeed, it seems to borrow heavily on structuring and story framing that was successful in the first season. Beyond the first episode, several others seem to tie in thematically to their parallels in S1, such as Shirley-centric episode 12-14 and Geass-centric 15. A lot of sequels fall into the trap of trying to repeat previous successes, but for an always-planned sequel like R2, this fixation seemed a bit out of place, even if creators were forced to shift things around some.\\n\\n\r\nThings are still interesting for the most part, but the change of course for the story (Lelouch's change of values and goals) felt somewhat choppy, and the mood changes a lot from episode to episode. S1 had its share of silliness and crack around Ashford Academy, but considering all the things that needed to be resolved in R2, I felt there were a few episodes that could have been better utilized. On the opposite end of the spectrum though, Sunrise seemed to occasionally throw 180's and give us episodes that were way out there in the left field: very WTF-inducing episodes. These episodes are what propel the story along the most, even if they often seemed abrupt in execution and occasionally anticlimactic. Despite this shaky progression, I do think that the story in R2 evolves all right enough. The supernatural elements that were kept in low profile in the first season get a little more attention... not enough to cover all the plotholes, but the final accumulation of events combines both the supernatural and the immediacy of war and revolution in a very interesting way.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest complaint I have about R2's storytelling is that death is treated in an entirely unconvincing manner. Character death almost always felt arbitrary and contrived; Sunrise already has a pretty bad rap for bringing characters back from the dead, but the number of times they did this in series is just ridiculous. Major characters, minor characters -- regardless of whether or not their death would have been significant in the long run, they went crazy with it all over the place. Characters that should have died didn't. Characters that did die don't stay dead. You get pretty jaded after a while.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, I'm actually very pleased with the ending of Code Geass R2. Even if none of the other episodes do, the last episode of R2 matches up to the last episode of S1. The drama is there; the storytelling is there. Everything is beautifully executed, and the ending is perfect in that it's open for interpretation, but it's very easy to draw a steadfast personal conclusion. Everyone can perceive an ending that makes them happy, and there's plenty of evidence both ways. Very clever, Sunrise -- at least you managed to do that part right.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - The character development in R2 is undoubtedly its greatest asset. Lelouch and Suzaku were both already complicated characters, but the situations they're forced through in this second season compound them much, much further. Their foilistic nature is emphasized again and again, and that delicious irony comes into play more than once (oh, I love irony). Idealistic Suzaku gets to play hardball through a seemingly endless string of seemingly cruel and heartless betrayals, and Lelouch the Machiavellist not only declares that &quot;love is power,&quot; but takes it upon himself to fulfill the entire world's wishes. Once again, it's very easy to become emotionally involved with these characters. You're invested in them. You hate to love them, and you love to hate them. Their pain is real; their triumph is real. It's the greatest mark of good storytelling and character development when you feel like you can cheer and cry with the characters you're watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe sad part of it all is just that a lot of secondary characters in S1 that seemed to have great potential as far as character development get short-changed in R2. Kallen's backstory involving her brother is never explained, and while Ougi still got a fair share of screentime, it never felt like it was enough to explore the depths of his character. It was frustrating because I knew he was an interesting character with a complex train of thought, but I never got to see it. Instead, I was faced with some utterly unnecessary flirtation between Chiba and Toudou; I'm glad we can to explore relationship possibilities beyond the obvious cast, but come on. I hated Rolo's guts because he acted too stereotypically, and I never felt like there was any real thoughtfulness to his character. There could have been a lot more expansion there, not to mention Lelouch's relationships with Kallen and Shirley. Having a noncommittal harem is great for fan debate, but to some extent, I expect some serious content. All too often, it seemed like his feelings for those around him were based solely on the convenience of story. He would care about Shirley if it suited the plot, and he would remember Kallen when they had time to write her back into the script seven episodes later. I know he's a better character than that -- they just don't show it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to explain without spoilers, but the irony of all the characters' roles at the end of the series is one of the things I love the most about the characters in this series. Everything is so fitting, so tragically fitting, and it's beautiful. I guess really appreciate the poetic justice of things.\\n\\n\r\nART &amp; ANIMATION - The art and animation remain consistent in R2 as in S1. The Knightmare designs are great, though I sometimes wish flying units would lose the whole angel wings gig. Damocles didn't feel like a very inspired design either, but at that point in the story, its design was the least of my concerns. CLAMP's boys are their usual noodley selves, but I find their aesthetic pointless to critique or debate at this point. Everyone has their own opinion about them, and for the most part, that isn't going to change. I appreciate CLAMP's consistency anyway, though I always find it curious that they can make characters look so pleasing and elegant while blatantly ignoring every rule of anatomy. I'm sure that real men wouldn't look good all stretched out or with shoulders four times as wide as their hips. Curious indeed.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing that's had to dispute though, it's the fact that CLAMP's facial designs allow for incredible expressiveness, especially when the emotion is sad. I absolutely adore just how stricken characters look when bad things happen to them -- sometimes, they look a little strange, outrageous and even sloppy (Lulu's shocked phone face, anyone?), but other times, the emotion is so strong that your heart just breaks for them. That such powerful art should accompany already powerful characters is great. \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - I didn't really care in one direction or another about R2's first OP/ED set, but I loved, loved, loved its second set. ALI PROJECT is usually a sure winner for me, here especially because I find their usual style very fitting to Code Geass. Edgy violins to capture that &quot;high class&quot; monarchy and shrill voices for the violence, drama, and anticipation. Perfect! I think I was coerced into liking FLOW's &quot;WORLD END&quot; because of gg's snarky captioning of a certain part of the lyrics (everything is fabulous~), but really, it's a great song that's also very fitting for the series, lyric-wise. R2's soundtrack is, naturally, similar to its first season counterpart -- both are mostly average with a few standout tracks, including some of the fight music and Britannian music (I love it when they use trumpets!). Hitomi's insert songs are, once again, very touching, emotional, and thoughtful -- I really like the haunting ambiance, and they're always used at very appropriate times. Geass's soundtrack isn't amazing, but I'd like to say that it's somewhere between good-average and great.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - As far as I know, the entire Japanese cast reprised their roles, which was excellent. I still love the insight you can gain by paying attention to how each character refers to himself, and it was interesting to see both Fukuyama and Sakurai handle Lelouch and Suzaku as they continued to develop as characters. The US dub airs this Sunday, but I imagine that most of the cast will remain the same, considering how quickly they've managed to dub it. I really do like how Lelouch and Suzaku's dub voices have turned out, not to mention Lloyd, but I still can't say the same for everyone else. (What the hell's up with Rakshata's voice??) Can't have 'um all, I guess. (Refer to my season one review for more details?)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - Code Geass R2 had a lot of issues, enough that many people have gone on to call it a veritable trainwreck. I would disagree -- considering all the obstacles they were up again, I'd say Sunrise managed to pull off a pretty damn decent job. It wasn't a disaster. The story followed through. The characters were consistent. Yes, there are a good fistful of plotholes, but I think the most important stuff (character goals and resolution) pulled through very well in the end. The fact that the ending was beautiful really helped with that, and I'm sure I'm not the only one relieved by the fact that there are no plans to make a third, tag-on season. If you liked Code Geass, I would definitely recommend seeing this series through. It's worth it in the end. If you were skeptical about Code Geass to begin with, then you might not take as kindly to R2, but I'm telling you, that ending was beautiful.",

            "content": "NaNoWriMo is an annual event in which the goal is to write a novel in 30 days. Anyone can do it, but in order to reach your goal, you often sacrifice editing, plotting a narrative, and forgetting certain character developments you meant to make. The reason I say this is because Code Geass R2 is an exact reflection of the NaNoWriMo story down to the last detail.\r\nThe first season, having been made famous by it's constant barrage of out-of-left-field cliffhangers, is constantly one-upped in the second half of anti-hero Lelouch's quest to change the world to his ideal. All questions regarding the first season's excruciatinglyambiguous finale are answered and from then on, it's a rapid-fire succession of changing hands, feints, and aces in the hole. By this means, Geass continuously refreshes audience interest, though with so many twists, it's easy to not care about them after a while.\\n\\n\r\nThe constant twists also lead to a blatant awareness that Geass R2 is being written on the fly with no real direction or end in sight, even as the episodes wind down. It's a flaw and a big one, but miraculously, Geass R2 saves itself repeatedly by revealing certain plot elements vital to the show, but only every so often so as to keep a sense of direction. All in all, the chaotic twists tip the balance between thought-out and impulsively written toward the more negative end.\\n\\n\r\nGeass R2's hodgepodge storyline is made no less confusing by its cast, which extends to the multitudes from the word &quot;go&quot;, imbuing characters only introduced late in Season 1 and adding even more to the mix as it goes along while pushing other pivotal characters from the first season way, way, way to the side. Combining the plot's chaotic movements along, we never really get a sense of character development from anyone because there simply isn't enough time. Only Lelouch, Suzaku, and C.C. get to shine, and even then it's hardly much at all. Everyone else is designated a rather flat personality, maybe a love interest, and a battle persona, and that's that.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is brought to life by some rather impressive production values on Sunrise's part. The animation is crisp, fluid, and always lively. Though CLAMP's character designs can be off-putting some of the time, it works well, and, despite how far it goes, never feels like too much of a good thing. It's not trying to be innovative, but it is excelling within the norm.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is much what you'd expect from the first season; blaring trumpets and forgettable insert songs. Though the opening themes are better than the first season's as songs, they are incredibly inappropriate given the content of the series. The end songs, on the other end of the spectrum, are both forgettable affairs.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of Code Geass R2's flaws, it is fun, and when it comes right down to it, a series that is essentially Death Note meets Gundam with rollerblading mecha and a girl with a pizza addiction should be fun. Code Geass R2 is always entertaining, even when it gets eye-roll-inducingly bizarre. This isn't so much a show that will be on an objective Top 10 list, but it's a blast start to finish. The anime equivalent of a summer Hollywood blockbuster, so to say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Code Geass R2 a 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "Well, I'm not going to be very positive about Code Geass R2. Since the first season was actually pretty good, I started to watch CG R2 in the hope that R2 would be just as great. \r\nOh, how I was dissapointed.\r\nEven though I learned that this season was 'NOT AS PLANNED', it's...bad. It's just a bad continuation on the first season. VERY bad. The start wasn't that bad, but the further the serie progresses, the more stupid it becomes.\r\nStory : 1\r\nOh come on. EVERY episode there's a dumb plottwist. They have destroyed the entire story the first season built up. Next to that there's aton of plotholes. I seriously cannot believe that anyone would believe that this is good stuff. Most of the plottwists are just stupid. \\n\r\nWHERE DO ALL THE KNIGHTMARES COME FROM? It was getting more and more like Dragonball Z thanks to those.\\n\r\n'THIS ISN'T EVEN 10% OF IT'S OUTPUT YET!!11&quot;\\n\r\nAlso, dead characters should STAY dead. The story is horrible. HORRIBLE.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nNo matter how bad the series have become, the art is still pretty good. It's good too look at, nothing too special but it's better than I've seen in some series. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nI do not like the second OP en ED. That was the only downpart to season one as well. The OP and ED sucked after a while. I didn't really notice any good BGM.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nIn season one, the characters were great. In season 2, LOL PLOTTWIST! LOL CHARACTER CHANGING! LOL DIFFERENT GOAL! etc. I'm not going to waste more words on this... \\n\r\nOh, I forgot, they screwed every character up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nI just watch it now to see what kind of stupid plottwist they give it. Seriously. It's enjoyable somewhere, but that's mostly because it's so stupid.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nSeason one was much better. This season is full of plotholes. It looks like DBZ and some of the character revelations are just stupid. This show is very overrated. I can see what some people like in it, but they just don't pay enough attention to the story imo. \\n\r\nThe ending was actually decent, compared to some episodes, but that doesn't mean a lot.",

            "content": "After a hugely successful season 1, we have the highly anticipated sequel, Code Geass R2.\r\nStory: 3\r\nThe story involved a reset but kicked off to a very strong, solid start with Lelouche as cunning as ever in getting his ways.  However, around 1/3 into the season it all starts falling apart.  We start getting rather outrageous, unplausible plot twists and sequence of events.  While this has happened in Season 1, R2 takes \"outrageous, unplausible\" to an entirely new level which continues right until the end of the series where finally, the ending had a very good twist to it.\r\nThe mecha battles have alsosuffered from the same problems from Gundam Seed Destiny - a few Nightmares that are just so ridiculously powerful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nIf you can stand the stick-thin characters (I knocked a mark off for this), then the art is pretty damn good.  The colours are vivid and the costumes varied in design.  The animation was also rather smooth as well.  Overall, it's good but not exceptional.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nGeass has a rather unique soundtrack style and I especially enjoyed the jazzy battle themes and Hitomi's vocal tracks.  Hitomi's track which was played in the finale had a very appropriate feel and was awesome.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I found many of the choices for the OP/ED rather questionable!\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nA very large cast which was rather interesting in season 1 but with the butchering of the storyline, also came the butchering of the characters.  The large cast prevented the development of key characters and they often made superficial appearances.  Kallen, as awesome as she is was totally lacking towards the end of the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nDespite the negativity, I did rather enjoy watching this series.  It was whacky and corny which may be the wrong reason to enjoy a show, but that's how I managed to derive lots of enjoyment from.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nGeass R2 shone well in some aspects but was totally lacking in other departments.  It had such a huge potential yet I feel it was utterly wasted.  R2 wasn't a total disaster but it could have been so much better.",

            "content": "\"All the world's a stage,\r\nAnd all the men and women merely players;\r\nThey have their exits and their entrances;\r\nAnd one man in his time plays many parts...\" - Shakespeare\r\nSTORY:  \r\nI felt that this was the best way to wrap up this show overall.  There were numerous plot twists, most of which significantly alter the storyline and circumstances of the main characters.  It follows the classic formula of best friends as the best kind of enemies and keeps you guessing.  However, one of its strong points is that some of the twists can be predicted if one is observant enough.  It doesn'tpull punches either for the sake of the viewer's sensibilities but rather always works towards progressing the story in the most dramatic way possible.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nNot the place that makes or breaks this show.  The animation is solid and at times displays great detail, especially in the fight sequences.  \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe music and sound effects were also solid.  There may be shows that do a better job of matching the action or plot with the perfect music, but Code Geass uses the right tempermant for the various scenes and shines in the truely dramatic moments.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nAnother big strength of this show.  Not only does Code Geass feature compelling protagonists/antagonists throughout, the roles are constantly in motion.  The use of anti-heroes and anti-villians as well as the more traditional character models makes for very interesting interactions and strange alliances.  Through the characters the show also confronts the viewer with conflicting views of morality, different individuals will see the characters in different lights.  Where one person sees an anti-hero another will see an anti-villian or antagonist etc.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI never stopped sitting at the edge of my seat.  Its the type of show that you can think about all week while you wait for the new episode.  The show is very rewatchable, you will notice new things everytime through, I know I have.  Finally, surprising you every episode with a twist while still throwing you bone that you might be able to predict keeps you engaged.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThis is one of the best anime shows I have seen so far.  Many peeople will find similarities to Death Note throughout the story but with one major improvement, the ending.  \\n",

            "content": "Generally I review only the anime that haven't been reviewed but Code Geass R2 affected me so much I had to write a review. RL Context: Work and other RL obligations had kept me from anime for a while. Coming back to anime and starting with .Hack/Sign wasn't the smartest thing to do. Thank god the next anime I saw was this one, or I would probably have gone on another anime hiatus. \r\nStory\r\nThis anime is quite difficult to describe without spoilers since the plot is one of the best I've seen to date and each episode has many talking points - just look atthe sheer number of posts in each episode discussion. Overall, it's complex, full of twists and fast paced. There is a perfect blend of tons of action, cool mecha, comedy, romance, emotion, drama - you want it, it's here in this series. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no possibility to get bored with this anime. I was guessing and most of my guesses went wrong! There were many &quot;Whaatt??&quot;, &quot;I don't believe it!&quot; and &quot;Nooo!&quot; moments. This anime pulls you in and doesn't let you go till it ends. Every episode leaves you wanting more. I was sad when it ended.  Now that's a good story. Kudos to whoever wrote the manga - thank you for this gift.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nThe amazing thing about this anime is there are no &quot;throw away&quot; characters. Every character is well realized and developed, even the small minor ones. Just when you think you have them figured out something happens that opens your eyes anew! They all provoke a reaction from the watcher, whether negative or positive, or negative turned to positive, or positive to negative, but there is a reaction which mostly changes over time. They engaged me so much I got INVOLVED in this anime. Wow, it's been a long time since I felt so much emotion, anticipation and enjoyment from watching an anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation and sound\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was awesome. There's none of the Super-deformed kawaii/joke mode. Fingers, eyes and hair are particularly well drawn, as is the cleavage of Kallen and Millay in particular (hey, I may be female but I still recognize fan-service). Just look at the ending animation - it's just beautiful. No other word for it. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending song wasn't that good or this would have had all perfect 10s. That being said the sound effects were perfect especially when combined with the well realized mecha in all the fight scenes. Overall, those were brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 blew me away. This anime reminded me strongly WHY everyone should watch anime. In total, it is a joy to watch. If I have time I will rewatch it. Episode 19 in particular. Genius. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed an anime so much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nThis deserves it's place as the #5 ranked anime on this list. I liked season 1 but R2 is even better. Up to the last episode and they're still coming up with twists. There's really nothing I disliked about this outstanding anime. For those who haven't seen it, please watch this (after seasion 1 of course). Part of me wants a season 3 but the other half of me fears it might detract from the satisfying conclusion of R2. Perfection sometimes doesn't require a third act.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Code Geass R2 is one of the most highly anticipated anime sequels and it certainly manages to please the fans of its original Supernatural, Mecha, Drama, Action anime. Nonetheless it is easy to compare it to its more well-thought-out prequel.\r\nThe story continues a year after the events of the Black Rebellion and it begins in the same manner as before; setting the scene with 2 intense, action-packed episodes. After that it takes a while for the story to gain some momentum, so you just have to get through the first couple recycled episodes until things get exciting. Lelouch still has the same motivation to putan end to his father\u2019s Britannian Empire nevertheless, how he will achieve it still remains a mystery, which is what makes the series so exciting to watch. Although part way through the intricate storyline the situation sort of goes haywire, as if the story acquires a mind of its own. Unlike the first season\u2019s in-depth storyline and thought provoking concept, this season tends to dumb things down a level by adding random developments and plot twist after plot twist, just for the writer\u2019s convenience. It also doesn\u2019t help that so much goes unexplained till the end, like the Emperor\u2019s motive and it didn\u2019t resolve things well either.\\n\\n\r\nWe have the same awesome cast of characters as before and with Lelouch & Suzaku\u2019s complex rivalry still there to add some spice to the mix. The introduction of many new characters is certainly welcomed here but there are also some that are unwelcomed to the story. In the end, the character aspect that I thought would remain the same throughout was partially ruined when certain characters underwent dramatic changes and others where killed off, once they fulfilled their purpose in the story. \\n\\n\r\nWell Sunrise must have had some spare cash because the production values are through the roof. The animation quality is so amazing and compared to the prequel, you\u2019ll be in for a real treat. Immensely detailed environments, slender CLAMP character designs, seamless CG effects and fluid action sequence are all here. Also the character gestures (especially Lelouch\u2019s) are just as exaggerated as before.\\n\\n\r\nThey don\u2019t skimp on the music either as there\u2019s an awesome soundtrack, which works well during both the exciting action and intense drama. On the other hand the music does get pretty messed up during the chaotic battles, as it constantly switches from one fanfare to the next. The OP and ED themes may take some getting used to but they are still pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this still remains as one of the most exciting mecha anime series of all time but a lot had to be sacrificed to get it there (characters, realism, logic). Just like in most mecha anime you can expect far too much time spent in cockpit-chat yet the battles remain as theatrical as ever before. Still it manages to fail in more areas than the first season such as: the pointless fanservice, over dramatizing scenes and typical Sunrise clich\u00e9s (characters surviving the impossible). So for those hoping for an even more intense experience than the first season may be somewhat let down, however this is still an amazing series.",

            "content": "Code Geass R2 is one of the best examples of how a very theatrical and over-the-top show that doesn't take itself too seriously can succeed by maximizing entertainment value. It is a series that shamelessly and knowingly appeals to the masses yet, surprisingly enough, somehow manages to keep a few thematic strengths beneath the surface to make the results worthwhile.\r\nFor you see, Code Geass in general is more than the sum of its parts. It's got flaws, sure, but I would argue they are almost besides the point. Well, at least as long as you're willing to play along with what the staff intended toaccomplish here. Needless to say, that can be much easier said than done.  \\n\\n\r\nIn essence, both the original Code Geass and R2 are quite emotional and youth-oriented in nature. There is no attempt to maintain plausibility in this show, so those looking for a serious take on alternate history or a down-to-earth war story shouldn't bother watching. That doesn't mean it is not without some internal logic, as twisted as it might be, but you absolutely need to learn to enjoy the craziness without entirely losing your mind or nerves in the process. \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the setting and world view. It is a rather whimsical fictional universe, no matter how you choose to look at things. What we have in this story is a world that liberally mixes futuristic science fiction with medieval fantasy right from its initial inception.\\n\\n\r\nOne the one hand, there are fantastical magical abilities, such as the power of Geass itself and everything related to it, along with powerful robots called Knightmare Frames that come in all sorts of varieties and colors. Some Knightmare models would be right at home in classic Real Robot mecha series such as Mobile Suit Gundam or Armored Trooper Votoms, while others appear to be more inspired by productions with a clear Super Robot touch, like Mobile Fighter G Gundam or Overman King Gainer among others. Code Geass R2 especially shows us a preference for the latter, roughly speaking, although without the quasi-organic look.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have emperors, princes, princesses and knights who often wear capes, use swords and speak using rather operatic and grandiose expressions or exaggerated hand gestures, along with a larger-than-life plot that combines shades of political intrigue with Japanese high school antics, robot warfare and constant one-upmanship, philosophical introspection and fanservice. A little bit of everything, one way or another, can be found here.\\n\\n\r\nOn paper, this sort of contradiction shouldn't work at all. For the more critical viewers, perhaps it never could have and never did. But strangely enough, I find myself in genuine disagreement. \\n\\n\r\nWhy? Because the show has just enough mad energy and self-aware bravado to pull it off. There are numerous signs that the production staff knew exactly what they were doing. Code Geass R2 is not attempting to present a series of events worthy of being included as part of a historical documentary. No, it's a work of pure entertainment, where by their own admission the writers loved coming up with crazy scenarios from week to week, as well as poking fun at themselves and their own work. Even at the expense of the poor characters, it must be said, who are trapped in the context of a story where their own relatively serious attitudes are at odds with almost everything that is going on. They are all playthings, at heart, used for the game called entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nFar too often, certain observers will tend to confuse the presence of drama with absolute seriousness, when the reality is that a show like this one is a case of tragicomedy and camp at work, deliberately combining or switching between humor and tragedy, sometimes within the same sequence of a given episode. \\n\\n\r\nWhy do all these unrealistic plans work? Why does Suzaku keep doing his spinkicks? Why is Sayoko a Ninja Maid? Why does Orange-kun steal the spotlight at times? Why does Emperor Charles have a ridiculous hair style and later goes flying off like a rocket? Why did a million people suddenly show up wearing the same costume? Because the staff found all of this amusing and, rightfully or wrongfully, thought the audience would derive the same sort of amusement from making such a flashy production. Considering the absurdly large popularity of the show at its height, I would argue that this wasn't an incorrect assumption.\\n\\n\r\nBut Code Geass is, one way or another, special because it manages to be more than just that. Which is why I must also touch upon some of the more interesting aspects of the show, regardless of how they weren't necessarily the primary focus point of R2 at all times.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, known as either Lelouch Lamperogue or Lelouch vi Britannia and particularly famous as the fabulous masked vigilante Zero, is a Byronic hero. That's a large part of what makes the series so attractive. Both his personality and the dynamics he develops with other characters, especially Suzaku, are a lot of fun to watch and quite intriguing to analyze. As a mastermind character with exaggerated speech patterns and physicality, Lelouch wears the clothes of a Light Yagami clone in the style of Death Note, but in reality he cannot entirely cope with the role. Which is what makes him more fallible and thus, I would argue, human. Humans -even so-called geniuses- can be perfectly irrational, contradictory and free to make mistakes that an omniscient spectator would consider foolish or worse. Humans are not perfect, not even the smartest ones. Much less those that are unstable teenagers or young adults, like Lelouch and most of the cast. \\n\\n\r\nAmong the other characters Suzaku, in particular, is worth mentioning because he is often the most misunderstood. Suzaku, comparable to but unlike Lelouch, also wears a mask that hides his real intentions...yet the trick is it isn't a physical one. He also has his own set of conflicting thoughts and emotions, explaining his behavioral changes between season one and R2, as well as his tortured path through the twists and turns of Code Geass R2 until the ending. Suzaku is a living contradiction who initially follows ideals that he doesn't entirely believe in, deep down, and as they break down the plot itself ultimately has him acknowledge this fact.\\n\\n\r\nLelouch wants to do good too, or so he tells himself, but cannot escape the direct and indirect consequences of his actions -as well as a lot of gratuitous bad luck- despite his outward attempts to portray himself as a demon or dark prince figure. The emphasis made on this sort of inner conflict is what makes Lelouch less of a product of the modern era and more of a throwback to 18th or 19th Century Romanticism, which is fitting considering the obvious neo-medieval aesthetic of the production. Romanticism appealed to emotion, not reason, and looked back to the Middle Ages, rejecting the Enlightenment's obsession with making everything out to be scientific at its core. As a Romantic character, Lelouch has access to a much wider range of emotions than other masterminds, who might have employed more plausible methods in their planning but tend to be far too aloof and distant in comparison. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality was standard for a television anime. Not particularly great as a whole, to be honest, but  nothing too bad either. You could even call it functional. I was actually rather impressed by the original soundtrack though, and would definitely recommend giving the background music compositions a good listen even outside the context of the show. \\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, there is no denying that Code Geass R2 isn't exactly perfect.  Oh, far from it. In some ways it is worse than the first series, by a significant degree, as it contains elements that several viewers might find fairly annoying to sit through. \\n\\n\r\nThe constant twists can get tiresome towards the final stages and, for all their contributions to increasing the fun factor, the way they risk detracting from the execution of the more interesting elements isn't a good thing. In fact, there were specific developments that suffered from a visible degree of popular backlash, which could have been avoided by slowing the pace and spacing things out to provide more details.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some cases of characters switching allegiance far too quickly, and that can be frustrating to witness even when there are valid reasons, some better than others, explaining their behavior in retrospect. In particular, a certain event involving the Black Knights should work fine on paper, when you  take a look at the general framework, but needed to be far better scripted and less rushed in practice. Instead, it comes off as a bit too petty. \\n\\n\r\nThat's part of why Code Geass R2 tends to challenge the average person's suspension of disbelief so much, especially for those who want to take Code Geass as a completely serious narrative when that's far from being the case. The more one looks into the real intentions of the creators, the more one realizes that respecting or maintaining any semblance of realism or absolute seriousness wasn't their main objective at all. \\n\\n\r\nNo matter what, the second half of the tale of Lelouch is an entertaining adventure with a few interesting complexities deserving of appreciation. But in the end, what we have here is a crazy anti-heroic neo-medieval romance, intended to keep the audience amused and having a good time, regardless of whatever else it could have been if it had chosen to follow another path. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5/10",

            "content": "As this is a review of a sequel, I believe that the reader is already familiar/has watched the first season of Code Geass.\r\nCode Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2 is both more of the same and yet a departure for the series in several ways. On one hand, it\u2019s often even more ridiculous and over the top than its predecessor, and on the other surprisingly dramatic, with an emotional resonance not found in the first season. This results in the show feeling more like a reboot/reimagining of the series rather than a simple continuation of the storyline. Now to be sure, many of the classic Geassmoments of the first season are present, however, this time around things feel very different in ways that are superior to the original even if R2 itself can't quite top the overall impact of its predecessor. Some will feel that R2 wasn't as good as the first season but it does live up to the Code Geass franchise.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Code Geass R2 continues the story of Lelouch Lamperouge and the Black Knights as they continue their fight against the Holy Britannian Empire. We are introduced to more characters including new allies, enemies, and Nightmare Frames. As the series progresses new factions are introduced and new alliances formed, with plot twists abound. The plot twists in R2 are even more abundant, and at times even more implausible and unexpected than the first season, with every episode essentially ending in a cliffhanger. However, the characters this time around are far more likable, even if they are so numerous that many of them, unfortunately, end up being underdeveloped. And while the show starts off slow, the plot eventually moves forward very fast and while stumbles somewhat near the climax, manages to pull off a remarkably well-crafted resolution at the end. Fans who were disappointed by the way the first season ended will undoubtedly be satisfied with the bizarre ending of R2.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Here's a series that has real emotional depth and dramatic resonance. Now to be clear, by no means is this a primary focus of R2, however, the actions and motivations of the characters and the events themselves seem to have greater meaning and purpose. The range of emotions felt by the characters is better conveyed: we feel their desperation and determination, their sadness and joy, their anger and regret. Characters that seemed so empty or clich\u00e9d in the first season are given greater depth and expression, with exceptions of course. Lelouch, in particular, is a far more interesting character this time around, and his inner conflict and desire for self-resolution. He'll do things that you wouldn't expect him to do. Also, his changing relationships with his comrades and enemies alike act as a drive that propels the show from a mere continuation into a rejuvenation of the series. Lelouch fans will definitely find him more interesting and amazing as well as the other characters. Especially Kallen.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: SUNRISE and CLAMPE have definitely outdone itself. The visuals of R2 are not just better than the original, but are also some/one of the best I've seen (though somewhat expected considering them using an extraordinary amount of budget.) R2 is definitely more flashier and colorful than ever before, the high quality of the visuals consistently impresses from one episode to the next. The characters and backgrounds are incredibly detailed and the large-scale action sequences are spectacular to watch. The only gripe I have is that the animation itself often lacks fluidity, especially during some of the more hectic action sequences. This didn't really take much away from the actual quality of the visuals but it is rather noticeable nevertheless. Actually, with the action and everything going on, you won't even notice the lack of fluidity. And while SUNRISE doesn't quite stand at the absolute top-tier level in terms of overall animation quality, R2 represents their best work since their old age of shows like Cowboy Bebop. In terms of the animation, Code Geass R2 sure have one of the best this year.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The audio is just as impressive as the visuals, with great sound effects and the solid voice acting (Jun Fukuyama, Ami Koshimizu, Yukana, etc)  you've come to expect from the first season. The music, on the other hand, is more of a mixed bag. The soundtrack itself is solid, a score that is well suited for the mixture of tones that a series like Geass goes through. The theme songs, conversely, are merely mediocre and all but one remains memorable. The pop theme surely is one of my favorite having listen to the songs many times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While watching, you'll be hooked onto the episodes and you might even finish the whole series in less than two days. This show will leave you wanting more and more till you have completed it. You might even want to re-watch the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Code Geass R2 is a series that almost every Code Geass fan will be happy to watch - for newer fans watching the first season is recommended. While its approach is often divergent from the first, it shares enough absurdities and overindulgence that those who didn't like the first series will most likely detest this one. Yet for all its flashiness, its superficiality and its dangerously complex back-story, this is still a far more entertaining series than most of the other shows out there. Again, Code Geass R2 proves that entertainment doesn't always have to be meaningful, just enjoyable. If you didn't enjoy the first season, then you most likely will not enjoy R2.",

            "content": "Code Geass is the dumbest show to ever take itself seriously. It is essentially a hackneyed amalgamation of clich\u00e9s and overused plot devices that clumsily attempts to disguise itself as something greater. Hell, it stole Death Note\u2019s whole shtick, and ruined it completely, before the anime version even finished airing. It blatantly stole from Evangelion, the most popular mecha anime and deconstruction there is, to make one of the weakest and most clich\u00e9 mecha series ever. Both of the series Code Geass stole from were dark and had at least some depth; Code Geass, on the other hand, juxtaposes pseudo-dark scenes with light school-life haremromcom. Plot develops with a marked carelessness; people die and are inexplicably brought back to life, even though they were either shown dying or there was clearly no way they could have possibly lived. Plot armor at its finest. Oh, did you want an epic and dense war story? Too bad, instead you\u2019re going to get aimless filler, centered on a bunch of people who probably shouldn\u2019t even be in high school, including an episode dedicated to catching a cat. This anime is most notable for having one of the highest concentrations of plot holes and loose ends that I have ever seen. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the supernatural aspect of the story is just ridiculous and, by extension, the story is as well. This \u201cGeass\u201d ability is completely inconsistent. Sometimes it can be deterred with mere willpower, or even the power of kisses (no joke,) but most of the time it appears to be pretty much undefeatable. There is a Geass canceller that is developed, but it is inexplicably given to only one dude who just pops up whenever he feels like it, with a different personality every time. A weakness, where the ability becomes uncontrollable, introduces itself at one point, but this plot point is quickly dealt with and forgotten. Every Geass user has one single ability granted by their Geass, except for one guy that inexplicably has several, but I won\u2019t even get into that. The biggest issue is that the conflict is all entirely pointless, as Lelouch\u2019s ability allows him to give anybody a command that they must obey. Hell, it can apparently even work on God. This command only works once, but the show makes it entirely clear that he could simply give a command along the lines of \u201cyou will be my slave and do whatever I say, until I do x.\u201d So why doesn\u2019t he do that from the very beginning? Because the story must be milked for two seasons, I guess. The whole anime could have ended in episode 1 had Lelouch, the supposed genius, made better use of his ability. Despite this, everything that was built up in the first season is destroyed in the most anticlimactic ending I have ever seen, the show returns to square one, and we have to go through the same style of drawn-out story arc in season two. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization is probably the biggest flaw in Code Geass. The characters are irritating, flat, inconsistent, contrived, and they alone destroy any possibility of this being even a decent anime. The main character, Lelouch, is good at chess and inexplicably predicts a lot of minor events a bit before they happen. This is how we know he\u2019s a genius. He makes a lot of dumb decisions, he wastes troops and resources, he kills potential allies, he spares enemies, he gets caught in needless battles, he makes emotional decisions in battle, he accidentally orders massacres, he never makes a proper back-up plan to deal with things he knows are like to happen, and we never get any indication that he knows the first thing about proper tactics, but he somehow wins battles and he\u2019s somehow a genius. Go figure. Luckily, all \u201ctactics\u201d were just replaced with boring beam spamming in the end, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really much better. Any development in Lelouch\u2019s character is completely contrived and comes out of nowhere. Additionally, he has the inexplicable ability to teleport; at least, that would be the only explanation for how he travels such huge distances so quickly. Suzaku, the kind-of antagonist kind-of not, is probably the dumbest anime character ever created. He is Lelouch\u2019s friend, and if he was a Jew during the holocaust he would do his very best to argue that Hitler is actually an okay guy after all. He believes that the corrupt government should be changed from the inside. So does he get into politics to accomplish this? No, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really allowed to; instead, he (inexplicably) becomes a mecha pilot for the military that is slaughtering and oppressing his people. He fails to see how this is not helping them. He also moves like a ninja, and dodges bullets, despite being quite clearly anorexic. I\u2019m not even going to talk about their goddawful character designs, just look at some screen shots for that one. All I\u2019ll say on that topic is this: if you\u2019re going to act like a character is hot, then don\u2019t make them an extraordinarily and inhumanly ugly emo anorexic with a ridiculously pointy chin. As for the other characters, there\u2019s some annoying racist yandere lesbian who sexually assaults a table at one point. Seriously. There\u2019s also some immortal chick with green hair who likes pizza; not much else to say about her. There\u2019s an irritating crippled chick, with a completely inconsistent personality, who mostly serves to be useless and need constant protection. Really, for about 90% of the plot, her character just exists to get kidnapped. There\u2019s also some redhead with big tits who loves the main character and has big tits, has a drug addict mother who we forget about for most of the series, and can inexplicably pilot mechas with her big tits and has big tits plus a pair of large breasts. She has a nice ass as well, and you should expect it or her bosom to be the main focus whenever she is in the shot. The \"bad guys\" are horrible characters as well; one of the main antagonists is eventually revealed to be \u201ca good guy after all, yaaaaay\u201d and the audience is expected to ignore all the horrific atrocities he oversaw. Do these characters sound compelling? Well, if not, then it is because they are not characters at all; they are merely inconsistent and clich\u00e9 plot devices. Especially the women, who are all objectified to pretty much just get protected, cry, and provide fanservice. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWatch Code Geass if you have a weird Deus ex Machina fetish, but otherwise stay away. It does nothing new and it does nothing well. It doesn\u2019t even fail in an interesting or original way, destroying any chance for campy \"so-bad-it's-good\" appeal. As a result, I can't think of a single positive thing to say about it, and I have no choice but to give it a 1. \\n\\n\r\nAdditional comments: \\n\r\n1. This review covers both seasons. It would be pointless and unnecessary to write a separate review for each. Some manga series have over 40 volumes and we just write a review for them as a whole. I also fail to see why separate reviews should be written for each season when I'm just going to give each one the same score. The second season would be the inferior one due to even more plot holes, worse characters, more fanservice, and inconsistencies, but it also is more entertaining because there\u2019s less aimless filler, just in case you were wondering. The two are both 1s though. \\n\\n\r\n2. I didn\u2019t mention Shirley or Rolo when I discussed the other characters. Why? Because I\u2019m trying to forget those fuckers exist. \\n\\n\r\n3. Among my most used words for this review were \u201cinexplicably/inexplicable\u201d and \u201cinconsistency/inconsistent.\u201d Yeah, there\u2019s a very good reason for that.",

            "content": "Put on your seatbelts and brace yourself, for you will be taken on a rabidly-paced and concluding journey, slaloming through plot twists and character development at a tempo that will leave you longing for a new episode at the end of each one. Save a lot of time, for this is obnoxiously addictive. This is... Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch... R2!\r\nDid it jump the shark? Was it flawlessly executed? Could it have been improved on? Was it outright horrible? That I will not answer; such a question is for you to answer yourself. To me, it was great. It was awesome. While reluctant at first,I always ended up thinking that each change the series brought about, every little plot twist, every character development; it made the series even greater than it was. Every step that it took made it better; that is the undeniable truth for me. However, its pacing made it take too many steps in too short an amount of time, and it nearly stumbled at times. Details could be overlooked, minor events skipped, that wasn't too much of a problem. But it spent too little time on some of the major events, and in the end I'm not satisfied at all by that.\\n\\n\r\nThe previous season took care of the introduction of most of the main cast, which left an opportunity to extensively develop the cast during the second season. This was an opportunity that the creators took, used and drained to its full potential. With its 25 episodes, it does of course not have time to develop the entirety of Code Geass' cast, which is extremely large for its length - close to 80 named primary, secondary and tertiary characters. However, they developed the main cast extensively, did a great job with the supporting characters, and the new ones that were introduced were really cool too. Some may classify Lelouch's development as jumping the shark, but personally I felt that they did a great job, and that he is a great character; one whom I could believe in when it came to his development and actions, all the way to - and especially during - the very end.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect that Code Geass brings into perspective is love. There's a lot of loving going on between various characters, and this allowed for both drama and comedy to be played out, and it was done so in a very good fashion too. Several characters\u2019 love stories revolve around Lelouch, most notably those of Shirley and Kallen; both who obviously like Lelouch quite a lot. This is given both comedic and dramatic effects, and eventually plays an important part in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation superseded the previous season's, improving on nearly all points. By now you are probably used to the CLAMP-styled character designs, and who knows, you might've even grown to like them, in spite of their lankiness. Backgrounds and sceneries are done with good detail, and were enjoyable to behold, and the same can be said about the Knightmare battles. Animated in a perfect juxtapose of fluidity and chaos, mixed with great special- and ligthing effects, the battles were enjoyable aesthetically in addition to everything else they provided the viewer with.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was perfect for the series, this season as well. Keeping some old ones, introducing new ones, the soundtrack was refreshed, yet it kept the same tone it had during the previous season. The background music, while nothing especially noteworthy, provided an amplifying effect to the atmosphere; be it battle, thought, love, comedy or something else. The opening and ending themes were good this season too, with the second opening theme standing out as the best one. The final episode ended nicely with an insert song that made the scenes that unfolded before my eyes make me cry - I'm a sensitive person. They did one mistake however, and that was by not ending it after that insert song; of all things they had to fire in the Ali Project ending, which completely ruined the poignancy that had been built up.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 provides an highly entertaining sequel that has fallen into the hit-or-miss pit-trap, with hating on one side and loving on the other. How you will react to it, only the gods know that, so all that I can say is: watch it to the very end and see for yourself. The constant plot twists may sway your opinion up and down multifarious times. It did with me, but in the end, everything fell to place and all went well.\\n\\n",

            "content": "*A great sequel to Code Geass, but not quite a masterpiece.*\r\n\"Jaw dropping plot twists. Wonderful animation and soundtracks. Skillfully woven storyline with the first season. Cleverly executed ending.\"\r\nCode Geass - Hangyaku no Lelouch R2 is the long awaited sequel to the masterpiece Code Geass - Hangyaku no Lelouch. Although it was generally perceived as a piece of trainwreck, especially during the latter half of the show, there is absolutely no doubt that it has made its mark in the anime industry. To be honest, I was pretty depressed after reading some of the interviews with director Taniguchi. He acknowledge the fact that Code Geass R2is a series of \"not-as-planned\" for him and his production crew due to demands from higher up contrasting with the original plot. However, from a business perspective, Taniguchi pointed out that R2 is very successful (with the Blu Ray/DVD sales and other miscellaneous merchandises). \\n\\n\r\nIn brief, Code Geass R2 turned out to be FAR from what the director envisioned it to be. For instance, Rolo was a new character added not because Taniguchi wanted to, but rather it was due to pressure from the Sunrise executives to \"ease new viewers\". Also, Suzaku\u2019s relation to the Geass which was suppose to be a lot deeper, Kallen\u2019s father (who was mentioned in the first season), and Cecile\u2019s relationship with Suzaku (there was evidently some sort of affection between them in season one).There are many many other things that can be added to the list, but you get the drift. Despite all these train wrecks, R2 is still considered extremely successful (just like Gundam SEED Destiny) in the world of business. The main reason is simply that the companies can milk money out of our pockets due to the FABULOUS models, DVD (and re-mastered Blu Ray DVD), and other accessories. However with all that being said, who is to say that we will actually like the \"original\" Code Geass R2 more?\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nPersonally, I feel the story started out quite nicely following the events at the end of the first season. However, as the story progresses I get the feeling things are proceeding too rapidly (maybe due to time constrain?). This in turn leads to confusion for many viewers, especially those of us who rely on fansubs. Some viewers even claim that the anime is going overboard with the immense plot twists each episode. However, despite all these negative comments by some people, most fans still enjoy the \"epic-ness\" of R2 with its jaw-dropping episodes. Another way of saying it is the plot twists help drives the show! \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nI assume most viewers of R2 have seen the first season and must have, to a certain degree, be familiar with the character designs by now (and hopefully have come to accept them as well, else it can be very painful to watch). Other aspects of the animation are also very amazing even when compared to the prequel. Great CG effects tie in with detailed character design, detailed environments, plus smooth fluid animation in HD all makes R2 an outstanding piece of art. *edit* Okay...ignore the animation for 20 episode, that episode deserves like 6/10...\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nBlame ALI PROJECT for not getting a 10/10. Honestly, if they take them out, I would gladly give them perfect rating. The other OP and ED are all great and does not hurt your ears listening to them. Soundtrack-wise, they are all well done as with the first season. Sadly most of the amazing insert songs are near the end of the series though. Overall, if you liked the sound track from first season, you should not be disappointed with this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThanks to season one there weren't too many new characters that need to be introduced in great detail. Hence we get to see more character developments that was a bit lacking from the first season. It is always nice to see more \"colour\" added to each distinctive unique characters.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Impression:\\n\r\nJust because the story was completely re-rewritten for R2 doesn't mean it is horrible. In fact, I love the plot twists very much (though sometimes it does give me some overboard feel...like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann). Now let us all \"play this game of democracy, shall we?\"",

            "content": "On the surface, this looked great - promising setting, themes, characters, world. Unfortunately, all things that were clever about Season 1 were scrapped in favor of... well, I don't know, really. Shocking the audience? Misplaced fanservice?\r\nThe most glaring and obvious problem is that the cool antihero protagonist that was so refreshing in the first season got derailed into a wangsty Canon Sue. No clever tricks, determination, character growth or development, nothing but the endless loop of Oh Noes Nunnally over and over. And yet for some reason the camera refuses to leave his immediate proximity, so while the other characters and settings might have interestingpotential, all that is ignored in favor of more Lelouch-angst. And yet despite the fact that the only thing consistent about the character is his self-centered wangst and hypocrisy, every major character magically finds him loveable and sympathetic even when he's unrepentantly destroyed their lives. It's like reading through some particularly bad piece of fanfiction.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the narration then ignores are things like character development and narrative causality. The clever tactical ploys of the first season were pretty much nonexistent, relying instead on beam-spamming Super Mecha duels (y'know, the very thing that people complain about with Gundam?) and liberal application of plot-induced stupidity to the opposition, or just reiterating the exact same plans used in Season 1. Deus Ex Machina doesn't even begin to cover this. The Geass mystery that seemed so important was given no resolution and pretty much written off as a footnote.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization was about as consistent as Swiss cheese, with characters seemingly completely forgetting what they'd said or done just one episode ago and doing 180 turns with little to no exposition. Surely they could have spent some of that time wasted on fanservicy hijinks or the Endless Angst Loop fleshing out the supporting cast? Forget actual development - the more screentime a character got the less consistent their actions were, and the only characters who didn't act like they had multiple personalities were the ones too insignificant to matter. If you're going to have characters acting in ways utterly opposed to everything we've seen about them up to this point, you need to spend some time explaining to us why. Part of this can be blamed on the introduction of a whole batch of new characters while refusing to leave any of the old ones, resulting in neither old nor new characters getting enough screentime. Old characters who had outlived their story role hung out in the background but were not given any new purpose, while new characters that looked promising in concept never got enough exposition to actually live up to that promise.\\n\\n\r\nThe only really positive things I can say about R2 is that it's got pretty animation (mecha combat falls short of Macross Frontier, but it's not like Code Geass focuses much on that) and the background music, particularly the vocal pieces by Hitomi, is gorgeous. It generally manages to surprise the audience in its unpredictability, but unlike Season 1, often crosses the line into unbelievability instead. &quot;That was unpredicted but it makes sense&quot; is different from &quot;that was unpredicted and killed narrative causality&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the ideas, characters, and setting were interesting, but the script appears to have been written by a particularly indecisive committee of retarded monkeys. It's not a fault of the premise itself - the spinoffs such as games and novels manage to take those same settings and characters and actually make them interesting, or at least make sense, so I'm not sure why the supposedly high-budget anime fails so badly at doing so. It is not, of course, universally bad - there are moments of cleverness and good writing, but those moments are overwhelmingly outnumbered by the bad writing.\\n\\n\r\nR2 is fine to watch for the lolz if you turn off your brain and try not to think too hard about it, but those expecting the cleverness of Season 1 should probably stay away. If you're really into the series, read the novels/manga or write your own fanfiction, I guarantee you it'd make more sense than this drivel.",

            "content": "Code Geass R2 is, in essence, the most resounding travesty in the history of Japanese animation, and proof that anime fans will watch anything if it panders to them enough. It is to anime what Heroes is to US television, except that when Heroes became terrible midway through the viewers abandoned the series. This monstrosity only got more popular in the same situation. It's truly baffling.\r\nTo start, the story picks up right from R1(and by \"pick up\", I mean reset the whole plot), but manages to go absolutely nowhere for at least 10 episodes. The titular \"rebellion\" is cast aside into the domain of minorsub plots, like Ougi's relationship with that brown woman in the first season. Instead we get the genius Lelouch running around in meaningless fanservice episodes and battling characters with sorcerer's eyes. Remember how in season 1, the story revolved around interesting characters in a semi-realistic war in an alternate timeline of Earth? Ha. That much time into this season and the most important and game-changing thing you'll see is a C.C. upskirt. Then halfway through it meanders around some outlandish garbage in a plot entirely about two characters that for all intents and purposes died in the first season. Hell, the middle section of the show is so tacked on and meaningless I honestly can't comprehend why it was ever there to begin with. Finally, for the last half of the series the story turns at a 90 degree angle by the end of each and every episode. Lots of completely pointless and boring battles happen near the end, but it doesn't matter since the circumstances don't make much sense, no sane viewer has any emotion invested in the characters fighting, and the battle tactics that were once the high point of the series are now something you'd find Zapp Brannigan doing. This amazing torrent of plot holes, bad pacing and meaningless events reaches its climax in a contrived copout that probably wouldn't have even been that bad if the rest of the story were consistent. Or tolerable. Or comprehensible.\\n\\n\r\nAnother horrific aspect of the series is its characters. Actually, this is probably the worst part of the whole thing. The entire cast of CGR2, save for roughly four characters, is so badly written that the people on the screen can't even stick to the single sentence that defines their whole persona. Or their character is moronic. Or their main purpose is to pander to a certain sect of otaku. Or they're just boring. Or they serve no established purpose in the series at all. If someone can comment on my profile and explain why Gino, Xing Ke and Jeremiah were in this show(Crispin Freeman shouting LOYALTY is not a valid excuse for Jeremiah. Even Crispin himself doesn't know why that guy exists or is popular), that would be dandy.\\n\\n\r\n Oh yeah, and no one dies in this show except  for the obvious. Everyone else, be they exploded or hurled off a cliff, inexplicably lives for no reason other than to annoy the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's discuss the good characters in this show: Lelouch, Suzaku, Rolo. Yes, that's correct. Out of CGR2's enormous cast of about 40 recurring characters, only three are anywhere near being decent. You'd think C.C. would be on this brief listing, but she doesn't exist for half of the series and as soon as she shows up her character is completely rewritten after her only story-relevant sequence. \\n\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 is Lelouch's story, first and foremost. He is the only consistent part that holds all of this garbage together. That might've been intentional, but I'm not entirely buying it. Even so, Lelouch's character is boring, his motivations change constantly and all of his \"intelligence\" from the first season has been relegated into performing \"miracles\"(cheap/contrived/ridiculous plot twists) and sending in waves of dudes to clog the enemies' cannons. His master plan and endgame strategy seemed genius enough to thousands of idiots across the internet to give him incredible praise, but it really was just as much of a joke as the rest of his iceberg summoning and floor collapsing  antics. Think Watchmen, if it were written by a 12 year old.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have Suzaku. The Ryuho to Lelouch's Kazuma. He doesn't exist in this story until a little ways in, and doesn't do much until halfway through. He spends a lot of his time angry over what happened at the end of last season and struggling over his tool-ish idealism. In fact, all this guy does is angst about Lelouch for a majority of the time he's around. This one time he was told to protect someone, but she wandered off and died. So Suzy blamed Lelouch, because that's how he rolls. He's basically Kira Yamato with a bipolar personality and even more immortality. Suzaku's actually a rather unlikable character and his personality swings around like a pendulum, but that's about as good as it gets in this series.\\n\\n\r\nExcept for Rolo. Rolo is the best thing to come out of this trainwreck. His character, despite being introduced solely as yaoi fanservice in Suzaku's absence, is the most consistent and well written in the series by a good distance. He develops, never contradicts his purpose, and was a key point in one of the most memorable and non-idiotic scenes. Ultimately Rolo was totally unimportant, almost as if the writers set him on a shelf next to the series so he didn't get covered in the sticky, smelly substance it was leaking all over the place. So sad.\\n\\n\r\nThe final aspect of this tripe I'm going to talk about in detail is the focus. Code Geass has none. What is Code Geass about, in the end? What is its genre? Who is it marketed to? Respectively, those answers are: Nothing, All of them, and Everyone. The only unifying thing in Code Geass is Lelouch's character, but he isn't a good character. He's not as interesting as Light Yagami in terms of personality or his goals and he's not as well written as someone like Kenzou Tenma. So really, all you have is an entire story centered around this barely-above-shounen-writing guy with no prominent driving themes, commentary or anything like that.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass also attempts, and apparently succeeded, in appealing to every kind of anime fan. The series was fairly consistent and balanced during its first season, but the follow-up did nothing but shine spotlights all over its cliches and pandering features. The character designs become more fanservicey and CLAMP-y, drawing in boys and girls. The robots suddenly evolve from bipedal tanks to laser-spamming, transforming, energy shield-bearing monstrosities. The genre fluctuates between melodrama, politics, comedy, fantasy, romance, science fiction, psychological thriller, school stories and what have you depending on the episode. It just doesn't work. Taniguchi and the writers had no interest in being original or telling a cohesive story here and instead set their eyes on making tons of cash for Sunrise. \\n\\n\r\nBut yeah, the animation on the DVD versions are pretty good and the soundtrack is by one of the better guys in the business. At face value, Code Geass isn't a bad series. It's mindlessly entertaining, but the issue here is that so, so many morons think it's anything more than that, which does a disservice to people who watch good, original and well crafted Japanese animation and to the industry as a whole.",

            "content": "Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion Review:\r\nFirstly I would like to say that this review is for the entire series as a whole, NOT just for season 2. Now then....\r\nI am not a fan of mecha. There, I said it. This was the main reason why I ignored all of the suggestions and decided to put off this show for so long. However, this decision of mine to put off this show was just plain stupid and I now realize why everyone likes this show. Code Geass has become one of my favorite shows of all time and has joined Clannad and Steins;Gate on thelist of shows that I believe are truly on a different level from the rest.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10:\\n\r\nPolitics. The primary focus of the plot is politics. This is true with most shows in the mecha genre. However, Code Geass does not limit itself to just this focus. Code Geass dives into the morals of humans and the true nature of people. This is primarily seen with the main character Lelouch who is granted the ability to control other people that he makes eye contact with. With this power (and Lelouch's extremely high intelligence), Lelouch forms a rebel group known as the Black Knights to fight against the tyranny of Britannia. To add on to this, there are school life, and other non-war related plotlines that are well placed throughout the show to give you a break from the action. Now, before I watched this show I had already read about this, I thought I knew what the story was going to be like. I was wrong. The story isn't your typical rag tag group of kids trying to fight against an empire story. The story is about Lelouch. It's about Lelouch and his successes, struggles, mistakes, and changes. Although he basically IS the storyline, I will refrain from diving in further and go into more detail in the character section later. The story is one that is packed with plot twists and unexpected events (some admittedly can feel forced or leave plotholes, especially towards the end of season 2). This is more so in the first season, where the second season changes it up a bit and focuses more on the emotional aspect than the suspenseful one. Although the dynamic of the show changes between seasons, this change was necessary and really makes this show multidimensional. The writers tend to use the \"because I said so\" and \"oh it all happened in the past and we just never told you guys\" plot devices to explain a lot of events but for me this wasn't a big deal. However, I know that others absolutely hate this kind of writing so it does have to go into account in my review, dropping the story from a 10 to a 9. For all you fans of closure, the first season provides none, but the second season provides one of the greatest endings I have seen in a long time that is a lot more complex than one might first assume. The story was nothing short of brilliant, and the show's ending only justifies this, however the plot holes and poor explaining that went with some events prevent this story from being a perfect 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nAnother reason why I hesitated in watching this show was the art. I just didn't like the way all the characters looked. After watching it however, I have changed my mind. The art direction was very good, providing a wide array of characters, settings, and action. At times the action could suffer from the animation, but this was uncommon and for the most part the art was very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nLelouch's voice actor was nothing short of brilliant. Without him, I'm not sure if Lelouch would have been as interesting of a character as he was. The rest of the voice acting was solid for the most part as well. The music for the most part did nothing to stand out in any particular way. It wasn't bad. But it wasn't anything special. It served its purpose effectively and that's all that matters. The exceptions were the vocal tracks in this anime such as \"Stories\" \"Continued Story\" and \"Innocent Days\" as well as \"Madder Sky\" due to it being used during a crucial part of the last episode. Overall the sound was very good due to the voice acting however the soundtrack was hit or miss, at times it was average or not good, while a few other tracks were actually fantastic. The inconsistency prevented the sound from getting a 9 but it was great none the less.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\r\nEverybody seems to want to compare Lelouch to Light from Death Note. I can see where they're coming from (extremely smart, granted amazing power, seemingly very selfish at times). However, Lelouch has a trait that Light seems to completely lack, Lelouch actually has morals. Sometimes it is hard to see, but Lelouch fully intends to make the world a better place. He makes countless mistakes that harm others throughout his journey, and when these kind of things happen, you can clearly see Lelouch being effected by these mistakes. He may put on a face as if it is all fine, but by paying attention to his initial reactions, and the final decisions that he makes towards the end, you can tell that he fully accepts his mistakes as sins that will most likely never be forgiven. But moving on from Lelouch there are plenty of other characters. Most notably there is Suzaku. Suzaku was a character that I had strong opinions towards. What was weird however was that the writers somehow made me like him one minute, hate his ass the next, sympathize with him another, and then love him again. This of course was intentional and very well done. Suzaku is similar to Lelouch in that he has good intentions but goes about the wrong way of trying to achieve them. It's hard talking about these two without any spoilers, but realize that they are without a doubt the two most important characters, and following them both was definitely a treat. Other important characters were C.C. (aka little miss plot hole maker) and Kallen (aka fanservice). Beyond these four characters the others weren't too developed due to the sheer fact that there were so many of them. However, none of the characters were really \"bad\" besides maybe Nina. Ok yeah, Nina was awful. The fact that Lelouch was so brilliant and that, for the most part, his supporting cast was relatively strong, I really can't give the character section anything less than a 9.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nThis may be because practically every episode ended in a cliffhanger, but I could not stop watching this show. From the first episode to the last I could not stop myself from watching. I wanted to know what happened next. I wanted to know the consequences of Lelouch's actions, and how he would respond. I wanted to see in what unique way he would tactically take down all of his opponents the next time. I wanted to see how Lelouch and Suzaku's friendship would pan out. The show provides you with countless small and large desires that can get fulfilled within minutes, or not be answered until the last episode. This recipe of teasing and rewarding made this show addicting as hell and was beautifully crafted. The intriguing plot, interesting politics, and fantastic characters were melded beautifully by the writers to create a show perfectly executed to entertain the viewer. The two seasons differ in their approach, but the basic tease and deliver equation was still in place throughout it all. The first season contained a stable goal for the characters filled with shocking surprises and twists. The second season was far more inconsistent with its objective, but really delivers massive emotional punches, and eventually steers itself up for the grande finale. Code Geass was filled with practically everything you could ask for in an entertaining anime, and all these tools were utilized perfectly with fantastic execution. If there's one thing Code Geass did right, it was that it kept me entertained.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.2/10:\\n\r\nThe plot, pacing, characters, emotions, and most importantly the execution of it all are what pull Code Geass out of the crowd and make it truly something else. The plot can push towards over the top at times and trip over itself, but the overall story and the characters within it make Code Geass one hell of a ride. This show has joined Clannad (10/10) and Steins;Gate (9.5/10) as the three lone anime series that I have given a 9 or higher rating to, and is a must watch for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\nMore addicting than crack, and without the deadly side effects! Ranging from action packed, to funny, to convoluted, to tear jerking this show is something else. Truly a joy to watch and a must watch for all.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Main character is a legend\\n\r\n+ One of the greatest endings ever\\n\r\n+ Extremely addicting\\n\r\n+ Story is fantastic\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Plot holes/Writers' tendency to use the \"because i said so\" explaination\\n\r\n- There may have been too many different characters, resulting in some unnecessary or just plain weak/annoying characters (Nina)\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Code Geass, watch...\\n\r\nGuilty Crown:\\n\r\nThe shows are extremely similar in almost every aspect and both are very entertaining. However, try to keep your brain shut down a bit while watching this show because there are plenty of plotholes.\\n\r\nDeath Note:\\n\r\nThe most obvious choice mainly because of the Light/Lelouch comparison. They are both extremely intelligent and enjoyable to watch, and the shows are both intense.\\n\\n\r\n9.2/10 - Brilliant\\n\\n",

            "content": "Code Geass R2 has provoked conflicting reactions among the fan base, just like the original series did. Viewers still loved or hated it outright, even as many others laughed, and once again it's not hard to see why.\r\nI think R2 was a disappointment but not without redeeming qualities. It is an enjoyable sequel that could have used more foresight and additional planning. Maybe a little less ambition, a smaller cast of characters or better pacing would have been very welcome improvements. In the end, I appreciated Code Geass as a whole in spite of its flaws. Not the best show out there, but then againit doesn't need to be.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nAfter having to go through strangely familiar territory, Code Geass R2 finally reaches a grander scale. What began as a local rebellion ends up having larger repercussions, both directly and indirectly. And that is just the big picture. The protagonist, Lelouch, continues to keep everything together here. What remains at the core of Code Geass and its themes is his development as a character. But it is, admittedly, the kind of development that tends to take him in a far more destructive than constructive direction and this can be hard to watch, let alone swallow. Nevertheless, I believe the main plot was brought to a rather fitting, if not absolutely satisfying, conclusion as far as those terms are concerned. Unfortunately, this central focus on Lelouch was a little too dominant in the long run, at the expense of other elements.\\n\\n\r\nWe are taken through many more twists and turns this time around, which is both good and bad. From the exciting to the absolutely ridiculous, from the dramatic to the cheap, most are at least amusing. Yet there are clear pacing problems, especially towards the second half of R2, and that did affect the overall flow. I never felt really lost, but certain events were dealt with too quickly, including one climatic confrontation in particular. In retrospect, several early episodes were ultimately unnecessary and wasted valuable screen time that later developments could have used. As things stand, the show is rather messy and certain ideas received uneven amounts of attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing and direction are competent, at heart, but evidently suffer from trying to do too much, too quickly and thus may have shot themselves in the foot more than once. The first half of the series has increased fanservice, which can be occasionally distracting. Some mysteries were resolved but, unfortunately, a few unanswered questions of varying importance were also left behind and this can be annoying if not actually crippling. The show's mecha action is acceptable but lost some of its appeal due to accelerated technological progression. It's still not as much of a factor here as it would be in other series though, from my point of view, since it isn't really meant to be the main focus.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the last story arc seemed out of place at first and its very existence remains quite controversial in light of other possibilities. The ending itself, on the other hand, benefits from markedly increased attention to detail by the production staff and packs a strong emotional and thematic punch, even if the epilogue that followed it was probably too short. The final episode of Code Geass R2 gives the viewer the ability to make up his or her own mind, which is a double-edged sword. I can say the resolution worked for me, but there are different opinions. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nProduction values are still well above the average. The animation was generally alright and, in specific places, even great. Some background frames did lack quality, but not to a bothersome extent unless you know where to look. Even then, it must be pointed out that some of the worst sequences were reanimated or redrawn in time for the DVD release. The original character designs by CLAMP continue to be fairly effective and the mechanical side of things was also quite competent overall. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 had good music and, for the most part, it was used well within the show itself. Some pieces are bombastic, no doubt, as one would probably expect from a tale so intrinsically linked to having a flair for the dramatic. Several tracks from the first season make a comeback here, but there is plenty of new material. The insert songs, in particular, were very nice even if a little more elusive. The opening and ending themes are a little less memorable but certainly not bad. With one exception, maybe, as opinions may easily vary here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nLelouch is what drives Code Geass and he was still fairly successful in this regard as long as you can tolerate the story's overall direction, but he wouldn't be nearly as interesting without the ongoing dynamic between him and Suzaku, who once again played the most important supporting role. Kallen and C.C. got some attention and closure in their own right when they were given enough screen time, even if certain expectations were not met. Overall, these four characters received some development, though not without problems here and there. I suppose Rolo, Shirley and Nunnally also had their moments too, all things considered, but just barely.\\n\\n\r\nThat sounds fine, so what lowered the score then? An old issue which wasn't helped by rushed pacing: the huge cast was often misused and certain plot threads were left unresolved. Too many minor characters were introduced without giving them enough weight to stand on. Many of them didn't require much attention in the first place -I can see that the story works regardless- but others did seem to demand either more screen time or more convincing motivations. The show's antagonists, some more than others, were noticeably lacking. In the end, the picture is definitely mixed here and I can't help but feel that a lot more could have been done with a smaller number of characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 was an entertaining show, in many different ways, and I do not regret watching it. From the serious to the absurd, from cliffhanger to cliffhanger, the series succeeded in making me anticipate almost every upcoming episode. There are specific events which can't be taken seriously, at all, and the staff must surely be aware of this. But there are also some genuinely effective moments in the mix, depending on what the viewer is willing to put up with, and while the series can be rightfully accused of being emotionally manipulative it isn't nearly as senseless as it appears to be on the surface. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, R2 benefits from simply being fun to watch, even though it is very true that there were problematic issues along the way. Many of the show's flaws could have been avoided with a tighter narrative, more explanations and a far more reasonable pace. As a sequel, Code Geass R2 feels appropriate yet also disappointing. Not everyone will be happy with the end result and I have my own complaints, but Code Geass, as a whole, was a worthwhile experience.",

            "content": "I'm going to write a review about R2 that may not be well liked among Geass fans, for the low score I give it, but I ask the reader to hear me out and read this in an impartial light. \r\nFirst off, I would like to say that \"R1\" was an amazing premise, with massive twists, good characters, good plot, interesting premise and overall good execution. I did honestly like R1. R2 keeps the crisp artwork and sound style of R1, so I give those a high score, but R2 has some deep recurring flaws that pretty much butcher the series in my opinion. \r\nAllspoilers are appendixed, you can read through without spoilers of this or the first series, but some spoilers will be included to show where I'm coming from at the end of the review (but will be forecast in advance)\\n\\n\r\nThese are the two biggest elements of a character-driven story: The character development and the plot progression.\\n\r\nI'll begin with Character development, and quite frankly, there was none. I used my basic litmus test of character development and every single character failed. This test is simple, I ask \"would this character have done anything at the end of this series that they weren't willing to do at the beginning?\" Note: WILLING, not ABLE. for example, Lelouch may have been willing to do all the things he did, but unable to do them until he gained his Geass. However, his objectives, his desires, did not change at all during the whole show. This applies equally to the whole cast. Not a single one of them changes their opinions about anything, they simply change in the methods they use to achieve their goals (if even that), which is indicative of a plot without development. Now this wouldn't be such an issue to me if development hadn't been the writer's goal. When a certain character dies halfway through the series, (1) there are effectively no ramifications on the characters who should have been deeply influenced by the act. Now what this said to most viewers would have been \"this was proof of Lelouch's inner strength, a test of character\". However, to me it plays out like such: the character died, which the writer had intended to happen. The death did not have a significant impact on the plot. Thus, the character was only included to be killed off and prove Lelouch's strength. However, this also means that the character who was there was only there to be killed, which means this character was effectively treated like an object to be played with by the plot, and I feel no need to sympathise with an object. When viewed in this light, the fact that Lelouch's inner strength was tested is a moot point, because his character could have been tested in so many other ways that did not involve the writer using a character as if he/she were an object. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the biggest problem with R2, the complete lack of character development. They \"explain\" characters, they \"test\" characters, sure, but they do not \"develop\" them. Essentially, the only development that does occur happens about 10 seconds prior to the credits rolling, which is far too late to warrant me giving this series a good mark.\\n\\n\r\nThe second major problem is that R2 broke my willing suspension of disbelief. There are three main examples of this: one, where a cliffhanger fell into a cliche and overused trope area (2), which from that point on, trivialised all other cliffhangers and was a major detriment to the series. Two, the fact that a certain character survived halfway through the series despite the fact that they should have died (3), this trivialised death- if one character could survive, then they all should be able to, but they did not, which further proves to me that the writer was only killing off characters to try and induce character development, which again, proves that the writer was objectifying characters, which is the exact opposite of character development. And thirdly, the fact that there was two recurring elements effectively ignored (or \"handwaved\") as the series concludes (4/5), which shows to me that the writer was putting stuff in to make the series more interesting, not because they were actually useful as plot devices in of themselves, which trivialised the role of almost every nonmajor character and filler event.\\n\\n\r\nThe final biggest problem is the plot. In essence, about a dozen or so episodes of R2 are filler. While the series always seems to be doing something, apart from the final arcs, all it really does is tread water. Most of the subplots are irrelevant to the final outcome, as (6) shows. Basically, the plot waves its arms and creates a lot of fuss, but doesn't really *go* anywhere for almost the entirety of R2. And when it finally does pick up, it fails to have any twist at all. Cliffhangers, sure, twists, no.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, R2 took the brilliant effort of R1, but failed to run with it, effectively adding in a whole bunch of filler arcs, characters and subplots that really were irrelevant to the main plot, and failed to really develop any of the charters. As such, R2 was a major letdown for me, as it basically undermined all the efforts of R1 apart from the artwork and soundtrack.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWARNING++++SPOILER APPENDIX++++WARNING\\n\\n\r\n(1)Shirely's death, Lelouch doesn't so much as mourn, which is fine, if it weren't for the fact that they had no need to kill her, so the lack of mourning is effectively a double-negative, they cancel out the contrive death by having a contrived funeral, which breaks my willing suspension of disbelief and still fails to deliver any meaningful development.\\n\r\n(2)When the \"double\" turned out to be a \"latex perfection\" (Tvtropes term) ie: a chick wearing a mask. Pretty much a completely trivial and very unbelievable (where did they get it, why doesn't anyone else use them, etc), bending heavily my willing suspension of disbelief.\\n\r\n(3)The maid, she was ON the ship that was destroyed by the \"FLEIJA\" blast. Sure, Nannuly should have survived, but how the heck did she? She may be ninja, but come on, seriously? This SHATTERED my willing suspension of disbelief. Bandages do NOT solve all problems. She only survived by plot induced invulnerability, which completely trivialises the many deaths in the series.\\n\r\n(4)Li's recurring cough. essentially not mentioned at all by series end. What was the point of even including the thing? Fake drama, that's what. Pretty much sums up this whole series.\\n\r\n(5)The fact that \"if Lelouch's geass gets stronger....\" Well, he just puts in two contacts lenses. Again, fake drama. That's not interesting, that's disappointing.\\n\r\n(6)He TOLD THE VIEWER THE PLAN in R1. Like, literally. Sure, it wasn't for long, nor was it step-by-step, but he still did it. Pretty much forecasts the ending perfectly to someone who'd been paying attention and knows even the first thing about how martyrs work.",

            "content": "Code Geass Hangyaku no Lelouch is extraordinary intelligent and a master of entertainment. \r\nSTORY\r\n    Season one of Code Geass ended with a cliffhanger, which sets the stage of season two. The story is past-paced and compelling, in no argument it is the best factor of this anime. Code Geass R2 is filled with complex plots and subplots along with its story line that will keep you hook until the very last episode.\r\n    The setting is set in a sort of near-future war set on earth. The Holy Britain Empire, a dominate power that holds controlfor one third of the world. Even Japan has been taken over by the Britian Empire, the freedom of Japan has been lost, even its name has been replaced with a cold number, &quot;number 11&quot;. The Black Knights, which is a rebellion organization lead by the intelligent high school student, Lelouch also known as zero, has set its goal for the freedom of Japan and the downfall of the Britain Empire. Although it is fantasy, most of it reflects on the reality of today and interchanging historical events. It focuses on the negatives of autocracy government, which is the Holy Britain Empire in this case. Also it deals with the corruption of power today, and the manipulations of the media.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\n    No doubt Sunrise has spent a hell lot of money on the animation, the battle scenes are greatly done, all the movements are presented pretty smoothly. The character designs are also pretty detailed and unique. The Mechas, known as the Knightmares, are also well done.\\n\\n\r\n    The original character design is illustrated by CLAMP. The characters are then converted into animation character for the series by Sunrise's character designer Takahiro Kimura, but it is done in such a way so that the character still shows much of CLAMP's original art. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\n    The characters have distinctive personalities. There character development from the first series of Code Geass wasn't too detailed, but in R2 it shows much more colors from these characters and especially Lelouch who had to deal with responsibilities and the moral of humanity, his relationships with Nunnally, Rolo, and Suzaku are all very distinctive.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\n    With the story line, the art, and sound put together, I'd still say it's the story that stands out the most. The battle plots are thought out well, it's like rather than killing two birds with one stone, the stone would kill the birds, manipulate the nest, destory the bough, cut the tree in half, and blow up the shit hell out of everything.\\n\\n\r\n    The animation and sound are put together greatly. This anime gives greatly enjoyment indeed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNone the less, it is very enjoyable for anyone who is looking for some entertainment. I praise for the revolution.",

It is here we see the revolution come full circle. I know there are a lot of complaints about plot holes, and some extreme plot twists, but I did not see reason to complain. In anything, the impossible can be madepossible, absurdity can be made reality. Code Geass did not rip to shreds what the original series had created: it created its own. That may upset some viewers, but for the sake of storytelling and plot, I couldn't find a flaw with it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was colourful and unique, as before. There are nuanced differences, but they aren't very noticeable. If anything, it just got more colourful and crisper looking. The animation also improved.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were more developed and interesting. We see what really makes every character tick. In the first season, a lot of people were introduced, and they are fleshed out further in the second season. There is a wider cast in the the second, but these new characters are all interesting and unique as well. The entire vi Britannia family is intriguing, and you get a lot of history, development and backstory to this bunch especially.  \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed every minute of this. \\n\\n\r\nIs it good?

            "content": "I've been trying to review this series since it ended, but it's proven difficult because while I want to treat it as impartially as possible, there are a lot of factors that went into the decision-making of the series that make it hard to judge in just one way. I'm sure that that's true for a lot of series, but it's simply that I've been made all too aware about everything that had to do with this one. Being a huge fan of the first season doesn't help either.\r\nThis review may contain spoilers for the first season of Code Geass.\r\nSTORY - A lot has beenrevealed about the executive meddling and general &quot;not as planned&quot;-ness that affected R2. Suffice to say that the producers had to change many things around, not necessarily in ways they wanted, and this second season likely turned out very different from the way it was originally planned. Unfortunately, I can only talk about the final product, regardless of intentions; this has led me to feel as if I'm being unfair in any criticisms I make as far as story and character go. I guess I really have no choice in the end, but I think it's important to keep in mind that some of the more poorly executed points of this series likely resulted from the aforementioned.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 starts one year after the &quot;ending&quot; of the first season and the first episode is the first of many that invokes feelings of deja vu. Neither Code Geass nor Code Geass R2 present many themes or storylines that haven't been covered before, but the plot does do a lot of evolving and changing between the seasons. The ex-prince that wants to destroy his homeland and discover the truth ends up leading the war to end all wars, a theme especially prominent in various Gundam series. But the series' greatest strength has always been its ability to tell the story in a new and interesting way, regardless of the barebones storyline. To that end, R2 doesn't quite live up to S1's standards -- indeed, it seems to borrow heavily on structuring and story framing that was successful in the first season. Beyond the first episode, several others seem to tie in thematically to their parallels in S1, such as Shirley-centric episode 12-14 and Geass-centric 15. A lot of sequels fall into the trap of trying to repeat previous successes, but for an always-planned sequel like R2, this fixation seemed a bit out of place, even if creators were forced to shift things around some.\\n\\n\r\nThings are still interesting for the most part, but the change of course for the story (Lelouch's change of values and goals) felt somewhat choppy, and the mood changes a lot from episode to episode. S1 had its share of silliness and crack around Ashford Academy, but considering all the things that needed to be resolved in R2, I felt there were a few episodes that could have been better utilized. On the opposite end of the spectrum though, Sunrise seemed to occasionally throw 180's and give us episodes that were way out there in the left field: very WTF-inducing episodes. These episodes are what propel the story along the most, even if they often seemed abrupt in execution and occasionally anticlimactic. Despite this shaky progression, I do think that the story in R2 evolves all right enough. The supernatural elements that were kept in low profile in the first season get a little more attention... not enough to cover all the plotholes, but the final accumulation of events combines both the supernatural and the immediacy of war and revolution in a very interesting way.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest complaint I have about R2's storytelling is that death is treated in an entirely unconvincing manner. Character death almost always felt arbitrary and contrived; Sunrise already has a pretty bad rap for bringing characters back from the dead, but the number of times they did this in series is just ridiculous. Major characters, minor characters -- regardless of whether or not their death would have been significant in the long run, they went crazy with it all over the place. Characters that should have died didn't. Characters that did die don't stay dead. You get pretty jaded after a while.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, I'm actually very pleased with the ending of Code Geass R2. Even if none of the other episodes do, the last episode of R2 matches up to the last episode of S1. The drama is there; the storytelling is there. Everything is beautifully executed, and the ending is perfect in that it's open for interpretation, but it's very easy to draw a steadfast personal conclusion. Everyone can perceive an ending that makes them happy, and there's plenty of evidence both ways. Very clever, Sunrise -- at least you managed to do that part right.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - The character development in R2 is undoubtedly its greatest asset. Lelouch and Suzaku were both already complicated characters, but the situations they're forced through in this second season compound them much, much further. Their foilistic nature is emphasized again and again, and that delicious irony comes into play more than once (oh, I love irony). Idealistic Suzaku gets to play hardball through a seemingly endless string of seemingly cruel and heartless betrayals, and Lelouch the Machiavellist not only declares that &quot;love is power,&quot; but takes it upon himself to fulfill the entire world's wishes. Once again, it's very easy to become emotionally involved with these characters. You're invested in them. You hate to love them, and you love to hate them. Their pain is real; their triumph is real. It's the greatest mark of good storytelling and character development when you feel like you can cheer and cry with the characters you're watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe sad part of it all is just that a lot of secondary characters in S1 that seemed to have great potential as far as character development get short-changed in R2. Kallen's backstory involving her brother is never explained, and while Ougi still got a fair share of screentime, it never felt like it was enough to explore the depths of his character. It was frustrating because I knew he was an interesting character with a complex train of thought, but I never got to see it. Instead, I was faced with some utterly unnecessary flirtation between Chiba and Toudou; I'm glad we can to explore relationship possibilities beyond the obvious cast, but come on. I hated Rolo's guts because he acted too stereotypically, and I never felt like there was any real thoughtfulness to his character. There could have been a lot more expansion there, not to mention Lelouch's relationships with Kallen and Shirley. Having a noncommittal harem is great for fan debate, but to some extent, I expect some serious content. All too often, it seemed like his feelings for those around him were based solely on the convenience of story. He would care about Shirley if it suited the plot, and he would remember Kallen when they had time to write her back into the script seven episodes later. I know he's a better character than that -- they just don't show it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to explain without spoilers, but the irony of all the characters' roles at the end of the series is one of the things I love the most about the characters in this series. Everything is so fitting, so tragically fitting, and it's beautiful. I guess really appreciate the poetic justice of things.\\n\\n\r\nART &amp; ANIMATION - The art and animation remain consistent in R2 as in S1. The Knightmare designs are great, though I sometimes wish flying units would lose the whole angel wings gig. Damocles didn't feel like a very inspired design either, but at that point in the story, its design was the least of my concerns. CLAMP's boys are their usual noodley selves, but I find their aesthetic pointless to critique or debate at this point. Everyone has their own opinion about them, and for the most part, that isn't going to change. I appreciate CLAMP's consistency anyway, though I always find it curious that they can make characters look so pleasing and elegant while blatantly ignoring every rule of anatomy. I'm sure that real men wouldn't look good all stretched out or with shoulders four times as wide as their hips. Curious indeed.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing that's had to dispute though, it's the fact that CLAMP's facial designs allow for incredible expressiveness, especially when the emotion is sad. I absolutely adore just how stricken characters look when bad things happen to them -- sometimes, they look a little strange, outrageous and even sloppy (Lulu's shocked phone face, anyone?), but other times, the emotion is so strong that your heart just breaks for them. That such powerful art should accompany already powerful characters is great. \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - I didn't really care in one direction or another about R2's first OP/ED set, but I loved, loved, loved its second set. ALI PROJECT is usually a sure winner for me, here especially because I find their usual style very fitting to Code Geass. Edgy violins to capture that &quot;high class&quot; monarchy and shrill voices for the violence, drama, and anticipation. Perfect! I think I was coerced into liking FLOW's &quot;WORLD END&quot; because of gg's snarky captioning of a certain part of the lyrics (everything is fabulous~), but really, it's a great song that's also very fitting for the series, lyric-wise. R2's soundtrack is, naturally, similar to its first season counterpart -- both are mostly average with a few standout tracks, including some of the fight music and Britannian music (I love it when they use trumpets!). Hitomi's insert songs are, once again, very touching, emotional, and thoughtful -- I really like the haunting ambiance, and they're always used at very appropriate times. Geass's soundtrack isn't amazing, but I'd like to say that it's somewhere between good-average and great.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - As far as I know, the entire Japanese cast reprised their roles, which was excellent. I still love the insight you can gain by paying attention to how each character refers to himself, and it was interesting to see both Fukuyama and Sakurai handle Lelouch and Suzaku as they continued to develop as characters. The US dub airs this Sunday, but I imagine that most of the cast will remain the same, considering how quickly they've managed to dub it. I really do like how Lelouch and Suzaku's dub voices have turned out, not to mention Lloyd, but I still can't say the same for everyone else. (What the hell's up with Rakshata's voice??) Can't have 'um all, I guess. (Refer to my season one review for more details?)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - Code Geass R2 had a lot of issues, enough that many people have gone on to call it a veritable trainwreck. I would disagree -- considering all the obstacles they were up again, I'd say Sunrise managed to pull off a pretty damn decent job. It wasn't a disaster. The story followed through. The characters were consistent. Yes, there are a good fistful of plotholes, but I think the most important stuff (character goals and resolution) pulled through very well in the end. The fact that the ending was beautiful really helped with that, and I'm sure I'm not the only one relieved by the fact that there are no plans to make a third, tag-on season. If you liked Code Geass, I would definitely recommend seeing this series through. It's worth it in the end. If you were skeptical about Code Geass to begin with, then you might not take as kindly to R2, but I'm telling you, that ending was beautiful.",

            "content": "NaNoWriMo is an annual event in which the goal is to write a novel in 30 days. Anyone can do it, but in order to reach your goal, you often sacrifice editing, plotting a narrative, and forgetting certain character developments you meant to make. The reason I say this is because Code Geass R2 is an exact reflection of the NaNoWriMo story down to the last detail.\r\nThe first season, having been made famous by it's constant barrage of out-of-left-field cliffhangers, is constantly one-upped in the second half of anti-hero Lelouch's quest to change the world to his ideal. All questions regarding the first season's excruciatinglyambiguous finale are answered and from then on, it's a rapid-fire succession of changing hands, feints, and aces in the hole. By this means, Geass continuously refreshes audience interest, though with so many twists, it's easy to not care about them after a while.\\n\\n\r\nThe constant twists also lead to a blatant awareness that Geass R2 is being written on the fly with no real direction or end in sight, even as the episodes wind down. It's a flaw and a big one, but miraculously, Geass R2 saves itself repeatedly by revealing certain plot elements vital to the show, but only every so often so as to keep a sense of direction. All in all, the chaotic twists tip the balance between thought-out and impulsively written toward the more negative end.\\n\\n\r\nGeass R2's hodgepodge storyline is made no less confusing by its cast, which extends to the multitudes from the word &quot;go&quot;, imbuing characters only introduced late in Season 1 and adding even more to the mix as it goes along while pushing other pivotal characters from the first season way, way, way to the side. Combining the plot's chaotic movements along, we never really get a sense of character development from anyone because there simply isn't enough time. Only Lelouch, Suzaku, and C.C. get to shine, and even then it's hardly much at all. Everyone else is designated a rather flat personality, maybe a love interest, and a battle persona, and that's that.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is brought to life by some rather impressive production values on Sunrise's part. The animation is crisp, fluid, and always lively. Though CLAMP's character designs can be off-putting some of the time, it works well, and, despite how far it goes, never feels like too much of a good thing. It's not trying to be innovative, but it is excelling within the norm.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is much what you'd expect from the first season; blaring trumpets and forgettable insert songs. Though the opening themes are better than the first season's as songs, they are incredibly inappropriate given the content of the series. The end songs, on the other end of the spectrum, are both forgettable affairs.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of Code Geass R2's flaws, it is fun, and when it comes right down to it, a series that is essentially Death Note meets Gundam with rollerblading mecha and a girl with a pizza addiction should be fun. Code Geass R2 is always entertaining, even when it gets eye-roll-inducingly bizarre. This isn't so much a show that will be on an objective Top 10 list, but it's a blast start to finish. The anime equivalent of a summer Hollywood blockbuster, so to say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Code Geass R2 a 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "Well, I'm not going to be very positive about Code Geass R2. Since the first season was actually pretty good, I started to watch CG R2 in the hope that R2 would be just as great. \r\nOh, how I was dissapointed.\r\nEven though I learned that this season was 'NOT AS PLANNED', it's...bad. It's just a bad continuation on the first season. VERY bad. The start wasn't that bad, but the further the serie progresses, the more stupid it becomes.\r\nStory : 1\r\nOh come on. EVERY episode there's a dumb plottwist. They have destroyed the entire story the first season built up. Next to that there's aton of plotholes. I seriously cannot believe that anyone would believe that this is good stuff. Most of the plottwists are just stupid. \\n\r\nWHERE DO ALL THE KNIGHTMARES COME FROM? It was getting more and more like Dragonball Z thanks to those.\\n\r\n'THIS ISN'T EVEN 10% OF IT'S OUTPUT YET!!11&quot;\\n\r\nAlso, dead characters should STAY dead. The story is horrible. HORRIBLE.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nNo matter how bad the series have become, the art is still pretty good. It's good too look at, nothing too special but it's better than I've seen in some series. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nI do not like the second OP en ED. That was the only downpart to season one as well. The OP and ED sucked after a while. I didn't really notice any good BGM.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nIn season one, the characters were great. In season 2, LOL PLOTTWIST! LOL CHARACTER CHANGING! LOL DIFFERENT GOAL! etc. I'm not going to waste more words on this... \\n\r\nOh, I forgot, they screwed every character up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nI just watch it now to see what kind of stupid plottwist they give it. Seriously. It's enjoyable somewhere, but that's mostly because it's so stupid.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nSeason one was much better. This season is full of plotholes. It looks like DBZ and some of the character revelations are just stupid. This show is very overrated. I can see what some people like in it, but they just don't pay enough attention to the story imo. \\n\r\nThe ending was actually decent, compared to some episodes, but that doesn't mean a lot.",

            "content": "After a hugely successful season 1, we have the highly anticipated sequel, Code Geass R2.\r\nStory: 3\r\nThe story involved a reset but kicked off to a very strong, solid start with Lelouche as cunning as ever in getting his ways.  However, around 1/3 into the season it all starts falling apart.  We start getting rather outrageous, unplausible plot twists and sequence of events.  While this has happened in Season 1, R2 takes \"outrageous, unplausible\" to an entirely new level which continues right until the end of the series where finally, the ending had a very good twist to it.\r\nThe mecha battles have alsosuffered from the same problems from Gundam Seed Destiny - a few Nightmares that are just so ridiculously powerful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nIf you can stand the stick-thin characters (I knocked a mark off for this), then the art is pretty damn good.  The colours are vivid and the costumes varied in design.  The animation was also rather smooth as well.  Overall, it's good but not exceptional.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nGeass has a rather unique soundtrack style and I especially enjoyed the jazzy battle themes and Hitomi's vocal tracks.  Hitomi's track which was played in the finale had a very appropriate feel and was awesome.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I found many of the choices for the OP/ED rather questionable!\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nA very large cast which was rather interesting in season 1 but with the butchering of the storyline, also came the butchering of the characters.  The large cast prevented the development of key characters and they often made superficial appearances.  Kallen, as awesome as she is was totally lacking towards the end of the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nDespite the negativity, I did rather enjoy watching this series.  It was whacky and corny which may be the wrong reason to enjoy a show, but that's how I managed to derive lots of enjoyment from.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nGeass R2 shone well in some aspects but was totally lacking in other departments.  It had such a huge potential yet I feel it was utterly wasted.  R2 wasn't a total disaster but it could have been so much better.",

            "content": "\"All the world's a stage,\r\nAnd all the men and women merely players;\r\nThey have their exits and their entrances;\r\nAnd one man in his time plays many parts...\" - Shakespeare\r\nSTORY:  \r\nI felt that this was the best way to wrap up this show overall.  There were numerous plot twists, most of which significantly alter the storyline and circumstances of the main characters.  It follows the classic formula of best friends as the best kind of enemies and keeps you guessing.  However, one of its strong points is that some of the twists can be predicted if one is observant enough.  It doesn'tpull punches either for the sake of the viewer's sensibilities but rather always works towards progressing the story in the most dramatic way possible.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nNot the place that makes or breaks this show.  The animation is solid and at times displays great detail, especially in the fight sequences.  \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe music and sound effects were also solid.  There may be shows that do a better job of matching the action or plot with the perfect music, but Code Geass uses the right tempermant for the various scenes and shines in the truely dramatic moments.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nAnother big strength of this show.  Not only does Code Geass feature compelling protagonists/antagonists throughout, the roles are constantly in motion.  The use of anti-heroes and anti-villians as well as the more traditional character models makes for very interesting interactions and strange alliances.  Through the characters the show also confronts the viewer with conflicting views of morality, different individuals will see the characters in different lights.  Where one person sees an anti-hero another will see an anti-villian or antagonist etc.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI never stopped sitting at the edge of my seat.  Its the type of show that you can think about all week while you wait for the new episode.  The show is very rewatchable, you will notice new things everytime through, I know I have.  Finally, surprising you every episode with a twist while still throwing you bone that you might be able to predict keeps you engaged.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThis is one of the best anime shows I have seen so far.  Many peeople will find similarities to Death Note throughout the story but with one major improvement, the ending.  \\n",

            "content": "Generally I review only the anime that haven't been reviewed but Code Geass R2 affected me so much I had to write a review. RL Context: Work and other RL obligations had kept me from anime for a while. Coming back to anime and starting with .Hack/Sign wasn't the smartest thing to do. Thank god the next anime I saw was this one, or I would probably have gone on another anime hiatus. \r\nStory\r\nThis anime is quite difficult to describe without spoilers since the plot is one of the best I've seen to date and each episode has many talking points - just look atthe sheer number of posts in each episode discussion. Overall, it's complex, full of twists and fast paced. There is a perfect blend of tons of action, cool mecha, comedy, romance, emotion, drama - you want it, it's here in this series. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no possibility to get bored with this anime. I was guessing and most of my guesses went wrong! There were many &quot;Whaatt??&quot;, &quot;I don't believe it!&quot; and &quot;Nooo!&quot; moments. This anime pulls you in and doesn't let you go till it ends. Every episode leaves you wanting more. I was sad when it ended.  Now that's a good story. Kudos to whoever wrote the manga - thank you for this gift.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nThe amazing thing about this anime is there are no &quot;throw away&quot; characters. Every character is well realized and developed, even the small minor ones. Just when you think you have them figured out something happens that opens your eyes anew! They all provoke a reaction from the watcher, whether negative or positive, or negative turned to positive, or positive to negative, but there is a reaction which mostly changes over time. They engaged me so much I got INVOLVED in this anime. Wow, it's been a long time since I felt so much emotion, anticipation and enjoyment from watching an anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation and sound\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was awesome. There's none of the Super-deformed kawaii/joke mode. Fingers, eyes and hair are particularly well drawn, as is the cleavage of Kallen and Millay in particular (hey, I may be female but I still recognize fan-service). Just look at the ending animation - it's just beautiful. No other word for it. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending song wasn't that good or this would have had all perfect 10s. That being said the sound effects were perfect especially when combined with the well realized mecha in all the fight scenes. Overall, those were brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 blew me away. This anime reminded me strongly WHY everyone should watch anime. In total, it is a joy to watch. If I have time I will rewatch it. Episode 19 in particular. Genius. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed an anime so much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nThis deserves it's place as the #5 ranked anime on this list. I liked season 1 but R2 is even better. Up to the last episode and they're still coming up with twists. There's really nothing I disliked about this outstanding anime. For those who haven't seen it, please watch this (after seasion 1 of course). Part of me wants a season 3 but the other half of me fears it might detract from the satisfying conclusion of R2. Perfection sometimes doesn't require a third act.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Code Geass R2 is one of the most highly anticipated anime sequels and it certainly manages to please the fans of its original Supernatural, Mecha, Drama, Action anime. Nonetheless it is easy to compare it to its more well-thought-out prequel.\r\nThe story continues a year after the events of the Black Rebellion and it begins in the same manner as before; setting the scene with 2 intense, action-packed episodes. After that it takes a while for the story to gain some momentum, so you just have to get through the first couple recycled episodes until things get exciting. Lelouch still has the same motivation to putan end to his father\u2019s Britannian Empire nevertheless, how he will achieve it still remains a mystery, which is what makes the series so exciting to watch. Although part way through the intricate storyline the situation sort of goes haywire, as if the story acquires a mind of its own. Unlike the first season\u2019s in-depth storyline and thought provoking concept, this season tends to dumb things down a level by adding random developments and plot twist after plot twist, just for the writer\u2019s convenience. It also doesn\u2019t help that so much goes unexplained till the end, like the Emperor\u2019s motive and it didn\u2019t resolve things well either.\\n\\n\r\nWe have the same awesome cast of characters as before and with Lelouch & Suzaku\u2019s complex rivalry still there to add some spice to the mix. The introduction of many new characters is certainly welcomed here but there are also some that are unwelcomed to the story. In the end, the character aspect that I thought would remain the same throughout was partially ruined when certain characters underwent dramatic changes and others where killed off, once they fulfilled their purpose in the story. \\n\\n\r\nWell Sunrise must have had some spare cash because the production values are through the roof. The animation quality is so amazing and compared to the prequel, you\u2019ll be in for a real treat. Immensely detailed environments, slender CLAMP character designs, seamless CG effects and fluid action sequence are all here. Also the character gestures (especially Lelouch\u2019s) are just as exaggerated as before.\\n\\n\r\nThey don\u2019t skimp on the music either as there\u2019s an awesome soundtrack, which works well during both the exciting action and intense drama. On the other hand the music does get pretty messed up during the chaotic battles, as it constantly switches from one fanfare to the next. The OP and ED themes may take some getting used to but they are still pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this still remains as one of the most exciting mecha anime series of all time but a lot had to be sacrificed to get it there (characters, realism, logic). Just like in most mecha anime you can expect far too much time spent in cockpit-chat yet the battles remain as theatrical as ever before. Still it manages to fail in more areas than the first season such as: the pointless fanservice, over dramatizing scenes and typical Sunrise clich\u00e9s (characters surviving the impossible). So for those hoping for an even more intense experience than the first season may be somewhat let down, however this is still an amazing series.",

            "content": "Code Geass R2 is one of the best examples of how a very theatrical and over-the-top show that doesn't take itself too seriously can succeed by maximizing entertainment value. It is a series that shamelessly and knowingly appeals to the masses yet, surprisingly enough, somehow manages to keep a few thematic strengths beneath the surface to make the results worthwhile.\r\nFor you see, Code Geass in general is more than the sum of its parts. It's got flaws, sure, but I would argue they are almost besides the point. Well, at least as long as you're willing to play along with what the staff intended toaccomplish here. Needless to say, that can be much easier said than done.  \\n\\n\r\nIn essence, both the original Code Geass and R2 are quite emotional and youth-oriented in nature. There is no attempt to maintain plausibility in this show, so those looking for a serious take on alternate history or a down-to-earth war story shouldn't bother watching. That doesn't mean it is not without some internal logic, as twisted as it might be, but you absolutely need to learn to enjoy the craziness without entirely losing your mind or nerves in the process. \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the setting and world view. It is a rather whimsical fictional universe, no matter how you choose to look at things. What we have in this story is a world that liberally mixes futuristic science fiction with medieval fantasy right from its initial inception.\\n\\n\r\nOne the one hand, there are fantastical magical abilities, such as the power of Geass itself and everything related to it, along with powerful robots called Knightmare Frames that come in all sorts of varieties and colors. Some Knightmare models would be right at home in classic Real Robot mecha series such as Mobile Suit Gundam or Armored Trooper Votoms, while others appear to be more inspired by productions with a clear Super Robot touch, like Mobile Fighter G Gundam or Overman King Gainer among others. Code Geass R2 especially shows us a preference for the latter, roughly speaking, although without the quasi-organic look.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have emperors, princes, princesses and knights who often wear capes, use swords and speak using rather operatic and grandiose expressions or exaggerated hand gestures, along with a larger-than-life plot that combines shades of political intrigue with Japanese high school antics, robot warfare and constant one-upmanship, philosophical introspection and fanservice. A little bit of everything, one way or another, can be found here.\\n\\n\r\nOn paper, this sort of contradiction shouldn't work at all. For the more critical viewers, perhaps it never could have and never did. But strangely enough, I find myself in genuine disagreement. \\n\\n\r\nWhy? Because the show has just enough mad energy and self-aware bravado to pull it off. There are numerous signs that the production staff knew exactly what they were doing. Code Geass R2 is not attempting to present a series of events worthy of being included as part of a historical documentary. No, it's a work of pure entertainment, where by their own admission the writers loved coming up with crazy scenarios from week to week, as well as poking fun at themselves and their own work. Even at the expense of the poor characters, it must be said, who are trapped in the context of a story where their own relatively serious attitudes are at odds with almost everything that is going on. They are all playthings, at heart, used for the game called entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nFar too often, certain observers will tend to confuse the presence of drama with absolute seriousness, when the reality is that a show like this one is a case of tragicomedy and camp at work, deliberately combining or switching between humor and tragedy, sometimes within the same sequence of a given episode. \\n\\n\r\nWhy do all these unrealistic plans work? Why does Suzaku keep doing his spinkicks? Why is Sayoko a Ninja Maid? Why does Orange-kun steal the spotlight at times? Why does Emperor Charles have a ridiculous hair style and later goes flying off like a rocket? Why did a million people suddenly show up wearing the same costume? Because the staff found all of this amusing and, rightfully or wrongfully, thought the audience would derive the same sort of amusement from making such a flashy production. Considering the absurdly large popularity of the show at its height, I would argue that this wasn't an incorrect assumption.\\n\\n\r\nBut Code Geass is, one way or another, special because it manages to be more than just that. Which is why I must also touch upon some of the more interesting aspects of the show, regardless of how they weren't necessarily the primary focus point of R2 at all times.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, known as either Lelouch Lamperogue or Lelouch vi Britannia and particularly famous as the fabulous masked vigilante Zero, is a Byronic hero. That's a large part of what makes the series so attractive. Both his personality and the dynamics he develops with other characters, especially Suzaku, are a lot of fun to watch and quite intriguing to analyze. As a mastermind character with exaggerated speech patterns and physicality, Lelouch wears the clothes of a Light Yagami clone in the style of Death Note, but in reality he cannot entirely cope with the role. Which is what makes him more fallible and thus, I would argue, human. Humans -even so-called geniuses- can be perfectly irrational, contradictory and free to make mistakes that an omniscient spectator would consider foolish or worse. Humans are not perfect, not even the smartest ones. Much less those that are unstable teenagers or young adults, like Lelouch and most of the cast. \\n\\n\r\nAmong the other characters Suzaku, in particular, is worth mentioning because he is often the most misunderstood. Suzaku, comparable to but unlike Lelouch, also wears a mask that hides his real intentions...yet the trick is it isn't a physical one. He also has his own set of conflicting thoughts and emotions, explaining his behavioral changes between season one and R2, as well as his tortured path through the twists and turns of Code Geass R2 until the ending. Suzaku is a living contradiction who initially follows ideals that he doesn't entirely believe in, deep down, and as they break down the plot itself ultimately has him acknowledge this fact.\\n\\n\r\nLelouch wants to do good too, or so he tells himself, but cannot escape the direct and indirect consequences of his actions -as well as a lot of gratuitous bad luck- despite his outward attempts to portray himself as a demon or dark prince figure. The emphasis made on this sort of inner conflict is what makes Lelouch less of a product of the modern era and more of a throwback to 18th or 19th Century Romanticism, which is fitting considering the obvious neo-medieval aesthetic of the production. Romanticism appealed to emotion, not reason, and looked back to the Middle Ages, rejecting the Enlightenment's obsession with making everything out to be scientific at its core. As a Romantic character, Lelouch has access to a much wider range of emotions than other masterminds, who might have employed more plausible methods in their planning but tend to be far too aloof and distant in comparison. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality was standard for a television anime. Not particularly great as a whole, to be honest, but  nothing too bad either. You could even call it functional. I was actually rather impressed by the original soundtrack though, and would definitely recommend giving the background music compositions a good listen even outside the context of the show. \\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, there is no denying that Code Geass R2 isn't exactly perfect.  Oh, far from it. In some ways it is worse than the first series, by a significant degree, as it contains elements that several viewers might find fairly annoying to sit through. \\n\\n\r\nThe constant twists can get tiresome towards the final stages and, for all their contributions to increasing the fun factor, the way they risk detracting from the execution of the more interesting elements isn't a good thing. In fact, there were specific developments that suffered from a visible degree of popular backlash, which could have been avoided by slowing the pace and spacing things out to provide more details.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some cases of characters switching allegiance far too quickly, and that can be frustrating to witness even when there are valid reasons, some better than others, explaining their behavior in retrospect. In particular, a certain event involving the Black Knights should work fine on paper, when you  take a look at the general framework, but needed to be far better scripted and less rushed in practice. Instead, it comes off as a bit too petty. \\n\\n\r\nThat's part of why Code Geass R2 tends to challenge the average person's suspension of disbelief so much, especially for those who want to take Code Geass as a completely serious narrative when that's far from being the case. The more one looks into the real intentions of the creators, the more one realizes that respecting or maintaining any semblance of realism or absolute seriousness wasn't their main objective at all. \\n\\n\r\nNo matter what, the second half of the tale of Lelouch is an entertaining adventure with a few interesting complexities deserving of appreciation. But in the end, what we have here is a crazy anti-heroic neo-medieval romance, intended to keep the audience amused and having a good time, regardless of whatever else it could have been if it had chosen to follow another path. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5/10",

            "content": "I actually finished Code Geass - Hangyaku no Lelouch R2 only a few days after reviewing the first season. To be blunt, at that time I was under so much rage and bitterness caused by the first season that I was in no state to review again without unjustifiably dumping all over R2. But here I am, perhaps to fulfill my ocd to review the second half of a series or perhaps to be less biased than last time, but its most likely because I have to let others know why this series is far from a masterpiece. It feels funny actually saying that. \"Masterpiece\",I mean that word gets thrown around alot when people are excited. Its like waking up with your arm asleep. It's just not natural. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, so whether you are an anime veteran or virgin, one can appreciate genuine originality in a medium that isn't afraid to go at anything. I mean, general plots for anime involve incest,giant robots, pop bands, westerns, samurai duels, crazy dances, bombastic humor, and genuine what the hell moments. The plot for R2 tries to be original, by striking a balance between eccentric twists and down to earth qualities to no avail. Most of the main characters are just anime iconographies that try to act like they aren't by being unpredicatable and contradictory to what they believe in.This sort of left me thinking after every line \"oh, well she is probably lying to make a moment more dramatic down the road\". This sense of manufactured, maliable plot is interesting at first in R2, because it lets on that the plot might be heading somewhere worthwhile, but it doesn't. The show doesn't really \"do\" subtle. This next part is a spoiler, but it proves my point. Consider the character Shirley. Her mind is erased to protect her from danger. Then she finds out it was erased and realizes who did it. This was worthwhile because it set up a stronger bond between herself and Lelouch. It seemed realistic in a non realistic universe, which is what epic (large) animes do time and time again. However, in R2 her mind is wiped again and then she finds out who it was again. Great, we are back where we left off. Then she dies and Lelouch couldn\u2019t give a damn. All of that seemingly original and shocking plot development for nothing. This pattern is constant in R2 and gives the viewer the sense that none of the characters mean anything more than dramatic payoffs to Lelouch or Suzaku.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part I didn't seize violently from actually watching the second season. The art was to be expected from such a big budgeted series. It gave the stereotypical, polished, anime good looking characters justice. All the characters were made to look appealing to viewers, male or female. Except when some were made to be ugly(very few) in which case they were automatically killed off. This ode to perfection in beauty only made Sunrise's anime/mtv aspirations more apparent to me.  The art played no other role than \"pretty\" and shed no light on character development at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say about sound? This is the highpoint of sound in the series, \u201cpew, pew, yargggh\u201d. All of the openings get you more pumped up than when listening to the Jonas brothers make sweet love to their synthesizers. The tracks for the plot are more transparent than Casper on a Sunday and they let you know it time and time again. If something is bad, you better bet on some tense overtones, if a big plot twist occurs (about every 5 minutes) you better bet some fluttery instrument is going to be played. Basically, the producers said \u201cwe don\u2019t want to leave anything to interpretation, I mean, these anime freaks want to escape their sad pit falls known as their lives, so just get them turned on and play the appropriate f**king music.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a letdown when these high priced shounen campaigns come out because they often give the general non-anime populous the wrong idea concerning what anime can achieve in art. People flipping channels only to see someone like Lelouch cackling like a mad man might think A) this is cool!, B) wow, anime really is just weird Japanese cartoons, or C) This is sort of like mtv. What I mean to say is that R2\u2019s characters do absolutely nothing to redefine anything in the medium. The girls look good and are subtlety subservient to the guys. Even Kallen and Cornelia. Kallen is a tool for Zero, no matter how strong she is and later a larger tool for Schneizel. Cornelia was actually great at first but then she became grouped in with the sort like Villeta and becomes one of those people who wait for their men to come home from war. If the main characters are considered, things get a little different. Lelouch has to question his reasoning many times over and is actually believable when he acts ruthless. I mean, most people are like that but just don\u2019t have the balls (or in this case Geass) to back up their claims. He is a pseudo anti hero in that regard, but the producers always flipped him back to \u201cgood Lelouch\u201d to make him likable at school. I thought that was also believable at first since one would most likely lie at school if they were a terrorist. But when he started speaking with sympathy for his friends it just didn\u2019t seem justified. The only thing that really validated his motives as a character came at the end of the series, which was ironically helped by another character, Suzaku. I'm not even gonna go into Suzaku, because, he is the walking epitome of what the show tried to be and failed at. A genuine contradiction. \\n\\n\r\nWatching R2 is like watching a show because you feel like you'll miss out. Its like high school. If you want to be and see a part of anime hype, this is the anime for you.. Want to kill some time after working? great. Sunrise put this little mellow-dramatic action piece that will take you out of your life for 30 minutes, check it out.  But please, please, I cant stress this enough. Don't call up a friend and say \"ah man, I just watched this show called Code Geass and its the best anime ever\". Because you will have just fulfilled Sunrise's shadow Nazi corporation agenda.",

            "content": "I recently revisited this series, it has been many years since I last saw it and so refreshing my memory of it has brought with it a number of revelations. NOTE - THIS IS A SPOILERIFIC REVIEW DO NOT PROCEED IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN BOTH SEASONS. \r\nOkay, so what is Code Geass? Code Geass as you're all aware is a story about one man's struggle against an empire. It's also a combination of Gundam and Deathnote (unashamed melange) with elements of mindfuck Eva thrown in at the end, oh and not to forget the whole high school atmosphere that is so woefully and forcefully maintainedthroughout. So what this leaves us with is a show that wants to take the best of every genre and combine it with the typical light yagami personality (of course this is in reality the Reinhard von Lohengramm personality but most people haven't seen Logh). \\n\\n\r\nFor all its flaws the first season was actually very well executed in the sense that the plot progressed as it should have done and the rebellion failing at the end was hunky dory. I felt I could look beyond all of the high-school antics and silly dilly dallying which are heavily out of place in a show that wants to be taken seriously, I could ignore them because the show had spirit, you could sense Lelouch's hatred for the Empire and I found myself sympathizing with his struggle. \\n\\n\r\nThere are of course a number of inexplicable loop-holes that the show seeks to rely on, in s1 for example - how on Earth did a school-kid start commanding an army of Knightmares straight off the bat (yes he had geass but geass implies the ability to control people - not pilot knightmares and command forces on a battlefield). C.C saves his ass a number of times very conveniently. \\n\\n\r\nSuzaku's role was simply to play the Athrun Zala to Lelouch's Kira Yamato, nothing like a bit of potential yaoi teenage angst to get the show moving, Suzaku's own motivations remained understandable in R1 but went completely Haywire in r2...in fact the whole show went haywire in R2.\\n\\n\r\nR2 Begins with Lelouch getting his memory restored, but the whole scenario with him being watched to draw out CC was too convenient as it was used as an excuse to keep the high school drama going for almost the whole season, even if you have managed to brainwash your observation team and create a dummy any rational empire would have noticed something was up when Zer0 had returned and proven himself to be as dangerous as the last Zer0. The transition to s2 was dismal, and Suzaku had turned into a complete asshole (which is odd considering his personality in r1) - one might blame it on Euphemia's death but then wouldn't he want to live on in the same way she would have? \\n\\n\r\nNina that useless lesbian from R1 somehow gets a main role after becoming the show's albert einstein and creating a nuclear bomb, Schneizel is an idiot and could have been turned into a much better \"L\" like character - certainly the way he used Euphemia in R1 made me get my hopes up that he would turn into a real adversary in R2.\\n\\n\r\nCharles and Marianne want to turn the world into a giant lump of frozen consciousness so there will be no more lies.....Yeah....this is where you've jumped off the deep end and started with all the ham-handed philosophy and Evanegelion imitation..actually this could count as a Haruhi imitation too, in any event it was unnecessary and uncalled for. Strange how quickly Lelouch decides to kill his mother too (considering he has acted up until now for her sake)\\n\\n\r\nLelouch killing Mariann leads me to another problem with the show which is: that people seem to have no problem backstabbing one another, I mean fine I can understand backstabbing when there's an environment conducive to it BUT Why did the black knights betray Zer0 after some bullshit from their enemy Schneizel? I mean at the most they would have demoted him as their leader but instead they sold him out. \\n\\n\r\nEssentially the show relies on this abysmal allegiance switching mechanism that it throws into overdrive in r2 - so people change sides like nobody's business, this is supposed to create excitement and in a way it does but if it's not well justified it leaves you with a sense of being cheesed off. \\n\\n\r\nAlso the whole \"Area 11 will become the Nippon Area\" card was then recycled with Schneizel's \"Nunally should become Queen assertion\" - the enemy offers the other side a solution that they would be amenable to in order to stop the battle (another trope I found in the show).  \\n\\n\r\nClearly there are some good thing's about the show\\n\r\n- all the women are amazingly hot, C.C's pizza-butt and Kallen's tits are yummy\\n\r\n- there is still the same underlying spirit that r1 had (just toned down and more heavily destroyed by bad writing) \\n\r\n- The ending is satisfying and provides closure.",

            "content": "Before reading this review take into account that this reviewer has not seen the entirety of series and that the series could possibly be completely different as a finished project than what it is at the time of the review.\r\nOverview:\r\nAfter seeing Code Geass R2  #2 on the top anime page I felt it necessary to put my word in as I cannot understand this series being even in the top 10. Yes, the first season of Code Geass was possibly one of the best animes of all time and would probably be one of the first that I would recommend. However, I feel thatthe quality of series has diminished with the introduction of the second season. This reduction in quality, in my opinion, can be attributed to three main additions to the series: fan service, new characters and a less realistic atmosphere (I know what your immediate response to this might be, but read on)\\n\\n\r\nI suppose this is a very biased view, but I simply find fan service disagreeable to my tastes. I suppose it is ignorable however in the second season fan service can be found generally in every episode, and I think that most viewers would agree with the notion that fan service takes time away from the story and is an annoyance.\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason why I feel that Code Geass has diminished in quality has been the introduction of several second-rate characters to the plot that draw attention away from the excellent combination of original characters that made the original series fascinating. This in combination with the fan service ultimately leads to less  character progression and a weaker story altogether.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, I feel that for an anime that projects an anti-hero, a genius at that, should sport a more realistic plot. I know that anime in general is in no way realistic, but usually there is some universal concept what a human is and how it reacts that is similar to what we would expect, and while there is some twist to the reality or physics of the world created by the anime there are still logical limits. Some moments in this anime are best described as ridiculous, unbelievable or just wtf moments. I just think that the writers could have done a better job, tis all. The original series while having the same difficulty just as many animes have, seemed to cope with this issue better than its sequel.\\n\\n\r\nMisc:\\n\r\nThe opening theme song of the new season in my opinion is less than stellar considering what Flow did for the previous season, but the closing song and accompanying animation I feel fits with the plot and the theme of the anime, while still being enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nThe art remains good just as it was in the previous season, no surprises here. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed the first season of Code Geass please by all means watch this season as it is also enjoyable, but dont get your hopes up when you see this in the top 5 anime. If you are new to the Code Geass scene then I would recommend the previous season as it will set up a base for you to watch the second season and was also more enjoyable in my opinion",

Body gestures in some scenes even make me think of Variable Geo.Bedlam as the world was set, some new characters is desighed for being killed only,someone without sense of being died a grand death,someone set as a pierrot ended as a hero,the plot is trying to cater for all the audience's taste from time to time but lose the control of the changing in role's character. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nEverything does well with the music.BGM has a medium quality and I feel lucky that Hitomi also made excellent performance in R2.As for Ali Project,it was said on 2CH that this middle-aged woman's troating can easily break down a person's esthetic standard if he/she is still a virgin.&lt;(*^__^*)&gt;joking only\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nThe guys nowadays can hardly find out what really take efforts in the plot.Even such an explicit end as CLAMP used 20 years before can move them to tears successfully.they call it a masterpiece,a classic,an amazing  serial while the director has already been devastated by SUNRISE.Congratulations !you guys enjoyed a half-year-long barbarous rape in R2.Should I say &quot;All Hail Lelouch!&quot; as you guys did?\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nNo more argue. it's ture that i dont like CG. After all, I wrote these words for unleashing only.\\n\r\np.s. \u8c37\u53e3\u3055\u3093,see you in GONZO this month.\\n\\n",

            "content": "What do you know, yet another review for the sequel of what is arguably one of the most popular anime of this decade. Code Geass R2 had an INCREDIBLY big shoe to fill after an very impressive first season. Did the show live up to its own hype? If you are already scrolling over the 'not helpful' button because of my overall score, I recommend you read the review fully.\r\nStory:\r\n+ Fast paced and full of mecha action\r\n+ Plot twists and unexpected events is this anime's favourite thing\r\n+ Very intriguing concepts are revealed regarding the power of the Geass which was left a mystery on season1\\n\r\n+ One of the better final episodes in recent memory\\n\\n\r\n- The action shifted from a more tactical and strategic perspective into a more generic \"new mecha with higher specs owns everything in its path\" fashion.\\n\r\n- As much as the plot twists managed to shock, unfortunately many times they failed to give proper explanations for them.\\n\r\n- Much of the anime was spent on the battles, and then rushed the main plot in the last couple of episodes. Not the best way to spread such a complex plot.\\n\r\n- Many questions were left unanswered, and some aspects were never revisited from season 1.\\n\r\n- They tried too hard.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n+ The glory of HD, I bow to you\\n\r\n+ CLAMP designs (if you like them)\\n\r\n+ Fantastic color pallete\\n\\n\r\n- CLAMP designs (if you hate them)\\n\r\n- Compared to season 1. The animators seemed to have forgotten how to draw curved lines, the face designs could poke your eyes out.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n+ Not much to discuss, the music is great\\n\r\n+ Fantastic voice acting, kuddos to all seiyuus\\n\r\n+ Very nice insert songs\\n\\n\r\n- Some of the style of the music may not be for everyone's tastes\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n+ Very intriguing and mysterious characters. And memorable too.\\n\r\n+ Many side characters with a lot of potential grace the anime constantly\\n\r\n+ Regardless of what anyone says, Suzaku knows how to stir the fanbase's emotions whether its hate, or love.\\n\r\n+ Lelouch makes the anime worth watching.\\n\\n\r\n- If you are not Lelouch or Suzaku, you will never be given much time to shine.\\n\r\n- Characters are introduced, and then disposed WAY too many times throughout the series.\\n\r\n- Killing characters only to bring them back for the sake of shock  WITHOUT any explanation of how they survive plagues the show way too many times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I cannot lie when I say R2 is definitely an extremely enjoyable anime to watch. But sometimes its hard to not notice how ridiculous it can get in terms of plot and character development. My biggest let down was the way the plot decayed from the fantastic quality of the first season (which I gave a 10 in plot) to the still enjoyable but faulty \"trying too hard to shock you\" attempts of season 2.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Code Geass R2 IS a good anime, and its still a good sequel to the greatness of the first season and definitely better than a lot of other animes out there. But the anime itself falls under its own greatness by trying too hard to maintain its reputation. If you liked the first season then there is no way u wont like the second one. And if you have never watched Code Geass at all, I strongly suggest you do. Regardless of the hype, this is still one of the better and most refreshing series in recent years.",

            "content": "Well, folks, it has been a short time but I am now ready to take a look at one of the most notorious anime of all time Code Geass R2.\r\nCode Geass R2 come out at 2008 and ever since it finished airing anime fans were heavily divided on R2.\r\nThere are people who called it a masterpiece and saying it's one of the best anime of all time people despising it with a burning passion and calling it a train-wreck or people who thought it was okay.\r\nWhat boat am I in?\r\nFor a long, while I use to be a boat where I thought Code Geass R2was a masterpiece and I thought no anime can top Code Geass R2\\n\\n\r\nHowever as the years went by as I got older as well as watching more anime and started to buy anime on Blu-Ray/DVD my opinion on certain anime has changed.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, I use love Sailor Moon as a kid but after watching more magical girl shows such as Cardcaptor Sakura, Madoka Magica as well as re-watching first season of Sailor Moon again in 2016 I thought the show didn't hold up well as it has a lot of flaws such as weak episodic story, mediocre characters and lackluster animation that has a lot of stock footage.\\n\\n\r\nWell after recently re-watching Code Geass R2 for the 18th time on DVD from Manga Entertainment in the UK.\\n\r\nDid my opinion of Code Geass R2 change?\\n\r\nDo I think Code Geass R2 is a masterpiece, do I think Code Geass R2 was an okay show or now do I think Code Geass R2 is a train-wreck?\\n\r\nWell, you will find out from this review.\\n\r\nHello, everyone, this is Shawn aka PhantomKurata and I will be reviewing Code Geass R2 and with that out the let's begin.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe year is now 2018. It\u2019s been one year since the failure of the black rebellion and the supposed death of Zero. The Black Knights have been defeated by the Britianians. Lelouch is now living a normal life at high school where all of his memories about his sister and him being zero have been completely wiped out. One day Lelouch along with his pseudo brother Rolo decided to go to gambling at the Babel Tower. Soon the black knights lead by C.C Launches an attack on the complex to retrieve Lelouch. She restores Lelouch's memories allowing him to use Geass to kill his enemies and resume his role as Zero, the masked leader of the Black Knights. Lelouch later finds out that the emperor, his father has altered his memories with Geass as well learning that his sister Nunnally is still alive. Now Lelouch must try to rescue her sister back as well as once again try to defeat the holy britannian empire with the help of the black knights.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Code Geass R2 is honestly not that good. In fact, it's really bad, especially when coming from R1 which for the most part had a great story that good writing for the most part.\\n\r\nThe first half of R2 is mostly a big rehash of R1 where most of the events are taken straight from R1 and they slapped it on to R2. Sure there are differences here and there but a lot of the time I get a huge sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. It also doesn\u2019t help that pacing for the first half was just terrible as it very slow and boring. Not to mention the tone shifts in R2 were unbearable here as the first half of R2 likes to change very quickly from a very serious tone to a more goofy tone. It\u2019s honestly really distracting. In terms of writing, story direction and themes the second half of R2 is absolutely horrendous. It\u2019s like the writers just give up and said screw it let\u2019s just throw shit on the wall and see what\u2019s sticks. From black knights betraying Zero due to them trusting the enemy Schneizal to the whole Sword Of Akasha subplot bullshit which was pretentious as hell. \\n\r\nNot to mention themes and realism are just thrown out the window in favor of people preaching to unrealistic nonsense.\\n\r\nNow am going to list 5 biggest flaws that I have with R2. 5 Major problems of that completely destroyed the show's quality  \\n\r\n1. The school episodes. The school episodes of R1 while annoying they were actually tolerable to watch for the most part. The school episodes R2 are just awful to watch. Those episodes alone completely butchered to the tone of series and most of those episodes were pointless in the long run.\\n\\n\r\n2. China Arc.\\n\r\nThis arc was pain filler. That arc didn't do anything in the story, it didn't have a real purpose of existing and everything in that arc gives us nothing but plot holes.\\n\r\nI have nothing more to say about this stupid arc.\\n\\n\r\n3. Cliffhangers\\n\r\nThe cliffhangers in R1 were well executed and it manages to make the viewer excited for the next episode just to see what happens next. The cliffhangers in R2 are very hit or mess with some them being good the others are flat out retarded.\\n\r\n4. Plot holes.\\n\r\nOh my god I have never seen an anime that has this amount of plot holes in my life. Keep in mind I was the same guy who has seen Gundam Seed Destiny, Guilty Crown, Digimon Adventure 02 and Sword Art Online and all of these shows that I just mentioned has a tonne of plot holes. Code Geass R2 has some of the worst plotholes I have ever seen.\\n\r\nAm going to list some of them right now.\\n\r\nHow did Suzaku survive the explosion after the battle with Kallen\\n\r\nHow is Suzaku still consumed by Lelouch's Geass by the end of R1? \\n\r\nWhere did theses Knightmare come from?\\n\r\nThe show never bothers to explain stuff like this as the show likes to waste on pointless stuff.\\n\r\n5. Sword of Akasha subplot.\\n\r\nThis is what fucking happens if you take 13 episode subplot and crammed it in into one episode.\\n\r\nIt's fucking awful and it makes the show a lot worse than it already is.\\n\r\nNot only there was no real build up or foreshadowing but it had a bunch of pretentious dialogue that is cringe-worthy.\\n\r\nLet's not forget a number of plot holes it has and even an average viewer can easily notice all the plot holes in the stupid subplot. Did I forget the pacing was nothing but horrid as it moves way too fucking fast and by the end of the subplot you will not care at all due to how poorly written and paced it was? Before I close the story selection off I like to say this.\\n\r\nDead characters that die in a series should stay dead. Seriously did the writers read the Bible of Jesus Yamato or something?\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story of Code Geass R2 is hot garbage. Really hot garbage. Most of the writing in this show felt like a bad fanfic done by a 13-year-old on fanfic.net who had no idea of what he was doing.\\n\r\nThe pacing was awful, the tone shifts were unbearable, the plot holes were everywhere and it has some of the worst executed subplots I have ever seen in a anime.\\n\r\nThankful the ending of Code Geass R2 manages to give us a satisfying end to the series that was well executed but this does not excuse the awful writing in the series.\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nI honestly have mixed feeling for this cast. In R1 most of the characters were likable and interesting but here some of the previous characters in R1 went from good to either being mediocre or downright bad.\\n\r\nNow normally I would talk about the main character first but here I would like to talk about some of the supporting characters first before we get to the main characters because I have a lot of complaints.\\n\r\nLet's start with the members of the black knights minus Kallen and Lelouch.\\n\r\nIn R1 most of the black knight's members were kinda likable in they own way and they actually felt like actual soldiers with a goal.\\n\r\nIn R2 almost all of the black knight's members became really unlikeable due to the stupid decisions that they made especially in the second half were in one point of the show they downright betray Zero after they being convinced by schnitzel words.\\n\r\nOkay why you all follow the words of an enemy. Expect to be complete dipshits!!!\\n\\n\r\nMily and Rivalz. I thought they were fun and characters in the show even tho they were not important in the main story. Also, Mily's graduation from  Ashford Academy is one of the sweeter and better moments in R2.\\n\\n\r\nShirley. Just I thought this dumb bitch can get any worse this show happens. While it didn't go into any detail of this character in R1 I wanted to save all of my criticism towards Shirley in R2 because she is easily the second worst character in the whole series.\\n\r\nThroughout the series, she does nothing but talks about Lelouch. Almost every freaking time.\\n\r\nIt's one thing to be in love but it's a different thing to only exist to suck on a guy's dick and to service tension bait for the plot, events, and writing.\\n\r\nShe was bad in R1 but this show manages to make her even more insufferable. She is bland, her dialogue is asinine and she's is an overall bitch of a character who only exists to suck on Lelouch's dick from start to finish.\\n\r\nAm glad she was killed off in the second half because man I was a happy camper when it happened.\\n\r\nShirley is a definition of a very poorly written character and I hope the directors and writers of Sunrise will not make a female character like that ever again. \\n\\n\r\nNina. She is an annoying trashy character who still can't get over Euphy's death as well as only existing to cause drama.\\n\r\nI have nothing more to say about this character.\\n\\n\r\nKallen. What did they do you, Kallen?\\n\r\nIn R1 she is a beautiful badass pilot who is likable and had a bit of character development. In R2 the writers were like do you know what let's take all the development of all as well as her who made her a likable character. Throw it out of the window turn her into a unlikeable fan-service character who gets kidnapped by the Britannia forces and later just like the Black Knights she ends up joining Britannian side after being convinced by the dipshits that are called the black knights.\\n\r\nI will never understand the writers logic.\\n\r\nYou took a character that I loved and has such amazing potential. Killed it shredded to pieces and turn her into a unlikeable bitch who has been reduced to fan-service bait for the horny teenagers out there.\\n\\n\r\nRolo. I really despise Rolo I really fucking do.\\n\r\nHe is an annoying brat who whines a lot. Also, this little shit wanted to kill Lelouch's Little Sister Nually who keep in mind is blinded fragile disabled girl on a wheelchair. Who the hell write this shit?\\n\r\nC.C.\\n\r\nIn R1 she was an interesting character with a lot of mystery behind her and I overall like her relationship with Lelouch.  She mostly stays the same in R2 but after that character reset for short while she has been reused into a fan service object that has lost all memories.\\n\\n\r\nSuzaku. While I kinda liked him in R1 despite him being hypocritical at times. In R2 Suzaku became a recantation of Kira Yamato (Jesus Yamato) (Gundam Seed) complete with his hax plot armor bullshit along with his preachy attitude and hypocritical ideals. Like with Kallen everything that I liked about Suzaku is now thrown out of the window and he devolves into a Gary sue.\\n\r\nI have nothing more to say about this Hypocrital fuck.\\n\\n\r\nLelouch.\\n\r\nI honestly have mixed feelings towards Lelouch in R2. While I like him for having good character development in the second half due to set events but at the same time, I really have to question his character ideals and attitude.\\n\r\nRemember in R1 where Lelouch had a more calm and confident attitude and had great ideals that were believable. R2, on the other hand, is more aggressive and more impatient meaning his a lot whinier not to mention his not as consistent as a character compared to his R1 counterpart.\\n\r\nHis so called brotherly relationship is honestly retarded\\n\r\nThroughout the series, he had a deep hatred from Rolo and he wanted to kill Rolo. However, after a certain event in the second half of R2 as well as the black knights betraying him he out of nowhere starts caring for Rolo...\\n\r\nI will never understand Lelouch logic whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly prefer Lelouch in R1.\\n\\n\r\n\u00c1s for the rest of the characters.\\n\r\nMinus the ones liked in R1 there are pretty forgettable especially the knights of the round.\\n\r\nOverall the characters in R2 are a massive step-down compared to the R1 counterparts.\\n\r\n4.5/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nThe visuals of Code Geass are still good as ever. Character movement is still smooth as ever Characters designs still look great and the animation for the mecha battles are still great.\\n\r\nHowever, there is one thing that really annoyed me about the mecha fights in R2.\\n\\n\r\nThe overkill formula. You see the mecha battles in Code Geass R1 had actual strategy and tactics making the mecha battles more fresh and exciting to watch. For some reason, the writers decided to use that stupid overkill formula that we saw from Gundam Seed and Wing and decided to put it into R2.\\n\r\nIt honestly makes the mecha battle boring and unexciting to watch as most of the main characters mechas just pop out of nowhere and countless amounts of nightmares with a single shot.\\n\\n\r\nThe mecha design pretty much the same as R1 we still have the god awful Sutherland's and other boring mechs. However, there were some great mecha designs in R2  for key characters such as Suzaku\u2019s Lancelot Albion, Gino's Tristan Divider and Kallen's Guren S.E.I.T.E.N. Eight Elements.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing that I like to mention is the fanservice. R1 had fan-service and least in R1 the fan-service was not that distracting as its only exist for comedic moments of the show with a few exceptions. R2 on the other hand no so much. It\u2019s all over the pace even in serious moments of the show and it\u2019s really distracting to watch.   \\n\r\nOverall while the visuals of R2 are still good but the mecha battles were very lackluster.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nIf there was one great thing to come out from R2 is the music. I really like the soundtrack as almost all the tracks were memorable and had a great tone.\\n\r\nThe first opening theme 02 is a very catchy song. The second opening theme World End is one of my favorite anime openings ever.\\n\r\nThe endings themes are a mixed bag for me. The first ending theme Shiawase Neiro is a good opening theme while the second ending theme Waga Routashi Aku no Hana is a forgettable ending theme.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe sub is good but I personally still prefer the dub as it very well acted for the most part not to mention it has Johnny Young Bosh as Lelouch who does a wonderful job voicing Lelouch.\\n\\n\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nMan, what a review this has been.\\n\r\nOverall I can say that Code Geass R2 not only a bad anime from Sunrise but it's just plain bad squeal.\\n\r\nThe story was terribly written, the plot holes were outrageous and most of the characters including the new ones sucked.\\n\r\nThe only things that saved Code Geass R2 of being in the same tier as Seed Destiny, Victory Gundam and Accel Word were the music, visuals, the ending and some of the characters that were in it. Everything else was a trainwreck and it made me wonder what exactly went wrong here.\\n\r\nFortunately, There is a reason why Code Geass R2 ended up the way it did. Originally Code Geass R2 was meant to be on a midnight timeslot. However, due to fan popularity as well as Gundam 00 Season 2 taking that Saturday midnight slot it was moved to Sunday afternoons at 5pm. That alone explains why the most of the mature content, script, and themes from R1 had to be heavily toned down and it ultimately affected the overall quality of Code Geass R2 especially the first half.\\n\r\nIt's such a shame really because Code Geass R2 had to potential to be great but it ended being a failure as a result.\\n\r\nI hope when it comes for future shows from Sunrise that the directors and writers learn from the mistakes that were made in Code Geass R2\\n\r\nThe anime may be popular during its run back in the day but as the old same goes. Popularity does not equal quality and Code Geass R2 is no different.\\n\r\nI hope Code Geass Lelouch of the Resurrection fixes everything that was wrong from Code Geass R2.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 4.5/10\\n\r\nAnyway, this was Shawn aka KurataTrigger and I will see you guys next time.",

It is good, probably the best point in the series, but it's average.\r\nSound: I like the VAs (Voice Actors), and the songs were OK, but nothing really wow-ed me.\r\nCharacters: I do say, Lelouche is a very good character, but he becomes predictable, and that kills his only good point - the rest ofthe characters are seen everywhere else, nothing new, really.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I gave it a three. It really wasn't entertaining. After seeing the first season, this was like watching it over again. I knew what was going to happen, and then watched it happen. This series is basically Death Note, except replacing the suspense with the occasional sighting of a mecha. Between the two series, there is an innumerable amount of &quot;plot twists&quot;. I put the quotes around that term because they stop becoming twists, and become so predictable it seems like that would be the obvious thing to do.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I would not recommend this show, I remember after finishing Code Geass the first, I wanted to watch more! I wanted more! But I was disappointed...I wanted more Code Geass, not the first season. Overall, the show is HIGHLY overrated, I mean at 10 episodes, the watchers rated it number two out of every single anime out there, behind only the infamous (and highly enjoyable, although some of the other features are often debated about) Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. But back to my point, how did a second series, only half-way through, pass not only every single other anime in existence, but also the first series!? People are idiots.",

One of the few which are worthy of high praise from my view.\r\nThe story and character development were great, even though there might of been some totally unrelated episodes, this was to give the audience a break from all the fighting and the major politics which are happening in the background.\r\nEach character had done their part extremely well, I felt as though the characters had just the perfect amount of screen time, though me being a C.C fan I didfeel a slight abandoning of her near the end. This goes without saying that Kallen's major screen time ended more earlier then C.C. Code Geass R2 manages to bring back some of the older character back in from the first season, this is true +1 from me cause I really did enjoy seeing some of the old people come back to kick some butt.\\n\\n\r\nThe story... ended off .. how should I put it, I guess I had expected it, but it was done extremely well, yet it was an emotional moment as well.... my hands are still somewhat shaky....Throughout the whole series Lelouch's master plans were demonstrated with vast, brilliant colours and the plot twists are placed in nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe bgm (background music) weren't anything of new, but all fitted in perfectly with each scene, the ending song in the last episode just put me on the verge of crying...\\n\\n\r\nI had thoroughly enjoyed this anime and the first one as well. The ending half of these series just captivated me to watch the next and the next episode after non stop! It is a brilliant anime and 'in my point' better then the first, it has alot more darker elements and plot twists, yet got me all hyped and emotional at the right times.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime highly to people!!\\n\\n\r\nCheers~ \\n\r\nP.S - My thoughts obviously will differ from everyone elses ;)",

Lelouch/Zero that start as an hero and an extraordinary strategist  acting like a crazy man, his enemies became his allies too often. The story give us many example of stupid situations like tha knight of Cornelia that continue to call Lelouch&quot;my princess&quot; or V.V. killing Marianne with a giant submachine guns. Too many examples of stupidity are present in this ugly seaso that have successfully sink what time ago i believe was one of the greatest i ever saw.

            "content": "Finally, the Code Geass saga has come into an end. All hail Code Geass!You are one of the most successful anime this decade (both in fanbase and business)\r\nLet me introduce first why Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 certainly leaves us heated debates: The magnificent season 1 ended with an excruciating cliffhanger but had confirmed itself a sequel. Why was this sequel made?\r\n1. To feed the gluttonous fanbase\r\n2. To earn more cash\r\n Moreover, the director, story writer and the production staff was pressured to make Code Geass R2...\r\n1. \"A lot better than season 1\"\r\n2. Satisfy enthusiasts by bringing a nice end\r\n3. Still must haveromance, comedy and fanservice wrapped up together no matter how dramatic the show has become\\n\r\n4. Have action figures for money\\n\r\n5. Appeal to new viewers curious about its popularity.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nGiven the backdrop, and many expectations, I say CGR2 succeeded in making a satisfying story to most of the fanbases. Why? Given all the demands, almost as good as Code Geass wrapping up multiple genres together, R2 is definitely good in the things it offers. CGR2 retained CG's level of suspense and intelligence, precisely formulating mind-blowing action coupled with intense drama, psychological warfare and some comedic scenes. Probably few or none can match the amount and impact of major  plot twists plentiful in this series. Totally intense and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThose are the good points we should and can observe. But R2 suffers from unavoidable sequel failures and potentials wasted or mediocre parts. To satisfy new viewers, it has sacrificed the beautiful climatic cliffhanger made by its prequel, restarting the advanced plot into a almost new setting.  They broke the line. The primary focus on the storyline and main characters shifted into new subplots and plenty new characters(and mecha too): One may miss the classic fights of opposing pairs as R2 makes less of these. Consistency is also an issue, most of the episodes are well formulated but some are too fast paced with significant parts  not emphasized.  \\n\\n\r\nGenerally, R2 cannot meet many of our expectations, and will and can not answer many of the mysteries that was left. Lots of its prevalent themes are dissolved and replaced by new ones:\\n\\n\r\n1. The fight for independence of Japan changed into a worldwide scale\\n\r\n2. The  shadowy Order of Black Knights is already openly exposed\\n\r\n3. The humanism of the first season is reduced and existentialism is added\\n\\n\r\nYet it ended the saga very well based in the majority of fans' and enthusiast's opinions.  Yet with all its flaws, it has substance: with all the mecha, it sums up the concept of war, love, hate, desire, freedom, life into the simple existence of the Geass.\\n\\n\r\n Art \\n\\n\r\n Hurray for R2's animation! The quality is obviously higher! Costume designs (made by CLAMP) are very impressive and creative (though some may be too much). Coupled with new mecha designs, CGR2 became much more \"colorful\" than the last season. The endings are artistically drawn as they give us some symbolic hints of what may happen soon.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem is, about two or three episodes destroyed the consistent high quality animation! The panels there are even worse than season 1's!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nMusic score is identical to the first season: epic. It is also consistent  with the alternate universe they set; the mix of classical music with the touch of modern action tracks. The background music fits the scenes perfectly. The issue is the OP's , ED's  Overall their lyrics reflect the themes very well but some will not appeal to some fans. Expect two Orange Range's, a Flow and an Ali Project.\\n\\n\r\nThe Hitomi insert songs are definitely more plentiful here and they give us heart warming or soul searching feelings. Well used and beautiful, they amplify the goodness of certain scenes. Yet because they are plentiful, they get little play time, some of them are not very memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of season one left a number of possibilities.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the \"restarting\" of the setting and \"rewinding\" of the advanced plot I say that character development started where it was left, continuing the conflict. But the progress would not be made possible without our main protagonist Lelouch Lamperouge's bravado. Bravo! Lelouch is still Lelouch! The depiction of his endeavors are well portrayed symbolically by his development with four women:\\n\\n\r\nKallen with the Black Knights, with the concept of his \"mask\"\\n\r\nShirley with Ashford Academy, with the concept of \"victim\" of power\\n\r\nNunally with his royal bloodline, with the concept of \"wishes\"\\n\r\nCC with the Geass, with the concept of \"tomorrow\"\\n\\n\r\nHis conflict with his enemy Suzaku remains intense and inspires both sadism and pity. The clash of ideal and reality is still emphasized though distributed into many people. R2 also gives chance for the underdeveloped characters to shine their dramas, necessary or not.The shifting of focus is a little bit hazier compared to the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe character of interactions and personalities is outstanding, its the show's  itself that may be a bit disappointing. As for the integrity of R2, plentiful unnecessary  fanservice ruined it somehow, by distracting the viewers. Also, some philosophical dialogues, though trivial, are not excellent; failing to provoke thoughts. The failed attempts to deepen things that are originally not, disappoints viewers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall\\n\\n\r\nSatisfaction is a personal opinion, so for me I can say that I really enjoyed CGR2-though some episodes are not very magnificent or annoying. The six months of anticipation is worth it and it was a nice experience.\\n\\n\r\nI really believe that CGR2 ended very well. And I should say that everyone has the right to rate this anime based on either its achievements or failures. Based on watching this series, I am sure that it could have been much better but definitely not a trainwreck.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This anime is nothing but watchable and does not deserve any remarkable praise. For me it is hard to understand why this series is so highly acclaimed.\r\nStory (1/10)\r\nCertainly, the screenplay is the weakest part of R2. What is most evident is the complete lack of any general idea for the series. Events usually happen at random. Lelouch simply causes stir somewhere and hopes everything will turn out the way he wishes. People change sides for no clear reason (and if the reason is specified, it isretarded). Plot twists are totally unjustified and often defy logic, not to mention probability. Generally, the dynamism greatly exceeds the substance of plot.\\n\\n\r\nEnding was probably intended to be moving, but is simply ridiculous and makes you wonder why you wasted more than a few hours of your life watching that show.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is rather good, but there is nothing exceptionally noteworthy. Mecha designs look quite impressive. So do battles. Unfortunately, there are too many cases of poor quality drawing to give animation a better score.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few catchy tones, but the soundtrack is nowhere near masterpieces such as NGE. The sound generally matches what happens on the screen well and cannot be described as annoying or anything like that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhereas characters were one of the best aspects of the first season, the second one looks quite lousy in that field. \\n\\n\r\nThe best character of the show - Emperor Charles, is no longer a brave and ambitious (albeit violent) king that cares about his country and has a consistent (albeit controversial) view on realiity. In R2 he is some kind of a maniac with superpowers who in some unbelivable way combines Gendou Ikari with Nietsche and Hitler.\\n\\n\r\nLelouch was a little bit irritating in the first season and it does not change in the second one. Actually, things get worse. Lelouch constantly rushes from place to place and does not think much about his actions. Later, he develops some kind of pseudo-philosophy to justify his strange deeds. His strong sister complex and ambiguous attitude to Suzaku remain just as disturbing, as they were before.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a number of new characters, but they are either completely unconvinving (Xinge) or terribly annoying (Lolo). Schneizel plays a much greater role in the second series and is presented as an evil genius obsessed with power, world domination etc. Yes, the only thing CG lacked were evil geniuses resembling those form old James Bond movies.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the series is quite fun to watch. It is so chaotic and unpredictable, that it makes you really curious what absurdity is going to happen next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5",

This anime is simply amazing. It leveled up greatly from season one to this masterpiece. The openings and endings are great. There are characters that you will love and also characters that you will hate. I can also say that you will love the characters that you hated in season 1 and vice versa. You will see how each character will leave an impact to you. The art improved from the first season. The storyand plot twist are very deep that it might take your breaths away. Wow! I really like everything about this anime. Every episode becomes greater. I highly recommend this anime especially to those who likes tactical animes and to those who didn't like how season one ended.",

It almost seems the target audience R2 was aimed at are 14 year old brats with extreme cases of A.D.D. By the end of R2 I stopped caring who won, and who died... I in fact wanted everyone to die.

What we were left with in Season 1 was a sloppy story that degenerated into almost nothing. Round 2 attempts to pick up the pieces and put them together, but the first six episodes are seemingly just as confusing. \r\nThis is a temporary review, I will review it more later as the episodes come out.\r\nSo far though, the show seems to take a less serious approach than the first round. We are left with episodes that don't really progress the story asmuch as show Lelouch's personal life and the silly antics associated with it, but is that a bad thing? No it's not because the episodes are definitely enjoyable, but as far as story goes, they're just going in one big circle.\\n\\n\r\nRound 2 starts out the same as Round 1, matter of fact, it is Round 1 minus Kallen/Karen being at the school. I'm hoping it will pick up though as it seems to be doing, but for now the story is seriously lacking and falling apart slower than it's being put together, which IS a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully they'll put it into full motion soon enough, like always the Characters are enjoyable and fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSo far R2 is great and better than R1 was, but let's see just how they handle it in the next 19 Episodes.\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Life without change might be called anything except life, it's nothing more than experience. ... Yes, Emperor Charles sought the past, you seek the present, but I seek the future.\" -Lelouch\r\nPreface: \r\nThis review is a continuation of the review for part 1, where I'll detail the differences, and many improvements of R2 upon its predecessor. The assumption that the reader has seen Code Geass stands, so do with that as you will. Please message me if you have comments or questions- I'll be happy to address any concerns or views expressed herein.\r\nOverview: \r\nPicking up where we left off, Lelouch continues his personal war against hisfather, Charles, the Emperor of the mighty Britannia, aided by the Black Knights, and some new allies obtained along the way. A furious ride from start to finish, R2 really ups the ante with the pacing, character development, and plot twists. The whole of part 1 could be considered an extravagantly long exposition and character dialogue setting up the consequence filled, heavy emotional action in R2. \\n\\n\r\nQuick stuff first:\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 (6 Animation, 2 Character design)\\n\\n\r\nCLAMP character designs- skinny bodies, long spider legs. The animation is stepped up significantly from part 1. More vibrant colors, moving parts on Mechas, less stillframe, more idle animation during pans and other, more cinematic feel. More Juicy explosions, fluid fight scenes, and solid key frames. Character design consistency is very high quality throughout, with no loss of detail at any time. \\n\r\nThe mechas still look great, and while many designs are again, reused for the no-name mechs, the named ones are pure awesome, and reach even higher levels of awesome than in part 1. The Guren SEITEN and Lancelot Albion are another level of cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 (8 for Voice Acting, 1 for OP and ED)\\n\\n\r\n1st OP, O2 by Orange Range is energetic and fun, the other OP and EDs are fine.\\n\r\nSame players as before, great and varied voices headed up by Johnny Yong Bosch. Kept emotional intensity and believability high, again, props to Funimation for putting this incredible group of VA together. The sound and speech are half the show, and they perform to the highest extent. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nAs a continuation of Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch, or part 1, it's expected to see an extension of the themes and conflicts present. R2 is no exception. R2 is an immediate successor to part 1, and it thankfully differentiates itself from its predecessor with both style AND substance. R2 was a much more focused product, with less of the jack-of-all-trades approach to trying to cram as many different genres of anime into a 25 episode series as possible. This was ditched in favor of a character driven, emotional drama- complete with the redemption (in my eyes) of several characters who were absolutely detestable in part 1.\\n\\n\r\nKallen and Suzaku, the ace pilot counterparts of the Black Knights and Britannia respectively, both undergo an immense amount of growth as characters, and experience a real CHARACTER ARC- something they sorely lacked in part 1. Kallen finally realizes what it is that she's fighting for, and once she realizes her Raison D'etre, her reason for being;  her heretofore importance to the plot consisting solely of fanservice and saving-Lelouch's-ass transitions to that of a true hero: a champion of that which is right, no matter the cost. Her inner conflict of doing what she feels in her heart is right, vs that of her orders absolutely mirrors the struggle that Suzaku faces. It made them both incredibly sympathetic, seeing the irreversible consequences that their actions wrought, and the difficult decisions they had to make with a morally ambiguous outcome. \\n\\n\r\nSuzaku, on the other hand, nearly does a 180 as a character. His previously infallible skills are turned on their head, and he becomes the tragic hero: one who's lost so much, but has everything to gain for fighting for the future. Suzaku suddenly finds fallibility and self doubt in himself, partly for his past, and partly for the uncertainty of the future, and is better for it. Crippled inside after a traumatic event in the Tokyo settlement, Suzaku finally breaks free of the mental prison of his unflinching loyalty to Britannia, and begins to question what it is he's fighting for: is it for his own vengeance, or is it for the good of those that he loves? While his decisions threaten to destroy him from the inside out, he faces another, external struggle: that of his side in the war. \\n\\n\r\nThese themes: the twisted, moral ambiguity of war; the heart vs the mind, orders vs justice, drive the conflict within both Suzaku and Kallen, but most especially in Lelouch. Lelouch experiences unimaginable loss in R2... What does one do when they've had everything taken away from them? Not only their own future, but the future that they've fought the world to forge for their loved ones? Lelouch is, at the same time, both a tragic anti-hero, and a detestable villain. Some of the most emotionally destructive and heart-wrenching events imaginable happen to our main character: the death of loved ones, being betrayed by everyone he could trust, and being left broken and alone, with no one but his own head to depend on. Lelouch is nearly crushed, within and without, but finds it in himself to carry on: to ask the questions no one else is able to, to make the decisions no one else can, to create a future that no one else had ever conceived. \\n\\n\r\nThe history and tragic background of the tormented C2 are also explored, which hit hard emotionally. Of all the characters in the show, C2 is the one I sympathized with the most. Her past is absolutely gutting, and the repeated tales of tragedy that come forth are almost painful to watch. \\n\\n\r\nFrom a plot perspective, the role reversals of Geass/Inner strength, the Black Knights and the Britannian military, and Zero/ the Emperor further serve to exemplify the relativity of truth, of right, of wrong. Two sides of a coin: the order, the chaos. The black and the white. Everything is counterpart to another, and this duality is one that drives Code Geass R2, and what makes it so entertaining and great. It allows the plot to twist and turn unexpectedly, but most importantly, believably. Nothing was presented in such a way that it was purely for the sake of \"tricking\" the audience. Motives were present, acted upon, and carried out with purpose and intent. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing improved markedly: less obvious plotholes and Deus ex Machina moments replaced with clever outs and, importantly, inner universe CONSISTENCY. Several plot conventions established that were thoroughly trounced and run over by a dump truck in part 1, as outlined in my review, were fixed and integrated well into the story. Workarounds for the Geass powers, their limitations, and even the nature of the powers are explored in R2, giving credibility to their usage in the story, rather than the appearance of \"making it up as we go\" that part 1 had. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 \\n\\n\r\nThe one-two punch of episode 4: Giant Pizza 2: Electric Boogaloo, Now With More C2 and episode 7, with the \"twist\" of the new viceroy of Area 11 was a mirror image/callback to that of part 1, I feared that R2 was also going to take the path of rehashing part 1, but just with different characters. To my great relief, it did not.\\n\r\nThe second half of the show really stepped up the game on all fronts. All of the character drama, endless feints and jabs, subplots, and side stories all come together in an explosive and unforgettable conclusion. The ending is the subject of many an angry rant or exuberant fan reaction, and will continue to be. I personally thought the ending was extremely satisfying-  what had to be done was done, and the history of the universe would be forever changed by it. It's left up to the interpretation of the viewer to decide what fate befalls Lelouch, and it's not my place to spoil it. However; if one considers the facts presented in the show, particularly those of the second half, the ending loses its ambiguity and it becomes quite clear what happened. \\n\r\n--If you want my take on the ending, PM me.--\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nAlmost every character left standing is given an exposition or montage about their efforts after the conclusion, and everything is neatly wrapped up with a little bow, a present to the viewer for putting up with 49 episodes of Code Geass! Not really- by the time the ending comes, you'll be left wanting more. Code Geass was a show I was so unsure of in the beginning, but by the end, I had grown, along with the characters, to take control of my life and make decisions for myself.\\n\r\nThe decision to finish Code Geass was one that I'll not regret.",

            "content": "What should've been a well-written, expertly-paced thrill ride, Code Geass R2 failed in every aspect. Most of the time I thought, \"What the hell were the writers thinking?\" But nevertheless, it won't fail to entertain you. I know most people will get the pitchforks out for me not endlessly praising Code Geass, but whatever. I don't find my gripes with the show to be completely unreasonable.\r\nCode Geass R2 basically starts out with a 'reset,' of sorts. Lelouch Lamperouge, aka Zero, gets his memory wiped and has a normal life with his little brother, Rollo. It is soon after we are re-introduced to the main castof Allies and Enemies: Suzaku, King Charles, C.C aka Pizza Butt, Kallen and rest of the black knights. I felt this was a waste of time but the writers wanted to get some new viewers so why not start anew? From a logical standpoint, it doesn't make sense why King Charles didn't just kill Lelouch after the season 1 climax but for writing purposes, he let him live. \\n\\n\r\nBut that is not where the problem lies in R2. One of the big problems is that Code Geass loses it's identity. It does way too much pandering. What do I mean by pandering? Well, Code Geass becomes a rom-com, psychological horror, josei, seinen, shounen-ai, all in one season. Now I may be exaggerating, but only by a little bit. Code Geass was originally about Lelouch, a brilliant strategist with the power of Geass, who would masterfully outwit his opponents with style and flair. That does not exist anymore in R2. The writers tried so hard to appeal to every kind of anime fan under the sun, that Code Geass's original identity was lost in the process. What the hell man?\\n\\n\r\nNext, is characters get stupider. They make completely illogical decisions because the plot dictates them to do so. I will give one example, but only one so I don't ruin the entire show for those who didn't see it. *Spoilers*Ohgi betrays Lelouch because Schneizel says so. He quickly sentences Lelouch, his leader, to the metaphorical guillotine because his ENEMY, yes enemy, tells them that Lelouch has the power to control minds. He throws out everything the rebellion fought for, for that reason. Also, Ohgi is a traitorous bastard as well but that is conveniently ignored. He knows Viletta works for the Brittainians yet he decides to do nothing about it. In the end, they make teh babies because they love each other so much and live happily ever after.*End of Spoilers* Stuff like that really pissed me off.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the pacing was atrocious. Every problem was met with a very quick  resolution that was completely inorganic. This was probably due to the fact that  code geass was only 20 something episodes long; it would have benefited from being a 50 episode long show. The show probably gets all of its high praise from its grandiose, but fitting ending. I felt the ending would have been better, if the rest of the show was up to par.\\n\\n\r\nNow, looking in-depth at the characters, the cast is pretty weak. The only character I really liked was Lelouch, but who doesn't like Lelouch. He is bold, brash, arrogant, cocky, everything you would want in a main character. Everybody else, I can't speak highly about. Suzaku is still Suzaku, which means he is a hypocrite, idiot and morally righteous douche. Shirley still Shirleys, which means she serves no real purpose except to be Lelouch's, \"humanity.\" C.C. is still there to be sexy, and eat pizza. The newest character is the Yandere Shota, Rollo, who is there to  creep you the hell out. I hated him but who doesn't? Most of the cast becomes fanservice, especially Kallen, but I am no going to write an essay about it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. The animation is smooth, sleek and nice to look at. The mecha battle scenes are not on par with EVA or even Gundam but they will do.\\n\\n\r\nDid enjoy Code Geass R2? I would be lying if I said no. No matter how stupid, how ridiculous or how frustrating it was to watch, I could never take my eyes off of the screen. Code Geass is really fun to watch, but only with your brain off. If you think too hard, you might recognize how simply ridiculous and nonsensical the show really is.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 gets a 6/10 from me. I would never rank this among the best anime of all time, although it is one of the most popular anime. Everybody should watch this show as it is considered a modern day classic but I am not crazy about it.",

            "content": "**Review Edited, Completed Series - DO NOT READ MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.* (Last review, i admit, i let my love for Geass conflict my review into being bias. Things have changed)\r\nStory - 8.0/10 (B-)\r\nWell, it takes place after the failed Black Rebellion. Zero has been supposedly killed, Suzaku becomes a member of the Knight of Rounds, and Kallen still is loyal to her Zero. The first episode feels like the first episode of the first season, dunno if it's good or bad however the introduction of Rolo, Lelouch's brother, brings some needed drama into the show. Afterwards, after all the corruption, conspiracies,Schneizel and the F.L.E.I.J.A warhead attack, things seem to really get odd. Suddenly, people are dying for almost no reason, people are magically coming back alive, and then Schneizel. It all feels too jumbled up, kinda like watching way too many soap operas. The ending is really not so good, i mean no Schneizel - Final Boss thing? But, the way Sunrise made Lelouch's death seem emotionally pulling (Yup, i shed a tear on you, Lulu.)was brilliant. It evens out the poorly-managed plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 9.7/10 (A)\\n\r\nWell the animation for Geass really got better, much better. The new Knightmares: Vincent Prototype, Shen-Hu, Guren S.E.I.T.E.N, Lancelot Albion and Shinkirou are really well designed. Like watching Gundam all over again, Code Geass gets props for such beautiful animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10 (A+)\\n\r\nBeautiful. The music for Code Geass makes even Shakespeare want to wonder how it's made. Every single piece of gold (music) was beautifully executed perfectly. The final song played during the last minutes of the show,  &quot;Continued Story&quot; by Hitomi, is a masterpiece at best.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6.8/10 (D+)\\n\r\nWell, i gotta stop here. I really didn't like how they added about 12 characters an episode, kinda gave me a headache. Let's name them all shall we?: Li Xingke, Tianzi, Kaguya, Schneizel, Kanon, Rolo, Anya, Gino, Bismarck, Miss. Romeyer, Ougi, Villeta, Orange-kun (Jeremiah), Sayoko, Todou, Chigusa, Guilford, Shirley, Milly, Rivalz, Nina (Oh, god not table humper), Arthur, Lloyd, Cecile, Cornelia, V.V, Lelouch, C.C, Kallen, Suzaku and then finally..The Emperor. I probably missed a dozen more, but you get the picture.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10 (A+)\\n\r\nThough many might call it a trainwreck, i think it's the best damn trainwreck. It's so enjoyable watching every thing unfold so oddly. You can hate Code Geass yet still enjoy it. The show really has gone a long way, and i can say i want more, like a side-story or prequel. Kudos to Sunrise for excellently making a fine show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Averaged: 8/10 (B-)\\n\\n\r\nThe Good: Background music, much better animation than season 1 and a fitting end to a show many &quot;enjoyed&quot; in different ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad: Plotholes, excess amounts of characters (even more than Naruto does) and way too much fanservice.",

            "content": "The sequel to the liveliest performance has arrived. Everyone knew they were getting something crazy, but no one could have expected this\u2026\r\nSomething felt off. It felt like that was on purpose however, at least at first, with the eerie repetition of the earliest act of the performance of yore. Nonetheless it felt glorious. Then, the assets started looking cheaper in places and the behind the scenes dilemmas started surfacing. This was not the play we truly wanted, but it was certainly entertaining for what it\u2019s worth. Code Geass has always been about being lively and theatrical. \r\nThe music takes this to new degrees. There arefew to no new tracks that add to anything other than the sheer bombastic epicness factor of it all, feeling like they can underscore literally anything war-related in a way that eleventes each scene to new heights. Other tracks are certainly catchy and even capable of giving off a sense of accomplishment or despair, but the main flavor is sheer bombast and glory! \u201cMadder Sky\u201d, \u201cShowdown\u201d, \u201cAll-Out Attacks\u201d, \u201cMisconduct\u201d, \u201cInner Strategy\u201d, \u201cProdigy\u201d, \u201cDeath Work\u201d, \u201cIf I Were A Bird\u201d, \u201cAcross The Borderline\u201d, and so many more flow wildly in my head when imagining any scene worth such godly music! The opening performances are also phenomenal, even more so than before! That\u2019s because Kotaro Nakagawa is a god, a god I say!\\n\\n\r\nThe returning cast does a fantastic job at keeping up their act, especially our main duo. Unfortunately, the new roles suffer, as they largely feel empty and pointless, tacked on because no one knew what to do. Some do get some scenes of closure in the middle and final acts, but are regardless, uninteresting and without the flavor and madness of the original cast. However, as stated before, said returning cast ups their game, notably our favorite scheming overlord Zero, and JEREMIAH GOTTWALD, THE MEMORABLE MAN OF ORANGE AND LOYALTY!! Additionally, the ending our favorite and/or least favorite shitbag, Suzaku Kururugi gets, is nothing short of the perfect poetic punishment for a pretentious preachy prick such as himself. Too bad the glorious finale makes little actual sense outside of that.\\n\\n\r\nTransitions are the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe script fell apart over time like a bad stage set, from the increasingly ridiculous Batman and Xantos gambits and whatnot to the audience-bewildering dumpster fire that was Sword of Akasha. The memery had gone too far, and there was no way to go but diagonally into another series of loop-de-loops. And thus, the glorious mess of strategy-warping and hammy final 4 episodes were made, as if they finally salvaged what original plans remained at the time. Nonetheless, the audience was stunned by the sheer audacity, flashiness of the designs and antics, and insane improvisation they attempted that many forgave the absurd script and the recycling, as well as the inferior production. Plus, the uproarious running gags came back.\\n\\n\r\nSo what I\u2019m saying is: Code Geass R2 is the biggest meme in anime history, for better or worse.",

            "content": "**As this is the sequel to the first season of Code Geass, let me tell you that the review is for both seasons. I'd rate them the same and enjoyed them in a same way.\r\nCode Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch / Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion /\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ae\u30a2\u30b9 \u53cd\u9006\u306e\u30eb\u30eb\u30fc\u30b7\u30e5 ; 2 x 25 episodes a 20minutes ; aired from April to September 2008 ; Action, Mecha, Super Power, Military ; licensed by FUNimation and Bandai Entertainment\r\nCode Geass is a classic, a must watch. The story very much follows a general idea often seen in books, movies and series: a normal human obtains a power to thenuse it for a greater good, mostly his own ideals. Code Geass executes this idea masterfully, creating a series which stays in the memories of its viewers forever. Furthermore (minor spoilers) it discusses and puts light on the very real threats of a worldwide nuclear war, the usage if lies and dishonesty in modern politics and basics of today's politics and terrorism. An exceptionally superb show, this is a must-watch for every anime fan.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nAs I already said, the generic plotline of someone obtaining a superpower to then take on the world and turning it on its head is nothing new. Yet Code Geass manages to bring a psychologic discussion into this, putting up the enforcement of ideals of peace and equality against the unrightful push of said ideals on the nonwilling people and the nonchangeable flow of time and the world. The various character relations and well chosen cliffhangers and plot twists make for an awesome storyline who just cries to be binge-watched.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nBeing a relatively old anime from 2008 the show still has pretty good art that can definitely keep up with modern shows. The fight scenes are well animated, especially in the Knightmare one-on-ones. Sometimes I wish they'd have put more thought and detail into certain areas (C's World) but still pretty good overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe background music was very fitting, just what you would expect. Underlining the tone of the series, especially the Nunnaly OST #25 was great. The first OP and ED were very good, while the 2nd ones felt a bit out of place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nLelouch's character traits, psychological and mundane beliefs and ideals are what every person in their early teen years wants to be and follow (in a reasonable extent). The discussion of world peace, evil, discrimination and happiness is well portrayed in the different characters and encourages a own discussion and dispute about morals and politics. The show also takes a good mix of entertaining Slice of Life (school episodes) to then turn back to a more serious and bigger tone.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nControlling the world, the struggles and the fights for it: probably the most discussed theme in the head of every single person. What am I ready to give up in order to get what I want? Is whatever I am doing for a greater good right, put in perspective of a single eye? Code Geass shows these conflicts within Lelouch and the various characters, also illustrating the whole concept of honesty and lies, world politics and threats. Lelouch can be considered a genius: He more than once managed to predict the exact reactions of his counterparts to then react accordingly. His unique character mixed with the colorful and widespread themes and character types of the show makes an awesome and very enjoyable series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\n\"In front of the greater picture, the tears of those who have lost their loves ones are the only thing that remains.\" Code Geass is awesome and excels in a lot of aspects. There isnt a single person who won't like this series, which is also reflected in the ratings. I suggest everyone to watch both seasons, atleast once.\\n\\n\r\nI realize that this review might be a bit confusing, but I'm still done and over after finishing this series. It's awesome and I can see myself in a lot of Schneizels, Ohgis, Kallens and Lelouchs ideals, hence an objective view is very hard to give from my part! :D TL;DR: Watch it its awesome.",

Heaven in this show is on Earth and is more vaguely explained than how babies are born.\r\nThis show has anything that your typical war drama has done, and it does feel pretty epic! Lelouch constantly trying to win mass mech war battles over his sister did seem ridiculous with this obsession, but its better than none. However, I must, and absolutely must admit-though still great in variety, if yourhaving 10 tonnes of ideas all shaped on a blender, that smoothie takes time, so it was clear that the writers were rushing the pacing and leaving many themes scratched on the surface for viewers to so seriously be invested. Because the story seems confusing as it leaves plot holes like \u201cHow the living hell is the Geass power even a thing?!\u201d And what we got was like \u201cIt came from Heaven, and that I\u2013blah, blah, blah I'm retarded C3, can you please tongue me again?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSecondary characters do play a role, but they are left so uncompleted! Like why is it a necessity, for us to care about Mecha Scythe Master? He was just a cheerful teenage military lad whose just there as one of the strongest Knights in Britainia, and yet he is just a there because he is just flipping there. It doesn\u2019t help that they are two-dimensional like this pink haired girl whose there... Just for the sake of some random part of the show that was meant to be philosophical and some other crap that seems vague?  \\n\\n\r\nIt's as if Japanese people don't even know what\u2019s 9+10!\\n\\n\r\nThe battles were seriously dumb down, and when I thought that the anime never explained how Lelouch playing chess seemed fairly faulty, it gets worse when they switched to aerial battles for the sake of mechs looking more stupid since feet are certainly necessary. No given explanation on how Lelouch manages to win these battles by glaring on that green mini-map and pointing his middle finger to the general that they have to kill.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end, its still some random stuff happening at the time of crisis and that confusing plot with 90 or so rubbish characters makes this a ridiculous and it makes for an unpredictable and a fun ride, nor the show is trying to contradict its nature, so its still all well and good.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.

            "content": "This review is about both seasons of Code Geass rather than just R2. There are spoilers so \"SPOILERS ALERT\". They are necessary to justify some stuff here. It's a long review but please read it till the end if you have the time. Anyway I expect from people who read this review that they watched all the episodes. If you still haven't seen them all, just beat yourself up and go do it now.\r\nFirst of all, I liked watching Code Geass and the first season is really good at least until the middle of it. It had what it takes to appeal to a largeaudience. It's the kind of series really hard to make because you're trying to please all the fans and sometimes things get fucked up. But not in Code Geass. You have fast-paced mecha battles, slight humor to liven up the show, \"complex\" strategic battle, a large cast for guys and gals to pick a favorite and so on. Code Geass was one of the best anime of its year if not the best.\\n\\n\r\nBut then towards the end, someone realized that this anime had a very good cash machine potential ( I really don't know if that's what happened ) and tried to increase it. Way to go to fuck things up. So the first half of the season was really good but then you get developments and plot twists that make no sense. For example the Euphinator scene. Why would Lelouch joke about ordering his sister to kill \"Elevens\"? It felt so \"not at all\" natural. It's the same as joking about ordering her to suck his dadidudongo. You don't do that, not to your sister or anybody. Anyway let's just look past it since that scene got what it wanted, that is a HUGE twist of events.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, R1 had a lot of good stuff going on and became the kind of anime you expect a sequel. And so R2 came. I remember being so hyped about it that I watched most episodes twice. But that makes your mind go \"What the fuck just happened\" after the second viewing.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing to mention that everyone must have observed is \"PLOT HOLES\". A classic example would be the Geass, the Lelouch Geass.\\n\r\nIn the first season, you see Lelouch ordering a girl to draw crosses on a wall everyday to test the duration of his power. Okay... that's a good idea.\\n\r\nIn R2 Lelouch lost his Geass and those who were geassed just weren't anymore as the cross drawing girl stopped doing her stuff ( There is the possibility she is fucking dead but who knows).\\n\r\nAgain okay... that makes sense.\\n\r\nThen you have Suzaku detonate a Freya Bomb because of a R1 past Geass...\\n\r\n--> What the fuck just happened?\\n\r\nWhat about the chess games between Schneizel and Lelouch?\\n\r\nIt was so retarded I didn't know how to react.\\n\r\nPlot holes are flaws but if you don't pay too much attention, it's not that bothering.\\n\r\nLet's just move on.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really good, a least for female viewers ( I'm not saying guys must hate it ). You can't go wrong with Clamp-style but seriously, sometimes you do...\\n\r\nI'm talking about the facial expressions. That's right, Lelouch may be a bishounen but I really think he should keep the Zero Mask on to prevent showing his shocked face. Another one would be the \"Nina learned about Euphie's death's face\". It must be the ugliest face I have ever seen in an anime, worse than any monster in a Tim Burton movie. And what about big round anime eyes becoming dot eyes? Too goddamn weird. Just look at Lelouch's contact lens and the size of his eye. Don't you think there is something wrong here?\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the music, openings and endings are awesome. Really good choices, nothing to say here except they rocks.\\n\r\nThe downside would be the themes. Why the hell do we always hear trumpets in Code Geass?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are the biggest flaw in R2. Not only do they get shittier, they don't make sense. And here comes Kaname Ougi, the shittiest, most useless character in Code Geass history, worse than a Knight of Rounds yet with more screentime to fuck things up. How come this guy gets to be Prime Minister? In R1 he was so useless that his crew decided to take orders from a stranger.\\n\r\nIn R2 he doesn't get any  better and infects his crew with stupidity. He fell in love with Viletta who he took advantage of because she got amnesiac ( what a creepo... ), he wanted to leave the Black Knights because he realized he was a useless piece of shit, but when Lelouch was discovered as a former Britannian prince, he and his comrades went all batshit over his ass. It's like: \"-Damned that former Britannian prince who saved our sorry asses multiple times, we can't let him live after he helped us get back our territory. -Yeah, we can't forgive him for what he's done, that is defending us from the Britannian Empire. If it weren't for him we would still be getting our asses kicked in our own country. -Totally, guys you are so right let's just trust this NOT former Britannian prince Schneizel who tried to kill us multiple times, if you think about it, it makes more sense since he wants to beat us into submission\"...\\n\r\nMoreover, the pacing in R2 messed up so many things like character screentime for the Knights of Rounds or even Marianne. The remaining Knights'fight against Suzaku could be described by 3 screenshots: Suzaku&Lancelot, sword slashes, Suzaku&Lancelot...\\n\r\nI'm not gonna talk about Marianne, she's just too useless for the plot.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Code Geass is great but R2 is such a bad sequel I can't even give it a 5 because after viewing all those episodes I had a bitter aftertaste. It has a lot of qualities but fucked up too much on a lot of points to redeem itself. I gave it a 4 because it could be so much better with a planned R3. If you try to make it a cash machine at least try to make a good one.\\n\r\nFinally I'm not trying to underrate the show, I couldn't care less about its score.\\n\r\nI also don't give a shit about how many \"helpful\" \"not helpful\" I get on this review but I'd like to read about some opinions so give feedback if you want. By the way, trolls are welcome.",

            "content": "I've been meaning to watch this show for a while and now that I've finally finished it I'm glad to say it was definitely not a waste. There was a good deal of praise being given to this series as a whole but I tried to ignore that as much as possible and watch without any prior opinions. In the end I don't think any of that praise is being misplaced. The show is definitely not perfect, far from it I think, but even with it's imperfections it still manages to keep hold of a coherent and engaging story. I feel that sequels and secondseasons are often doomed from the beginning by having to live up to whatever standard it's predecessor set. Luckily I think overall this season managed to shoulder this burden without even breaking a sweat. \\n\\n\r\nStory- The plot picks up almost where the first season left off. I say almost because this part actually takes place a year after the previous seasons events. As a result I was completely befuddled as to what was going on for at least two episodes, at which point they bring you pretty much back up to speed as to what's happened and what's going on. After that it's more of the same for a bit and I mean that in a very literal sense. The beginning of the second season felt like serious deja vu to me but it didn't take too long to break away into the meat of the new story. In general I really enjoyed the story itself, there were lots of unexpected twists and turns and I was left guessing what was going to happen up until the very end. Unfortunately some of these twists were more desirable than others. It's hard to really explain my frustration about this without giving things away but I'll do what I can. Basically this show takes far too much delight in resurrecting people that were thought to/should be dead. This became a huge annoyance to me but alas, there is nothing that can be done about it. Also at times I felt like they were just pushing things along in order to finish in the right amount of time. In the end however, everything holds together and aside from a few minor holes the plot concludes very nicely. To me the ending was executed extremely well and is what kept me from giving the story a lower score.\\n\\n\r\nArt- I'm no expert in this field but I think the art was done well. I guess the CLAMP character design is very like it or hate it and I like it so that's my opinion. Aside from basic design I thought that at times things felt a little too chaotic and messy but it was never anything detrimental. Also I think the one on one battles were done very nicely, they were very smooth and pleasing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound- As far as openings and endings go I was split between thinking they were decent and just not liking them. There wasn't anything downright terrible just my personal taste. The actual soundtrack itself though was very good. I wouldn't go so far to say every track is a masterpiece but by the end of the show even the tracks I didn't like in at first had grown on me. It is almost entirely orchestral with some choral things thrown in as well which is right up my ally of interest. In general though the music really added to the overall atmosphere of the show and did an excellent job at enhancing dramatic points.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- I think that character development was good but was nothing ground breaking. I think most of the development was used up on Lelouch, Suzaku, and C.C. with everyone else sort of taking the back seat, or maybe sitting all the way at the back of the bus. Really, aside from the aforementioned three I don't think there was any significant development at all or if there was it was poorly done. None of the supporting characters get a lot of screen time and some simply disappear entirely. Also I feel that although there is development in the main characters it is shakily done and none of it felt very smooth or natural to me. I saw a lot of potential with cast but I feel it was just left alone dew to time restraints. In the end though the characters do what they're supposed to in order to drive the plot along and I don't think it detracts much from the overall effect, it just prevents the show from being that much more amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Even after all of the imperfections I still really enjoyed this show. The characters and story really pulled me in and didn't let go until the very end. The show blurred the line between who was good and who was evil to such an extent that it was almost invisible until the very last few minutes and it kept me on the edge of my seat. There were far more high points than low points and I thought the ending was simply amazing. If you've seen the first season you'd be committing a crime to not watch this was one. If you haven't seen the first season then what are you waiting for? Watch it so you can watch this season!",

            "content": "Geass is back! Whether you pronounce it \"geese\" or \"gayass\" it's back. For another round. That's right, Round 2, or maybe Rehash 2. It's your favorite Geass characters, some have died, some refuse to die, and now have to collide with each other in this sloppy sequel to the original anime.\r\nWith the success of the original Hamlet-esque geass, and the cliffhanger ending--the entire fate of Area 11 and Lelouch's plot to get back at his family, they decided to stretch out a one season concept into two.\r\nSo what we get is the same characters. Acting as if they're really not sure why they've been broughtback for the second season, rehashes of the same elements of the first show (rebellion, betrayal, power bids in the Brittanian royal family, the disorganized Japanese, Chinese, and godknowswhoever allies with them), except it's now BIGGER AND BETTER. \\n\\n\r\nThe mechs, clumsy affairs with only a few being superweapons ALL now fly, do weird Gundam and Dragonball style garbage. There are more characters, more exposition of the existing characters, more of Lelouch pretending to be a smarmy schoolboy, Zero, a schoolboy pretending to be Zero--but now the stakes are higher. Are they?\\n\\n\r\nAny romantic interplay within the characters is really hackneyed and to the point of keeping the shippers talking. This all happens while the plot clumsily tries to outdo itself from exposing the \"the truth is bigger than you think and the enemy is not who it sems\" crap. Just when you think Lelouch has succeeded against the prescribed enemy, you realize that it was all a farce (wow, what script writing) and there's a NEW enemy he must defeat. If any of you are still awake after watching the show at this point, you know where it will eventually lead.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters die suddenly, but for no reason. We are forced to fixate on deaths of minor characters and major characters alike--often with little pretext or resolution, or impact. More like ______ has to die. It will get the fans riled up. Then some characters refuse to die, invoking the \"if you don't actually see a close-up of their face and a quip at the moment of death, the fawker isn't dead\" theme of Gundam anime. In fact, by the end of the show you're wondering why the HELL some of the characters haven't died.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's cool, because everything wraps up in such a bizarre and pointless way, as if to make everyone happy, that you'll hate yourself for ever picking this title up. \\n\\n\r\nUm, the good parts?\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, character design, and overall production value of this anime is top notch. Nudity has been curtailed for this season, but there are enough crotch shots and random WTF thong moments thrown about for no good reason to get someone excited. Not me.\\n\\n\r\nIt also proves one thing, every ALI PROJECT song sounds alike.",

Attack on titan was my favorite until I re watched this and it blew AOT  away.  The story of a teenager trying to over throw a entire nation is amazing. The art was really good but not amazing due to this anime being pretty old. If this anime were remade with everything the same.... actually the art pretty much defines this anime so it's fine as how it is. The sound track of this anime was really well done andsuited the moods of the scene really well and some songs I really enjoyed especially the hail Britannia song. The character were really well made and interesting. Expect Nena she was a little... you know what. I hate her with all my being. Every time I see her I gotta hold myself back from punching a whole in my computer screen but maybe that means her character was done so well that it makes you hate her guts. I really love Lelouch because he was bad ass strategist genies. Even if the whole world hate you you still fight for it. And for enjoyment I enjoyed this anime so much. It was pretty much life. Code Geass is a masterpiece of an anime and more anime should strive to be like it. Like masterpieces, not Code Geass. This anime is to great to have anything like it. I would give this anime a 10/10 but because no anime desires a 10/10 nor anything I give this a 9.9/10.",

            "content": "Giving this a 10/10 is not that surprising considering the huge fan base surrounding this show. It has been some time since I watched the sequel to code geass but I think I still have the memory to write a decent review on the show.\r\nCode Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2 is a sequel to the previous which delivers the same or a greater form of entertainment to the audience. However there is a quite a difference between the 2 seasons. The use of more dramatic and emotional scenes gives the audience an even greater attachment to the series. Thus giving us a fresh and newlook towards the show. This can be symbolized by the characters, settings or even the dialogue. When the audience is introduced to a second season we don't know if it will be a greater show or a complete mess .\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 is the continuation of the war between the Black Knights and the Holy Britannian Empire. However in any action sequel the characters will meet new foes, allies and fight against there \"destined rival\". There are ever greater and better plot twists in the sequel as they are either unexpected or just plain spectacular, due to the use of this method we are always hooked to the screen cringing are teeth of each and every single development in future episodes. \\n\r\nA basic statement that would describe the other characters would be \"Just there\" as the main theme of the show is Lelouch and his plan of conquering Britannia.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show have great development by the use of emotions and individual actions and designs they make in the show have great effect on the outcome in any situation provided, This signifies us to learn more in greater depth of the characters personality, traits and future vision. Providing we get to the know the characters better. We slowly start to feel some type emotional attachment to each one of them this is due to the increase in character growth the show seems to put forward in this sequel. However when we look at the main character in the series the great Lelouch, We as age wise or personal preference's find more interesting that draws us even close to his way of thinking. We have the scenario explained by his views. The use of ever changing relationships between Lelouch and the characters drives the plot forward and gives it even greater depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of R2 compared to season 1 uses a more vivid texture in each setting. The use of lighting is pretty well done. The characters facial features and expressions are crisp and well thought out while having the background setting realistic to a certain extent which overall heightens the emotional and physiological impact in different scenes including the spectacular movement of vehicles and soldiers fighting giving a quite a site to spectate. However comparing the animation to the current year it is pretty out-dated but this does not effect the shows performance in giving us great entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in my point of view is to be considered good. \\n\r\nThe music (including the sudden songs in different scene) fits in pretty well in each and every scene and gives a properly nice impression overall. The opening is pretty spectacular, it gives you a sense of depth and excitement.\\n\\n\r\nNow the question is how well I like the  final series, Well the answer is simple.\\n\r\nCompleted all the episodes through the morning and well into the night (5am) all on a 50Inch 1080p Smart HDTV. You can now understand the impact this show gave me just through the start of episode 1. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum up Code Geass R2 is a series of pure enjoyment and hyper excitement which leaves literally breathless. Your eyes will be glued to the screen with a need for the toilet to be kept a minimum. To sum up the series in one word \"Blockbuster\".\\n\\n\r\nI heavily recommend to watch the previous season to gain and feel the impact this show will bring you.\\n\r\nThank you for reading",

            "content": "Entertaining show for teens which took itself MUCH to seriously and by the last episode landed with a joke of a plot\r\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\r\nThe first season was more than solid. \"Code Geass\" is a mecha shounen (roughly \"for teenage boys\"). It's entertaining and it has ability to completely enchain the viewer. Animation and sounds are good, characters are interesting and so on. It still has all this strengths in the second season.\r\nOn the other hand in the second season the story suffers from the one of the most severe cases of cringe-inducing plot writing I have ever seen. To some extentit seems to be inevitable - the anime is not the shortest and it's driven almost entirely by dramatic plot twists. It would be extremely difficult for creators to make all of them plausible. Unfortunately the farther series goes the more unbelievable the story gets, to the point of being utterly unbearable. Some characters' actions are so massively idiotic and/or out-of-place that it ruins all pleasure for the viewer. While first season is relatively free of this, the second one is ruined by it to the extreme. Particularly glaring horror parts of writing started exactly at the end of episode 22 back in the first season, and by episode 19 of the second viewer's head automatically bangs the wall. \\n\\n\r\nThe second downside of the story writing is its huge discrepancy between how particular characters are portrayed and what they actually are. Like it's often the case with anime creators they apparently wanted their story to stay in the gray morality area, where every character has its own justifiable reasons and where there is no obvious right and wrong. It is generally a good thing, world stays more complicated and viewer can root for both sides of conflict. Here however...\\n\\n\r\nSecond main protagonist is hands down one of the most despicable anime characters ever (if not THE most). Guy is a liar, traitor, murderer (of the worst imaginable kind) and essentially Vidkun Quisling reborn. Yet he is surrounded by plot with aura of partial righteousness. Even his enemies in the show seem to sympathize with his reasons. In other words he is supposed to be an anti hero. He is not. What writers of the story entirely miss here is that in so called reality any sane person, given the chance, would shoot this guy on the spot.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does exactly opposite thing with the main hero. Lelouch as portrayed by creators is supposed to be Machiavellian, ruthless and disregarding ethics, on a slippery slope to becoming a full-fledged villain. Writers presents him that way because they clearly want to have a gray anti-hero as a protagonists. However they completely fail at convincing me to see Lelouch as villain, despite numerous attempts. The problem is, the only real flaw in his character is that he is not Machiavellian and ruthless enough, on the contrary, he tends to do things out of spite, even deep into season two, for purely idealistic reasons and is generally too whiny and emotional. As a result he makes several grave mistakes but during the entire show he actually does exactly ONE ruthless thing, and even that is explainable. Yet we are supposed to at least partially despise him because of his villainy. \\n\\n\r\nAnd main duo is only a start - in any decent ruled by karma universe almost entire main cast of characters (except arguably Lelouch and C. C.) deserves to be severely punished for genocide, unwarranted weapons of mass destruction usage, ethnic cleansing, support for apartheid, backing murderous political leaders for no reason, immoral medical research, high treason and last, but not least, massive stupidity. It concerns especially the entire Britannian royal family (including oh-so-good Princess Nunnally), anyone who was actively supporting them, virtually all members of Black Knights organization and most of UFN leaders. Yet, seriously, the show tries to make viewers cheer for their happiness at the end. Shshsh. At the end of the show there are still more reasons to back \"evil\" Emperor Lelouch than his enemies. And the show really tries hard to convince viewers otherwise, completely oblivious to consequences of its own story. Really, really annoying.\\n\\n\r\nIt is all effect of the anime for teens trying to overstretch itself and tackling very serious issues (should anyone collaborate in occupied country? is it ethically responsible to instigate insurgency? who is responsible for collateral casualties? what is the price one is willing to pay for take down an evil empire? bring a world peace? are empires morally comparable?), while keeping retarded parts of the show. It's not a certain recipe for disaster, some shows managed to pull this off, here however we have the case of exceptionally crappy writing full of ill-conceived twists and dei ex machina. It was forgivable in the first season, maybe because it was less apparent, but in the second one it just makes me sick.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention, the second season multiplied original faults from the first one. It was full of childish fanservice but now, omg, over-sized busts of heroines torment viewers everywhere. How I hate that! Awkward romances continue but the worst part is this high school masquerade. Come on, even in first season it was barely understandable that Lelouch is hiding there, in second one it is plain retarded. OK, there is a reason for that, it's this standard Japanese high school obsession, which forces almost every anime to take place there. Still, it's annoying as hell. Which is very repulsive and makes the whole second season of the show not worth recommending.",

            "content": "WARNING: This review contains an opinion that may differ from your own. I ask that you please read it with an open mind. If you're a fan of this manga/anime, hey I'm completely okay with that. I respect your opinion. Just how you should respect mine. \r\nThis will be a review for both R1 and R2. Before hitting the not helpful button, please here me out and take my criticism into consideration. Yeah I know, everyone loves this anime and people constantly list it in their top ten. But I felt like Code Geass had some glaring problems, which really prevented me from liking itmore then I actually did. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, a quick synopsis of story. Code Geass takes place in an alternate universe where the empire of Britannia controls most of the world. The governing powers consist of 3 nations: Britannia itself, the Chinese Federation and the European Union. Japan has been renamed Area 11 by the empire. Since Britannia\u2019s occupation of Japan, tension has been rising between the two nations. Enter our main protagonist, Lelouch Lamperouge, the former prince of Britannia who now lives in exile along with his sister Nunnally after the mysterious tragic death of their mother. One day, Lelouch gets caught up in the cross fire of a terrorist attack and encounters a women named C2, who saves his life. Not only that, but she hands him the power of the Geass. With this power, Lelouch can control anyone by just looking into their eyes and giving them a command. Now of course, there are more rules and guidelines for using this power but that\u2019s the gist of it. With the power of the Geass in his hand, he adopts the identity of Zero and leads a rebellion, in hopes of creating a better world for his sister Nunnally and finding out why his mother was murdered. And blah, blah, blah, I think you got the big picture by now. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the storytelling is great. Each episode was suspenseful, intense and it was just plot twist after plot twist; I was always wanting to know what happened next. About 15 episodes into the show, I started noticing some problems. The first being the lack of direction and focus. Code Geass tries too hard to appeal to every single anime fan. It\u2019s like the series doesn't know what it wants to be. To some it up, Code Geass is a mecha action show, political war drama and worst of all, it\u2019s a high school romantic comedy. Which results in the plot straying off from the main focus of Lelouch overthrowing his father along with the Britannian government and getting into these filler-ish types of side stories that no one cares for. Clearly, this was an obvious marketing strategy implemented by Sunrise. Their incentives were to appeal to all types of anime fans, like the ones who value good storytelling and characterization (like myself), and others who enjoy watching trash such as Harems, ecchis and moes/slice of life. Take for example, when they made that giant pizza at Lelouch's school. Wow.....really, honest to god, who the hell wanted to watch that ? Oh, lets not forget about the horribly contrived and cheesy sub-plot/romance between Lelouch and his female classmate Shirley. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Shirley, that brings me to my next point, the characters. Lets start off with Lelouch, arguably the best in the series. He is arrogant, manipulative, intelligent and a condescending a**hole overall. But that\u2019s what I liked about him. Easily the most well written and memorable, because he got the most characterization out of the bunch. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a completely different story when it comes to the other characters. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMost, if not all, got no characterization or development. Code Geass definitely has a large cast of characters; but almost all of them were completely disposable. Now yes, you could argue that the show is only 50 episodes and so they don\u2019t have time to flesh out every single one because then the it would go on forever. If that\u2019s the case, then why did they even bother introducing all of them if they weren't going to make them a valuable asset to the series ? I personally, found most of them to be boring ( most of Lelouch\u2019s classmates) or annoying (Nina anyone?). Even the ones who did get a good amount of characterization are later ruined by the writers inability to give them consistency. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSuzaku Kururugi is a perfect example of this. Without going into spoilers, out of the blue, his character does a complete 180 later on. There was no build up, foreshadowing, progression, or development to demonstrate this. Which resulted in some contrived plot devices. To top it off, most of the female cast member\u2019s only contribution to the show was strictly fan service. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFor instances, look at Kallen Stadfeld, earlier on, there were attempts at fleshing out her character by exploring why she hates Britannia and her reasons for joining the Black Knights (the rebel group led by Zero), which involved family troubles between her mom and step mom. Sadly, as the anime goes on, she\u2019s reduced to nothing more then eye candy through fan service; exemplified with constant ass shots of her when she\u2019s in the cockpit of the Guren MK-II while piloting it. Not to mention the seductive pink bunny outfit she wore in R2. That\u2019s another problem this show has. Excessive, pointless, bland and tasteless fan service that is spread out over the entirety of the anime. It was incredibly distracting , annoying and unnecessary. There were numerous times when it took me out of the experience. Fan service would have been fine if Code Geass was a harem or ecchi. But it\u2019s not, therefore it\u2019s deemed pointless, out of place and adds nothing to the overall quality of the series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nProduction values is where Code Geass excels the most. As far as the OST goes, it was a solid one. Most of it was orchestrated but it works just right for the show. That includes the openings and endings as well. All were good listens, and I don\u2019t even like J-Rock, but my favorite has to be the first opening for R2. I\u2019ll come out and say it. The art style here doesn't complement the tone and atmosphere of the narrative and overall experience. Code Geass is a story about imperialism, war, politics, power and corruption. Yet the art style looks like something you\u2019d find in a moe/slice of life, a harem or an ecchi. This all leads back to my previous statement where I said that sunrise was trying too hard to appeal to every anime fan. Animation wise, Code Geass is top notch. It never lets up, especially during the mecha battles. It flows very smoothly and there\u2019s little to no problems. You can definitely tell the creators put a lot of time into the visuals and aesthetics of the show. In terms of dub vs. sub, you decide. For the most part, the dub is good. But it never quite reaches the same level of excellency like the Cowboy Bebop, Death Note or Hellsing Ultimate dub. Nevertheless, Johnny Young Bosch gives a standout performance as Lelouch and possibly his best since his portrayal of Vash the Stampede. So yes, I\u2019d say the subbed version is superior but it all comes down to preference. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is far off from being a masterpiece in my opinion. The inconsistent characterization, under developed characters, excessive fanservice and lack of focus prevent it from being one. This anime is one of those types of shows where you try and want to love it but you just can't. Despite that, I still think it\u2019s a decent alright show that\u2019s worth a try; just don\u2019t go rushing yourself to watch it.",

(take a.. real life war going on right now which i will not name for political reasons, but nevertheless will say that i am against.)\\n\\n\r\nin code geass, we delve into the psyche of the characters, what makes them tick, what motivates them, what is their passion for doing what they're doing now (and i assure you there are plenty of revelations here!)\\n\\n\r\nin season 1, lelouch's motivation was pretty simple. destroy britannia, avenge mummy, and make nunnally a new happy world from scratch. \\n\r\nbut what about in R2? like it or not, he's bound to become attached to the otbk. will he abandon them once he accomplishes his agenda? will THEY abandon him if they realize he's really a britannian prince? what about his brothers and sisters? his father? what about suzaku?? and worse, nunnally?\\n\r\nhis world has now expanded from just revolving around revenge, suzaku and nunnally, to include his ashford friends and the otbk.\\n\\n\r\nwhat if accomplishing his goals means abandoning everything he cares about? what are his goals? are they still the same ones he had before?\\n\\n\r\nand lastly, what is CC's wish? \\n\\n\r\ncode geass r2 answers those questions. \\n\\n\r\nfrom the looks of it, this season is probably going to be the last. better grab your copy now before the seeds disappear, lol.i'm having trouble finding seeds for season 1 (i only have gg fansubs and they won't play on my dvd player).\\n\\n\r\nbut if you ask me, this is definitely one worth watching. and when i finally achieve my dream of learning japanese and go to japan, i will most definitely buy an original copy. if it's still there (D:)\\n\\n\r\non the fansubs page, i think eclipse is the best. no offense to others, but this is the only one that can play directly in my dvd player (an actual one so i can watch it on tv), so it's the one i get.",

            "content": "The story should have ended there, but no... just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, it always does. \r\nYou see, one day, some executives from Sunrise (the morons that made this confused mess of an animu) decided to communally smoke some expensive weed to get inspiration for new ideas. This proved to be a terrible mistake, as they all agreed in their collectively impaired judgment to make a second season for Code Geass. \r\nThis happens quite a lot: a good anime will go horrifyingly down the shitter when an addition is made to the original story. And because the Japanese never learn fromtheir mistakes, a second season had to be made for Code Geass as well so that it, too, could be epically ruined. Note that the first season is and always will be absolute trash, but the Japs just couldn't help themselves and make another would-be hentai. Smh.\\n\\n\r\nIt was already clear for the viewers that this continuation would be a bigass trainwreck from the get-go when a new lead character, Rolo, was introduced. It didn't take a genius to figure that this whiny faggot would prove to be the improbable animu version of Scrappy-Doo\u2014a younger, stupider, uglier, infinitely more annoying version of the main character. \\n\\n\r\nThings could only get worse from there: the continuity of the entire fucking show was totally ignored, so that the first seven episodes were made by following the same damn scenario as the first season, leaving the viewers to wonder whether this new incarnation of Code Geass will be a similar disappointment as Higurashi, a.k.a Nipah~, where the timeline is reset practically every episode. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so, after re-experiencing the whole plot, the viewer is treated to what amounts to a gigantic animated clusterfuck: Lelouch finds himself owning the entire world having made a pretty fair trade-in of China against Japan. He is now surrounded by an entirely new cast (of course), including a Chinese princess and her pedo knight, a fake brother that Lelouch intends to use and dump later, as well hundreds of other nations leaders that he infected with Geass so that they would join him. So he finds himself being the new leader of half of the world, and goes on to kick his father's ass who owns the other half. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot jumps to Rolo taking Lelouch to the Wonderland of Joy, and dying from the divine punishment of using the Za Warudo move that was way too cool for a faggot like him. Lelouch suddenly (once again, for no particular reason) finds his sense of purpose in life...and then levels up his Geass to level 50 to battle against a floating Jupiter-like thing on the ceiling that came from a hidden dimension in his basement. By this point, no one who watched the show knew what the fuck was going on. \\n\\n\r\nLelouch finally makes good on his engagement to Suzaku and happily marries him... but then finds himself in a world turned upside down face, so now in control of the bad guy's side half of the world, fighting against the good guys. \\n\\n\r\nIronically despite making absolutely NO FUCKING SENSE, this is the best the show ever gets, Lelouch stops being a whiney bitch and just acts like a total dick. \\n\\n\r\nThis is eventually ruined by the ending of course. Is he alive, or is he not? Frankly, I hope to Allah for the latter so we don't have a followup to this crap.\\n\\n\r\n\"Breaking News: 'Code Geass: Fukkatsu no Lelouch' Anime Announced\"\\n\\n\r\nAllah Akbar\\n\\n\r\nRatings:\\n\r\nCharacters: 0/10 Suck\\n\r\nStory: -3/10 Partially because of R2 but mainly because it sucks\\n\r\nAction: 4/10. It's about taking over teh world and giant robots, after all.\\n\r\nLulz: 4/10. The parts where it tries to be funny, fails. There are exceptions: the moment when a chink named Mao tries to chainsaw C.C. and stuff her into a bag, and when the Britfags decide to burn down the Jap ghetto and shoot all the motherfuckers for teh lulz.\\n\r\nFaggotry: 27.5/10. Out of all animu you'd ever watch, this one doesn't even need to be shooped to look gay, screenshots alone are enough. The way main characters look and dress (and jump) are shockingly homosexual, especially the combined efforts of Lelouch and Suzaku. Gayness is outright implied in more than a few parts: when Rolo approaches Lulu saying, \"I will be always with you\" and, and practically every other conversation between Lelouch and Suzaku. Just look for \"OH GEASS NO\" on YouTube. \\n\r\nFurry Fandom: 5/10. They dress up in animal costumes for some reason in one episode, and the pink-haired cumwhore dresses as a giant green beaver in another. However furries are gay so a good score here gives the show -5 points\\n\r\nProduct Placement: 30/10. Just for the Hell of it, try taking a shot every time you see a Pizza Hut logo. Be warned: you may die of alcohol poisoning.\\n",

            "content": "Story: at first I was skeptical about how this second half of Code Geass started, the bizarre replacement in everyone's minds of Nunally with Rolo just struck me as way out there; however, this season does not disappoint at all. It picks up where the first left off in terms of plot twists and keeping you guessing. The ending is simply superb, giving all the right abouts of closure and realism and wrapping up the story nicely without any frivolity but just the right amount of emotion.\r\nArt: I always enjoy CLAMPS designs, but, they are not without their flaws. The perspectives sometimes feel off especiallyin combination with the impossibly long arms and legs of characters. Still, it is a very minor issue, generally I really enjoyed that art.And somehow the art really seemed to fit Lelouch's character. Less pizza hut advertisements this time around though. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening theme bothered in me in as much as it did not seem to match the series for tone. It is better suited to a high school drama/comedy in my opinion. Otherwise, the sound was good. The voice acting was very enjoyable as well, and, the song before the closing credits on the last episode was beautifully chosen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I am not sure how this series managed to give almost the exact right about of time to all the characters, but, it did. There are quite a lot of new characters in this season, in addition to those from last season, and while it would have been nice to see a little more of the Knights of Rounds, I really think this show did an amazing job developing of characters. As for the characters themselves, the cast is truly rich and varied and should have at least one character that appeals to anyone who watches it. The characters are not static however, and continue to go through struggles and change.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I was tickled pink, and a number of other better colors, by this show. It had everything. I loved every pretty much every moment of this whole series. This season had some truly memorable and delicious moments with delightful twists. And, the ending was terrific, completely satisfying. I love a show that is this original. This season included a period of time where I couldn't decide who's side I was even on anymore, individually or in terms of groups. It was fantastically unpredictable. I'd give it higher score if I could for this category. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I highly recommend the series to pretty much anyone, as it has something for everyone. That said, if you are looking for the conventional...this is not the show to see. Overall the show was excellent and I waited impatiently each week for the next episode. I also recommending having a buddy who is also watching it, or has recently done so, to discuss it with as you go, its the kind of show you want to talk about.",

The story takes many dramatic plot turns that keep you on your feet, the only reason I gave it a 9 is because sometimes you can get lost in the dust. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nCLAMP has done it again! The colors, the gundams--er, &quot;Nightmares&quot;, they are all so colorful and beautiful to look at. This is one of the anime out there that doesn't cut to a chibi-induced hell or the sweatdrop-pulsing vein thing (not that there's anything wrong with that!!!), which gives you time to enjoy the actual art that is supposed to be created with anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is pretty much the same as for the first season, good thing the soundtrack was great! Sometimes it was hard to hear what the characters were saying above the dramatic violin music (haha), but overall the sound quality was great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nIn Code Geass R2, you are not only introduced to new characters, but you also see character developments from minor characters in the first season. It's really hard to talk about character development without spoiling it, but once you get to...oh, let's see...episode 20? 21? you'll totally understand.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to know why everyone loves the R2 better than the R1, you have to see it to believe it. The second season leaves you breathless, and it's a thrill ride more exciting than the first season. I was sad to end it, but at the same time I was happy on how the series came to a close (is that a spoiler?). This anime will leave you BEGGING for more! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass--both R1 and R2---are considered to be some of my favorite anime. Fans of the first season will like it, and if you haven't seen the first season, GO SEE IT. Both of these seasons will absolutely change your outlook on anime forever.",

            "content": "Story\r\ntaking place 1 yr from where season 1 trailed off i really anticipated this series' return but was a bit disappointed by how everything seemed to restart just the way everything began with geass 1. the only difference is that the catching up isnt far off since lelouch already have that military might he didnt have when code geass began. aside from that, i was a bit disappointed with how geass 2 somewhat deviated itself from geass 1 in the sense that the focal issue of geass has been resolved within 2 episodes, leaving some other secrets about it uncovered making the series lose the&quot;essence&quot; of its title.\\n\\n\r\nif geass 2 was able to brag about something, it would be the world domination schema that would really perk up strategy gamers' interests. alliances and forged, countries are colored red or blue and the world was torn between factions. as a personal fan of strategy games, i considered this plot influence a plus.\\n\\n\r\n in the end, code geass 2 reverted to being another gundam series that ends with one massive war and a use of nukes/superweapons and i think that in itself made geass 2 unimpressive. however, it's overall flow was realistic. technology was discovered to counter an opposing country's technology. the world competed with one another through technology and development and that is another great influence of watching geass in the long run. it makes people realize that this overpowered mech came into realization in order to counter this other mech.\\n\\n\r\noverall, geass have been bluntly a strategic action anime. it could've been better if they involved geass too and put it much in detail but hey. it happened, the season ended and everyone watched.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nthe art is always good since it came from clamp but some angles would make me remember some SeeD characters such as kira and athrun. well it's all nice though but it's somewhat distracting since you're too much focused in the development of the story itself. \\n\\n\r\nthe knightmares themselves were definitely stylish especially this time around. they featured much sleek and glossy coating that made me reminiscient of 00. there were also some knightmare designs that seemed to have been copied from Gundam 00 but i think that's plausible sincesunrise made both series.\\n\\n\r\nthere were also some episodes released with poor quality but regardless, geass 2 was still fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nwith nakagawa kotaro responsible for the bgm heard all throughout, there is no way geass wouldn't stand out. the opening songs by orange range and flow were good but the ending theme with ali project is/has that weird, uneasy impact on me. though i did like AP when they did the rozen maiden series, it somehow doesnt fit geass. i also didnt like how the final ep ended in an ali project end. it somehow doesnt feel enough closure like how they decided to end it on s1. that or maybe im requesting too much\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nthere were plenty of characters introduced this season as well as recurring ones. it seemed that every fanbase was influenced by geass such as lolicons, yaois, yuris, incest, and even some other unnamed weird bases.\\n\\n\r\naside from fanservice issues, im glad to see that a lot of the cast of geass have matured. from the young boy that wanted to make a world for her sister now fights for the rest of the world. the knight that holds his principles have finally decided to throw them away. there were lots of changes, both big and small, yet contributed to the development of the story. there were characters to raged at, to laugh at, to cry at and every last one of them contributed in the enjoyment of geass\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\naside from the return of overpowered mechas that does spinkicks and heeldrops, im amused the most on the display of wit and strategy that geass used all throughout. one thing that code geass dsitances itself from its gundam counterparts would be the sheer execution of strategy that does not rely heavily on a single unit's power. while lelouch continued to throw away lives, he made every sacrifice worth it. that virtue itself is something that would interest me in as how flawless strategies are executed and how and individual carries the burden of his choices. \\n\\n\r\ndespite being given the power of geass, despite the actions taken and the decisions made, we also see the conflict of a young boy as he turned into a responsible man as he continued to carry the weight of his sins. as his influence grew and the hatred spread and how he finally resolved everything in one go.\\n\\n\r\nif there were some things that season 2 influenced me with, it must've been the weight of one's sacrifice and the growing up of one simple ideal into another.\\n\\n\r\nthe boy who fought for his own happiness in R1 now fought for the happiness of the world in R2 and that in itself is a good way to close things regarding lelouch's personal issues.\\n\\n\r\nas ive said however, lelouch's issue is over in this series but the issue about CC and geass is not. if there would be an s3 it woudl definitely be a new story and a new cast\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nit was fun, it was depressing, it brought me to tears and rage and awe and dissatisfaction. even though the beginning was a bit good and the middle was totally off, the end topped it off but it still left most hanging. still, it never ceases to amaze me how much wisdom lelouch has. you can blame it to his experience in R1 and the things he experienced in R2 but still, the experiences he had cultivated him to make a &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; triumphant plan in the end and that totally impressed me with code geass.\\n\\n\r\nif this is the end of this series then i would surely miss the cast and crew of code geass. \\n\\n\r\nthis is a job well done but i wished that they made something along the series to make it better.",

            "content": "\"Regardless what I want, is tomorrow!\" \u2014 Lelouch Lamperouge\r\nFor you people who recently got into this beautiful medium called Anime then I definitely recommend you watch this show because this is one Epic that you ever forget.\r\nCode Geass R2 is the sequel to R1 and though it isn't far superior by the time you're watching this you'll already be consumed by the world of the Holy Empire of Britannia, a world were Japanese are looked down upon and will no longer be referred to as Japanese but instead Elevens. Code Geass alter's history in which when Julius Caesar attempted to invade Britain the local tribesband together electing a super-leader Eowyn the first member of the Britannian which in time became the world power of Britannia.\\n\\n\r\nMost people I know absolutely loved R1 so in turn they loved R2 as well but if you didn't like R1 first of all go fuck yourself, you aren't titled to an opinion on my review and second of all I doubt anything is going to change with because though R1 and R2 are a little different they're still similar.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\n-------\\n\r\nZero is back again, and his rebellion has just begun. But this time it's on a larger scale but if you thought he was ruthless last time well just you wait because he's gonna turn it up to a whole new level. Just like before it's a story filled with deceit and action, but I'd say R2 has more action sequences that R1.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nCode Geass has a very unique art style where all the character's have abnormally long torsos and limbs, the majority of viewers get used to the art style after 5 episodes. The reason I believe people reject this art style is because it's not one of the typical art style that animes utilize. I feel it adds to the character appeal making characters in my opinion just more badass.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nSoundtrack is just alright, nothing very memorable. But the characters voices are marvelous in both the dubbed and subbed version, with a few exceptions like Nunally's voice in the dubbed version, whenever she was speaking I felt like someone was sticking nails into my ears but regardless that doesn't affect the animation as a whole because the main character's voices are great and you can really feel the voices bring the characters to life.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nProbably the best part about the show are the very memorable characters our Protagonist is Lelouch who is quite the anti-hero is I do say so myself, you might find yourself questioning his judgement and his motives sometimes but that's our Hero. Then there is Suzaku who is the person who exemplifies justice the most in this Anime. Some characters are annoying like Nina but she get's less annoying this time around. Sure there are a few one dimensional characters here and there but I would say that the more important characters are \"deep\" in a sense and I find that you will agree with me when you learn of there motives, justification and backstory.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nCode Geass keeps you interested most of the time; but I do have to remark that the action scenes are very mehish but I only attribute it to how old the anime is, if you check out the OVAs (Akito the Exiled) then you'll understand that at the time they were limited to that Animation. The fight scenes do get interesting and if you're a fan of any Mech series like Gundam than you'll probably enjoy these fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nWatch it, it's pretty fucking good in my opinion, but I'm not expert I just watch anime 24/7.",

            "content": "A review of the sequel of the greatest anime of all time. In my opinion, at least. As this is a review of the second season of Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch, then I assume the viewer is familiar with the original, Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch as this is Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nAbout a year has passed since the events of the first season, and Lelouch no longer has memories of being Zero. In the events that happen in the first episode, Lelouch regains his memories of being Zero, so what I just said no longer has a meaning. So, hejust continues as he is, being Zero and dominating shit and shit like that while maintaining a normal school life. Suzaku, who knows that he was Zero, is unsure whether or not he has regained his memories. But only time will tell. I think.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty much the exact same art style as the first season had. You know, the season that was released just before this one? Yeah. That one.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is fascinating, listen to it nao, or I'll kill ye. There's not much more to say about it, the songs fit the sad death scenes and all that, so yeah.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI accidentally pressed 2 on this, and I thought I was high when I was going to write this down. Character: 2/... That's not right. The characters are awesome and continue from being awesome from the first season. My opinions on Suzaku change on this season, and I actually think he's quite an amazing character now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis entire series, the first and second seasons, has got to be my favorite anime of all time. I've watched about 40-50ish anime, but out of all of them, this has got to be one of my favorites. It's great, I'd rewatch it any day.",

            "content": "What do you consider as justice? \r\nA simple wish. A simple desire. World peace. What would you give up for that? How would you go about it?\r\nCode Geass R2, no, all of Code Geass revolves around how Lelouch Lamperouge goes about it all. It all starts in the first season so don't try to watch the second season without watching the first. I don't mean it because you won't get the idea of the plot. No, I believe that anyone can figure out the plot after a few episodes. It is because you will not enjoy Code Geass to its full extent. \r\nIn this review,I will be talking about the series as a whole, not as season one or season two.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is a well thought out story. Throughout the entire series, you never know the exact truth, the full story of what is going on, not until the very last episode. It is an intense anime and luckily, there are a few not exactly fillers (more like those calmer/fun episodes) that just makes you hope that everything will be okay. It tells us, that for now, we have to enjoy everything around us, even if life is too much. It balances out the intensity of Code Geass, even if it does change the mood drastically. \\n\\n\r\nCliffhangers are wonderfully used. Nearly every episode was a cliffhanger of some sort. It's always 'What's Zero going to do next?'. Zero's complexity left me hanging off my seat, wanting more and more to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were probably the most most strongest point of Code Geass, with the story nicely complimenting them. You will hate characters, love characters or change your mind about them. Every character has their own story. Every character has a wish with a different way to pursue it. Every character was so unique and so real. Zero/Lelouch was the most real of them all.\\n\\n\r\nHis 'realness' led me to hate him and despise him. His 'realness' always made me question what was right and what was wrong.His 'realness' was what made me love him as a character. As I said before, Lelouch is an incredibly complex character. He had a goal and pursued. Does that make him the hero or the villain? Or was it Zero? That is for you to answer. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast is so lovable yet most had a dark secret. But who doesn't have a secret? I loved most of the cast. They were wonderful and will have a place in my heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful. Clamp's over the top lankiness in characters is a trait that I love. Their eyes, wasn't as easy to take in for me. I get obsessive when it comes to eyes. However, their design seemed to have fitted the characters. Some were sharp and cunning, others were soft and caring and some were both. As normal, I don't take much notice to the background. The Knightmares were awesome. I loved the action scenes, especially when a new generation of Knightmares came to play. The animation was fluid and just lovely.\\n\\n\r\nSound I didn't like as much. The OPs and EDs could've been better in my opinion. They weren't exactly enjoyable and took time for me to get used to. I won't say much on seiyuu as I don't know what good voice acting is (seeing how I am a noob and barely understand Japanese well enough to analyse the VA). The BGM was cool. They used the right music during the right scenes. The soundtrack did bring out either the action or the sadness of each scene.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, at times I hated Code Geass. It was so much of a roller coaster I didn't know what to think of it. With questions like 'What is the truth?' and 'What is justice?' screaming out at me, I just couldn't think. At times, Zero was right and at others, he was wrong. He had done what was immoral to me and I couldn't help but hate him. But then again, I couldn't help but think, maybe his way was the right way.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was fitting. It was what I wanted but not to such a degree. After finally having the truth revealed to me, it was an ending that I had accepted. Code Geass is a psychological anime. It twists and turns in such a way it confuses your sense of justice. It was a good anime. I love it even if I did hate it at times. It was wonderful and can't be easily forgotten.",

It was vaguely explained, and I could sense it.\\n\r\nAs much as I didn't want to do this well... Lets begin.\\n\r\nAs mentioned before Code Geass takes a grand-scale war setting with characters taking war seriously, feel discriminated and overwhelmed... It doesn't work here.\\n\r\nA well written war story needs inspirational characters on both sides who don't overshadow the rest because they're smart and the others aren't.\\n\r\nLegend of the Galactic Heroes did the same but the characters there were equal and people could like and decide who to vote for even wwith corrupt nobles. Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 took war seriously, even if it felt Amuro had plot armour because of the Gundam.\\n\r\nLelouch however... Automatically overshadows and overthrows everyone with almost no effort because of his power, he isn't a tacticion like Char Aznable or Yang Wenli, he's a manipulator taking advantage of his power to earn anything. Sure, there was a moment where he used his brains, before forming the personality of zero.\\n\r\nBut at the same time, he's just a child abusing his power to win over anything. (And regarding his questionable decisions and plot armor when it comes to doing something)\\n\r\nSuzaku, the supposedly equal opponent to Lelouch doesn't feel like an opponent as much as a taunt buddy, which is further proven in the second season where he becomes an aristocrat. Which he had hated after seeing what they can achieve just from a nuke. (Also did I mention he killed his father by accident thus gaining the power to a Britannian loyal soldier? And the fact that he denies Zero's choices because he thinks they are wrong and by the end he starts questioning whether the Britannian Empire was a right choice yet decides to join them to the end?)\\n\r\nSo he betrays Lelouch and lets him have false memories and live!? Yo Suzaku Didn't you like... Want to kill him for killing your waifu or sth? WHY JUST WHY DID THE WRITERS SAY THIS IS OK?!\\n\r\nC.C the MAIN HEROINE is as dry as any lead can be, she's just a whole pizza hut waifu advertisement for people with really REALLY REALLY bad choices of girls. Nothing much I can say for her.\\n\r\nAs for the other characters like Karen, Villa, Orange, Charles, Rolo and other characters which were one of the few far-fetched characters main characters that felt like they were supposed to be left as side characters that wouldn't matter, other than when LELOUCH VI BRITANNIA ... I mean Zero tells them to do something they're characterization is as bad as the characterization of the side characters in Galactic Heroes, 0079, and even Vision of Escaflowne. And the cast isn't even that overwhelming to need more than a few episodes of development but its so niche it's pitiful, if they were more put on as a focus than mostly Lelouch & C.C, it would of had better fleshed out and side characters.\\n\r\nWhile it could of been better here and there not much complaints in terms of the first season but oh boy, the second one just rocks the boat!\\n\r\nAnd yes, Galactic Heroes did the same bullshit with its aristocrats they feel one note or barely have any redeeming quality and so do the side characters in Code Geass.\\n\r\nHalf of my problems with the show were not fixed with the second season, infact there were MORE problems than less once I had finished it. Regarding the ending well... It was magnificent, well done and perfect. Sadly the show didn't do as much, oh well. Atleast the composer did his job.\\n\r\nCode Geass is plagued by pathetic writing, horribly developed side charactersm shock factor/sudden character deaths for the sole reason to make you cry and nothing more. Plot convinence to extend the series so that the Sunrise to get earn more money than it should so the studio can go on and re-release another gundam each year because the writers/authors of gundam are suffering from brain damage at this point.",

This show is ingeniously written and a sheer pleasure to watch as the story unfolds and we learn more about the world we are put into. The story only becomes better as it unfolds.\r\n[ART: 9/10]\r\nThe character design and art itself are great and only goes up in quality during the transition from R1 to R2. The main characters have much thought and care put intotheir designs and they stand out compared to other characters, whether it's in this series or any other. \\n\\n\r\n[SOUND: 10/10]\\n\r\nThe sound was done masterfully, both the voice acting and background music. Everything fits and the voice actors do a great job portraying their characters for the animation they're in.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER: 10/10]\\n\r\nThe main characters are extremely well-written and unforgettable. Lelouch is seen as one of the best characters in anime history and it isn't hard to see why. Whether you see him as a harsh dictator or enthralling hero, you'll have a difficult time hating him by the end.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 10/10]\\n\r\nI loved this show all the way through watching it and I never felt as if it wasn't anything but great during. As a groundbreaking masterpiece of the medium, Code Geass will stand the test of time as one of the previous decade's greatest animated works.",

            "content": "Non-Spoiler Review\r\nAnime: Code Geass\r\nSeasons: 2\r\nTotal Episodes: 50 (25 per season)\r\nGenre: Psychological, Military and War, Mecha, Action, Super power\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nThe animes starts with the explanation of how the world is divided into 3 superpowers The Holy Britannian Empire, The EU and The Chinese Federation. Lelouch (the protagonist) is shown as a student with remarkable intellect but is l an exiled prince from the Holy Britannian Empire, he's the 11th Prince and son of the 98th Emperor of Britannia. He wishes to destroy the Holy Empire namely his father the 98th Emperor for abandoning him and his sister Nunnally and later sets off on his mission after crossingpaths with a mysterious girl named C. C.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT/STORYLINE:\\n\r\nThe anime imo started off slowly the first 3 or 4 episodes but they gradually picked up momentum and maintained it through out the series to the last episode of the 2nd season.\\n\r\nTo avoid some potential spoilers, I'll keep it short.\\n\r\nBritannia won the war with Japan and is now in control of it with its name changed to Area 11 the people there referred to as \"Elevens\". The 1st season R1 was about the start of the rebellion by Lelouch in order to make a world suitable for his younger sister Nunnally to live in peacefully (who is blind and crippled). Lelouch using the code name \"Zero\" forms an organization with the purpose of defeating Brianna and taking back control of Area 11 (Japan), but it isn't all that serious 24/7 in the anime we do get some comedy relief moments.\\n\r\nThe 2nd Season R2 goes further into his plan to destroy Britannia, before I continue lemme say this the 1st episode of R2 may seem confusing but it's the correct sequence (i.e R1 then R2). Things get explained later. After the events of R1 Lelouch and his organization is still battling Britannia but with time Lelouch has to be more careful in his dealing because of some changes in conditions. In R2 Lelouch is shown using his masterful intellect to oppose Britannia while he stays in the spotlight.\\n\r\nThough as one would expect there are plot holes present in the series some being downright stupid, some others that could've been due to not paying much attention, it isn't perfect but comes pretty close imo.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS/CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:\\n\r\nLelouch Vi Britannia (Zero): Is the main character of the series, he had an dual personality throughout the series, one of an easygoing student and the other being Zero who plans for the destruction of Britannia. He is shown to be Prideful, Stubborn and very intelligent. Imo his character remained almost similar (as stubborn characters are usually hard to change) but as he progresses through his goals he comes across great losses be that his missions or people, which changes him and his plans (somewhat).\\n\\n\r\nSuzaka Kururugi (2nd Main): He's the childhood best friend of Lelouch they meet when Lelouch and Nunnally are send to Area 11. He's shown to be caring about others and excels at combat. I'd say his character changes quite a bit because of all the suffering he goes through (you might even hate him at some point), he believes in changing the system for within itself rather than confronting it by violent means like Lelouch intended, this obviously creates a gap between these two.\\n\\n\r\nC.C: She's a mystery girl who gives Lelouch a rather special power when both of them make a contract with each other. She mostly shown doing her own thing (not really too curious about what's happening around her), her main and possibly only priority is that Lelouch survives. Oh, and she loves Pizza... Lots and Lots of Pizza....\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\r\nThe artstyle was different from what I'm used to but it was watchable, all characters had some unusually long legs and arms. Searching on the internet I came across a term for it \"noodle people\". You can try searching for \"art style noodle people\". The action sequence were pretty well animated there weren't many \"bad animations moments\". Overall I'd say it had decent animation.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC:\\n\r\nAh, this...\\n\r\nThe OSTs were wonderful and synced perfectly to add to the impact of scenes.\\n\r\nHere are the names:\\n\r\nMadder Sky Ver1 - Main Theme (My 2nd fav)\\n\r\nAcross the Borderline\\n\r\nIf I Were a Bird\\n\r\nContinued Story Ver1 (also pretty good)\\n\r\nYuukyuo Seishuka\\n\r\nInnocent Days\\n\r\nMadder Sky Ver2 (I'd prefer Ver1)\\n\r\nMasquerade\\n\r\nMozaiku Kakera (right in the feels, most fav)\\n\r\nNoblesse Oblige\\n\r\nNunnally\\n\r\nContinued Story Ver2\\n\\n\r\nOpenings:\\n\r\nColors by FLOW (Ep 1 to 12, R1) (my fav)\\n\r\nKaidoku Funo by Jimm (Ep 13 to 23, R1)\\n\r\nHitomi no Tsubasa by Access (Ep 24 to 25, R1)\\n\r\nO2 by ORANGE RANGE (Ep 1 to 12, R2)\\n\r\nWorld End by FLOW (Ep 13 to 25, R2)\\n\\n\r\nEndings:\\n\r\nYuukyou Seishunka by ALI PROJECT (Ep 1 to 12, R1)\\n\r\nMozaiku Kakera by SunSet Swish (Ep 13 to 25, R1) (my fav)\\n\r\nShiawase Neiro by ORANGE RANCH (Ep 1 to 12, R2)\\n\r\nWaga Rotashi Aku no Hana by ALI PROJECT (Ep 13 to 25)\\n\\n\r\nFINAL WORDS:\\n\r\nThis anime was really different for me, really interesting and really amazing. Those constant plot twists had me on the edge of my seat with me left wondering after each episode what expect next, but it wasn't without its bad deals like those plot holes I mentioned earlier but they didn't spoil the fun too much either so it's all good. It also had a pretty good amount of psychological scenes which left me in awe!\\n\\n\r\nFAVORITE QOUTES:\\n\r\n\"If the king does not lead, how can he expect his subordinates to follow.\" - Lelouch\\n\\n\r\n\"In their heart, everyone has faith that their victory exists. However, in the face of time and destiny, the act of faith is fruitless and fleeting at best.\". - C.C\\n\\n\r\nRATING:\\n\r\nPlot: R1 and R2 combined 9.7/10\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 8.3/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 8.3/10\\n\r\nMusic: 8.5/10\\n\r\nOverall: 9.4/10\\n\\n\r\nRemember this is a combined review about R1 and R2\\n\r\nAnd my first anime review so it might not have included some things",

            "content": "So I finished Code Geass R1 and R2, the 2006 to 2008 version\r\nAnd it\u2019s definitely say that this is definitely one of my favorite anime and one of the best I have seen.\r\nLike holy shit\u2026 the characters, their relationships, the development, the different arcs, the villains - all of it was just amazing!\r\nIt all starts off really boring and meh and all adventure and solid war. All focusing on the relationship between Lelouch and Suzaku which is a really touching and beautiful friendship. A really great friendship.Thier motivs and reasons to fight. Wearing mask why fiding for the other side.Lelouch fights for his sister, whileSuzaku fights for Euphi. In the end: both of their motivs class at a stand-off and that leads up to R2.\\n\\n\r\nThe way that Lulu make use of his Geass, oh my gosh\u2026 I really loved it! He honestly is one step ahead of everyone even his older siblings is really a golden era i've hit. Suzaku poloting the Lancelot in combat is trually a good way to make more amazing!\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is about terrorisim and other stuff i had to say but, forgot........oh well....And pizza! XD\\n\r\n(not counting the plot holes since i know how they work in almost any ANIME EVER!) Pacing is neato.\\n\\n\r\nMao's arc was a total waste of my time and honestly, he was just this fail geass user who never had talent and was nothing importent to the plot at all! I mean, sure it's okay to add a side plot only that 3 FREAKING EPISODE TOOK FOREVER TO COMPLEATE IT - DARN IT MAO.\\n\\n\r\nVi 2 and Rollo got nothing at all i really care about them. Both of those losers got their death treament after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe Knightmare Frames and their battles in it were too damn good (espesilly the Gawain) they gave them the King Athur titles during the knights and etc. Even the minor frames whom are only grunts still did got my high hopes for this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains man\u2026 the villains. The show in R2 is not the same as it is in R2. First they want to destroy the holy kingdom, then in R2 they've decide to take it over isntead. The area 11 is the victim in all of this crap and tbh, they got the crappy treatment till the very end of ep 25 from the second season. The writer had to murder alot of japs just for that one episode in all of them geting thier freedom from the tyrants. They'were fighting for what they want deep down in their hearts and same goes for the 98th king of Britania. One belives ''war and politcs'' is a total waste of meangless stuff and others think saving ones you love is important and etc. When Lelouch wanted to overtake Britania he then decide to be the villian in the final 4-5 episode of the freaking show and the Black Knights decide to join up the Chinse federation and with ofcourse the older brother of Lulu (whoms name is hard to spell). They became the good guys and yet the prince still wanted to be real treat. Charlels Zi Britania wanted to bring back the died and using war to collect the souls he need is kinda meh since you could of just used your geass from the start to prevent anyone from being evil and his whole speeach about ''ALL MEN NOT BEING EQUAL'' is kinda right and someways wrong. Sword of Akasha and the Ragnarok connection were his olny way, still he lose to Lulu. Geremiah Gotwald was intersthing and not cringe worth i'd say. The whole ''Orange gag'' made my dad and was kinda funny. Suddenly, he was the emporers's body for during night lady marian was killed and yet he only served her.\\n\r\nI could of expect a bit more from the cast and yet this was all get got...Or at least had personality and were somewhat likable.Not to mention about Suzaky being a hypocrite was toally fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe music,background, special effects and etc are A+\\n\\n\r\nBut nah, my fav arcs\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe Black Rebellion arc was literally the best one one - damn, how good was this monstrosity?! But it was so worth it because we are seeing a huge story, one that could\u2019ve easily have been the entire plot of this show even! The show took such a fucking dark turn here, like a lot of those deaths scared me. Even the 2nd one was a good taste for me. The battle on mount whatever it was called got me really in a mood to watch it again. And the final arc was wonderfull. Their Knight Mare Frames fitting one another and the animation had me really shaking hyper.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the things i hate about the show.\\n\\n\r\n1. Mao's stupid arc whom i never liket and was a total meh arc.\\n\r\n2. The fanservice was alright, i know Kallen was a total eye candy in the first half of the R1 since most of her shower scene end up being gags to make us she her butt lol\\n\r\n3. I hate how in during the 1 season any of the pure bloods wanted to date thier borther and sister whom are born from other mother even tho their father is on big asshole. Lulu wanted to marry Euphi or Sherly wants to live togerther with her dad was total cringe moment for me.Not kidding. WHO THE ACTUALL FUCK WANTS TO MARRY SOMEONE WITH THE SAME BLOOD AS YOU- INCEST IS WRONG\\n\r\n4. Rollo was a total pointless character whom got me bored and totally in a bad mood.\\n\r\n5. Vi 2 in general never seemed to me at all of a treat, due to how poorly got the treatment after the fight at the Geass Order. He piloted the same sit fuck knight as orange boy and still lose to it.\\n\r\n6. The plot holes.\\n\r\n7. Asahina's death was not done right. How? he was killed of by the stupid fleya that could of not bean fired if Shuzaku just left the area.\\n\\n\r\nThis\u2026 this was literally a wonderful anime, I loved almost every second of it. It's messeage about war, politics and terrosim got my head really smarter.THIS was the anime I got that from. THIS was the one that tugged at my heartstrings. THIS was the one that had me bawling over characters I grew attached to over the course of the show. THIS was the one I cared when characters were in life and death situations. THIS was the one that didn\u2019t take me over a year because I was so bored. HELL, I was never bored watching this - never felt like a chore. It was entertainment through and through. Unlike other animes whom i've struggles to compleate. This one made me fell like a real person to see the real work.\\n\\n\r\nSolid 10/10 from me, y\u2019all should watch it\u2026 yall probably HAVE watched it already cuz I am slow when it comes to shit xD",

            "content": "The first season of Code Geass ended on one of the all-time great cliffhangers, a shocking moment of revelation that concluded the series and left the viewers dying for more. If you haven't seen the first season of Code Geass, I recommend that you stop reading this review, and go watch the first season right now. Code Geass is one of my personal favorite anime ever, and Code Geass R2 is one of the most fabulous sequel of any anime ever. The ending of the first season of Code Geass gave a very wide idea of choices for a next season and Code Geass R2delivered, especially at the very end. Allow me to explain:\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 continues the tale of Lelouch Lamperouge Vi Britannia and his crusade to exact revenge upon his father, destroy the rotten world, and create a new, better world where people will no longer fight but live in peace, and help people finally move into the future instead of clinging onto the past. I won't go too much into the plot, since it'll be hard to not spoil anything, so basically the coup d'\u00e9tat by the Black Knights, led by the protagonist, Lelouch vi Britannia, ended in failure and resulted in Lelouch's capture and brainwashing. Since then, the coup has been referred to as the Black Rebellion. But once C.C returns Lelouch's memory, Lelouch once again sets out to find Nunnally, destroy the world, and create a better world; crashing into new obstacles, learning new things and seeing the world/people with a whole new perspective. It\u2019s quite confusing and disappointing when Code Geass R2 opens with Lelouch back in school, the Black Knights uprising months in the past and life apparently returned completely to normal. So many questions are raised by what happened: Why does Lelouch suddenly have a brother instead of a sister? How was the Black Rebellion defeated? What became of Suzaku, Kallen and all the other players? Code Geass brilliantly, slowly unravels these thrilling mysteries (All things are answered). It\u2019s also a fantastic piece of storytelling, catching the viewer completely off guard and immediately sucking us back in. Code Geass R2 notably expands the scope of the show, both geographically but also narratively. New antagonists emerge; Lelouch\u2019s elder brother Schniezel Vi Britannia, who wanted to create an untouchable nuclear battle station and nuke several major cities around the world (show power) then nuke any other areas where mass violence is breaking out in the hope that by having a monopoly on violence, people won't fight each other anymore, for fear of retribution. And another antagonist, Lelouch's father, the Emperor Charles vi Britannia. Though he\u2019s been lurking here and there throughout the first season, Charles takes the center stage here as Lelouch\u2019s battle becomes almost a personal conflict against his estranged parent. Overall, Code Geass R2 feels much more epic, and breath-taking than the original, battles where the fate of the entire world, and possibly even beyond, is at stake. But, that's not saying that Code Geass R2 is better than the first season...\\n\\n\r\nThe first season was a ingenious scripted masterpiece where the various characters and plot threads tied together into an immensely satisfying whole. In contrast, Code Geass R2 is sometimes a mess. Plot threads go around everywhere, some satisfyingly resolved, some partially addressed and some simply left in the dust. The show seems unable to settle on any sort of status quo, furiously jumping through characters, settings, arcs, and tones in a breakneck attempt to make sure we never get bored (though we never do). Although there were some great plot twists, and cliffhangers, it seemed as though the writers were rushing and trying too hard to add in confusing, ludicrous twists, some of which work out, others not making any sense. Code Geass R2 goes a bit overboard in being extremely dramatic. Overall, the pacing of Code Geass R2 seemed like it's major flaw, but not so much as to ruin the plot as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters in Code Geass R2, every one of them is done and handled very well. Most of the cast of characters consists of characters from Season 1 (except antagonists I mentioned earlier), and each character\u2019s return is handled with impressive care. Code Geass R2 goes deeply into Lelouch, Suzaku, and especially C.C's past, and delving into the origins/past of the power of Geass in the process. Also, the evolution of each character is very visible and apparent in the series, and another thing that Code Geass does so well is not change or upset the basic fundamentals of its characters while giving them such altering and life changing roles. A very intriguing new character is Lelouch's brother, Rollo who a lot of people hate for understandable reasons, but nobody seems to truly understand him for who he is. \\n\\n\r\n\"To defeat evil, I shall become an even greater evil.\"\\n\r\n\"The only ones who should kill are those who are prepared to be killed.\"\\n\r\n-Lelouch Vi Britannia\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to take a paragraph and dedicate it to Lelouch Lamperouge Vi Britannia, one of my \"big 3\" (top 3 favorite character along with Light Yagami and Johan Liebert). Why is Lelouch such an intriguing and glorious character? First, Lelouch Lamperouge views the world in disgust. Human beings lie, betray, and repeat their tragic history that they claim they want to put behind them, but never do. Wars, terrorism are all things that happen in real life, justice systems (governments) vow to get rid of it, but through \"good\" means, nothing ever changes. Every year there are tragic events, shootings, wars. After WW1 the aftermath was so devastating that everyone vowed never to have another war like that, but a couple years later storms in WW2, which was even more severe. How repulsive. Therefore Lelouch, willing to sacrifice his life, and his happiness for the benefit of others/the world, wears a mask becomes an evil greater than evil itself, and leads \"the people\" to a new era, an era where countries can gather for an exchange of hearts, and the world will finally be at peace. Despite his cruel upfront attitudes and orders, behind the scenes, Lelouch is a tragically scarred teenager who wants nothing than to live in peace with his friends and sister, but cannot for the sake of the rest of the world. Sure Lelouch uses his geass power on others, but was it for selfish reasons like most people would use it for? No. He used his power for others, for the benefit of the rest of the world. You would think that people would leap at a chance to get rid of problems/sin, but no. In reality people just want relief, not a cure; as long as people themselves aren't affected, they don't truly care about what happens to other people across the world despite claiming that they do. Equity? Fairness? In this world, people claim that people are equal, but even today inequity is among the people. Rich people have more power over commoners, they bribe the government into doing things their way... How pathetically our world revolves around. \\n\\n\r\n\"If strength is justice, is powerlessness a crime?\"\\n\\n\r\nLelouch on the other-hand believes that all men are created equal, and that the weak, the strong, they are all the same human beings. Lelouch is a true hero (he follows the 4 stages of a hero in mythology as well). Out in public he centers the hatred of the world upon himself, creating others to unite in order to overthrow him, and behind the scenes he is the people's hero, who protects the innocent. And then in the end... He is the true messiah who saved/changed the world. After being abandoned by his family, losing his sister, seeing his true friends get hurt/die, being scarred by the distrust/betrayal of his others, and having to sacrifice his happiness for eternity, and yet still managing to find the strength and willpower to achieve his deep dream; truly a tragic hero. All Hail Lelouch Lamperouge Vi Britannia. \\n\\n\r\nOn the Artistic side, Code Geass R2 was impressive and outstanding to say the least. Clamp once again provides it\u2019s impressive character designs, and Sunrise does exceptionally well with their area of expertise, mecha designs. The mech battles, the action, the animation are all exceedingly well done. Code Geass, which first started in 2006, puts most anime being made currently to shame not only in plot and enjoyment level, but also in art designs. The addition of religious/color symbolism in Code Geass' animation is certainly an interesting add to look out for. Props to Sunrise for a job well done in the animation department. Everything in the show, from the animation or artistic side is near perfect.\\n\r\nSound in Code Geass is up there in the music heavens of anime. Having multiple breathtaking osts, Code Geass' already emotional, and epic scenes improve to even higher grounds with the fantastic music that sets the mood for each scene. The use of each ost at each part of the anime was on-point. In addition to the osts, the openings and endings for Code Geass were a treat to listen to everytime an episode begins and ends. Simply fabulous. The song that plays at the very end of Code Geass alongside arguably my favorite moment in anime history will always be a part of my heart/memory and I will tear up whenever I listen to it. The voicing in Code Geass was amazing too, both Sub and Dub. Although Jun Fukuyama's voice was a bit too deep, and adult-like for a teenager like Lelouch, the charisma was there. As for the other characters like Suzaku, C.C, Schniezel, and Kallen, I had absolutely no complaint. The dub version of Code Geass is one of few anime that I believe was nothing short of spectacular, and could arguably be just as good, if not better than the sub which itself was amazing as well. Lelouch's dubbed voice by Johnny Yong Bosch fit Lelouch so well that it's scary. All in all, the overall sound in code geass deserves a perfect 10/10, no question.\\n\\n\r\nA theme in Code Geass:\\n\\n\r\n(SPOILERS, SKIP IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE ANIME)\\n\\n\r\nUnmasking, literal or figurative, is a recurring theme in Code Geass:\\n\r\n- Zero's mask falling off for Shirley and Villetta to see.\\n\r\n- Toudou cutting the Lancelot's cockpit, exposing Suzaku inside.\\n\r\n- Suzaku breaking Zero's mask with a bullet, exposing Lelouch to himself and Kallen.\\n\r\n- Explicitly referenced (represented by actual masks falling off people's faces) in - Shirley's nightmares when her memories return.\\n\r\n- Schneizel exposing the truth about Zero and Geass to the Black Knights.\\n\r\n- Culminating in Charles's Instrumentality plan.\\n\r\n- Finally, in the epilogue, Kallen abandons her Ill Girl persona when she returns to Ashford academy.\\n\\n\r\n(END OF SPOILERS)\\n\\n\r\nCharles wants to \"remove all masks from the world\", exposing people's true selves to each other. By force. Although Lelouch objects for different (and perfectly understandable) reasons, at this point, we might be meant to remember Mao, who used to do the exact same thing Charles wanted to do, just on a per-person basis rather than the world scale. Which only further emphasizes how horrible the idea would be in practice. Who are we truly deep within ourselves, and why must we conceal our true identity? Are we afraid that once others know who we truly are that they'll never accept us for who we are? Or are we just evil? What is our true identity anyways, how do we know?\\n\\n\r\nDo you believe that the world is regressing and that human beings aren't being able to move on into the future? If so, how would you change it or perhaps make the world better? The repeating history of mankind: greed/lust for power, wanting to change the world to fit what one person believes is right, resulting in wars that lead to deaths of millions, economy crises that destroy everyday life for people, fear consuming the world, trust/alliances being broken, and inequity/injustice in society. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its few story pacing, and unexplained plot-holes problems, Code Geass R2 continues where Code Geass left off, and never stops being an absolutely top-notch piece of writing and entertainment. At the end of the day, Code Geass R2 stands in the hall of fame as one of the best anime to date. If you haven't seen the first season of Code Geass, I have no idea why you're reading this still, go watch the first season... And if you've seen the first season of Code Geass and enjoyed it, then definitely watch Code Geass R2, it will not disappoint. The ending to Code Geass is probably my favorite ending up to date in an anime ever.",

            "content": "Wow.... where do I begin with this. This show honestly exceeded my expectations with every \r\nepisode. Each episode is jam packed with action, plot twists, and excellent writing. When you think you know whats gonna happen, this show diverts expectations in the best possible way. I'm not even gonna go into the philosophical and idealist ideas that this show provides. The basis of this show in my opinion is truly what ideals the characters think is right for peace. And as the series progresses we see each character question their ideals and it creates a tension that carried through each episode. And these opposing idealsthat create these wars are what shows like this should be. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms in art this show is great. Even for its age, the animation is fantastic and all of the fight scenes are done well. In sound, I loved the OST but the openings could've been better. I loved Colors by FLOW from the first season and also OP 5 was great but that was about it. \\n\\n\r\nBut what this show truly exceeds expectations is. the. characters. Like honestly theres a reason why Lelouch is the most favorited character on this site. His conviction and strategic prowess in the show is truly what made this show put me on the edge on my seat. I loved the concept that the characters on the show put on \"masks\" in order to create identities for themselves. It is a big debate whether Lelouch is a villain or good. But I think this is a false argument because no one in life is simply good or bad. Even though he does morally bad acts, he always does it for others which is shown in the last scene of the show. Besides Lelouch (because honestly I can write a 10 page essay on this man) I enjoyed the other characters on the show. C.C is sort of like guardian angel for Lelouch. I enjoyed her interactions with him and it seemed by the end they are more then just partners. I'm sort of torn on Suzaku. Initially a rival for Lelouch, he gets lost in his ideals but is able to redeem himself by the end by becoming the mask of Zero. His sense of morality is very jaded as even though he criticizes Lelouch for doing immoral acts, he has done the same which fits the theme of the show. Kallen was one of my favorites as her fights were always dope.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a banger anime. 10/10. Thought provoking anime like these are reason I watch anime. This show pretty much checked all the boxes for me. We get compelling characters, great action, actual suspense, and overall great story. What more do you want?",

This should be a must-watch for every anime lover!\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass - Hangyaku no Lelouch R2 / Code Geass - Lelouch of the Rebellion R2, is the sequel for the first season of Code Geass who was left as a cliffhanger, it starts off with our main character Lelouch Lamperouge living his normal life, in Ashford Academy with his friends...but there is no Nunally to be seen, and there is a little brother?! Rolo Lamperouge, a very jealous individual who would kill for his brother, a Geass user and a secret agent sent to monitor Lelouch actions and ensure his memory isn't back. [Charles vi Brittania had used his own Geass to erase Lelouch's memories after the events of the last episode of the first season of CG]\\n\\n\r\nOnce he regains his memories, Lelouch strives to change the world yet again to make this a better world for his crippled and blind young sister Nunally by defeating the rotten Britannia under the alias of Zero the commander of the Black Knights with his very resourceful tactis and Batman-esque gambits.\\n\\n\r\nThe story proceed to roll on in a similar way to Code Geass S1, with the addition of new characters and old, their development and the ever so magnificent plot twists and deaths... Like Lelouch becoming enemy with Nunally as she is 87th in line of sucession to the Britannian Throne, deciding to resume the Special Administrative Zone of Japan of Euphemia vi Britannia. Lelouch falls in deep despair after knowing about this and attempts to drug him self with Refrain. He proceeds to take the whole Britannia Empire, including his father, the spirit of his mother and many other princes, the fearful F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead, and even \"befriending\" Suzaku at the very end, thus nominating him Knight of Zero (a very nice word-play if I might say), all for the plan of Zero Requiem.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the series are pretty good, taking in count when it was made, it's also very fluid, there are barely any negative claims I can make here. Also I haven't seen many of Sunrise animes so I can't judge them fully.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound overall is pretty damn good as well, ranging from great seiyuu's to great soundtracks, I personally didn't fancy the openings and endings of this season, but that's me,  my only regret about sound is that they didn't use Colors by Flow in the very ending of Episode 25.\\n\\n\r\nLelouch is the definition of a martyr, if I've ever seen one,  he suffers through so much tragedy, losing his best friends, his memories, his army, his family... even his life just for the sake of the peaceful world.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\nThis is directed to all the Lelouch fans out there that want to believe he lived on, related to the bittersweet and ambiguous ending of Episode 25, it is possible that Lelouch is still alive, due to the fact that Nunnaly saw visions when she touched Lelouch's body, such thing happens when you touch someone who has the Code, and that C.C. smiled by the end of the episode, referent to an earlier episode when Lelouch promised he would be back to C.C. thus making her smile.",

            "content": "I want to start off saying that i realize there are already over 40 reviews for season 2 of Code Geass and  that many people already have their own opinion about this anime.  But I feel that this anime is so well made that I just had to post something up for it.\r\nStory:\r\n     The story within the second season of Code Geass is quite complex and very dynamic.  From rebellions to finding out truths about things you would believe otherwise, you are always placed in a position where you are urged to keep watching to see what happensto Lelouche or what he will do next.  This concludes to a very dramatic ending for Lelouche, which i hear many people dabating over what happens to Lelouche after that incident.  Although some people didn't like the ending, i think it was very appropriate considering what Lelouche wanted and how the managed to obtain it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n     The artwork is well done and up to par with most anime we see today.  I have yet to see the manga of Code Geass so i can't make any good comparisons to how well or appropriate the characters were made accoding to their concept models.  Anyway, there shouldn't be disappointment with the color, shading, and rendering of the characters to the backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n     Honestly, I have just finished watching episode 25, so the ending music, Continued Story, is still in my head.  With that, i think the sound quality is well made and give the feeling of an everlasting story that you can keep watching, even though the season is done.  Basically, the music quite beautiful made and fits well int this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n     Many of the characters were introduced and developed during season 1, so i don't much to say here.  The continuing development of Lelouche and friends are constant and never disappointing, and the revelations made especially with Lelouche's parents are eye opening.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\n     Overall Code Geass is an amazing anime with a world rich of information and progress.  Not many animes out there have such a well thought out story and development.  Needless to say, this anime will draw you in, such as it left me with tears at the end of episode 25.",

            "content": "NOTE: THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SERIES - THIS REVIEW IS MAINLY TO RECORD MY THOUGHTS ON THE STUFF THAT BOTHERED ME WHILE WATCHING - DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE SHOW ALREADY\r\nI'm grouping this with R1, as I see them as essentially 1 series (nothing is resolved in the first season). The main problems I had with this series were the weak character motivations as well as the huge number of contrivances and plot \"dead ends\", where something seems to be developing only to be pushed aside as the story continues. I think the main problem was that this seriestried to do too many things at once, and as a result was extremely hard to follow with an analytic approach. I often had to rewatch episodes in an attempt to understand the underlying conflict and relationships between the characters, especially with the individual character motivations all over the place. I think this probably comes from the huge-ass character list and the fact that there was not enough time to develop most of these characters in any meaningful way\\n\r\nFurthermore, the pacing of the series was honestly terrible, with the main focus of the series set up by the first season only receiving 1 episode of resolution, with almost no explanation given. What really was the ragnorok connection and it's connection to C.C. and the geass power?  \\n\r\nEssentially, it took a huge amount of effort to go along with the unbelievable actions of the characters with a disproportionate payoff at the end (explanation and resolution). In my opinion, a series shouldn't require you to know information in future episodes to even be able to create a frame of reference in which the character's actions make sense. \\n\r\nHowever, I won't deny that this series was extremely fun and exciting to watch anyways (if I ignore all the questions and small plotholes throughout the series). I think the highlights of this series were the plot twists (my favorite two moments were the juxtaposition of the two S.A.Z of Nippon episodes involving both the massacre and the exile), and the interesting usages of Lelouch's geass in his his tricks and manipulations of people. Although I was disappointed by the resolution of many of the plotlines, I think the ending was the perfect resolution to the series as a whole. I would still recommend this series to most people as long as they don't try to analyze and make connections between everything while watching as I tried to do (even now I'm trying to stop myself from continuing the review and analysis of the decisions of the characters because I know I will just ruin the series for myself).",

Complete character 180s, plot-holes, plot conveniences, loop-holes, ass-pulls and the most overrated second season of any anime I've seen to date (but not the worst that honor goes to Haruhi). That's what Code Geass R2 is. It is a complete disappointment for any fans of the first season (even though the first wasn't a masterpiece and is still overrated). \r\nSuzaku sucks even more. Lelouch still has a sister complex, but manages to be even dumber, Rolo is one of the most useless characters I have seen ever and the plot turned into a complete mess. Plus, the useless fanservice doubled, but with less nudity (  :'-[   ). \\n\r\nI know this is a pretty controversial point of view (like my Tokyo Ghoul review), but I still think it's the most valid point of view based on critical thinking. \\n\\n\r\nIs the show bad? Not really, but highly overrated. It's a fun watch if you are not too critical, but for me it killed my braincells way too much.\\n\\n\r\nWant a better antihero? Watch Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nWant a better Mecha? Watch NGE , Tenpen Toppa Fuck Logic Up the Ass (Gurren Lagann great show) or Gundam.\\n\\n\r\nWant a better terrorist show?

            "content": "And so I conclude my journey with this marvelous show. The second season of Code Geass takes up much of the strengths and the few weaknesses of its predecessor, and overall manages to captivate me, the viewer, once again.\r\nAs the show continues from the incredibly tense cliffhanger the first season provided us with, the plot doesn't take long in ramping up the stakes once again, after introducing us to the new circumstances of our MC and how the plot now, yet again, revolves around him.\r\nMuch of the flaws in this season are eerily similar to its predecessor, which in turn means that there aren't reallythat many flaws worth mentioning. In general the choices made by the various characters are a lot more coherent, and you can understand the sentiment behind most choices fairly easily. There is still an apparent power-loop when we're talking about the weapons utilized in the show, but this can generally be glossed over, and doesn't necessarily impact the story in any bad way.\\n\\n\r\nYou could argue that a certain explanation of power and events that took place during the entirety of the show was overly abstract. I personally feel as if there was no other way to properly explain it all in a realistic manner, and although I don't necessarily feel much for it, I certainly don't despise it. I think the show managed to handle the conceptual terms of morality and ambiguity quite well, even if you have to pay very close attention to follow what was going on during this segment.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fairly similar, and although there are new introductions, most of the cast is present yet again. Character development does steadily continue, but most characters seemed to have reach a set point where they adhere to their ideals and principles, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Especially since the story continues to put more pressure on everything and everyone, and seeing these ideals crack or survive by means of a pyrrhic victory is a wondrous experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe story progresses, the plotlines are moving, all is happening at a rapid pace that seems to be going faster and faster. Roads are ended and points of no return are entered as the final few episodes slowly drift towards the pinnacle of endings that I've had the pleasure of encountering in any show I've ever watched. Where the first season ended at a high note, the second season delivers us viewers with one of the finest, most coherent, and utterly satisfying endings that I've witnessed.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this is one of the finest shows I've had the pleasure of experiencing. There is so much worthy of praise here, be it the soundtrack that keeps delivering, the character cast, the plotlines and that marvel of an ending. If you've enjoyed the first season of Code Geass, then there's no doubt in my mind you'll enjoy this one even more. A true masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for your time, dear valued reader, and hopefully you enjoyed my written experiences concerning \"Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2\".\\n\\n",

            "content": "I had very high hopes that the sequel of CG will be a lot better than the 1st Season because of the praise and the insane amount of perfect 10's. Now that I have finished it........let's just say, this season didn't live up to the greatness and perfection that the 1st Season had. \r\n[Story]: (8/10)\r\nA year has passed since \"The Black Rebellion\" and the remaining Black Knights have vanished into the shadows. Their leader, Zero, has now been executed by the Britannian Empire. Life is now back to normal in Area 11. One day, a student skipped his classes in Ashford Academy and sneaked out.In the shadow, several forces are watching him from a distance. Who is this student?\\n\\n\r\nWhat the hell happened with the story? How can they mess it up? I'm exaggerating, the story is not a complete mess but it's definitely inferior compared to the 1st season.  The first episode started out nicely, Lelouch figuring out that his memories has been wiped and C2 coming to the rescue. By the second episode, everything has been answered and now the show starts to crank to high gear with it's supposed \"epic\" storyline. That's what I believed when I started watching the first 4 episodes. After the 4th episode, I started noticing something wrong with CG R2. I asked myself, aren't they going a bit too fast with the storytelling? Here folks is one of the reasons why I thought R2 is not a masterpiece. The story pacing. The pacing was so perfect in the first season but the pacing here is absolutely messed up. They started throwing more and more plot points at a ridiculously rushed pace.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, some of the plot points were useless and did not affect the overall plot. The arc that is mostly guilty about this is the \"Chinese Federation\" arc. By simply skipping this arc, the overall plot of CG R2 will not be greatly affected. So can I freely say that this arc is a filler? That's for you to decide.  Another arc I had an issue with is the \"Geass\" arc. I'm probably the only guy here who found this arc dumb and disappointing as hell. The origins of Geass is poorly explained and involving \"God\" in this arc is just....What does Charles killing God have anything to do with all of this? Another issue I found is some of the subplot points are not even fully resolves. If you watched the arcs in the middle of the series then you'll know what I'm talking about\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the show has a lot of plot holes. Maybe they were answered at some point of the show but I guess I didn't catch the answers. Some plot holes are:  The mystery of Geass, V2's \"immortality\" but he somehow died, Charles and his immortality, where the hell did the Geass come from?, etc. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all theses flaws, the show still had a good story but not a very great one when compared to the first season storytelling. The show also had great plot twists at the end of every episode that makes me want to watch more episodes. \\n\r\nIn short, the first 20 episodes were meh or decent, the last 5 episode suddenly became great and the ending is also a great one. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe Animation is a lot better compared to the first season and the mech designs are more beautiful. Even the Lancelot. The mechas that the Knights of the Round uses is also beautiful. There is one problem still. Those damn ass-shots, otherwise known as fanservice. Why are the cameras angled in such a way that Kallen's ass is being shown, C2's positions, and etc. The character design is pretty much the same and while I found the character design to be an issue in R1, I pretty much got used to it here. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, in my opinion, is a lot better compared to the first season. The background themes are also a lot better especially the battle themes that are playing during the mech fighting scenes. The first OP theme song is  \"02~O-Two~\" by Orange Range and the 2nd OP theme song is \"WORLD END\" by FLOW. The 1st ED theme song is \"Shiawase Neiro\" by Orange Range \\n\r\nand the 2nd ED theme song is  \"Waga Routashi Aku no Hana by ALI PROJECT\\n\\n\r\nNow my opinions on the OP and ED theme songs. The 1st OP sounds decent but it too annoying real fast. The 2nd OP however, sounds a lot better. The 2nd OP is now going to my \"Favourite OP\" list. The 1st ED theme song sounds great and the 2nd ED theme song sucked ass. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the show in English Dub so I'm going to review the English VA. They all did a great job, in my opinion, and Suzaku's voice sounds a lot better. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9/10)\\n\r\nWhile the second season didn't live up to the story, the characters sure did. Well, most of them did. Most of the characters, again, were fully developed and written well. The Suzaku and Lelouch dynamic is still at its best and did not disappoint me. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the new characters were great and some of them aren't. Some people hated Rolo and some people, like me, don't. I mean, I don't love his character but his character and his personality is enough to make me not hate him. Some of the Knight of the Rounds characters didn't get a lot of screentime. Some of them only appeared for one episode and some of them appeared for at least 2-3 episodes but that's it. They should have gotten more development and gave Anya's character some more explanation because I found her character, and her past interesting. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8/10)\\n\r\nIf it wasn't for the pacing then I could have fully enjoyed the second season a helluva lot more than the first season but I just didn't enjoy it as much as I did watching the first season. The show is packed with mecha fighting scenes, interesting strategies, Lelouch, and interesting plot twists that still made me enjoy this show. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Overall]: (8.2/10)\\n\r\nLet's be real here, I don't know why the second season is packed with perfect scores. It's probably the fanboys or the fact that they can't see the flaws that the second season had. The show did have a good story, I gotta give them that, but the horrible pacing, filler-ish arc, and nonsensical \"Geass\" arc is what prevented this show from being a masterpiece. The excessive fanservice is also what prevented this from being a masterpiece. If you loved the first season like I did then don't expect it to be better than R1 because it's not. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Good Story\\n\r\n+Great Animation\\n\r\n+Outstanding Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Great Characters\\n\r\n+Perfect Plot Twists\\n\r\n+Lelouch still remains to be one of the best protagonist for this show\\n\r\n+One of the best endings I've seen in CG\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Pacing issues\\n\r\n-Some plot points are not resolved\\n\r\n-Nonsensical \"Geass\" arc\\n\r\n-Filler-ish \"Chinese Federation\" arc\\n\r\n-Plot Holes\\n\r\n-Excessive Fanservice",

            "content": "What makes Code Geass so popular? Is it the captivating visuals, the stunning plot twists, the bombastic dialogue, the epic scope of the world itself? Could it be the character interaction, the political drama, possibly the dynamic nature of the main character himself? It's a mystery why this anime appeals to so many people until you really delve into the juicy details of this wonderful story that combines hardcore fighting and action and stark reality of life to how the human condition works throughout it all.\r\nStarting off slow, the anime seems not to pick up with the first season. I had a real \"wtf\" momentfor awhile; was I watching the same show? This was not Code Geass as I had known before. But as always, the story became surprisingly fast-paced and bitter; the story progressed in such a way that one can compare it to ripples in a pond - as the story went on, the ripples of the characters' actions affected future events at an increasingly dangerous pace. I won't reveal the story; the synopsis is enough. However, there's enough for everyone - the action, the side-story romances, and the sub-plots of various characters. Interestingly enough, the sub-plots actually tied in with the main story; though they did provide background information for said character, those side stories later impacted the main story line with enough force for attention. Lelouch again shows his brilliant military and chess mind, acting with accordance, showing he's always three or four steps in front of his opponents. In season one, he seemed to roll over most of his opponents mercilessly; there were exceptions, but he seemed to have it too easy. However, he really meets his match again and again, striving with all his heart and mind to overcome the seemingly impossible barriers before him.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful; the effects, stunning; the fast-paced heart-stopping action sequences, amazing. So much effort was put into the art, it was hard not to wander and admire the various environments the characters were in. There was never a real permanent setting, either, which meant more gorgeous artwork and camera-panning vistas that left one on the imaginary precipice of breathlessness. The action was longer and more profound; the mecha scenes were really something. While the fighting was taking place, the characters shouted at each other, making the battle seem more life-like and less autonomous and machine-oriented. The weapons, also, were fantastically different. Every special mecha had a unique weapon or capability, and the various characters each had their speciality. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the epic dialogue to the dramatic OP and ED, the sound never failed to impress me. The OP wormed its way onto my ipod, and the ED I never failed to watch. The artwork here was also beautiful; the OP was always dramatic and fast-paced, underlying the real mood of the story. The ED was almost melancholy and mournful. The dialogue was astounding; the characters really showed who they were through their mouths; every conversation was important, and usually pretty darn dramatic and dark. When fighting, when thinking, when alone - the characters had such a great way of expressing themselves, their beliefs, and from that, we, as an audience, could discern their real personalities. \\n\\n\r\nAhhhhh, what is a movie or TV show without it's characters? Just an empty husk or shell. The characters were the icing on the cake, the concrete foundation of a skyscraper, the anchor of a battleship. Without these characters, the cake would not taste as good, the building would crumble, the battleship overturned in the stormy seas. Lelouch was epic as ever, trying to balance his ambitions and aspirations with personal problems and liabilities. It's one vs the majority; and he's in for a bumpy ride. Suzaku morphed several times during the show, exhibiting surprising unheard of characteristics and a dark, brooding past that weighs on his soul. I would put Kallen as the next main character - she is has an interesting relationship with Lelouch, the Black Knights, the school friends, and Suzaku. She continually is portrayed as solid, with a mostly unshakable, hard-headed mind. C.C. is very, very important; mysterious, as always, her past and motivations seen are revealed...for better or for worse....\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was impressed and completely satisfied with this masterpiece of an anime. Is there really any more to ask for? The producers of the show put everything that was needed. However, several times the key moments of the show seemed hurried or hasty; but that's about the only negative thing I have to say. The storyline was epic, the art staggering, the characters awesomely portrayed. The flaws were too few to be named, the benefits too many to be mentioned. Remember: a Geass is two-faced.",

            "content": "\"Code geass\" The only literal anime to define the word \"Greatness\" It's an outstanding anime focused around an outstanding main character, who is probably the most HUMAN character ever to be created in fiction. The character development is almost Orgasmic. Love him, Hate him. Whichever side you choose, you can't help but be mesmerized by the story's plot. The main character  \"Lelouch lamperouge\" who later on goes by the name \"Lelouch VI Britannia\" is without a doubt, one of the greatest characters of all time who strives to make the world a better place, for the sake of his physically challenged sister who meansthe world to him. The amount of trails and hardships he had to endure to make this dream a reality is spectacular. He's not your typical generic shounen main characters who pull off the impossible with their Nakama power-ups. But a normal character who acts like a normal human being. He does both good things and things that can be assumed to be bad, depending on the situation. Despite losing almost everything and everyone he cared for. He was able to give not only to his sister, but to the entire world it's \"Future\". \\n\r\nIf you haven't watched the series yet, I would highly recommend it. It's a must watch series that's probably my all time fave series. I'm pretty sure you'll find it worth it aswell. Season 1 can have a slow start but season 2 eventually makes up for it. The song tracks are amazing as well.\\n\r\nOverall score based on every aspect - 10/10",

            "content": "Code Geass R2, the sequel to the first season, is a flawed, yet addicting anime with a wide array of characters and a complex/sometimes-confusing plot. Personally, R2 is one of my favorite anime, but it wasn't as strong and solid as the first season was. However; it still offers a lot to the plate.\r\nThe major flaw I see with the second season is its pacing, most of the time so much is going on that it's hard to understand, and it may need a re-watch. That was the case more often than so; it only dragged in a few areas. Another notable flaw is thatthere's such a HUGE cast of characters, many do not get the development they should. Some main characters were kinda left out for parts of the story, or they were ignored. However I do think Lelouch, C.C., and Suzaku had excellent development throughout the show. Also, compared to its first-season counterpart, the tactics and intelligence displayed aren't as strong. With all the upgraded Knightmares, it was more of a who had the best knightmare. Another negative, though not as notable, is the fanservice. For me I can just ignore it, but sometimes it gets a little too much. Not a huge negative, but noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flip side, R2 is just as if not more entertaining than the first season. Abundant plot twists, epic battles, character's spouting morals at eachother, you get the idea. Sometimes though the plot twists can get a little ridiculous. It all depends on your suspension of disbelief, though; and I can tolerate most of the show's antics. The opening songs are great, the ending songs are just okay. I love the soundtrack, it's very strong and fits well with the different moments, I liked the new BGM they added. Another positive point is the animation and art very crisp and bright, and they fit well with the show. The 3 main characters, and Kallen to some extent, are one of the best things about this show to me. Lelouch is my favorite male anime character, and C.C. is up there as well. Although the storyline suffered from pacing issues, it was still a great ride, I definitely didn't regret watching it. You just have to loosen yourself up and enjoy yourself. Also, the ending was brilliant. Definitely a plus.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you liked the first season, you should definitely try R2 out, I think it'll be worth your time. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This is a GREAT second season to the outstanding anime code geass. This has as much action as the first season. At first I was thinking it might not be as good, but this was just AWESOME!!!!! The first episode was pretty much a bore, but it got better soon after. The action started coming in and the was so many plot twists. I really LOVED it. \r\nStory: Lelouch starts out with forgeting everything. It was a big suprise. But then it develped and became interesting. The plot thickened and the part about Suzuka and Lelouch was great. There are many characters from the firstseason as well. I absolutely LOVED the ending. I even cried! This is a must see show. But watch the first season first.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It was great. The details were great. I loved how everyone looked, when they were angry, dying, or happy. The color was done magnificently. It was all really beautifully drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was great. The sound effects when there was murder, crowds cheering, or just background noise, was all well done. The sound made the whole anime set its mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I think all the characters are great. The new characters, I LOVED their personalities. And the old characters, their personalities never changed. It was really good. The new characters were well put along with the story. The old characters played many rolls that were more important than what they were in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well there isn't much to say. I enjoyed it a lot. And I'm sure you'll enjoy it too. I LOVED the action, the plot twists, the unexpected moments, and the bloody gorey stuff. They all made the season more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: My overall score is 10 because I thought everything was well done. EVERYTHING. The pictures were great. The sound effects were awesome. The plot was just out of this world. If I could I would give it a 100 out of 100. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this helped. I tried not to add spoilers, but there may be some.",

            "content": "Important: Forgive my english please. As a french person, it's not always very easy.\r\nAfter a review on Seed Destiny without covering Seed itself, I thought that a review on Code Geass R2 will be suitable. So here it goes, Code Geass R2 review time.\r\nBTW: Same thing with Seed Destiny, A LOT OF SPOILERS. You don't like this, don't read it.\r\nStory: Let me establish something first. I enjoy this second season, but I do think that it's very overrated. Let's start with the story first. The first two episodes really get me. It was an exciting way to bring the series back. Lelouch losing his memorieswas a big plot-twist right from the beginning. He has a fake brother, a fake life. He's still an intelligent guy, but he seems very calm and vastly happy with his life... and then the Black Knights come to bring their leader back. Right from the beginning, the crew of the show gets you excited about it. This is where I part away from everyone right here. I didn't like all the time wasted on Lelouch spending time to college again, 'cause there's some useless things in there. Not everything is, but a lot of it. And instead of having the Black Knights ready to kick Britannia's ass, the crew of this production decided to waste more time on reforming the Black Knights yet again. I know that I'm one of the few that think like that about that, but you have to face it. Then they initiate the Chinese Federation Arc. And... wow... I was thinking: \"Great job Mister Zero, everyone will follow you now all dress up as you themselves.\" And then what are they doing... not to much. And they introduced the worst Knightmares of all Code Geass: The Shen-Hu, Li's unit. And what an ugly \"K-nightmare\" it is. That's just a little complain about this season. Then... guess what... Lelouch comes back to Japan with Chinese allies, to do what?? To go back to college to fill a stupid episode of him dating all the girls in school. This was just so out of place that I look with a horror look at it. I don't mind a silly show having that kind of episode, but at this point where they were in the show, it was just so bad. Soon after, *MAJOR SPOILER*, Shirley is killed. And although I didn't like her character very much, that was very dramatic to see Lelouch trying to ressurect her with all his power and when you see that it's Rolo, you're kinda pissed. Then Lelouch attacks the Geass secret hideout and brings an end to everything about this odd place. The good stuffs started to came out at that time, but it's still slow. I'm gonna fast-forward through some things in there, but the show really started to get awesome when Lelouch gets rid of his father and his mother. The most amazing part show of the show starts right now: Lelouch becomes the emperor of Britannia. His plan is so awesome that show really grabed me at that point and it was finally time!! Then Lelouch kicks the ass of the rebel forces of Schneizel and the Black Knights (oh I forgot their betrayal towards Lelouch...oups). The world will now be govern by this tyrannical emperor. And then surprise... Suzaku shows up dress up as Zero and stabs Lelouch right into the chest. Lelouch dies and the world is now free from this bastard. If I would rate the show by the last episodes (21-25), I would give it a 10 out of 10. The last part is so freaking amazing!! But going by all what happened during the second season, I give it a 8 out of 10. You can see that I skipped some points of the story, but hey, I don't want you to sit 2 hours to read my review, so for the story a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Ouch... I'll talk about the art from the mecha point of view, since that I think that Clamp's characters design are okay in all. The mecha from this season are ridiculous. What was good about the first season was the fact that the Knightmares were pretty realistic the way they were presented. The ones that were kinda high-performance were Lancelot, Gurren MKII and the most amazing of all the Knightmares out there: the Gawain. The problem with second season is the gundam-gimmicks that they threw in there. In one year, we pass from land-spinner mecha to flying-over-the-water-gundam-seed mecha. Lancelot Albion was pretty much the Strike Freedom of this show. Gurren MKII became a little to ridiculous with a radioactive-hand that can fly by itself, shoot energy radioactive bullets and throwing radioactive-\"beyblade\". The Shen-Hu, like I mentionned earlier, is just so ugly. Tristan wasn't great at all. Mordred was so boring and useless. The Shinkirou was so god-modish is not even funny. All those mechas were \"unoriginal\". The only one that gets out without a scratch from all that s**t that happen is Tohdoh's unit, the Zangetsu, which is still an awesome mecha. Some people were then saying to me that it doesn't make any sense that I didn't like the \"too fast change of design of mecha\" which has been used in Gundam 00 S1 to Gundam 00 S2 and Mobile suit Gundam to Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam. But here's the difference: both Gundam 00 and Zeta Gundam had respectively a 5 years time jump and a 7 years time jump. In the case of Code Geass, they went from land-spinners to wings that shoot energy bullets from it. In one year, the time jump was too short. That's why it doesn't make any sense. So for creating not so great-mechas, but still having good character design, 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Hum... the OST of Code Geass is not bad, but it's far from being an awesome soundtrack. The first opening just scares me out to a point of giving me \"K-nightmares\" (lame joke). The second opening is good bringing back FLOW who also did the first opening from the first season. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Oh boy... a lot of ground to cover in there. Okay... here we go:\\n\\n\r\nLelouch: Not to much say about him. He was still a great character and I enjoyed his last plan. I really like that character in the first season and I still like him. He's not your typical mecha lead character and he was without a doubt the best main character you could have gave to this serie.\\n\\n\r\nSuzaku: Hew!! That character disgusted me in this season. I kinda liked him the first season, 'cause he was a kind guy even know his reason for fighting for Britannia was kinda lame (changing things from the inside... dude... you were a grunt!!). But I just can't stand him in R2. He became a total dick to everyone and he tortured my favorite woman of that show... KALLEN!! How can you do that to that sexy girl, you screw-up boy!!\\n\\n\r\nRolo: Please!!! Kill that guy!!! Kill him with fire!!! Kill him with a knife, a nuke, but something!! Even know he died in the show, they should have killed him the moment he showed his face on screen. They gave him a gentle death!!! A GENTLE DEATH!!! He is probably my most hated guy in the entire anime universe up there with Kouta from Elfen Lied. He should have died from a terrible fall from that building when he was trying to save Lelouch from his fall. Sunrise, Bandai, please!!! Anybody, erase that character forever and ever!!\\n\\n\r\nC.C.: To me, she was still a good character, but it seems she had nothing to do in R2. The only real point for having her was to \"kill\" her, but instead, she lost her memories and they gave them back to her after a few time. She was still funny, but she really had nothing to do.\\n\\n\r\nKallen: I really liked that character in R1 and I still liked her. She still fight for the same reasons, which is great, 'cause it shows how she really wants to put the misery of Japan to an end. My favorite part of all the show has to do with her, when she beats Suzaku when he came to her for apologizing from using Refrain on her. I really enjoyed her and plus, she is the only character that had full-fanservice view.\\n\\n\r\nJeremiah: God I love that character!! He went from an arrogant pilot to a loser-villain to a fail-test-of-Geass to an awesome kickass assassin to a loyal soldier of Lelouch. Who will forgot JEREMIAH IMPACTO!!! Great job Bandai!! This is my favorite character of R2.\\n\\n\r\nQuickly:\\n\r\nLloyd: Still funny. (UTAH!!!)\\n\r\nRivalz: Useless bartender.\\n\r\nNina: DIE!!!!\\n\r\nC\u00e9cile: Great.\\n\r\nSchneizel: Epic fail at the end.\\n\r\nShirley: I didn't like her, but she didn't deserved it...\\n\r\nGuilford: Good God!! That guy cannot die!!\\n\r\nCornelia: I missed her in R2. She brought good things in R1.\\n\r\nDiethard: At the end... POWNED!!!\\n\r\nTohdoh: He went from cool to kinda... lame... I fell sorry for him.\\n\r\nMarianne: Not that gentle in the end.\\n\r\nBismarck: He... failed so hard at the end.\\n\r\nGino: He annoyed me.\\n\r\nLi: Mr. Mysterious-Cough-of-Blood-Disease.\\n\r\nCharles: Wakamoto wasn't so evil in the end.\\n\r\nSo in the end: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even know I said all those bad things about R2, I finished the show in two weeks. So, I think that it's pretty easy to blow up in a short amount of time, but I didn't enjoy R2 as much as I enjoyed R1. All of the above sumarized pretty much where my enjoyment came from. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: My disappointment surely comes from the fact that I was expecting something different from what we got. This is definitely a series that I'm gonna re-watch to make sure that my complains make sense. I might have been to harsh on it, but on the other hand, I think that R2 is so overrated. In the end, it was a good show, but it could have been better in my opinion. Of course, my opinion is not the one from the other, so take my review as a view point and a \"dump\" on this show. Overall: 7/10",

            "content": "The first series of Sunrise's Code Geass was really good. In the first series our protagonist, Lelouch Lamperouge, gained the power to give anyone a command that they had no choice but to obey. He decided to use this power to overthrow the Britannian empire. Japan, now called Area 11 and under Britannian control, became a battleground as he used their resistance as his army. Just when it looked like they might succeed, Lelouch learned that his sister, Nunnally, had been taken prisoner and left the battlefield. This quickly led to things going badly for the rebellion. Meanwhile, his best friend, Suzaku, found out thathe was the terrorist Zero. The previous series ended on a cliffhanger with Suzaku & Lelouch holding guns to one another's heads. What happened to Nunnally, the resistance, Lelouch & Suzaku? Let's find out with Code Geass Hangyaku no Lelouch R2.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nWe open a year after the black knight rebellion. Lelouch thinks about Zero's reported execution and the foolishness of trying to oppose Britannia like he did. Restless, he escapes from school with his younger brother and makes his way to a gambling establishment. While there, some knightmares piloted by remnants of the black knights break in. Lelouch is grabbed by Kallen but manages to escape, eventually becoming separated from his brother. He's found by C.C who restores his true memories, which were altered by the emperor using his own geass. Thanks to C.C's actions, Zero is reborn and ready to regain his army and rekindle the battle against Britannia, but it won't be so easy. The emperor still has Nunnally and there are several people keeping surveillance of him, including his supposed brother. Can Lelouch get past these obstacles and pose a credible threat against the single most powerful nation in the world?\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest narrative issue with this series is that it does retread some of the same material as the first series. The initial uses of Lelouch's power and his first command of troops in particular are very similar. However, we can largely forgive that because it does need to, once again, establish what his geass can do and demonstrate his tactical prowess. The series is also a bit heavy-handed in foreshadowing the big ending moment once it reaches the last four episodes. They might as well have it spelled out in large neon lettering.\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, there are a lot of strong elements to the story. Most of the twists work really well and stem naturally from the events of the narrative instead of coming across as forced and contrived. I also like that the reason they left Lelouch alive actually makes a lot of sense. The ending is strong, even though they make it obvious. The stratagems that Lelouch employs are legitimately clever and I like that his major opponents react intelligently and try to anticipate him, sometimes even derailing his plans. Which is much better than something like, say, Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu where the strategies are so basic that they should be easy to see through, but where that almost never happens because everyone, except the main strategist characters, is an idiot. Then we have the tragic moments. There are some really strong, well done, tragic moments in this series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters we get are really well done. The previously established characters get more development that builds off of where they were in the prior series. Most of the new characters are nicely complex as well, at least the major ones. There are some minor supporting characters who just kind of exist without really having anything to them. The biggest issue is that Villetta's character arc doesn't make much sense, given her previously established characterisation. But that's also only one supporting character.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork looks the same as the first series, as it should. As such, my biggest complaint is still with the emaciated looking character designs. However, the action sequences, mecha designs and visual effects are all really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe performances, as a whole, are really good. Fukuyama Jun, Sakurai Takahiro, Yukana & Koshimizu Ami remain the stand out performances from all the other strong performances. Nazuka Kaori, Mizushima Takahiro & Midorikawa Hikaru are also really good in this series. The series still suffers a bit from actors who use odd tonal qualities that sound more like an exaggerated cartoon than anyone's natural speaking voice. Shiratori Tetsu & Sekine Nobuaki being the most memorable examples.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nNina is still motivated by her strong feelings for Euphemia. We also get to see Sayoko kiss a girl, but she's disguised as a guy at the time so it doesn't really count.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is a great series. Both the first and second series. It has a lot of strong moments, strong characters, great action and superb acting. It's not a flawless series and there are some better ones out there, but if you're into mecha or the idea of a rebellion involving cunning strategies and supernatural powers appeals to you, check it out by all means. My final rating for Code Geass Hangyaku no Lelouch R2, is a solid 8/10. Next week it's another sequel with Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka?, series 2.",

            "content": "Everything works very well, the soundtrack, the voice acting, the animation, the direction, the combats, the dialogues, and even the amoralities.\r\nStory\r\nTo understand the proposal of this work is necessary to have a little prior knowledge about a book The Prince of Niccolo Machiavelli, which is the curriculum base of those who study sociology, politics, anthropology, philosophy, law, among other sands, and more , is bedside book for everyone in power. There is a phrase that is usually attributed to Machiavelli, and even if it is not his, it sums up his work well, \" the ends justify the means.\" It is because of this authorand this book that the expression arose; Machiavellian, providing the best explanation of the philosophical basis governing the real world which is portrayed in the script of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme of anime is objective moral, where to reach its end Lelouch will justify any means, hence the work will portray in the most vile form, which is through death. Where necessary he must kill his friends, kill the family, kill his love, kill his homeland, kill his people, kill his allies, kill millions, kill his feelings, and kill even oneself necessary. And this is made clear in the first episodes of the first season, where the anime uses a dialogue between Lelouch and Suzaku consuming much of an episode, only to explain explicitly to the unwary and most devoid of political and philosophical knowledge. So he leaves no doubt and has no way to argue and say that it was something only suggestive, implicit, or coincidence, because this work is very well thought out, planned and oriented.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not a purely military anime, but it has many battles, and more than weapons wars have psychological battles. Where in these conflicts are presented strategic solutions that may not be original to the real world, but it is for an anime to put the deal of amorality like never before was treated and this is something great. They are tactics devoid of moral precedence, where only the end by itself is morality. All the moments of the strategies were totally satisfactory, since the plans elaborated are based on evidence and information. Regardless, the plans do not always give certain, in several moments it is necessary improvisation, to remake the plan, to delay the conflict, to lose everything, to enter in despair, to betray, to be betrayed and to return to the zero, this is good, therefore humanizes the history and give realism.\\n\\n\r\nThere are innumerable deaths in the anime, where almost all are without return. And with there are deaths and they are very strongly impacting! It also has the false deaths where the anime imply that a certain character may have died what works well as yet another element of the plot that only enriching the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass has practically original features for his proposal, where he manages to squander details and smoothness, combined with a futuristic, mystical, and alternative reality, a necessary trait for an anime that is not restricted to battles. Its colors and lights combine with the strokes being harmonized with a futuristic, mystical, and alternative reality, which is different from a purely military work. The best part is that although the anime is old it is not dated, fruit of its art.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nTo consume of emotions and pleasure is not necessary to watch this anime, just put to play his songs. It is splendorous how they manage to play producing feelings of both sadness and euphoria. Among the countless sensational songs of this anime the most outstanding are Innocent Days, Stories, Continued Story and Madder Sky.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and closings are all very good because of the songs, but the last closing is phenomenal, it's not only because of the instrumental part, that it is wonderful, but the whole. It is the most artistic, symbolic and metaphorical waxing of the work, with attention in the lyrics of the song if see how amoral it is, showing how much the producers have given up and resolved have plunged deep into the theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nComplicated to talk about villains or good guys in this anime, because the anime does not advocate any kind of moral predictions and all within a Western, civilized and Christian morality, are villains in this anime. What have are actually rivals fighting for power and the plot making the viewer hang on to one side.\\n\\n\r\nLelouch, Charles, and Schneizel, none of the three disagree with philosophy, means, or goals, but they are different in something far deeper than all of this, and have to do with vision, past, present, and future. This is fantastic, it is sensational, it is splendid, it is too rich, the author went much further for having given depth that hardly anyone would see this philosophy of anime within the characters, thus being a visionary.\\n\\n\r\nSuzaku shows that it is not at least philosophically contrasting to the Lelouch, it follows the same philosophy as the ends justify the means. Only the medium he takes for himself is different, and despite a shallow logic is not willing to turn back on his way, for he made a great sacrifice. Soon, to adopt the revolutionary path of Lelouch would imply to throw away its own martyrdom, showing layers, depth, and brilliance in giving a new form of being opposition.\\n\\n\r\nCC is so good that even if not being the protagonist won for two years followed in the best female character of animes. She is an enigmatic character and finishes the work with many mysteries of her without being revealed, but much of its past was worked out enough not to feel lack. Another point is when she in certain event becomes fragile, becomes comical and very charismatic.\\n\\n\r\nLeolouch has everything to be hated, but not for being a sucker, but for being bad himself, is a perfect villain, yet he manages to gain charisma by fighting other psychopaths using intelligence and wit. This character is good because it makes the public to lean for a person who would generally be despicable, just a very good anime to be able to do it. The work is sensational exactly because of Lelouch of Machiavellianism in its various moments of psychopathy, which makes the anime intellectually rich.\\n\\n\r\nFinally Code Geass is one of the very rare anime that has a different end for the protagonists, brave and nothing a bit convenient. There are so few who give similar directions to this anime, which counts in the fingers how much there is something like that, let alone those that like, which makes everything even better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nIt is easily possible to find on the internet one of the many videos of people watching the last episode, and the reactions range from hysterical cries to uncontrollable crying crises. The final episode was and is simply the best of all animes.\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly the ending is the most exciting part of the anime, but not the only one. Shirley, Jeremiah, Nunnally, Anya and Rolo are the characters who most succeed after the protagonists, in produce feelings in the people they are watching. several are the remarkable scenes they play and easily make people change their minds about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several spikes of excitement and near the end it is impossible to stop watching. The beginning of the second season is a bit confusing, but it is something deliberate and soon explained, which insists on continuing to watch until the medium that is when the revelations come and the plot will develop more quickly.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point that causes enthusiasm is the evolution of the weapons, all the rivalry to produce, as well as the visual and power presented by them. No this is not an anime of giant robots fighting each other, this is one that uses just that to develop some much more complex and attractive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nDespite everything in this anime that is excellent, the coolest is something that is generally not good, which is a final half open. It was fabulous, then give to formulate at least three possible endings, and hence must be thinking to know which is the true, many theories have been made, were many years of discursion about it.",

            "content": "For those who enjoy a good plot and ending, this is highly recommended series.\r\nThis sequel or rather season 2 of Code Geass was exceptionally looked forward to after a brilliant season 1.  In this season, it patches the loopholes that Season 1 had presented to you, giving you a complete and whole storyline.  Despite having looked forward to it much and the chance of great disappointment for such high expectations, I'm relieved to say that Code Geass has managed to lived up to my expectations.  \r\n----Story----\r\nThe story starts off what appears to disconnected to the season 1 which acts as a surpriseto most viewers, however as this is Code Geass, it turns around giving most viewers an unexpected explanation.  \\n\\n\r\nIt twists and turns and while there were parts where the story had been slow and seemingly somewhat draggy, it makes up for it with the brilliant plans that the main character hatches.  It always catches me off guard to something that seemed hopeless.  Though it fails to hook me onto my seat during this season, nevertheless it never misses its beat making each time that I watch it, enjoy myself to the fullest.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot that seems to be somewhat simplistic in the end turns out to be something not quite as simple as it makes out to be, which makes it quite a bonus.  \\n\\n\r\nEnding wise, it was an incredible ending and it was something totally unexpected.  This series' ending is one of the best I've seen to this date.\\n\\n\r\n----Animation----\\n\\n\r\nSharp pointed chins,  multi- coloured eyes and hair is typical of many anime.  There is nothing special about the characters.  What sets Code Geass' characters apart from other animes, I believe, is the costume design.  The costumes despite them being simple, show thought behind the designs with the tasteful &quot;gold trimmings&quot; and simple colours.  \\n\\n\r\n----Sound----\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this anime is pleasant and enjoyable to listen to off the anime.  It is able to convey the emotions that the anime has tried to although it needs the support of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n----Character----\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass' characters have come a long way from where they started since the beginning of the season.  The characters in this series change and evolve with every trial they meet. This makes the characters feel more realistic and easier to relate to.  I had even found myself feeling sorry for a character that I had originally hated.\\n\\n\r\n----Enjoyment----\\n\\n\r\nI had highly enjoyed watching this series and with the plot that has no loopholes at the end or the ending that seems awesome, there is a great satisfaction in finishing this series.  I find myself re-watching this series over and over again to re-create the pleasure I found watching it.\\n",

            "content": "*This is a review of both seasons of Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion\r\nI\u2019ll start this review by stating that Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion is one of, if not, my favorite anime of all time. This made me extremely hesitant to re-watch this series, partly because I was afraid that the story wouldn\u2019t be as interesting because I\u2019ve already seen all of the plots twists and turns. Also, in part, because I have always held this series in a high regard, and I didn\u2019t want my re-watching of this series to reveal huge flaws that I didn\u2019t see the first time. I\u2019m proudto say that none of my fears were realized, and I enjoyed Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion almost as much as I did the first time around.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion revolves around Lelouch, a crown prince of the Holy Britannian Empire, which controls one-third of the world. After the death of his mother, he is sent to Area 11, formally known as the island of Japan. The actions of his father, as well as the mystery surrounding his mother\u2019s death, leave Lelouch with a deep hatred for the country of Britannia. After a terrorist plot gone wrong, he is blessed with \u201cThe power of kings\u201d known as geass. Using this ability, his genius intellect, and the followers he gathers on the way, he starts a rebellion on the island of Area 11.The story is thrilling, and thoroughly entertaining throughout the series. Everything is being explained as the story progresses, and lead to my favorite anime ending ever.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass has an uncommon animation style, and I think that it works perfectly. My only problem is there are times when I noticed some characters looked awkward. This is especially true for some of the girls in the series. While it works really well a vast majority of the time, sometimes the characters look sort of strange. It also really shines is in the action sequences. The fight scenes between Knightmares (Mechas), all looked fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound might be the weakest point of the series, which is a difficult think for me to say because the first opening is one of my personal favorites. I don\u2019t think any of the openings or endings are bad, I actually think they\u2019re pretty good. The issue is that there are way too many. There are five openings and six endings between the two seasons, which would\u2019ve been fine if they all were excellent. There are some openings and endings that are so much better than the others. I liked those so much I wish they had lasted longer than they did. That aside, the background music used during the episodes was great. The music fit the scenes perfectly. It was epic when it needed to be, and also knew when to slow it down during emotional moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters in the series are varied and deep. They all have unique ideals and motives, which causes conflict throughout the entire series. The characters are portrayed in a way that makes it difficult to determine who exactly is in the right. Even if your ideals are just, do the ends justify the means? Can you truly change anything with out taking huge, and sometimes costly, risks? These are some of the questions the characters are constantly struggling with. Code Geass also does a great job showing the humanity of the characters. There is genuine joy, and happiness, and there are moments of intense rage, and bitter sadness. The main characters in this series are well rounded and developed. Even though we don\u2019t get as much information on the supporting characters, they all play their parts well too. They are unique, and they all add something different to the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion was thrilling from beginning to end. The battles were an amazing mixture of action, strategy and tactics. The characters are varied and interesting. Plus the animation and sound is solid.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict and Breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/5\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4/5\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/5\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/5\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/5\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 5/5 [Not an average of individual scores]\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion is a gripping masterpiece that will have you constantly clinging to the edge of your seat.",

The story is top notch and if it hasn't already should get some kind of award because of how amazing it is! The main thing that I liked about the whole show was the ending, my god was it good, was mind blowing but makes so much sense! The second part explains any questions you had through out the show and leaves you overwhelmed by how amazing it was (Unlike the ending to Death Note)! Myonly problem with the show was that there were way too many Mech fights, i liked them but I felt it got a bit much! However you do learn a lot more about the characters in this part and get to understand them a little more, your opinions of some of the characters will change by doing so.  Throughout watching this anime, including the first half, you will have a major craving for Pizza Hut as it is advertised constantly throughout the show! So in the end, I would give this anime 10/10 and recommend it to anyone who wants to get their minds blown or is a big fan of Mechs!\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Once you've watched the ending, search online for original Japanese ending, it is what I believe to be the true ending, they just edited it out!",

            "content": "*SPOILER ALERT: some parts of this review will spoil things from the first season on Code Geass.\r\nCritic\u2019s Log \u2013 August 10, 2015. Review #97: Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2.\r\nI was listening to Radiohead\u2019s fifth album \u201cAmnesiac\u201d and I only liked a few songs in it. Why do I bring them up, because Britannia has awesome music Wait, what am I talking about? Oh that\u2019s right! Here\u2019s CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2!\r\nOne year has passed since the failure of the Black Rebellion. Britannia has assigned Area 11 to a \"correctional education\" status, where the Japanese people are made an example of bybrute force, to try to prevent any future uprisings and suppress rebellious intentions. Unsuspecting high school student Lelouch, oblivious to his rebellious past as Zero, stumbles upon a scheme on his life and the life of a mysterious woman known as C.C., who reveals to him his forgotten purpose and his \"true\" self. Lelouch gets rid of his assailants and declares himself Zero once again and he sets out to finish what he started.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDid you get that premise clearly? Well allow me to break the reviewing formula that I go with to address this. The first season of Code Geass ended in a cliffhanger, and it would have been ideal to start the second season where it left off. But no, This season starts by taking the plot to a different direction, turning 180 and shitting on the cliffhanger that assured a second season. That is bullshit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 started in April of 2008 until September of the same year. It is a Sunrise production and I noticed that even though the animation is pretty much the same, it seems that the quality has gone up just a little bit. I suppose that is a nice thing. There are a little few bumps on animation quality and visuals but it is mostly good except for the distracting Pizza Hut product placement, Again\u2026 if you reside in America, any scenes using the sign is taken out in the American release. CLAMP comes back to do character designs for this installment and I still like them. As for the openings, The first opening looks energetic and the second opening is a good opening to send off the series. As for closings, Both closings have great artwork. That is all I can really say about the animation, not much has changed and it has been mostly consistent with the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Hitomi Kuroishi and Kotaro Nakagawa is still good but I have noticed there was a couple tunes used a lot during this season\u2019s runtime. Like I said in the previous Code Geass review, the soundtrack is often energetic, light and epic, The lighter themes are not as occasional as the first season. This is nice considering the second season\u2019s tone is not the same as Season 1. The first opening theme \u201cO2\u201d is a decent listen, The second theme \u201cWORLD END\u201d is a fitting opening to properly send off the series. There are newer themes playing around this season, so that is another good thing about this particular season.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also another thing that has remained consistent from Season 1. Jun Fukuyama remains excellent as Lelouch, and I am already used to Takahiro Sakurai as Suzaku at this point in the series. Yukana is still great as C.C., and Ami Koshimizu is still fine as Kallen, and of course\u2026 Norio Wakamoto is epic as Emperor Charles zi Britannia but I am going to just say this now\u2026 he is over-the-top in this one.The Japanese voice cast is fine in this show but I must say that the English Dub remained consistent (for the most part). Johnny Yong Bosch took a little getting used to in the first few episodes of Season 1, but he delivers exceedingly in R2. Yuri Lowenthal is also consistent in his performance like Season 1. Kate Higgins is great as C.C. and Karen Strassman is still just as good as she was in Season 1 with Kallen. There are some additions to the dub such as David Vincent as Xingke, and Dave Wittenberg as Gino as well as Spike Spencer who plays Rolo. There are some notable voice actors and voice actresses that return such as Kirk Thornton, Laura Bailey, Liam O\u2019Brien, Michael Lindsay, Stephanie Sheh, Peter Spellos, Steve Staley, Travis Willingham, Troy Baker, Crispin Freeman, and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn. Also, Vic Mignogna somehow gets a part in this one. Also, Michael McConnohie has improved but Rebecca Forstadt still made it hard for me to get used to her voice as Nunnally. Like the first season, The ADR director is the late Kevin Seymour and he does not disappoint with this dub.\\n\\n\r\nNow we get to the characters and they are well-established in the first season, but as for this season\u2026We are going to be here for a while. Lelouch is mostly consistent except for a few questionable character moments here and there. Kallen could have had more development but she still manages to stand out in some way. The supporting characters such as the Black Knight characters are still decent characters, the Britannian side is a lot more likeable (Well, for some that is) One fine example is Jeremiah Gottwald who I am glad to see how he plays off in this season. Also added to the cast are the Knights of the Round. Yes, there are references to King Arthur in this anime. Even the cat is named \u201cArthur\u201d. Gino is a bit too optimistic and he doesn\u2019t really fit the whole \u201cKnight\u201d thing for some reason. Anya is one-dimensional and forced. Some \u201cKnights\u201d get a few seconds of screentime and there are a couple that are never shown. The only \u201cKnight\u201d that was actually worth a damn was Bismarck Waldstein. Now there are some characters that I just could not stand throughout the run of this season. One of them is Nina, but wait\u2026Did I mention that I did not hate her? That was during Season 1, I actually did not like her when Season 2 came around. Why? Her actions when she reacts to \u201cZero\u201d was predictable and even though she is smart when it mattered most, how she deals with her repercussions at a later point really felt forced. THE TABLES HAVE NOW BEEN FLIPPED! I do blame bad directing on this. The second character is Rolo. I did not like this character that much. Why? Even though he has his wants and needs. His \u201cwants\u201d are understandable. His motives and \u201cNeeds\u201d are what really bugged me about Rolo. Last but not least, there is Suzaku Kururugi. Where do I begin with this asshole. Well, he was established well for the most part in the first season. In the second season, his character turns a 180 and now his motives have drastically changed because the plot said so and this character change was so poorly executed that I went from feeling sympathetic for Suzaku to feeling annoyed towards Suzaku. I will not give away much here but I found him to be a douche for most of this second season. The characters had so much potential but it is wasted because of bad directing. Speaking of bad directing, I was also annoyed by the close up ass-shots that involved a female character or two.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you know, Code Geass R2 to this day is considered Top 10 material by Anime fans, what a bunch of bullshit! How it starts is a cop-out to the cliffhanger left from the end of Season 1, it takes a while to get moving, It even had an episode involving students making a giant fucking pizza\u2026 AGAIN! Oh and that Hat contest episode\u2026 Where do I begin with that one? Oh yeah\u2026 two words: FUCKING STUPID! It did manage to get back on track in the middle third of the series but that\u2019s when the series got even more ridiculous. It went from twist after twist after twist. Code Geass R2 almost went into Shyamalan Territory. The twists later on in this season took away the quality of the story. Oh but the damage was already done by all the cliffhanger resolutions being handled through flashbacks. Come to think of it, Code Geass R2 was not as great as I remembered it since 6 years ago. The animation and music stayed consistent for the most part. The character development and treatment is awful in this season (save for a few) What I liked in the first season of Code Geass was how Lelouch and Suzaku played out between eachother. I hated Suzaku\u2019s character change and how he interacts with Lelouch at first. What else did I like? The tactics that were emphasized in the first season, Some tactics were emphasized in R2 but that gets blasted to hell later on. Screw Tactics! Some pilots got the most powerful Gund\u2026. Uh\u2026 Knightmares in the battlefield! I like how well-paced the first season was, The pacing was fast but I think it was too fast with all the shit that was crammed in during R2. There was even great talk about the ending. Even though the final episode is memorable, The ending all together just felt rushed and I did not find it all too satisfactory with the conditions of how the show caps it all off (save for a memorable moment). Here is what I don\u2019t understand, Goro Taniguchi did fine with the first season and Ichiro Okouchi\u2019s writing for the most part was acceptable. How in the Nine Circles of Bloody Hell did they fuck up with Code Geass R2? The plot is a clusterfuck there is no bloody way I would acknowledge this season as a good one. Although, I must confess, it\u2019s a guilty pleasure of mine.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 was available by Bandai Entertainment. It did go out of print till Funimation came along and rescued it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh\u2026It turns out that I did point that out in my previous review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe first season of Code Geass was a good run, flaws and all. The result of Code Geass R2 was in my opinion\u2026 Disappointing. The animation and soundtrack are just as good for what they are just like its previous season. The character development and plot may not sit well for some and the directing was just awful, but what made this season a guilty pleasure for me despite major issues I have with it is thanks to the actions scenes. They made the show not boring. Also, the ending was not complete garbage and it was memorable. However, I can\u2019t hold back any longer but Code Geass R2 is\u2026 OVERRATED.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI give Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 a 6.5 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment.",

It kept me hooked throughout the show and the only thing I do after finishing an episode is starting the next one. The plot twists surpasses those of Death Note, and every conflict always ends in the most unexpected fashion. \r\nThis is in fact, one of very few shows who's ending actually holds together. I've seen so many other anime where their ending is way over the top and you have 0 idea what is going on nomatter how much attention you paid prior to the climax. But, this show barely does that. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound of the show is flawless, considering when it was made. But honestly, I doubt having a below average animation and sound would have made much of a difference to my overall enjoyment of the show, The story is just so gripping that you pretty much ignore everything else. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fairly great as well, there is a ton of them by the end of second season, and pretty much NO ONE DIES, which is a huge problem because most of them ends up not getting developed at all. Apart from that, they are all extremely likeable (except 1 girl, who always gets on my nerves) and distinct from each other.",

            "content": "*This is my first ridiculously biased review, so please provide constructive criticism where needed. No spoilers or plot content of any sort.\r\nWhere to begin? What a maelstrom of whirling motifs and metaphorical nuances! This rebellion is the supreme coup de tat, nearly flawless in its execution. If one can move past the obvious skinny male yaoi-influences and relentless underdogs-overcoming-obfuscating-obstacles premise, a brilliant series radiating quick twists and dramatic epiphanies can be found gleaming below. What made this series shine so brightly for me was the culmination of the last (technically fifty) twenty-five episodes, which were solemnly tied together in a glorious, overwhelming climax, which managedto bring a tear or two from deep within me to my eye. The plot utilizes, at most times, witty and furious, ranging from psychological games (often chess is used as a metaphor to describe conflicts between opponents, and Death Note-like character-telepathy can shamelessly  be found here), to intense, and increasingly large, mecha battles. Nearly everything that I enjoy in an anime was combined into this one series, and it was difficult for me to cease watching it, even though I have now viewed it several times. Each time through it reveals some other connection that I had not previously seen before, and this keeps me into it. I dare to compare this technique of trickling scatterbrain bits of information and shocking moments of revelation to that of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. However, this is just my heavily biased opinion, even though I ordered myself to be unbiased in this review, I am finding it difficult not to be, since I am so attached to R2. You will have to be the judge of whether you share in my perceptions. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter design physically, is like most other Japanese action renditions of the male and female form. Large eyes, skinny and mostly tall figures, and larger female proportions. Internal character design is much more complex, however. Each member has their own internal and external conflicts, even characters that could barely be called secondary, and each plays their own role in shaping the outcome of the overall stratagem, however subtle their influence may be. It is easy to become attached to certain characters, and their struggles and triumphs are heartfelt, but it lacks the emotional responses induced by series such as Clannad and Kanon, but this deficiency works for the better. It would seem out of place. Please be aware that most character models are on the mature side; there are no lolis, and moe is difficult to find.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 is not without its faults. This series has a nasty habit of repeating itself. It suffers from severe Utawarerumono syndrome, of which the developers clearly couldn\u2019t find a cure for in time for R2. If you step back and take a look, you will see that a small ragtag band of misfits (also with a masked leader) has combined to form a consistely upgraded (which seems to conveniently follow a logistic curve) fighting force against increasingly overwhelming odds and deity-like enemy leaders. This can be a turnoff for some, but this series is written in such a way that the \u201chappens to find a way out of this one\u201d scenarios do not become too annoying, although they are often. Yes, this series is overhyped\u2026just like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Death Note, and so on. However, just like all of the aforementioned series, it deserves to be watched and subsequently appreciated. Even though I rated both R2 and its predecessor a ten, I feel that R2 has far surpassed its parent. The plot is faster and more brutal, the fight scenes epic-er, and passions flare more often and with more fire.\\n\\n\r\n*Note--- This anime is extremely more pleasing to watch subbed than dubbed. The English audio doesn\u2019t compare to the original Japanese voice acting, in my opinion. I have seen both seasons of this anime dubbed and subbed, so don\u2019t tell me I\u2019m discriminatory against it one way or the other.\\n\r\nAlso, please, please, don\u2019t watch this season first. This is not a series to be watched out of order, and missing an episode can be devastating in terms of understanding what is occurring, as the plot, near the middle, begins to interweave at breakneck speed.\\n",

            "content": "Loved the ending, just beautiful. Doesn't reflect the entire show though. \r\nSTORY- 7/10\r\nYou know that amazing strategic analysis that Lelouch used in Season 1? How he positioned his units in the best place to effectively neutralize his opponents? Well, after Episode 8-10ish, his use of \"strategy\" is taking one of his many invincible robots and unloading his battery into the enemy troops. Of course, Lelouch is still a brilliant genius, but the use of strategy is no longer as prominent or executed as well. On the other hand, the powerful final episodes were better than anything in the rest of the series for me, withsome of the biggest \"Feels\" moments in anime history.\\n\\n\r\nART- 8/10\\n\r\nAnimation was good and all except for one thing- the Fanservice. Glorious shots of CC's and Kallen's...everything. The most awkward angles while piloting the mechas. The art styles were very good, keeping up the style set by the first season, so not much to complain about besides the ass shots.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND- 9/10\\n\r\nMusic and voice-acting in R2 is superb, and decent openings and endings. The soft songs that play during important character moments and the bombastic orchestral and brass music in the more epic parts of the show go beautifully, no real complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER- 8/10\\n\r\nAll the characters are interesting enough, with their own motives and morals, although from time to time they act rather bipolar with loose characterization and you don't really know exactly what happened to them at times, although that might just be some intense character development occurring. My other main issue with the characters is that the vast majority of the Black Knights are extremely gullible to anything anyone says. But at the end of the day, all these characters create some sort of emotional feelings inside you and in many cases make you want to sympathize with them. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT- 10/10\\n\r\nLoved this show, one of the best I've ever seen. My few problems with the characters and plot were easily solved by the ending, with many characters earning their redemption in some way or another. The last 5 minutes of Episode 20 was legendary by the way, best moment in the series IMO.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL- 9/10\\n\r\nCode Geass Season 2 wasn't as great as the first season in terms of actual storyline or characters, but makes up for it with its upgraded soundtrack, animation, and great ending. Obviously one of the best anime of the last decade and worthy of watching from all anime fans.",

            "content": "Code Geass is a truly outstanding anime series that tells a story about a young man seeking revenge and justice for his family. \r\nStory: The story itself is absolutely fantastic. The way the story develops and progresses is amazing and the plot twists are extremely unpredictable - at least for me. However, with that being said, there are many plot holes and the 'Sci-fi' aspect of the story is actually pretty bad. Many of the sci-fi things the show tries to address confuses the audience more than it explains it. Overall, the story is still great regardless and ends very well. 10/10\r\nArt: Art is oneof the weak points about Code Geass. In my opinion, I feel like the art - especially character designs - is not very well drawn but the scenes are still animated pretty well.  7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound; This is one of Code Geass's strong points. The soundtrack is simply sublime. Each scene has soundtracks that uses a full orchestra and each track are able to convey the emotion in the scenes very nicely. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are also developed very well. Many characters change throughout the 25 episodes and it is evident that their ideals also change. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2 is possibly one of the best anime series I have ever watched, despite some of its flaws. It is definitely a must-watch for all.\\n\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "In all my life, I have watched many TV series, many movies and some anime. Some of them are the worst, some being good for entertainment purpose, some having good hard work put into it, some showing the best of the hard work and a few others being a masterpiece.\r\nAnd then there's Code Geass.\r\nIt has been the only ever anime that I can regard as something priceless. The story, though it sticks to certain cliches, does not rely upon them and evolves on its own, beautifully, like the blossom of a flower. Every point in the story defines the whole series and by the timeyou watch it all, you feel proud, happy, sad, but without regret. Never before has there been something so defining, so moving and so lifelike in its approach.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you watch Code Geass for  the first time, like I did a week back , it may look a bit like any normal entertainment in the first few episodes. But later, it drags you into its depths and when you finally finish watching it, you can never believe that you did watch something so amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the series is good. CLAMP has  done a good work of generating the mecha battles and every character shown appropriately in their defining moments. Almost any scene with Lelouch's character development is a scene where the unnoticed artwork just adapts incredibly to the story line.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound track is just amazing. To quote a few, I would suggest you listen to the intros and outros the first time the appear at least. Try not to skip them and instead listen to the score till the episode ends. Even if you may not understand the well written lyrics of the score, listening to it will be worth it. Mosaic Kakera, The world's end, Hitomi no Tsubasa and  Orange range are perfectly made and melodious. Some scenes in Code Geass, especially the fight scenes, the dramatic scenes have the back ground music resonating with them.\\n\\n\r\nAs for characters, there is no good doer or villain with a heart of evil in this particular anime. Everyone adapts to their good side and evil side really well. Even if you hate a particular character so much, you can't help but cry for them at times.  Most of the character development in this series occurs in the most unexpected places. There is an important moment near the end of R2 when the main characters question their decisions for the sake of the world. That episode contains a lot of truth and self reflection on their deeds and becomes the cornerstone of  their final actions. Though that episode seems to divert away from the main plot, it brings out the best character development in the lead characters. That is the beauty of Code Geass. It doesn't feel forced and every dialogue, every action ,culminates towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nIf you truly want to see Code Geass in its glory, try not to view spoilers of the anime until you finish watching it. That includes memes, discussions and plot lines. If you don't understand one episode, watch the next one. The story in itself does not abandon the viewer's understanding and justifies its presence. Though the series does have its *ahem*awkward*ahem* moments, they don't hinder the story line and the anime still has its best moments. \\n\\n\r\nIn my personal opinion, I have never watched something tangle with the emotions and story of each character before. It has the same elements that made the Dark Knight, LOTR and Inception a phenomenal success: apt character representation in the face of reality, the perfect imperfections beneath each person, fulfillment of efforts made by the people behind the works, an exploration into the varying ideologies behind every character and finally, a perfect experience. That is why I love Code Geass and why I am happy to have witnessed something as epic as this. Dear writers of Code geass, if you are reading this, thank you for the efforts you made for making Code Geass the phenomenon it was today.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This anime is great in many aspects, of which it\u00b4s high points are strategy, wit and just the general hype and excitement caused by the secrecy of lelouch being a double-lifed terroristgroup-leader and prince of Britannia. However, the thing that probably made this the best anime of all time in my mind for a while, is the INCREDIBLE, AMAZING, MINDBLOWING, TRAGIC and BEAUTIFUL ending. The ending impressed me so much that I was speechless. In the end the feels also really hit me surprisingly for the first timeever while watching anything. Code Geass will always be etched into my mind and memory.",

And I'm glad that I did, because this anime is simply a masterpiece!\r\nStory: The story was well planned, however it got a little rushed as the series went along. Despite that, the overall story is simply astounding. It got me hooked from the first episode and I finshed both R1 and R2 in 3 days. The plot twists and cliffhangers in every episode will leave you wanting much more it's hard to stop watching :D\r\nArt: Asexpected from CLAMP, the character designs was magnificent. The background and the machines were all drawn in great detail and did not disappoint me.y\\n\\n\r\nSound: Code Geass BGM was one of the best I've heard. The music really sets the mood, and you would still be listening to the music despite all the action going on! The voice actors were also well chosen. Jun's role as Lelouch was the best I've seen, though I never took much notice of him in Bleach (Yumichika). He really pulls off the different faces of Lelouch through voices alone! C.C.'s voice fits her perfectly too, giving off the mysterious feel. In all, great sound!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I like the way they portray the characters, showing that they do have weaknesses too, and not the IM INVINCIBLE YO mindless thinking. Enough to score for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed Code Geass as it was the first anime that could keep me hooked on it so long and made me think about the themes explored in the story. It really shook my opinion of what justice really is, etc. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: A greeeeeeeeat anime! The mechas are there to help the story proceed, the main theme in this anime is not just fighting, but also shows what goes on people's minds from both sides of the story. A really amazing psychological anime as well! I WILL MISS CODE GEASS D:",

Code Geass, season 2, episode 20.\r\nCode Geass is a masterpiece you certainly don't want to miss. Addictive and intriguing, this anime manages to instigate a lasting impact with his appealing main character. The introduction of the Geass, the contract concluded with C.C, and the resulting schemes of Lelouch Lamperouge as he seeks to overthrow the Holy Britannian Empire steadily build up the tension and the emotional and moral depth of Code Geass. Does the means justify the end ? What does humankind truly wishfor ? As the story unfolds, we learn more about Lelouch's past, his motives and his resolve as he leads the Black Knights as Zero. Friendship, partnership and betrayal are themes evoqued and thoroughly explored by the main protagonists who happen to envision life differently. Every supportive cast characters has his own role to play in the story, which leads to many unexpected turns of event. The plot twists will undoubtly make you think and hope and laugh and scream and cry at times. The despair of Lelouch Lamperouge made him use his full potential to achieve his goal while accepting the consequences of his own acts.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is my definition of a masterpiece, magnified with a beautifully handled animation, a great cast of voice actors and a truly inspiring soundtrack. This winning combination will keep you glued till the very end.\\n\\n\r\nA 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nP.S : This review is about the two seasons of Code Geass, which are equally enjoyable.",

Every time you would find out something different it would strike you right away. Lots of things unexpected would happen. So much that its like a suspense. The mech was amazing. It would improve from time to time. Very very insane anime.",

            "content": "Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch aka Lelouch of the Rebellion is set one year after the failure of the Black Rebellion and the supposed death of Zero. Unsuspecting high school student Lelouch, oblivious to his rebellious past as Zero, stumbles upon a scheme on his life and the life of a mysterious woman known as C.C., who reveals to him his forgotten purpose and his \"true\" self. Destroying his assailants and declaring himself Zero once again, Lelouch sets out to finish what he started.(Synopsis from Anime News Network)\r\nIf you haven\u2019t seen season one i recommend that you go do that right now before even thingof watching this season as they are both directly related to each other. You will have no idea of what is happening, its deep enough as it is.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8.5/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs of this series OP #1: \"O2\" by ORANGE RANGE,OP #2: \"WORLD END\" by FLOW, ED#1: \"Shiawase Neiro\" by ORANGE RANGE, Ed#2: \"Waga Routashi Aku no Hana\" by ALI PROJECT were all good solid efforts with your usually heavy metal/rock themes. They are nothing to complain about but they can do better. However, the background music throughout the series was exceptional. The suspenseful senses contain slow, ominious music while the school scene contained light hearted, fact paced music. It is truly amazing how the music various just enough to match the temperament of every scene perfectly. The finally ending was also commendable, \u201cContinued story\u201d by Hitomi Kuroishi is only placed in the last episode and allows your to reflect on what happened throughout the series. The slow classical music is unintrusive and reflective, perfect of the finale.\\n\\n\r\nStory(9/10)\\n\r\nThroughout the story there were numerous plot twists which ssignificantly altered the storyline and circumstances of the main characters, especially Lelouch. It follows the classic formula of best friends are your worst enemies and keeps you guessing untill the very end. The most unexpected and heart breaking twists come completely out of the blue, however this leads to a more dramatic and thrilling story. I found the story very captivating as it doesn\u2019t focus completely on the war, death and destruction you would expect from an action/mecha(like Neon Genesis Evangelion, bodies blowing up every few minutes, sheesh) anime but it also gave us glimpses into the characters school life and friends which let you build a strong link with the characters. The story was somewhat slow paces at times becuase of the constant suspense but it is well worth the wait,This anime had one of the most memorable endings ever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(10/10)\\n\r\nThe characters are truly the highlight of the whole anime. Not only does it feature compelling protagonists/antagonists throughout the , the roles are constantly in motion. The use of \u201canti-heroes\u201d and \u201canti-villians\u201d as well as more traditional character models such as the the motherly figure, the girl with unrequited love towards the main character etc make for very interesting interactions and alliances. Each character is unique in their own way and each have problems that they must face.Many people end up liking the minor characters more than the major ones.Through the characters the show confronts viewers with conflicting views of morality, different individuals will see the characters in different lights. Where one person sees an anti-hero another will see an anti-villian or antagonist etc.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation(9/10)\\n\r\nThe animation throughout the series is superb. The fight scenes are extremely well animated allowing the viewer to play the same scene over and over again without getting bored of it( i know i did).The large scale wars are well animated without the background losing its color or the masses of soldiers turning into mush and appearing like a swamp of mud.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(10/10)\\n\r\nOverall the series was amazing. I ended up staying up overnight waiting for the last episode to be released. This show will never cease to amaze you, whether it be through unexpected plot twists, massive large scale wars, an unexpecting fanservice shot or  touching relationships.  This anime will meet your demand and surpass it.\\n",

At first, Code Geass was looking like a pretty jawsome pizza -- the world's BIGGEST pizza, in fact!  A pizza so big that you'd need to be piloting a giant mecha to even toss it, I bet.  But see, before long, things start getting a little messy: First, a land shark from Gyo charges through the kitchen.  You jump the shark in your mecha, dropping the pizza and drowning Japan in cheese and tomato sauce.Oops.  \"Oh well, no big deal,\" you say.  \"That wouldn't have been a good pizza anyway.  Not enough toppings.  I'll try again later.\"\\n\\n\r\nThat was the first season.  Now, with R2, your little brother comes to help out.  Didn't know you had a little brother?  Well, you do.  You must have hit your head or something, caught a touch of amnesia.  Come to think of it, you haven't been acting quite like yourself lately.  For that matter, nobody seems to act like themselves anymore -- they all start doing things that don't make sense, and before you know it, they're throwing anchovies and pickles and chocolate sprinkles and fried chicken and mars bars and honeycomb cereal and eyeballs and oranges and robots and sweaty socks into the pizza, and it's just a mess.  Eventually, the pizza ends up collapsing under the weight of all its toppings, and it's just pandemonium.  Girls are falling into the tomato trucks, and cats are wearing helmets, and teachers are exposing their ass cheeks, and everyone has super powers and your mother's a loli and your uncle's a loli and your sister's a zombie and your brother's yandere and oranges are loyal and violets are blue and hoagies are traitorous and i don't even know what i'm saying anymore what the hell is going on has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?!\\n\\n\r\n...So you pretty much just blew the pizza to smithereens, and half the world with it.  Oops.  Some delusional nutcase claiming to be Christ the Messiah tried to clean up the mess by eating it all himself, preaching something wacky about how the sooty, cheesy mess represented all the evil in the world or whatever, but it didn't work out -- see, it wasn't long before his fat, bloated corpse full of pizza, steel and concrete started rotting, and everything leaked right on back out.  A good effort on his part, I guess, but what a stupid idea. He was loony. \\n\\n\r\n\"...Well, yeah, okay, that all sucks,\" you say, \"but wasn't it fun?\"  Well, yeah, I guess it was kind of fun.  But you know man...that pizza looked really tasty back in the beginning, when it was just cheese and pepperoni.  I wish I could've eaten it.  Now I'm just hungry and regretful.",

Each character felt like they did what they did was their choice.\r\nIn the second season it felt a little more forced in that this character has to do an action in order to keep the story moving.

            "content": "I never thought I would hate so much a fictional show but Code Geass slaped me in the face and treated me like a fucking idiot. I know there are a lot of stupid shows, but this was described to me like the next death note, so I decided to give it an opportunity. I don\u00b4t like dropping anime even if its bad. \r\nAt the end of the show I felt so stupid with the impression that I wasted my time watching this garbage instead of something, not great, but at least entertaining.\r\nSo why shouldn\u00b4t you watch code geass (I\u00b4ll make it short as I\u00b4msure you\u00b4re a busy person):\\n\\n\r\n-The story begins promising, with mecha fighting between a rebellion and the empire, until everything is dragged down by tons of plotholes and deus ex maquinas. Oh and the twist, for fucks sake. Even if you\u00b4re a fan of Shayamalan twists, the twists in this show are just painfully insulting to any rational human being.\\n\\n\r\n-The characters are obnoxius and cliched. The main character is despicable and socyopath that manipulates everyone around him. Still the writers alienates the audience making you see him like the good guy because he fights with the rebellion, and everybody knows that the rebellion are good , and the empire is bad and bla,bla bla..\\n\r\nEverybody else is just a disposable character that fills the necessary shounen tropes: the tsundere love interest, the cute little sister, the evil father-douchebag figure, etc\\n\r\nAlmost forgot about his best friend \u00b4Suzaku\u00b4 who may be the most stupid character I ever seen in anime. He lacks characterization and his motivations can change any episode, he\u00b4s kinda good, then he turns bad, then he\u00b4s good again. I don\u00b4t want to spoil anything but I still cant\u00b4t understand how a proffesional team of writers have made such a retarded character\\n\\n\r\n-The art and sound of the show are decent, not great, just ok. Well, even if it was the best animation ever it couldn\u00b4t have saved this anime from being so bad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Code Geass is the worst anime I have seen in my life. Not because it was just bad (Sword Art Online is garbage but I don\u00b4t hate it) but because it was so pretentious and mind-numbing that I wish I had never saw it in the first place.\\n\r\nBut still Code Geass is one of the most rated and loved animes of all time. Why? My guess is that this anime is for teenagers, and people who just don\u00b4t care enough that the plot and characters make sense. So maybe if you don\u00b4t give a damn about the events happening and just want to see giant mechas fighting this may be your cup of tea. Just like a Michael Bay movie",

In some parts the show paces itself unrealistically which makes you question it's approach, in most parts it is defined pretty well, since this show in the first place is not real, the plot relies on the power which of that Geass to change the fate of humanity, which therefore leads to unknown territory. During this phase, trying to understand the show for what it ismay be the best approach. It is best to keep an open mind and think for yourself it's definitive message. \\n\\n\r\nWhilst for some people this is extraordinarily painful to watch, like-said it is best to keep an open mind when watching this show, personally, I like the way how it goes, for the most part. Leading to a somewhat acceptable conclusion but can  and could have been done differently, but in the end decided to go for a ending that showed what an ideology could do, and what could happen if you sticked through with it, learning these things, for me, was a pretty good watch.",

            "content": "Code Geass' first season was unremarkable but enjoyable, this second season though manages to drag even the few things that I enjoyed about this series into a pit of dullness and melodrama.\r\nNow don't get me wrong, the series was over-the-top and extremely melodramatic even in its first season, but it effectively used those tonal modes to support a structure that all and all worked. Code Geass looked at a wider political conflict while at the same time keeping its parties grounded into humanity through human drama.\r\nThis second season completely breaks that structure. Personal plots become wide end-of-the-world matters, wider plots get reduced to personal conflict...in short, it tries to bring everything together but crash and burns horrifically in doing so. \\n\\n\r\nThere are other problems obviously, like the addition of a huge number of completely uninteresting new characters and the increased focus on mecha action. But all of these are in the end not all that important... what truly drags this second season down is the complete failing in resolving the themes and plot-lines of the first season in any satisfying manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe failing is not only in the structure, but in the content itself. All the characterization the protagonist went through ends up amounting to nothing and any political, ideological or even personal statement the series seemed like it was trying to make in the first season, is completely undermined by a bland resolution that calls on the worst cliches of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nUntil the last five episodes I would have said that Code Geass would have been a much more interesting series if it was framed from the point of view of literally any other character but the protagonist, but now to be honest I have to wonder if the few interesting enjoyable bits weren't just a fluke.\\n",

Not only, the second season or the first season, but the whole anime altogether.\r\nMost animes tend to loose its touch after first season, but it was just an epic. First, I found the story a little prdictable but the ENDING did all the trick, thanks to Lelouch for being such a decorated character.\r\nCode Geass was driven by the powerful humanoids for all the series. But , Lelouch's brilliance took the spotlight. Its pcychological as well.\r\nThe story is an absolute thriller . WEll thought and well presented. Code Geass R2 is little better than the the first season because Zero' s actionsare much ' straight to the point' for me and it added some pretty awesome chracters as well and the Ending.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHe strory deserves a 10/10. It has one of the most beautiful story ever.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound could have been better . Some soothing soundtracks to keep us amazed . So its an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing . BUT not a really challenging villain . So its 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Code Geass left me stunned at the end of the anime and its a 10/10. Please do watch it people.",

            "content": "I'm just going to sum this all up because it would make sense that someone who's reading the reviews for this series already knows what happens in the first so I'm just going to jump right in and review my reaction to both seasons as a whole.\r\nStory 9/10 - Maybe I'm sugar coating it a bit but the story was definitely something worth watching. It wasn't one of those series that I simply dropped and never watched again. I will admit, the second season is hard to get into which is why I rated it a 9/10 instead of a 10/10, it is hard tocontinue watching as it starts, but once I started watching it again after a hiatus, I couldn't keep my eyes off it. I would sit in school just waiting for the bell to ring so I could go home and continue watching. Season 1 was definitely more \"attention grabbing\" as opposed to season 2, possibly because we already know the story and it's nothing new, but trust me, this season is worth watching because if you thought season 1 had the most emotion, think again because this season had my heart aching. What I also adore about the story in this series is the fact it's not two-dimensional with it's genre, Code Geass is a little bit of everything from action to drama, you name it, which makes it a perfect anime for anyone.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10 - From the moment I started watching this anime, the artwork didn't go unnoticed, at least for me. Especially since this is an anime that falls in the mecha genre. I understand since around the time animation was first introduced, technology has advanced so that it makes it easier to animate things like fighting robots and gundams. But that still leaves me awestruck at the fact someone had to sit down and design that. Someone had to create the detail in those machines and just everything. \\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10 - Not much to say here, sound is one of those things that just kind of blends in to anime for me so I don't tend to notice it. It's just right for it to be there. But I think if the sound were absolutely terrible, I would have noticed by now. I did actually enjoy all of the openings and endings, the first couple I actually listen to on a somewhat regular basis. Either way, I believe the sound in this anime was pretty average and nothing too spectacular or amazing but it serves it's purpose well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10 - I think the characters are what I loved most about this series. All of the characters are so unique, I find the ones possessing the power of Geass to be the most unique because of their unique power and character. Lelouch and Suzaku were two characters that stood out to me the most I believe, because they both have so much emotion hidden within their character. Whether it's kept bottled up or not. The two of them are an enigma with plenty of elements in their past to show for it. I could go on about how great all of the other characters were, but I think I've made my point quite clear.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 - I don't think there was ever a moment in this anime where I was truly disappointed. And I am also impressed because Code Geass did something that few animes can accomplish, at least what I've seen and that's make a decent sequel. The reason for this is most likely because of the way the first season ended, it was obvious there was going to be a sequel. And I am thoroughly satisfied with what they had to show. The first season ended the way maybe some didn't expect it to, but the second season ended perfectly.  For those who haven't seen, I won't spoil anything, I will just say the ending for me was that of a bittersweet one, but that's the way it should have ended in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this series and it's one of those shows I think every anime fan should watch or at least try once in their life. Is it the greatest anime of all time? Well, no. I don't think there is a \"greatest anime of all time\" because there are so many good animes out there that you can't just pick one, either that or you can't have just one \"greatest anime\". But really, this is an anime I recommend for anyone, because it's gotten it's approval from me and it's gotten it's approval from anime fans everywhere.",

Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2 hits all of these notes with sheer perfection. Every episode, I found myself clutching my seat because everything was extremely intense. On top of that, the anime always had enough twists and emotional scenes to keep you guessing. I never knew what to expect with each episode other than that each episode would be good. The twist ending was so great that I lie awake at night just thinking of how awesome it was and how I never sawit coming. It felt good to actually watch an anime with a good ending, as I have watched some horrible endings in my short anime life. On top of all of this, the character development was fantastic. I actually hated some of the characters such as Rolo and Schneizl to the point of hating them in real life, while I also loved Lelouch and Nunnally no matter what happened. It takes a very good anime to make me feel that way. Now to the minor details. The character designs struck me as strange at first. Everyone looked like they were 10' tall and 2\" wide with eyes bigger than their heads. However, after maybe two episodes, this did not bother me, and everything else looked great, especially the Knightmares. Both openings were good but not extremely memorable or special, however the music in the show was great. The music always seemed to emphasize the major points and the instrumentals were great. Everyone should watch this near perfect anime, and not just once but two or three times.",

            "content": "Code Geass is the answer to the question \"What if the stereotypical mastermind villain was the good guy?\" A marvel of a series and very unique and different. It applies shoujo-style layered character, melodramatic tragedy to a shounen-style mecha war story, producing something unique and engaging that is neither overblown in style and structured yet brutally unsentimental, Code Geass is defined by the meticulous scheming of Lelouch, the anti-hero who carries the show. . The CLAMP character designs, fluid animation, and varied mecha combat are all part of the picture, but when it comes down to it the reason you watch are for those momentswhen Lelouch smiles sadistically and you realize he's already won, usually by savage blindide. His personality and willing decent into a hell of his own making are backed by a commanding Japanese performance and framed by a colorful cast of people doomed to be broken by fate.\\n\\n\r\nCasting villain as hero and hero as villain, Code Geass twists a stock melodramatic war story into something new and deliciously malicious. The series rides almost entirely on the shoulders of its ultimate anti-hero, which turns out to be its greatest strength. It's neither uplifting nor weepy--it's a ruthless chess match set to a symphony of brutality that is as gripping as it is unusual. In short, wicked, tragic fun. Code Geass also emphasizes on the general theme of \"revenge\". If you ever seen Death note where the show took more of a verbal approach at trying to out do each other between L and Light yagami's both genius minds who are rivals that are trying to defeat each other. To win the war against Kira. Thats kind of how code geass is portrayed, the one question you have to ask your self when watching this show is \"who is the good guy'? \"who is the bad guy\". Throughout this show, there is some one on the darker side and the one that is behind the curtain so to speak, then there is one character that is on the good side. But you will never realize who it is, because the show uses alot of confusing complex multi sided personalities for each character that keeps you guessing. But just that complex reality of two characters thrown into a chaos of war, both with genius minds trying to strategize every action keeps you wanting more and more and its hardly a show you will drop because of that. Its very satisfying, new and refreshing and i think fans of mecha action and serious character dramatic overtones will enjoy this series.",

The character design is top notch, especially with their decisions and individuality which is often times so rare in anime. I loved that each one had their own agenda, their own emotions, and their own reasoning for their actions. There were also so many different characters and different aspects to the story that it kept you on your toes for the most part. Once you got the feel of Lelouch's thinking, or Suzaku's honor you could predict their movements, but it was never dull.\r\nI am still of the opinion that anyanime that can make you love it while making you hate it at the same time is absolutely fantastic. This is an excellent sequel to the first season and the tragedies that happened. Lelouch was a bit more impulsive with his movements because with the power he accumulates he could be with little consequence.\\n\\n\r\nWithout telling any spoilers, I will say that there are quite a few twists to the story. Quite a few times you hate characters who redeem themselves. Characters who your heart breaks for. Even a few that make you very disappointed. With such a large cast of characters it's hard to want anyone side to be the victor, but I believe the story panned out in the best possible way I could have hoped for. It was the only solution left that was viable to allow everyone to accomplish their goals.\\n\\n\r\nI am thoroughly enchanted with this anime.",

Anddd i found the 1st season boring, but acceptable because of the story leading to an epic cliffhanger, making me wanted to watch more, and the season 2.... I'm really really dissapointed\r\nStory (4)\r\nMany review mentioned that the storry is good, many plot twist, manycharacters being introduced to us, but that's EXACTLY what i hate about it. \\n\r\n1st of all, there are TOO MANY plot twist going on and the story become so dull that when a character die(part of the twist) you dont even feel symphaty, you feel pity for them because it didnt draw any feel, like(spoiler alert) The death of Rolo and shirley.... IT WASNT EVEN NECESARRY. They made the same plot as akame ga kiru or death note, killing everyone, many massacare, but the executions of eeach death is so bad. There's so little to no character development here(spoiler off). 2nd many characters introduced. Dont get me wrong, i like bunch of new character if they given some time to introduce their past, their feelings and such but with too many twist going on and event happening too fast i feel like they're in the background in this story, try to think bout it, if they focuses the main characters this shows could be much better, thats why i\\n\\n\r\nArt is (9), well the art is good, the mechs is cool etc as well as the sound (7),the reason i give it 7 is because the ending and opening is pretty bad, maybe because i just watched death parade and listened to their OP\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(3)\\n\r\ni enjoyed some moment of this series but since the 2nd half, all the event happening to quickly without introduction so i really found it boring (well since the 1st half it has been boring)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5)\\n\r\nFor you who like (BOTH) Harem,school life, comedy,misplaced ecchi,  mecha, action will find this enjoyable but i dont.",

            "content": "Popularity is a funny thing. In society, it\u2019s what people spend a lifetime striving for, but it all seems to end so fast. In order to keep up, they must constantly satiate the masses to ensure that their \u201c15 minutes of fame\u201d lasts for a lifetime. Not surprisingly, this sort of pattern often occurs in television and in anime. Whether in the form of the recent boom in \u201cmoe\u201d characters or the even more recent addiction with MMO/survival game themed anime, certain formulas for guaranteed success exist for the purpose of selling well in the market. Although these formulas are so successful they basically printmoney, these types of shows often become stagnant or frankly, were not even good ideas to begin with. Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2 (or R2 for short) essentially amalgamates all of these ideas and genres together to form their finished product.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, the story of R2 is simple. The bulk of the characters still strive for their individual goals and ambitions, and at the heart of these conflicting desires, hidden behind his thirst for world domination, is Lelouch\u2019s ulterior motive: to avenge the death of his mother and to create a picturesque world for his sister, Nunally, to live in happily ever after.  \\n\\n\r\n(As always, it is fitting to judge the quality of a sequel\u2019s story with its prequel, so I\u2019ll be doing quite a bit of comparing in this section). \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the concept of the prequel\u2019s story persists in R2, the approach Sunrise takes in wrapping it up is very different. To put it frankly, the story begins to lose its direction as politics are thrown over plot twists, which are thrown over a heavy coat of melodrama. This is due to two main reasons: the fact that the writers probably did not have enough time to think the plot through (airing less than a year after its predecessor\u2019s end) and that they knew what they were going to ultimately throw out would please the fan-base in name alone. \\n\\n\r\nAnd to their credit, it was a raving success, as expected. Sunrise hit a grand slam in terms of what essentially degenerates into mindless entertainment embellished by \u201cintellectual\u201d dialogues about politics and the supernatural (which are much more prevalent themes in this sequel). Viewers love to see plot twist after plot twist because it gives them the same thrill as when riding a roller coaster; however, just because the story may give you that rush does not mean it is good writing. Stories that overdose on these adrenaline-pumping moments lead to detachment in another important category, the characters (I will elaborate on this in the characters section). \\n\\n\r\nAs for other points of the story, another aspect I saw that took a major hit in terms of quality are the full-scale battle scenes, which are prevalent in both seasons. In the prequel, important conflicts were more often than not fought with an amiable attempt to emphasize the importance of strategy. Some battles would be won or lost purely due to tactical reasoning, yet there were some instances where the writers would throw a super-robot into the mix to completely dominate the battlefield. This approach, although relatively annoying, was definitely ok in the first season simply because the introduction of a terrifying new superweapon every now and then was not only exciting entertainment, but also set a mood that proves to be essential for any action/thriller-oriented show. Unfortunately, there is such thing as too much goodness. Gone are the attempts at even attempting logical strategy in R2 as the writers set out to make each battle into a simple decision of who has the bigger, badder, shinier knightmare, thermonuclear weapon, and whatnot. Although tactics are still briefly mentioned here and there, more often than not are they embellished with nonsensical logic and pretentious ideals (I\u2019m looking at you, illegal chess move). \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, another nagging factor that appears again in R2 is the slice-of-life aspect of the show. Some may call it an immaculate segue between the rigors of the battlefield and the cheerfulness of everyday life, but I think it is an excuse at adding filler in order to somehow progress the plot while providing fans with comedic relief and fanservice. Granted, the contrast actually does aid in adding to the thrill of Lelouch\u2019s everyday life by his attempts to hide his identity from his closest friends, but this mostly all ends with melodrama or our favorites, plot twists. Considering the sharp change of direction the end of the first season set up, I was disappointed in Sunrise\u2019s decision to continue the antics and not focus on the more serious side of the story. \\n\\n\r\nTL/DR Story Thoughts\\n\r\nAll in all, R2\u2019s story was crippled by its own aspirations. Simply put, it tried too hard to be too many things at once. As a result, the answers to questions posed at the very beginning of the prequel were disappointingly brushed upon with the very plot twists that seem to sustain the series. Although the story was able to succeed in providing the viewer with entertainment in a grand scale, it was ultimately poorly planned entertainment that saw its consequences realized as the series fell with an underwhelming latter half, only to be partially salvaged by an ending that had the right idea, but also fell short due to earlier misgivings. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10 - Attempted to retain its great concept, but fell short in execution.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nThere is little to argue about the art and animation as a whole. The series maintains the high quality of its predecessor and is even able to step it up a notch. A subtle example of such an improvement is the whole animation of Lelouch using his geass on another person. The animation of the most important battles is fluid and augmented by high quality, aesthetically appealing knightmare frames. Additionally, the scenery and sheer scale of each and every scene is rather detailed and adds a flair for the dramatic. Character designs by CLAMP retain their signature looks, and attention to facial expressions realizes the wide array of emotions from each and every character. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, one nagging issue I have with art style and animation is that it is so gaudy and overdone that the visuals alone can distract the viewer from what is supposed to matter most, the dialogue. I found that at times I would only remember a scene because of how much they emphasized Kallen\u2019s\u2026package or because a shiny new superweapon had come to save or ruin the day. Again, even in the choices made for art and animation, R2 again decides to challenge the notion that there is such a thing as going too far. Visuals serve as an important aid to the story and characters, and the staff is responsible in making sure that visuals do not hinder the viewer\u2019s overall experience.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10. Outstanding, fluid animation that maintains high quality but may go too far sometimes\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nJust like its art, the sound set of R2 is excellent all around. Track placement and the overall quality of the OST itself is grand and well thought out. There is seldom an instance when I would say the OST felt \u201coff.\u201d Voice acting is always important in every anime, and R2 delivers in nearly every aspect. From the confident, assertive voice of Fukuyama Jun\u2019s Lelouch to Ami Koshimizu\u2019s Kallen (these two seem to have a thing for starring together), some of the voice acting performances would be the sole reason I could even remember a character. \\n\r\nThe two openings, 02~O-Two by Orange Range and WORLD END by FLOW, are both fitting and catchy openings that, although still pale in comparison to COLORS (by FLOW), are a welcome change from the disappointing second and third openings of the 1st season.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ending, Shiawase Neiro by Orange Range, is by far my most favorite song of the series whereas the second ending, My Beautifully Elegant Flower of Evil, although catchy in its own way, is still no different from any other Ali Project song out there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there is nothing much to complain about the sound in R2. From a well done OST to top notch voice acting, the overall package is excellent, but not what I would call the best. (see the entirety of the Aria series)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10, excellent all around.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nR2 brings to the table an even wider array of characters than those of its prequel. This introduction of so many new characters; however, is a double-edged sword. On one hand, characters such as Anya and Gino from the newly introduced knights of the round group are given ample screen time (but questionable development), but on the other hand, the other knights of the round are given little time and importance. At first, it seemed as if the whole system of these knights was an excellent idea, providing an intimidating hierarchy of power to the antagonizing side. Unfortunately, this idea, along with many others, are introduced but never fully realized. And to rub salt on the wound, the awkward screen-time given to the characters that the writers felt the need to force in was squandered before focusing more attention to the core group of characters (like the ever-so mysterious C.C.). \\n\\n\r\nAnd this leads to the first main issue with the characters of R2. More often than not, characters become plot device shells and are not given much thought or development at all. What\u2019s worse is that the writers make clear attempts at trying to force some emotional connection with an un-relatable, poorly developed character. The best example I can refer to is Tianzi and the \u201coh so tragic\u201d fate that befalls her thanks to her status or something like that. Other characters, particularly Nina, are also given emotional issues, but the forced melodrama that clouds the plot along with borderline irrational character personalities often lead to an emotional detachment with most characters.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, on the bright side, the writers are able to somewhat maintain this emotional connection with the most important character, Lelouch. Throughout the show, I still found it very easy to genuinely feel the unfortunate pain Lelouch had to endure. The weight of emotion was prevalent, and I was relieved that the show still tried its best to convey Lelouch\u2019s thoughts and feelings to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Lelouch\u2019s character (and only part of it at that) is the only iota of praise I can legitimately point to in regards to the characters of R2. There is another fatal flaw in terms of the characters, and it all falls back to the fault of the plot. \\n\\n\r\nNamely, their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned above, some characters are just not likable to begin with. Whether it is Nina or Suzaku, some characters are difficult to accept because of how their personalities are built in the first place. On the other hand, many characters seem to change their ideals and defining characteristics at a snap of a finger for the sake of \u201cenhancing\u201d the plot. Connecting this with my previously mentioned issue of plot device shells, I would go as far as to compare some characters to marionettes, doomed by the hands of the writers, who were trying to salvage a sinking story. The shining example of such a misfortune is Kururugi Suzaku. Since I\u2019m writing a rather spoiler-free review, I\u2019ll let the viewer see for him or herself. \\n\\n\r\nIf I were to put a word to describe the characters of R2, I would say unfortunate. Trapped by the story\u2019s unpredictable direction and the series\u2019 aspiration to bite more than it can chew, most of the characters were given little attention and illogical development. Although this is primarily the fault of the story, the mediocrity of the cast in general cannot be forgiven. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10, Unfortunately mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one thing that this series could not do any better, it would be the pure, unadulterated enjoyment it provided me throughout this experience. Albeit through cheap devices such as plot twists that eventually wore out, the show knew that it had to continue to captivate or else it would shed its skin and the weak backbone of the series would be revealed. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this is the main aspect that made R2 loved by so many.\\n\\n\r\nR2 is extremely easy to watch, and its attempts to depict monumental conflicts while delivering convincing entertainment are generally successful. To say the least, the entertainment factor was more than enough to meet expectations. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the series, Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2 promised an experience like none other before, and in a sense, it somewhat succeeded; however, it all came down to execution. Reliant on a story fully driven by unexplained plot-twist after plot-twist, the staff at Sunrise fell back on the characters to keep the story afloat. Unfortunately, this plan did not and will never work anytime in the future. As a result, the only character decent enough to appreciate is Lelouch, and even he had his own identity crises. In the end, R2 wanted to distinguish itself from the masses and secure its fame, but lost its identity as a whole. Like a celebrity begging for 15 more glorious minutes, R2 became just as desperate. Still, with top-notch animation and an excellent soundtrack along with several epic moments, it is still something to give a try.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7.6/10\\n\\n\r\n*see my rating scale for interpretations of my ratings*    \\n\\n",

            "content": "Okay, about time I gave a review to my favourite anime. This review stands for both seasons.\r\nCode Geass is the very definition of \"anime done right\". Obviously not perfect, but the flaws are very minor whereas everything that matters is done almost perfectly.\r\nSTORY\r\nSOOOO much to say here. Let's just sum up the pros and the cons:\r\nPROS: the show is CLEVER.\r\n- It has various PHILOSOPHICAL THEMES : the questions of \"identity\", \"consequences\" or \"loyalty\", and that's only a FEW subjects that are approached, Also, these aren't just \"morals\" (as in the final word of a series).\r\nThe philosophies are carried through the WHOLE SERIES, with plenty ofmetaphores and other symbolics all along.\\n\r\nFor example, the question of \"identity\" (\"what makes me who I am?\", basically) is carried by the lies and tricks of the different characters through the whole story, by the metaphores of mask (\"the mask of the Emperor\"), by the identity changes (\"Oh Lelouch, why are you Lelouch? You changed your name, but kept your first name\"), but also by the idea of the C World itself.\\n\r\nIf you want a less abstract example, just watch episode 13 season 2, with the falling masks. \\n\\n\r\n- the battles are FULL OF IMPRESSIVE TACTICS, using the particularity of the battlefield or using new tech to surprise their opponents. It is way more impressive to see Lelouch activate a volcanoe than to watch Gundams cutting themselves.\\n\\n\r\n- the dialogues are WRITTEN BRILLANTLY. Some dialogues are echos to previous ones, others are intertwined perfectly, and more importantly, they're neither too long nor too short. Perfectly concise.\\n\r\nWant some example? Watch episode 5 of season 1, when Lelouch and C.C talks while Euphemia and Suzaku have the same talk. During the whole discussion, Lelouch and Suzaku say the same thing, UNTIL the very end where their answers diverge : one says \"you have to crush your enemis, simple as that\" while the other says \"I don't have the solution yet\".\\n\r\nThat scene shows perfectly how the two characters diverge : they came the same way, but don't have the same philosophy (while Lelouch is all \"all means to an end\", Suzaku wants to find the most peaceful solution).\\n\\n\r\n- the story moves on at a VERY FAST PACE, but is not rushed.\\n\r\nAs a result, a lot of stuff happens, the story moves on while still letting you take a break from time to time. There is not a single other anime that has such a good pace, as any other anime either doesn't have a lot of story or takes way too long to develop what they have to say.\\n\\n\r\n- even the secondary characters are useful either to the plot or to the background. Even the crew of the Academy do have a purpose (Milly's family is the one that covered for Lelouch and Nunnaly when they needed it ; Nina is a genius that gets to join Prince Shneizel and fight Zero ; Shirley is the main victim of the whole story, which makes her very important for the philosophy about \"consequences of actions\"). Hell, some secondary characters have THEIR OWN PLOT, which makes them really interesting to follow. Diethard and Jeremiah's characters, for example : each has their own story, and both those stories are tied to the subject of \"loyalty\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONS :\\n\r\n- The pace is so fast that it sometimes fails to explain stuff properly. It often happens that an important scene lasts less than 2 seconds, and if you miss it you may not understand.\\n\r\n- The show is very ground-to-earth, BUT some parts of it are hard to take seriously. Fanservice or martial art with giant robots, for example.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat does it for the story. There is hardly anything to criticize on that point, and that is proven by the fact the the hardest critics about it feel like they didn't even watch the show... or just didn't understand it.  The show is undeniably clever. It goes straight to the point and doesn't stick to a single fight for 20 episodes (right, DBZ?). It manages to go fast while not being rushed, that alone makes it exceptional.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nCode Geass is clean. The animation is smooth, which makes for awesome fights. The pictures of the dashboards during the fights are a very good idea, as it shows the state of the battle without highly detailed pics. The only flaw is the chara-design : the characters are very thin and have pointy chins. It's not ugly either, it's just... weird.\\n\\n\r\nFor the rest, if you doubt that the art is so good, I'll just refer you to the bath scene during episode 13 of season 1. Lelouch doubts of his path, and has a series of flashbacks.\\n\r\nFirst, the flashbacks are all blurry and oppressive... until Lelouch thinks of Nunnally. Suddenly, the flashback is neat and shiny, which makes it light to watch.\\n\r\nThis represents the mental state of Lelouch at this point : he doubts that what he does is right, but he does it anyway, for his sister, because that's what he decided.\\n\\n\r\nIn only ONE MINUTE, with JUST flashbacks with some visual effects, they do an extremely powerful scene. AND WITHOUT ANY MONOLOGUE. Just the flashbacks and Lelouch's body language.\\n\r\nTHAT'S how good the art is in Code Geass. In any other anime, they would describe Lelouch's thoughts with a monologue ; not here.\\n\\n\r\nSHOW, DON'T TELL. That's what Code Geass does, and that's WAY MORE POWERFUL.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nOn this point, Code Geass is done right once again. The OST is very diverse, so you will probably find some tracks that you don't like, but you will also find others that you do like. Overall the OST fits the scenes perfectly.\\n\r\nThe seiyuus are THE BEST. Even in japanimation standard, Code Geass stands out. You have some doubts? Just listen to Lelouch's screams when he is in pain.\\n\r\nThe openings are memorable (thanks to FLOW!), the endings are... weird.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nOn this point, there would be plenty to tell as well.\\n\r\nI'll just say this to begin with: Code Geass received a LOT of trophies for its characters. That was deserved.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, I have to say this : DON'T COMPARE LELOUCH WITH LIGHT (from Death Note). many people do this stupid comparison. Light is a murderer who thinks he's saving the world, Lelouch is a terrorist who wants to A, avenge his mother and B, create a world where his sister could leave without the fear of being assassinated.\\n\r\nThe two of them don't have anything in common except for their charisma and intelligence. Light is a devil, Lelouch is a human. End of the comparison.\\n\\n\r\nLelouch is charismatic and clever. It's by far one of the best characters in anime, because he is COMPLEX. He is neither evil nor good. He is HUMAN. He is ready to destroy the world out of love for his sister. Do I really have to add anything to show how complex he is?\\n\\n\r\nAnd Lelouch is not the only good character in this show. In fact, ALL the characters are awesome, either because they are deep or because they have a very strong personality.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, even the secondary characters have some story to tell. That makes the world of Code Geass REALLY DENSE. You don't just hear one story. You hear of a war, but you also hear of a mystic power that governs the world, but also of a story of redemption, of individual will, of life between racists Britannians and Japanese, ...\\n\\n\r\nThe one stronghold of characters in Code Geass is there is NO GOOD GUYS NOR BAD GUYS. Some are kind. Some are crazy dangerous. Some are hard to understand. Some are trash. Some are fun. Some betray their allies. Some join their original enemies.\\n\\n\r\nALL. ARE. HUMANS. With their own will, their own story, and their own interests.\\n\\n\r\nAnd THIS. IS. HOW TO WRITE CHARACTERS.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nThere is plenty to say on Code Geass. Yes, you can find some flaws in it. There is a bit of fanservice, some parts of it are hard to understand by watching only once, some parts don't even have proper explanations.\\n\\n\r\nBUT all this is very minor compared to the rest. Code Geass is THE MOST CLEVER SHOW EVER. Because the dialogues are brillant, because the fights are clever (it's not just a bunch of robots that destroy themselves), because the characters and their relationships are complex, because the philosophy is very deep and various, and because a lot happens through these 50 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't agree with it being clever, I highly suggest you watch it again, without bias.",

            "content": "You can see why Code Geass might not be for everyone. A story that awkwardly moves into metaphysics while not always making much sense; characters who seem to abruptly change their beliefs without as much as a blink; war strategy is often overshadowed by a simple arms race despite Lelouch constantly proclaiming superiority of \"strategy over tactics\"... True, Code Geass isn't perfect and can be frustrating but there is a lot of good here. It is one of the most enjoyable anime series I ever watched. Firstly, I loved the ending, I think the plot closes perfectly and compensates for the terrible cliffhanger that isthe ending of season 1. Secondly, I think Code Geass is a paragon of balancing fan-service and slapstick comedy into what is mostly a serious, dark story. My personal opinion is that comedy doesn't belong in a serious production, but Code Geass is one of the few shows where directors managed to strike the right amount of balance: the comedy doesn't feel out of place while providing a good amount of entertainment.\\n\r\nI will keep it short: if you are looking for something sophisticated, this is not Code Geass. Code Geass is a simple (albeit somewhat thought-provoking), very well made show. It does have strongly politicised story and somewhat philosophical angle but I see those as actually its weak points. It is a very enjoyable show about mechas, with cool characters, interesting plot twists and high budget animation. If you don't pick at the plot too much it comes together very nicely, and if we forget about the nitty-gritty details, and focus on the general message the show is trying to tell us, I think it is rather interesting. Especially considering we are looking at what is essentially a shounen production.",

            "content": "This second season is certainly better than the first one. While it\u2019s still melodramatic the execution is way better. Nonetheless, the fact that the anime keeps reminding me what happened before is terrible, it\u2019s like if the anime didn\u2019t have the confidence in me remembering it. \r\nAnother thing is the relationships between the characters which in my opinion while they were not excellent, they were very well develop. Yet, the execution of some key scenes weren\u2019t the best ones.\r\nCode Geass in this second season looked like a combination between Death Note in the first episodes, and Evangelion in the last ones. While this is notbad, it\u2019s certainly not even as good as the originals. The first episodes were great in my opinion, because they had that Death Note atmosphere of mental challenging for the protagonist, nonetheless the contrast in the scenes that were in the school were shockingly different, this due to a poor execution. While in this first arc of Code Geass was acceptable due to the situations, after that it\u2019s just feel forced.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end of Code Geass it resembles a little bit of Evangelion, with all of this philosophic dilemma, nonetheless, this dilemma has been put better in other animes such as Psycho-Pass, and it just seems that the mechas are there just to please the audience that loves mechas. It\u2019 more like a got used to it more than an actual reason to be there.\\n\\n\r\nThe execution of a lot of things were getting better the more it advanced, then again, a lot of things are resolved in Deus Ex Machina for most of us that have an anti-bullshit eye, just by luck more than any other thing or plan, or just put in there without any logical explanation.\\n\r\nA lot of potential in some characters is lost due to Lelouch, which in my opinion is not that big of a deal, I don\u2019t get how can people compare him to Light in some things, I mean, in war it\u2019s obvious that Lelouch, but pretty much other things, such as a plan to know things and get what he wants in a subtle way in order to protect his identity or clean his hands, Light is way out of his league. Anyway, Suzaku was very well executed in this second season, and while we could appreciate more C.C. a little bit more of her and explanations wouldn\u2019t have hurt anybody. And yes, I hated the fact that the creators putted a lot more fanservice in this season and yes, that they pretty much made Kallen a blond character with big boobs and good fighting skills. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s better, for me it was not worth it of that much of time. I watched this saga in 1 week, when I watched FMA: B in 3 days in pretty much the same conditions (summer vacations in both of these).\\n\\n\r\nIn total I would give 70/100 to this saga and a 74/100 to this season.\\n",

            "content": "I just finished watching this so this review might be all over the place. Please bear with me.\r\nStory 10/10: While the story went in unexpected directions in the first season, this season took it to a whole another level and thus this is definitely one of the most mind-fuck animes I've ever watched. I tried guessing what was going on whenever I was confused but then when things were actually revealed I was just left feeling stupid. It was amazing.\r\nArt 10/10: I really loved the art and animation in the first season, and that didn't change this time around. Since it was pretty much top-notchfrom the start, there was very little left to be improved, in my opinion of course, so I don't have much to say about this part.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: Sometime during this season I grew so attached to Jun Fukuyama's voice that now I couldn't imagine anyone else voicing Lelouch. The rest of the voice acting was amazing as well, with a lot of outstanding performances in the last episodes. The background music was different, but still frequently reused tracks from the first season, although I must say I felt more emotionally impacted by the new music, especially in the second half of the season. I loved the first opening and ending themes, but didn't much care about the others. I'm fine with that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: I generally have a hard time warming up to new characters especially if other characters I love are killed for them to have a place in the story, and that was true for some of the new faces in this, but I grew to love most of them by the end, and most of my favourite characters from the first season showed up here as well, even if some of them didn't have as big of a role as I would've wished. Overall the character aspect was incredibly satisfying, this season blessing us with some of the most complex and human characters in anime, and Lelouch's character arc got a wonderful, if sad, ending. The only complaint about the characters I have is Rolo's existence, whom I found useless and annoying and was glad when [redacted].\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: In the very beginning I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it as much as the first season, especially when I saw what direction the story was taking, but soon I was kept on the edge of my seat by every episode, so I managed to finish this season in two days as well. I did skip some action scenes to get to the plot evolution, but any complaints I might have can be overlooked thanks to the existence of the last episode, which might be my favourite anime episode like.... ever....\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: I know a lot of people don't love this season, but personally I found it even better than the first and it knocked Hunter x Hunter off the number 1 spot on my 'all time favourite anime' list so I would definitely recommend it to just about anyone. Now please excuse me while I go cry to 'Continued Story'.",

            "content": "I got in into this series for the robots, but Code Geass R2 blew me away with it's grandeur and characters more than anything. I honestly had no idea the plot would go the direction it did in the final half of R2, for which I commend my friends and colleagues on refraining from even hinting at the sheer scope of it. The final act ramped up the stakes, excitement, and everything exponentially.\r\nAs opposed to the first season, I became heavily invested in the characters in R2. And by characters I mean just Lelouch and Suzaku. I projected all of my unfulfilled desires held forKira from Death Note onto Lelouch's Zero, which effectively rendered any opposing force to him as a nuisance. I will tell you that with this narrow perspective, it was wholly satisfying, but even a more balanced opinion on the characters, plot, and moral greyness will leave you feeling intrigued and positively challenged throughout. There are a lot of allegiance changes that are supposed to be heart wrenching and dramatic, but they're easy to dismiss if you're team Zero all the way.\\n\\n\r\nThis time around they exchanged school hijinx and hard military robot action for high drama and super robots, which honestly harmonize much better together than did their preceding elements. At the beginning of R2 I was worried this season would be just as school-centric as the first, but much to my liking they weaned off of it to focus more on the actual story. Make no mistake, you still get a heaping helping of the whole school gang, but as the plot escalates they become less relevant. The shift from more grounded robots to high powered flying mechs played out at roughly the same pace, and fans of main character mechs from season one will be delighted to see their upgraded forms. My friends had sold me on the lack of tactics focus in R2 as a bad thing, but I was honestly much more engaged with the robot action, perhaps due to the more exciting color palatte, or maybe just because of the endearing characters within them.\\n\\n\r\nAround the end of the first season I realized there was actually a point to all of this and began to pay attention, and R2 cuts no corners in the themes department. It hits you with questions about government, allegiance, justification for terrible actions, and many more than I care to remember. If you want to dig deep you can probably find a lot of chin-stroking goodness here, but it's also enjoyable at a surface level (And also in a \"make fun of how hamhanded this is\" way). As expected there is plentiful Japanese cultural imagery and symbolism woven throughout, so much so that I'm convinced there is way more than a poor gaijin like myself could hope to discern. In the final act it gets HEAVY with the themes. At one point I felt a shift in the Evangelical (Evangelion-ical? Evangelion-istic?) direction, but luckily it corrected its course and steered clear of those waters towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was of such a consistent quality that I never took much time to think about it. There are little to no noticeable dips in budget in any episode (Except, perhaps, in the writing, like when they rehash a school plot from season one for the lulz). Out of the two pairs of openings and endings, the only one I didn't care for was the first OP. Right when it had started to grow on me, they changed it to \"World End\" by Flow. I honestly enjoyed these songs in their own right, but none of them can really compete with \"Colors.\" That one was a classic to me before I ever watched this series. One thing of note for both of the endings is their simplistic slideshow of beautiful character portraits. I hypothesize that these aided in my enjoyment of the series, as presenting me with pictures of everyone helped me digest who did what in each episode, what side they were on, and most importantly, plunged me straight into shipping territory. If that ain't effective, I don't know what is.\\n\\n\r\nNow excuse me while I go scavenge for some quality Lelouch x Suzaku fanfics. 10/10.",

I've had an average of 4-5 different views on characters just because of how well they've developed each of them. In one episode you'll be begging for this character to die, the next you'll be wishing that they'd come back. The story really playswith your emotions so it make the overall enjoyment much better.\\n\\n\r\nStory line: Mastapiece. Pretty complex. Might be hard for some people to keep up with.\\n\\n\r\nArt: On Point. They really captured the emotions and gave them unique expressions.\\n\\n\r\nSound : Beautiful. Soundtracks matched up perfectly with the mood/situation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Amazing. A lot of development for almost every relevant character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Outstanding. Suspense kept me on the edge of my seat at the end of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this series is a masterpiece. It's got a solid story-line accompanied by flawless art and beautiful soundtracks.

            "content": "I am not a pro when it comes to writing reviews. This is a good review to read for those who aren't Anime fanatics but do watch Anime occasionally as a hobby or during leisure time.\r\nFirst of all, Code Geass both R1 and 2 are really worth watching. R2 has more action and seems to have satisfied people's hunger for more Knightmare fighting then it did in R1. Guren, Lancelot, Shen hu are really amazing Knightmares.\r\nAside from that about the characters Lelouch, is a very likeable character, he is not only handsome but also highly intelligent. The storyline progressed great with his best friend andrival, Suzaku. Showing what a true friendship really is when both share the same views and values. They contrast one another, with Lelouch's outer appearance being devious and 'cruel', whilst Suzaku is more innocent and naive. I like how one another, yet are opposites give a vivid view to the audience of the strength in the friendship they share.\\n\r\n C.C's words of wisdom was one thing that really made me like how Code Geass explored the views it portrayed. Such as human's desire for happiness.\\n\r\nI like the symbolism of Zero's mask being used with metaphorical language, it related to me personally with my life. I tend to be fond towards any 'mask' metaphors/views.\\n\r\nThe art was great, the battles of the Knightmares was beautiful to an extent. Forgot what it was called but that moment when the Emperor released those souls, that was beautiful art. The way it twister in a circular motion towards the top embraced a dark atmosphere which opposed the bright light background. \\n\r\nThe story is what amazed me most, the way it progressed made it hard to predict what would happen at the end. I really praise the way love has been portrayed throughout the story. Especially how love and hate really outshone one another; without one or the other would've been weak. The whole of Code Geass there was a massive comparison between ideals of good and bad, and using media techniques to present that in an ironic way is what really made me fall in love with Code Geass.\\n\r\nCode Geass is by far, the most favourite Anime I have watched to far. \\n\r\nBy the way, Lelouch's voice is so masculine and really makes his character handsome!",

Probabilmente alla Sunrise e agli sponsors, che hanno fatto di tutto con le loro richieste per cambiare le idee degli autori: gi&agrave; modificare l'orario di R2 rispetto alla prima stagione, mettendolo la domenica pomeriggio, faceva capire come la Sunrise volesse qualcosa di ancora pi&ugrave; commerciale e adatto un po' ad ogni tipo di pubblico.\r\nE alloraa Taniguchi e Okouchi non &egrave; rimasto che abbozzare e costruire una sequela di colpi di scena, ribaltoni e cambi di alleanze ed altre trovate tra il ridicolo e l'assurdo, cosi da prendere in giro la Sunrise e una parte del pubblico, ma riuscendo spesso ad arrivare comunque all'epico e giungendo alla conclusione progettata agli albori, che chiude tutta la serie in un modo memorabile.\\n\r\nImpresso nella memoria, da questo punto di vista, rimarr&agrave; l'episodio 21 che, nella maniera pi&ugrave; bizzarra possibile, ribalta tutte le teorie che gli spettatori si erano fatte fin l&igrave;, ridicolizza alcuni personaggi fino al quel punto mitizzati, ma riesce ad essere ad ogni modo assolutamente esaltante.\\n\\n\r\nLe potenzialit&agrave; mal sfruttate comunque sono tante? Si. Alcuni personaggi (Cornelia e Kallen su tutti) risultano in R2 mal impiegati e sviluppati? E' vero. Non tutti i colpi di scena sono in effetti da salvare e ben congeniati? Giusto. C'&egrave; qualche resurrezione di troppo? Senza dubbio. Come amalgama della storia, guardando tutta l'epopea nelle sue due stagioni, il meglio lo abbiamo fino alla Battaglia di Narita, prima che tutto da l&igrave; cominci poi a procedere a strappi e a momenti topici isolati, con alcuni episodi francamente da buttare o che si salvano in extremis a volte solo per alcune scene? D'accordissimo. Tanti difetti che farebbero buttare la sceneggiatura nel cestino.\\n\\n\r\nMa rimane il fatto che resta lo stesso un'affascinante faida famigliare, un' epica e a tratti struggente metafora di un mondo impazzito (ed escludendo le esagerazioni e la poca verosimiglianza che la serie possiede, mondo non troppo dissimile da quello vero) che riesce a trovare la sua pace e la ragione quando tutto sembra perduto. Pace che, per essere ottenuta, bisogna essere in grado di saper pagare dei sacrifici.\\n\r\nUn inno alla giovent&ugrave; in grado di abbattere un sistema retto da valori vecchi ed egoistici, creandone uno pi&ugrave; giusto.\\n\\n\r\nTutto questo &egrave; s&igrave; anche, e forse per lo pi&ugrave;, un giocattolone stupido, ma &egrave; stato terribilmente divertente e geniale pure nella stupidit&agrave;, cos&igrave; da superare quel confine che fa in modo che, un'opera che ha tutti i crismi per essere mediocre, possa diventare invece uno stracult. Una serie per pochi ma non per tutti XD.\\n\\n\r\nAll hail Lelouch!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Siccome &egrave; la seconda volta che scrivo quersta review prego i mod di non toccarla! Mi sono stufato, imparatevi l'italiano!\\n\\n\\n\r\ntext in english:\\n\\n\r\nIn the end all ended in the most logical and poetic as possible.\\n\r\nFinal moving, as many times if they are seen recently, which gives a meaning to a season that seemed beyond derail any logical sense.\\n\\n\r\nBut what has been an incredible performance this season? Probably the Sunrise and the sponsors, who have done everything with their requests to change the ideas of authors already changing the time R2 compared to the first season, putting it on Sunday afternoon, was how the Sunrise wanted something more commercial and some suitable 'for all audiences.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then to Taniguchi and Okouchi was not that sketch and build a series of blows to the scene, ribaltoni and changes of alliances and other found between ridiculous and absurd, so to be taken around the Sunrise and a part of the public, but often able to get anyway EPI and the conclusion is designed to dawn that brings the entire series in a memorable way.\\n\r\nImprinted in the memory, from this point of view, remain the episode 21 which, in the most bizarre possible limelight all the theories that viewers had made since then, some people mockery until that point mitizzati, but manages to be at Anyway absolutely exhilarating.\\n\\n\r\nThe potential still poorly exploited lot? Yes. Some characters (Cornelia and Kallen at all) in R2 are poorly developed and used? It 'true. Not all the shots on stage are actually save well from congenital? Right. There is some resurrection too? Without a doubt. As amalgam of history, looking across the epic in his two seasons, the best we have until the Battle of Narita, before everything starts from there then to proceed with tears and moments topical isolated, with some episodes frankly be thrown or that save in extremis sometimes for only a few scenes? D'agree. Many defects that would throw the script in the trash.\\n\\n\r\nBut the fact remains that the same remains a fascinating family feud, an 'epic and drawn struggente metaphor of a crazy world (and excluding any exaggerations and little likelihood that the series possesses the world not too dissimilar from the one true) that can find his peace and reason when all seems lost. Peace that to be achieved, we must be able to know how to pay sacrifices.\\n\r\nA hymn to youth to break down a system governed by old values and selfish, creating a more just.\\n\\n\r\nAll this is yes also, and perhaps for the most part, a giocattolone stupid, but it was terribly funny and clever and in stupidity, so as to overcome the border that makes sure that a work that has all crismi to be mediocre, could instead become a stracult. A series for a few but not all XD.\\n\\n\r\nALL HAIL Lelouch!\\n",

            "content": "Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2 the sequel to popular anime, Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch, it picks up straight after the events of season 1. For those who have watched season 1, this sequel is a must watched, with many aspects the same, we get to see once more Lelouche's mind put to work creating epic scenes that makes viewers go \"Wow\".\r\nStory 10\r\nCode Geass, has one of the best anime stories ever, although the scenario is your typical, War mecha kinda anime, its the content that truly makes this amazing. Almost all of Lelouche's battle are so clever, with each scene leaving the viewerspeechless unable to comprehend what just happened and unable to take in all the epicness that had just occurred. Unlike Season 1, Season 2 is more worldwide affecting other countries such as China, although Japan is still the main focus of course, also there is more emphasis on the Geass story line aswell rather than just a season based on a simple rebellion. The ending of Code Geass, is truly unique, it is by far one of the most cleverest ending i have ever witnessed, it left me literally speechless and made me constantly think \"Wow Lelouche your an absolute boss\". Its an ending that all anime viewers must witness. I have personally been on youtube and watched it probably at least 5 times =P\\n\\n\r\nArt 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great, unlike other mecha animes, with literally showing only 1 kind of soldier unit, code Geass actually has more than 1 kind of soldier unit. Each character is beautifully designed, C.C bright green hair and her weird suit getup shows just how weird she is. Karen is as always placed in ridiculously ecchi position, but male viewers cant help but love them =P, i know i was one of them =P.  Suzaku's new appearance helps develop his character, and shows just how important he has become in part of the Britannia empire. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8\\n\\n\r\nThe sound like all animes, are nothing special it has appropriate music at the right times that creates and develop's the mood. Although what always get is the britannia OST that always play when the words \"All Hail Britannia\" comes up, it creates an atmosphere that makes you think \"Shit's about to go down\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10\\n\\n\r\nFollowing from Season 1, most of the main cast appear in Season 2. Lelouche and Karen's relationship deepens as Karen finally knows Lelouche is Zero, while knowing this secret Lelouche can't help but depend on Karen more and more, it also helped to create unforgettable moments when something bad happened with their relationship. C.C is the same as ever, but conveying more trust this time for Karen, and her relationship with lelouche strengthens throughout the series, developing an even deeper trust for each other. Lelouche is still the same character as ever, but this time his emotions is played even more with several unexpected character appearances that leaves you shocked. One of the characters that truly touched me was Shirley, her undying love for Lelouche was something truly amazing, that i couldn't help but cry at the end of Shirley's story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\\n\r\nHonestly how could you not enjoy this anime?. Who doesn't like massive battles, with strategies so clever that makes you go \"What the F*** just happened\" every time. While having a lot of action, it still manages to throw in a lot of drama, that develops the story and Lelouche's character as a whole (mainly emotionally). With each dramatic story that occurred, you can't help but feel for Lelouche and be attached to him, with some stories it just shows that even though he is so incredibly clever, he sometimes still are unable to protect the ones closest to him and that he is truly helpless sometimes. The ending of this anime is something you will definitely enjoy, i won't spoil it for you but if you watch it you have one hell of a ending waiting for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is darn right amazing overall, its cleverness, its tear jerking scenes, the fight scenes, the drama and the story not a lot of animes could have done a more perfect job in my opinion. I often think to myself \"Man i wish i could forget about this anime and rewatch it from scratch and experience the same epicness over and over again\", but obviously that cant happen =(. While I do wish for another season, I think the ending of Code Geass is just so perfect that another season will simply ruin the magic created. For viewers that want a Mecha anime, with incredible drama/battle strategies, then Code Geass is a must watch!!",

IT WAS SO BRILLIANT AND AMAZING, AND IT DID NOT IN ANY WAY FEEL LIKE A WASTE OF TIME. \r\n***SPOILERS IN HERE*****\r\nIn fact there was no filler episodes, every episode contributed to the series' plot. It was so heart breaking and sad,  when certain characters died and when characters changed. I was shocked and surprised to see it play out the way it did, all I can say it that Lelouch was a truly brilliant mind and there is I was sad tosee him o like that. It really got right there when his little sister finally understood what he was doing and told him that she loved him one last time before he died. I was so done. Lelouch was a truly incredible person and I found myself during the last episodes, besides in tears, knowing that I loved him as a character. Code Geass is one of the best anime I have ever seen, and I would watch it again, but I already know all the twist and turns. I hope you watch this and enjoy this season as much as I did. \\n\\n\r\nI also feel really sad for Suzaku because he had to kill his best friend and hide his own face from the world for as long as he lived. If he ever dies. I just want Lelouch and Suzaku to meet again so they can be friends again like before. Those two are truly the team that can do anything.",

            "content": "Here  we  have  Code  Geass: Hangyaku  no  Lelouch  R2...\r\n  Before  i  start  to  analyze  my ratings   i'd  like  to  say  that  having  heard  so much  praising  for  this  anime  my  expectations  were  quiet  high  to  begin  with.\r\n  Generally  while  R1  had  so  much  potential  for  a  deep  and  original  plot , R2  came  to  wreckany p rogress  R1  had  made towards   a  unique  and  truly  meaningful  show.                                                                                                       \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\\n\r\n  While  the  flow  in  R1  was  easy  to  follow  yet  fulled  with   plot  twists  and  unexpected  events  nicely  mingled  around  the  main  character's objective,  R2  follows  a  too  fast  pacing  targeting   to  \"paralyze\"  the  viewer  with  shocking  but  poor  and   in  the  end  meaningless  twists  leaving  the  viewer  with  a \"mindfucked\"  impression  so  that  its  plenty  plot  holes  go  by  unoticed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\n  Even  if everyone  says  the  art  is  one  of  the  strongest points  of  the  anime  i  think  i'll  have  to  disagree. If  i  had   to describe  the  character  art  i'd  say  \"over-streched  moe  beings\". Ofcourse  having  seing  the  manga's  art  it's  clear  that they  were designed  as  they were  depicted  in  the  manga. However  having  the sam  overstylized  character designes  as  some  light  novel  adaptations,  it's really  hard in  my opinion  to  take  this  anime  seriously  even  if  it  has  to  do  with  mature  and  violent  themes.  Another con  considering  the art is  repetitive  and  overacting  idles of  some  characters  such  as Zero's  ( that  over-dramatic  hand  move  he  makes  every  time  he  thinks  he's  saying  something  big) or  the guy  who could  read  thoughts  (with  his getting-on-one's-nerves  clap clap). Well at least the mecha designs weren't THAT bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\\n\r\n  Thankfully i was pleased by the musical investment  of  the show  and  the opening-ending  songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\n  It wasn't in fact coincidental that i wasn't moved by most of the character's deaths because simply most of them didn't have any character (development)! Lelouch was the angst-revenge-magically ingenious type of character and while at least in R1 we could see some of his inner monologue thoughts in R2 he just acts with no known motive until literally his lasts moments so he can become the martyr for the later good in the eyes of the viewers, but serisously in R2 Lelouch became for at least the half season just a stranger in my eyes. Then you got Suzaku and his ever ending dilemas until suddently all of them are gone and becomes a faithful follower in the requiem zero plan showing not real emotion from at least the second half of the season and on. Lastly we got Jeremiah who Suddently in turns to Lelouch side even though loyalty to Queen Marrian doesn't justify at all why he wants to be faithfull to Lelouch since until then his willpower seemed to be taking revenge from Zero/Lelouch. There are a bunchfull of characters who suddently turned the complete opposite for no real reason like King Charles and Queen Marrian, etc...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\n To be honest when i started the series i was wandering from the inside \"What makes people put this show so high on their lists?\". Sadly i was left with the same question till the very end of the show whose main objective seemed to be just to \"hook\" the viewer with some cheap plot twists and get a good sponsorship from yall' good \"pizza hut\" (seriously the commercial intention was too strong with this one). Even the fanservice seemed out of place as everyone would just go silly in these events making it seem more like a fanservice ova/filler. Well at least the battles could somehow keep you satisfied before they became too repetitive and unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: you must be too easily impressed to seriously hype so much about a show that mix and matches mecha with school drama and yall' good \"revenge\" angst. It was just a Frankenstain show trying out its commercial skills",

As an engineering student, it picked my interest because the technology used in the series are very advanced although it exceeds the technology in the real word. Even it has a supernatural aspects and some super power, it was really captivating. In fact, the advanced technology, fighting scenes and the powers presented are the factors which make this series capable of being an intriguing one. Also, the planning and making a strategy before commencing an attack are also one of my favorites. Now, let's continue for my own opinion about this series.\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n\tThe story tells us about the imperialism of Great Britain to Japan. As to be expected in an imperialistic scenes, there is war and lot of bloodshed. There are lot of ideologies presented in this story as to how to defeat the whole empire but there is only one stands and that ideology is the most impossible among others. However, within the series, this ideology makes sense and forge justice and that ideology will be forced to accomplish by a mere 17/18-year old student who has a brain and power to defy the whole empire. It becomes a trigger to make the series awesome. As the series continue, lot of dramatic moments shown and it will make you cry so much. Every death will be depicted in some episodes and makes your heart broken. Also, it has a lot of plot twist. The chronological events are also well done however it is not perfect. For the ending, I really don't know how to make a suggestion for it because I am really speechless when I watched the ending. It made me depressed. It so sad that make me cry a lot. In overall, the author did a great job for the story. The story was really one of my favorites because of its uniqueness from others. \\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\n\tThe art is so good and very well done too. Also, the high graphics amazed me. The fighting scenes is great that's why it was really intensifying. Furthermore, the sound throughout the series was amazing. The sound effects in fighting scenes made an utmost awesomeness and also in death scenes of some characters. Because of the sound effects, the death scenes make me depressed. In general, both sound and art in this series help a lot to become one of those masterpiece anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis series did not disappoint me perhaps it exceeds my expectations. I really enjoy it. This series is a masterpiece. \\n",

            "content": "Story - The Sequel to the famed Season 1 Of Code Geass does just as good as it's predecessor if not even better. Hooking you in every moment of the way with a new Dilemma arising at the end of every episode. I mean c'mon who doesn't love cliffhangers! The story starts of a year after the events of season one with Lelouch having no memory whatsoever of ''Zero'' Living an ordinary life but unknowingly being watched by the Britannia government\r\nBut by the end of episode 1 we get the Lelouch we love The Miracle maker who's prepared to do whatsoever to achieve his goalof world domination.\\n\r\nI found myself more pulled in to season 2 then season 1 as they add many more dynamics to it such as new characters with motivations always changing as the story progresses and Situations where you start to think ''oh s**t How's he gonna get out of this'' But also Surprising deaths that even got myself tearing up a bit. But the glory of this miracle Anime Is towards the final 7-8 Episodes Where S**t Really goes down and you find yourself in awe with events such as the meaning of what Geass And C's Really is! As for the Ending Which I just finished today, I have to say hands down I did not expect it to make me feel so much emotion for certain characters And Is Definitely in my Opinion The ''Greatest anime Ending of all time'' \\n\\n\r\nArt- While I'm not the biggest fan of the art it does have some sort of merit to it which cannot be changed and you wouldn't want it to be changed because it wouldn't be Code Geass Without The Specifically Character Designed Stick-man. But as for the Mecha Battles I Have too say the animation had me pulled in with the Awesome Battles Between these Awesome Mech Robots with each battle got you rooting for a different Mech! Don't be fooled the animation is beautiful with vibrant colors and beautiful backgrounds to match...But I guess I'm more of a fan of the 2014 and so on Animation But I do Give it a Princiefied Thumbs up to the standards during those times.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The Soundtrack goes so well with the scenes and gives liveliness to each scene. While I'm not biggest fan of soundtracks during anime and I don't really listen out to the Ost's Playing in the back As Long as it gives the right feeling to the scene I'm watching then your doing something right In this case Code Geass did. As for the Ost ''Stories'' When It played during Certain Scenes It fits perfect and gave me chills everywhere. If only they played it more. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - I have absolute no problem here as I love to get involved with the characters of a deep compelling story and I'm sure most of us do! And Code Geass does this perfect as it gives each and every character if not there moment to shine there Progression as a character and motives that even we can relate to. Such as Lelouch having such a deep Inventive personality never before seen on any anime out there shouldering the power to take on the world you really do feel for the struggles he faces on the journey to world domination and the character development he goes through but the whole cast goes through. A comparison I would like to make Is ''Light From Death note To Lelouch'' Light being a sociopathic man which I personally loved to an even Crazier man hellbent on becoming god of the world. Whilst Lelouch is in a sense similar. He really just meant good for the world. Even if he had done the things he had done he had his reasons and it was the only way to Achieve World peace so he shouldered that on himself to take war on and banish It from the world Of Geass. That alone makes him one of the greatest Main protagonist/antagonist in all of anime history.As For Nina She's just ''annoying'' Well Hell I guess even by the end you feel somewhat sympathy for her....ah Hell no she's annoying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - After watching Season 1 Of Geass I was so excited to get onto Season 2 But I Never imagined myself Finishing it within the time span of two days...which took a few brain cells away from me But I don't regret It one bit and would watch the Dub All over again just for the sheer enjoyment of it. I found myself episode after episode wanting to find out what's going to happen next...Not many Anime out there do this but I guess Geass is just one of them Special ones You just have to love.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Code Geass Has to be one of my Favorite Anime of all time Season 1 Included The series makes you feel for the world as we can compare our world with The Brittanian World, and there Onslaught of the Japanese Makes you really Detest the Britannia Empire and the system They have put up Which makes it similar to our world. With things such as poverty and war and even ''God'' But Hell I do have to say it's been a one ride I've been on It's shame It's ended and I Can't re-erase my memory and watch the whole thing again Haha. But If your an Anime Viewer and still haven't seen Code Geass I Recommend you go watch it as soon as possible At least to the third episode to when it starts picking up. Hands down One of the Greatest anime out there as for now....''All Hail Emperor Lelouch''",

            "content": "There is a reason why Lelouch vi Britannia is considered to be arguably the greatest anime character of all time. As this is the sequel to the 2006 anime, Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 is definitely worth the watch.\r\nStory= 10/10. What is justice? Is there such a thing in war? Are the despicable means that terrorists use really not worth it in the end? More specifically, do the ends justify the means? This anime portrays the harrowing concept of war perfectly through all its horrors, more specifically through the experiences and broken relationships of those in the front lines. The way this animeis able to make its viewers look up towards heroic characters is mind-blowing. This anime shows the emotional roller coaster of what it means to be a true hero, one that wears a mask, a facade. \\n\\n\r\nArt= 10/10. May not be the most beautiful compared to some other works, but is definitely outstanding compared to other anime of its time and of today. \\n\\n\r\nSound= 10/10, Nothing screams 'Military' or 'War' or 'Loss' more than the glorious soundtrack of Code Geass: R2. It is amazing, heartbreaking, and filled with emotion and drama. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter= 9/10. I honestly, for a lack of better words, do not think there is an anime character I dislike more than Suzaku Kururugi because of how stupid he is. His character is poorly written when he should have been able to figure out the fact that his best friend is not entirely at fault for their problems. Suzaku's whole \"I'll stop this violence with more violence!\" ideology is another reason why I dislike him. In fact, there are many lovable and loathsome characters in this show. Also, there is way too much 'teasing the ship' between Lelouch and C.C; I really hope those two are shown as an official couple in season 3.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment= 10/10. This anime was very psychological in a way; \"I've got a plan for your plan for my plan for your plan.\" I love that, especially in action/military stories where the main character is trying to anticipate the moves of his enemies while they're doing the same thing. I was hooked onto this anime from season 1 to the end. Code Geass became my all time favorite show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10/10. Code Geass is a masterpiece and will forever have a very special place in my heart as my #1 favorite anything, really; there are no anime's, movies, video games, TV shows, sports, musicians, or books that can even come close to how much I love this show. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, I recommend watching this anime in the English dub; the casting and voice acting is also my #1 favorite with Lelouch having my favorite voice actor, Johnny Yong Bosch!",

I'm writing a review to tell you people who've yet to watch Code Geass and Code Geass R2 their awesomeness.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe series is the epitome of unpredictability. It's so well forged that the story goes on smoothly will little inconsistencies. Although it gets confusing at some points, it quickly gets you back in track with abrupt developments and turns. The happenings all throughout the series are utterly mind-blowing; hearts arebroken, bridges are burned, relationships are shattered and recreated, and loves are rekindled. Finishing this whole series is a great achievement and experience in itself and I dare say that it isn't an exaggeration. Code Geass may even be on par with some old anime legends (saying as someone who has watched the old mecha legend, Neon Genesis Evangelion).\\n\\n\r\nThis series, R2, the second series of Code Geass, kick-starts from where the first season ended, but with a surprise. Let's be honest with this point, the story gets a bit frustrating, but in a good way; I call it ambivalent. The art and sounds are top-notch (although I'm not a big fan of the way CLAMP makes their characters). The characters are (1 out of the scale of 10) somehow insipid, but individualistic.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion to the series is satisfying.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is a spectacle that everybody must watch. There will be no room for regret once you see it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: 10 out of 10!\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: The third season has been announced and will soon be released.",

            "content": "I came to the conclusion that this anime, no matter what, is still very very popolar even after 9 years it aired on Japanese and Western televisions.  Objectively, this is not very much considering that other animes are much older and they survived to this day with still praise and such.   I think that the popularity of ''Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2'' is to be attributed mainly to the outstanding overall plot and its particular setting, which i honestly found original and exectued perfectly until the end.   Here are my scores:\r\nStory: 10/10.   I gotta admit, the firsttime i watched Code Geass (the first season, which i also found great) i was having hard times understanding the plot and thought of it as pretty boring because i couldn't make up my mind about the progression of the story which was a bit slow on the first episodes, in fact i dropped the anime initially. Then, after some years, i recollected my thoughts about it and decided to give it another shot and goddamn it.  I was completely blown away and impatient to see the second season, and after seeing it i now i can say that in it's one of the most beautifully crafted and complex story i've ever seen in any anime, and in general.   This second season just owhermelmed me with a great array of feelings, and every episode (especially those at the end) left me agape and with shivers down my spine.   It left so many impressions to me that i almost couldn't sleep at night for the hype of seeing the next episode the day after!  And this is saying much because many times the plot of an anime needs to be really, really good to grab my attention to this extent, and this story did much much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10.  One of the reasons i first dropped Code Geass was because i didn't liked to the slightest the design of the characters that to me were too innatural and a bit funny to see.  But when i rewatched the first season and the second now i realised i was wrong considering the design so superficially based only on the characters, because the Mecha design is very good and the animation studio did a really good job especially in the most gripping scenes.  And i gotta say, the delivery of the feelings on the face of the characters, and especially Lelouch, are also handled efficiently improving the overall immersion in the story.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10.  There are two opening, both performed by Flow, which are alternative rock based and i liked them both especially the voice of the singer.  The overall soundtrack it's like coming straight from an orchestra ensemble, and i can't say much else because you should personally listen to understand it first but i can assure you that it is Powerful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10.  Well, we finally came here.  It's too difficult to even trying to understand fully the main character, Lelouch Vi Britannia, because his intentions are ambigous and his way of thinking is absurdely polyhedral, making him a tremendously intricated person and one of the best characters ever created .   Nonethless his personality is fleshed out so perfectly that it almost makes you believe that he is wandering with his Geass among us right now.   His friend and sister, respectively Suzaku Kururugi and Nunnaly, are also extremely well constructed and we can clearly see their personal evolution over the 25 episodes.   The remaining cast is huge, i think about 35-40 characters in all, but many of them are well written almost as the three main protagonists, and that's definitely remarkable from the creators of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10.  It made me glued to my chair all the time, shivers descending my spine at every twist and ensuing conflicts, at every moments of joy or utter despair.   It was so powerful that i can't really describe it in mere words.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10. ''Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2'' its deeply emotional, gripping, extremely intelligent plot-wise, and at times all-around merciless.  It's a story about comprimeses, decisions, friendship, family in a setting reminiscent of a giant chess table with every moves that can pose no threats to others or destroying them in every way.  In conclusion i consider this anime one of the greatest of all time, and hope that its popularity will continue to grow more and more. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Code Geass - Lelouch of the Rebellion...It is THE anime to watch. If you watch it, you will NEVER regret watching this. I'll make this a short synopsis so there's really no spoilers. Here you are! This anime starts off with a war between Japan and Britannia. The Japanese are defeated and are now called Area 11. A young boy named Lelouch Lamperouge who is a pure genius despises his country Britannia, where he currently lives. He is an \"ordinary\" student who attends Ashford Academy as a part of the Student Council. He has a younger sister named Nunnally who is blind and crippled fromseeing their mother die in front of her eyes. She wishes for a more peaceful, gentler world with no war/fights going on everyday and he aims to make her wish come true and will do whatever it takes to make it come true... He then obtains a power called the Geass from a girl named C.C and uses it to make that wish come to reality... \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is NOT boring. It's FAR from boring. The drawings are by CLAMP and as usual, amazing drawings. A simple, but incredible plot. UNBELIEVABLE PLOT TWISTS. I'm really picky about the anime I watch and this is the best anime I have ever watched in my life. This anime just makes you want more and more and more. It makes you utterly obsessed with it. Or at least addicted to it. The background music is simply INGENIUS. It really mixes in with all the different events that happen. The characters' personalities are really well-made up. Each are all unique and everything about it is just incredible. This anime isn't exactly for kids. It's complicated and some parts are confusing and hard to keep up with. So I'd have to say 13+ should watch it. Or maybe even older. I say 13+ because I watched it when I was 13 and I understood most of it. It has the perfect mix of everything. Action. Drama. Comedy. Romance. Horror. School Life. What're you still reading this for? You should already have started watching this by now! So go and start this incredible anime!",

Fans of mechs, dizzying plot twists, rapidly paced action and storytelling, or just anime in general will likely fall in love with this series.\r\nWith the conclusion of R2, the series is brought to a surprisingly satisfying conclusion. With the never-ending plot twists and ever-developing characters, it had begun to feel the series couldn't wrap it all up in the final episodes, but it does, in a far cleaner, truer way than I thought possible. If you enjoying the firstseason, then you already know exactly why you should watch the second. If are debating whether to continue watching, then you're a fool. The second season is as good, and better, than the first, and will keep you just as rabidly enthralled as before, if not even more so.",

            "content": "Full Title: Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2\r\nYear: 2008\r\nGenres: Mecha, Drama, Action, Science Fantasy\r\nEpisodes: 25\r\nAge Rating: PG-13 (Language, Violence)\r\nR2 picks up where Code Geass left off, and like its predecessor it pulls you in from the very first episode. The Black Knights have been defeated, Japan is safely under Britannian rule, and Lelouch is just a normal student driving down the highway with his brother. If you've seen Code Geass, you should already have some questions: what happened to Lelouch and Suzaku, why does Lelouch have a brother, and how has Lelouch returned to his old life? R2 is full of such quandaries andeasily distinguishes itself from Code Geass as the more suspenseful series. It is in R2 that all of the answers to the questions set up by Code Geass will be revealed, and this alone makes it a smash hit.\\n\\n\r\nR2 features the same beautiful animation as that in Code Geass, but as the Knightmares take to the sky and each side tries to outdo the other with new technological strength, the fights and special powers are even more impressive. My sentiments toward the voice cast remain as they were when I reviewed Code Geass, and it's really nice to see Spike Spencer join the English cast to play Rolo (see Shinji in Neon Genesis Evangelion, Hanataro in Bleach). As for the OST, I've seen a number of reviews hailing R2's as superior to Code Geass', but I didn't notice any significant difference. Both OSTs are awesome and feature great nobility and action-packed themes (of note are \"Boy from Britannia,\" \"Area,\" and \"Concealment\").\\n\\n\r\nAs was mentioned, R2 is incredibly suspenseful, even moreso than Code Geass, but as much as this can be an asset it can be a problem, too. With such suspense comes twists of epic proportions, and sometimes I found myself scoffing at the plot development. If you've seen Code Geass and found the major twist in episode 23 too outrageous for your tastes, then you will probably be disappointed with the \"creativity\" of R2. Occasionally things are just too convenient and, even for an anime like this, unbelievable. Still, I can't deny that for every episode, regardless of its believability, my eyes were glued to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nOn a final note, what an ending! This is probably the first anime that had me choked up and on the verge of tears. What's more, if you pay close attention during the final 5 episodes, you will determine the answer to the ultimate question: what happens to Lelouch? This just goes to demonstrate the level of depth that is there in R2 if you seek it, and I think such unpretentious depth is what makes it such an appealing series. If you're younger or disinterested in deeper plots, there are plenty of badass mecha fights, cool powers, and delightful characters to make R2 worth your time. If you're looking for a show with deeper philosophical meaning, you should be very satisfied as well, and in this respect I found R2 comparable to Neon Genesis Evangelion and Wolf's Rain. But if you're like me and you are looking for both, then you should watch R2 (and Code Geass, of course) or you'll really be missing out.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9.3/10\\n\r\nAudio: 9.1/10\\n\r\nStoryline: 9.6/10\\n\r\nOverall Score: 9.5/10 (Masterpiece)\\n\\n\r\nCheck out my blog for snapshots and high quality episode/OST downloads at http://animefiend.blogspot.com\\n",

Code Geass, R2 takes all the promise of it's predecessor and builds on it, becoming without a doubt one of the best anime second seasons out there. Here's a breakdown of the scores: [warning, spoilers may apply!]\r\n1. Story. The story picks up a year after the last season ended. Despite the gap, the story is immediately engaging, and with enough background that a newcomer wouldn't be completely lost. So, ten out of ten.\r\n2 and 3. It may be cheating, but I usually wad these two sections into one and call it 'style.' For style, I give thisone a nine, if only because the animation is a bit simple at times. Still, the music and the artwork lend itself to the focus of the story, which is the characters and not the action surrounding them. \\n\r\n4. Characters! If I could, I would give this a twenty. It's not because they're my favorite characters of all time, it's because each of them is developed and treated like a real person. This is the single best fact about this anime, each character is as round as the could possibly be.\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment. This is my lowest mark, at seven, but only because the storyline and characters were so engaging I was actually angry at some points. Still, this series truly involves the mind, which I do appreciate greatly. \\n\r\n6. Finally, the overall marks. As you can see, I've given it full marks, and for all of the above points. Frankly, this anime couldn't have been done better if it tried.\\n\r\nEven  the dub is excellent, which is saying something.",

            "content": "Code Geass R2 is sitting pretty on myanimelist with a score of 9.00. The real question is, does it deserve this score? Sort of kinda maybe but not really.\r\nStory 7/10 \r\nThe first season had a great story which I really enjoyed, but Code Geass R2's story got so ridiculous at some points (such as that entire Sword of Akasha episode) that I couldn't help myself from laughing. They decided to throw in tons of random characters that are very very skilled at fighting among other things assuming that no one would question why the fuck they weren't helping Japan against the Black Knights in Season1. They topped this clusterfuck of a story off with probably the greatest and most satisfying end to an anime in existence, so that's nice.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 \\n\r\nBesides the triangle faces the art style is pretty basic and smooth\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThis show definitely has some good voice actors, that's including the dub Lelouch. His evil laugh gave me some serious chills.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10 \\n\r\nHere is where the clusterfuck of a story is redeemed, the enjoyment factor of this show is strictly a \"dumb fun\" type enjoyment, where as long as you turn your brain off completely, you should be fine. While \"dumb fun\" enjoyment isn't as fulfilling and memorable as the enjoyment you'll get from storytelling masterpieces like Madoka Magica and Death Note, it's still fun in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI feel like they tried too hard to appeal to the masses after the success of season 1, but it's a good 25 episodes nonetheless, and the ending will always be one of my favorites.\\n\\n",

His father was basically the Emperor of the whole Empire, and he had lots of princes.. Lelouch was 11th prince of the Britannian Empire.\r\nUpon Lelouch's mom assassination and his fathers unconcern about Lelouch or Nunnally, Lelouch though that his father was the author of this crime, making him swear that he will take revenge upon his father and all the empire itself,which include his brothers of course. Years after his mom assassination, none of the princes knew Lelouch was still alive.. ooh.. but he was.. and he got back with a psychic power known as Geass wich he accidentaly got during an eventual event. Geass is basicaly a power that can make anyone do what you say just by looking at his eyes. Badass if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime right here.. for me.. is the best anime I've ever seen, it has  action, it has mental game action (just like Death Note), it has some sort of comedy in some parts, altough for the most part its a serious anime, with alot of sad and worse!..  really depressing moments.. it will give you chills and it will give you a sense of acomplishment although you didnt acomplish anything, this meaning.. it will imerse you in its world. The ending of this anime, it's.. god.. magical?.. one of its kind?.. idk, I just know it's an ending that will make you feel at ease, depressed and happy.. it grants you all that in a moment of 10 minutes. Best. Ending. Ever. \\n\\n\r\nStory: it's a masterpiece lilke story, it has all its elements, and always makes you wanna watch the next episode, since nearly all the episodes are epic.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Altough at first I didnt like the art, when you actually start caring about the anime, and paying really good attention to it, you kinda feel that the art of it, is.. well.. beautiful. I don't know how to explain this to you.. you should watch the anime to get what I'm saying ;)\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, all the voice actors are amazing, I really like Lelouch's voice, it gives that sense of superiority xD the OST is amazing as well, btw, the Bitannian Athem is EPIC.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: All the character of this anime, feel right, they never move out of their personality, they really feel real. Nearly all of them have an important part to play in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I LOVED IT, as I told you before, it's an amazing anime, a masterpiece itself, my favourite anime, how could I not rate this anime a 10 out of 10? \\n\\n\r\nI suggest.. no.. I COMMAND YOU to watch this anime if you are into masterpieces.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let's see... I won't only write a review based on R2 but also from R1. But of course majority (I think it will) will be from R2.\r\nStory: -rating 8-\r\nJust like R1, R2 story also bring unexpected things to make it more exciting. But flaws hit it pretty good here in R2. Unexpected things ARE nice, but if it moving too fast it will leave holes. So Marianne is alive, but Lelouch just goes like \"no worries! I only cares about my sister..\" I let it pass. \"This sword (thingy) will change the world!\" Said charles. I just goes like... Oh OK... You just ruined theimage of a perfect smart evil Charles here...  Or maybe like \"hey! I'm the ruler of China! I'm still a kid and never goes outside in my life before but i can speak Japanese!\" ... some things like that pretty much affected the story and make me feels like I'm thinking too much to actually realizes what had happened... Of course the ending were perfect.. Suzaku still have that inhuman skill, and Nunally still very sensitive towards other people's feeling so... Well the inhuman skill thingy still makes me feels weird but it actually perfected the ending. It fix the story mess in the few previous episodes so an 8 are worth it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: -rating 9-\\n\r\nThe art didn't changed from R1. But since my review here cover both Rs, my opinions for the art is pretty nice.. At first glance, I hesitate to watch Code Geass because the art are not my liking. In fact, the art really bothered me to the point I actually  drop R1 at first episode before. But since lately I don't really have material that I wanted to watch lately, I decided to watch Code Geass... Now that I'm used to it, the art is pretty nice and Lelouch actually looks really cool... But of course I give it a 9 because how long the body length is still feels weird.\\n\\n\r\nSound: -rating 10-\\n\r\nActually.. I never really comments much for sounding.. I guess my experience with anime isn't wide enough for me to notice anything with the sounding.. So I just gave it a 10 because nothing actually bothers me..\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: -rating 8-\\n\r\nMost of the essential characters are pretty well made. Their personality varied so it never get boring. Here are my a little detailed opinions on each and grouped characters:\\n\r\n*Lelouch: this character overall is pretty much 9/10. I wanted to give 10/10 but some things quite bothers me. A genius character and not so naive over killings or friendship power is pretty rare lately, so Lelouch strong points are these. But his obsession with Nunally's happiness are too high. And kissing with some girls without thinking it too much makes him like a bit out of character (IMHO).\\n\r\n*C.C.: my favorite character, so the overall is of course 10/10. Quiet, not a whinny, got skills, not afraid of anything, got brains, and of course she is a useful character for Lelouch. This is the kind of my favorite best girl! (Though I can't choose her on my favorite character list because it's full T_T). The quite part is not necessary though.\\n\r\n*Suzaku: overall is 9/10. He got the character, so even though some of his actions are annoying (like changing from the inside thing) it's actually understandable when I saw the last episode. He also have than impossible inhuman skill that can dodge rains of bullets which is makes him weird.. But hey! Lancelot looks cool in action with him..\\n\r\n*Kallen: overall is 10/10. Not really a favorite but I write the review neutrally and she deserve this point from me. She is not a whinny, incredibly strong, got brains and she is pretty quick to realise some important thoughts from Lelouch (it is shown in around the last episodes and the last episode itself). At first she may be annoying at the story about her mother problem but she was well played later on.\\n\r\n*Nunnaly: overall is 10/10. Many people detests her because the only thing she capable of is being kidnapped. But if you look and thought it carefully, she is a pretty smart character. Even though she is hesitant to shoot Lelouch, she still do it. When her assistant (or smt) tried to trick her with the plan regarding the elevens, she realise it right away.\\n\r\n*Shirley: .... ... ... Do I really have to rate her? I hate a character like this. I can even give 0/10 for her. Whinny character, not useful at all, only can cry, choosing a boy which is not even your boyfriend over your birth father (this kind of clich\u00e9 is the most annoying for me), not consistent and of course, so na\u00efve. At first glance she already looked like Inoue from bleach. Her and Nina are the one that lower my rating for both character rating and my overall rating for code grass R2.\\n\r\nThere are lots of characters that I wanted to share my opinion on them.. But it will take too long.. So far, the most amusing character for me is Llyod and the self claimed Zeros' best friend XD\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: -rating 10-\\n\r\nLet's cast aside the fact that lower my enjoyment, overall the rating for enyoment is 10 for me. I finished the whole R1 and R2 in just 4 days beside the fact that it's schools day..\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating is 9",

This is now one of my favorite animes. \r\nSlightly dark.\r\nThe author really has done a fantastic job at building Lelouch's character. His complex character leaves you wondering what his next move is, whether good or bad. \r\nI find it very unique that there really is no right or wrong side to Lelouch's approach in changing the world. It's solely up to the viewer to decide; and if you lean more towards one side, that's what you hope will happen. But without spoiling anything, the ending will cater to both sides in a way you won't expect.\\n\\n\r\nThis season is the by far better and better paced. It shifts more towards action rather than school life and with Lelouch's hiding his identity as Zero. \\n\\n\r\nWith (new?) antagonists, the story really builds more depth and caves itself deeper for more mysteries to be solved. Near the end of the season, there will be so much anticipation built up, and the ending won't let you down! \\n",

            "content": "After the first season of Code Geass, the second season gives a very solid continuation to the story, developing the characters and the story more and ending with a very satisfying conclusion. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story of the Code Geass R2 continues a year after the events of the first season. Lelouch has lost his memories through some events after the fight with him and Suzaku Kururugi and the black knights have been severely weakened through the loss of their leader. As C.C. cannot accept this situation Lelouch is in, she tries to capture him with the help of the black knights and remind him ofhis contract with her. However, after Lelouch regains his memories thanks to C.C. he still needs to act like he has not regained them. He needs to do this because he still does not know Nunally\u2019s whereabouts, as she could have been captured by Britannia and be used against Lelouch. Just like the first season, the second season of Code Geass has a very large story with a lot of things going on and many different themes used within the story. The political and militaristic themes continue throughout this season, but this season focusses on the origin of the Geass power as well. Overall, the story continues the way it was in the previous season, which was pretty great and expands upon it.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation of the second season of Code Geass are slightly better than the first season in my opinion. This can also be seen with the openings which do have somewhat more fluid animation. The openings also use more original animation not used in the anime itself and the animation goes along with the music better. The art style is almost the same as the first season, with the characters still being thin and tall. The action scenes are also pretty well choreographed. Overall, I think I would probably give the animation a 7/10 if it would air today, but as it has aired 11 years ago, I will give it an 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nJust like the first season, the soundtrack of Code Geass is great with many of its soundtracks really representing its political and militaristic themes, as well as its more dramatic scenes. This season adds to the score of the first season with several new soundtracks fitting these themes very well. The opening themes are great as well and the voice actors perform their roles about just as good as the first season, which already was very good. Overall, the soundtrack of Code Geass R2 is great, just like the first season. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThis season continues with developing the already very interesting characters the first season had to offer. Lelouch continues to try to change the world and make it a better place for Nunally, find out who killed his mother and take revenge on his father and Suzaku still tries to change Britannia from the inside. Other characters like Kallen do change somewhat more, with the reason in her case being that she is a bit conflicted knowing that Zero is Lelouch. Even though she is a bit conflicted, she wants to help Lelouch when he is depressed and even begins to fall in love with him. Other characters like C.C. begin to show more of their emotions and what they truly are, as their backstories get revealed. New characters get introduced as well, such as Lelouch\u2019s \u2018brother\u2019 Rollo who has made a lot of memories with Lelouch in the time he lost his original memories. Overall, the characters in this season are great, with them developing even more, showing other sides of themselves as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nMy enjoyment this season was about just as good as the first season, with a lot of new action scenes and new strategies being shown in this season, new characters and interesting character interactions being shown and the story being expanded upon. The ending was also very satisfying in my opinion and one of the best endings in anime I have seen. Overall, this anime was very enjoyable for me, from the beginning to the end.\\n\\n\r\nBonus Categories: 9/10\\n\r\n-----\\n\r\nAction and Strategies: 8/10\\n\r\nThere are several interesting strategies and well-choreographed action scenes throughout the second season of Code Geass. For example, one of the battles has Lelouch and his opponent constantly moving their troops around to try to get a better position, before they attack their opponent. In other instances, Lelouch once again predicts what his opponent will do or say in certain situations and thinks of a tactic responding to what his opponents will say or do. However, in some instances Lelouch thinks of a somewhat bad tactic, not predicting what his opponent will do. In some cases, this is logical, as Lelouch has a bit conflicted emotions, but in other times it is a bit illogical as he is emotionally just fine. Many battles in the anime have a good combination of good strategies and very good action scenes. The fight choreography is for the most part very good and the anime delivers plenty exciting fighting scenes, just like the first season. Overall, the action and strategies in the anime are very good. \\n\\n\r\nEnding: 10/10\\n\r\nThe ending of Code Geass R2 has to be one of the best endings in anime I have ever seen. The ending concludes the show in a very satisfying way by first having a giant final battle and then concluding the story with finishing motivations of several of the characters. The ending is a closed ending, but does leave some interpretation about certain elements for the viewer to speculate on, which is very well done. Overall, there are very little anime which can achieve an ending as great as the ending of Code Geass, which is why I will give it a 10/10. \\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 (8,83/10)\\n\r\nCode Geass R2 is a great anime and serves as a very good sequel to the first season of Code Geass. The anime has plenty of action, strategies, great characters with very good character development, a large story with many themes, good animation and a great soundtrack to accompany the many important scenes and themes in the anime. To top it all of it has one of the best endings I have ever seen in anime. If you liked the first season of Code Geass, you will probably like this season as well. \\n",

            "content": "Story:10\r\nArt:9\r\nSound:9\r\nCharacter:10\r\nEnjoyment:10\r\nOverall:10\r\nI watched this movie in Indonesia. but I'm very pleased to say that I was greatly surprised. I 'll try to keep my review as possible.\r\nStory:10\r\nThe story is very interesting to understand, and not easy to guess where the story will head when watching movies. I gave a value of 10 because the story is very interesting, touching hearts and many surprises of this film.\r\nArt:9\r\nAs expected of a Okouchi Ichiro and Taniguchi Gorou film, the artwork is beautiful. The production quality is off the charts. art itself is enough to arouse curiosity, as it did for me during even the trailer. I give it avalue of 9 because the portrayal is very beautiful , good, and interesting. His choice of colors and use of movement and focus within the frame really help you pay attention to what you need to pay attention to, while also not skimping out and leaving out detail if your eyes do decide to stray, which I recommend you do while watching Code Geass film for every blur, light flare, and particle floating along the screen really do add incredible amounts of emotion to the scene/screen.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nmusic comes from a band of FLOW, who do not know the band FLOW already well-known long in Japan, not only FLOW, there ORANGE RANGE  and ALI PROJECT. Also accompanied by music that is beautiful, charming and touching. I give it a value of 9 because it sounds beautiful, nice and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\r\nI wouldn't say I have much of a complaint about main characters. CLAMP does a good job to portray their characters well. The characters in this series are rather varied. Some are very plain and one-dimensional, while others have an amazing complexity to them that makes them very life-like. I'll be honest. I've become somewhat infatuated with Lelouch as a character (and am rather biased as a result). To me, he is very much a human character -- he has emotions, opinions, a unique point of view, and some very serious flaws, all of which make him incredibly easy to relate to and to sympathize with. He is easily the most complex character in the series, and he feels real to me, even with his supernatural powers and his genius-level intellect. This ability to make the audience relate to him is also probably the series' greatest strength and the main reason why the story is able to remain relevant and interesting despite the fact that there aren't too many new ideas plotwise. I gave a value of 10 because his character is well illustrated, beautifully, fascinated and amazed. Lelouch is not only the main character, there C.C, Kallen and Suzaku. I will not explain the other characters more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:10/10\\n\r\nAs little as I felt I delved into the personalities of the characters, I did enjoy the film a lot. I really love this series, and I definitely did not see that happening. Honestly, I found the first episode incredibly underwhelming: the opening sequence made it look like a series I wouldn't be interested in watching at all, and all of the expository really turned me off...but the second episode? That was so much more epic than I could have ever predicted, and I was pretty much won over after that. Everyone's lives diverge in different ways. I enjoyed Lelouch struggles throughout the film to help each other, and a second series of Code Geass was very touching to tears dripping. I gave a value of 10 for the Enjoyment / overall very unusual start, good story, his character is good, the picture is good, the music was good, a battle between robots,  politics, ideology, tension, competition, brotherhood, friendship, happy, sad, love and hate.\\n\\n\r\nhow do you guys want?",

It's just interesting how it works out.\r\nLike R1, The continuation of Code Geass is just epic. It gets a very emotional as well and totally unexpected character decisions you will about to see.",

            "content": "A little disclaimer... I'm going to review the whole series here, not just season two, since neither season has a great shift in quality from the other and the main story arc takes place over both seasons.\r\nCode Geass can be described as many things, if I was to try and sum it up in one line I'd say it's an epic mecha sci-fi romp, intertwined with political scheming, super powers, superfluous dialogue and a hint of fanservice. I mean this show really is epic in every way, if there isn't something epic happening then something epic is about to happen or has just happened. Peopleconverse in the field of battle with overblown speeches and retorts, and even when characters are alone there is usually a soliloquy of some sort. Depending on your preference this might sound terrible, or awesome, but I'll just say that it works. Yes, the series is over the top, but that's exactly how it needed to be.\\n\\n\r\nAside from watching mechas (Knightmares) play beat-em up there is a story to be told. It's the tale of a world suffering from the tyranny of Britannia, in this fictional  future Britannia have taken over roughly 1/3 of the world, the most recent country being Japan. The story focuses on Lelouchs (An exiled prince of Britannia) rise against the enemy in order to create a peaceful world for his sister. Lelouch is masquerading as a Britannian student, but when he stumbles across C.C he is given the Geass. The \"Power of the Kings\" which allows him complete control over any person. The bulk of the series takes place in Area 11, formerly known as Japan. We see that under the rule of Britannia we have a segregated country in which the \"Elevens\" have little rights and are kept in poverty, the racial undertones of the series may not be the focus of the story, but it adds depth. It's not all just robots and superpowers, but it's a fight against oppression.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is backed by some great sound work and art design. The soundtrack captures the moods perfectly with adrenaline pumped battle music for the fight scenes and softer poignant pieces for the more heartbreaking moments in the series. The voicing of the main cast really stand out, with Lelouchs voice actor stealing the show, I imagine this series wouldn't have been half as enjoyable with his commanding vocal presence. In a series with such verbose dialogue you need the voices to pull it off, and all the cast do a fine job. The character animation has a lanky style to it, but it's all obviously well drawn, the mecha battles especially are fun to watch. I might as well mention the fanservice here, there is a bit of nudity in the series (those really are some odd shots of the female knightmare pilots, I guess an under-the-seat view of the action really helps!) but it's nothing extreme and neither adds nor detracts from the series.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't a shortage of characters here and despite the constant mecha battles it's really the characters that are the driving force. Our main protagonist is of course Lelouch, his character is one of righteous indignation who believes that the ends justify the means. He doesn't hesitate to use his powers to kill, and often uses even his own allies as pawns in his greater scheme. But despite all of this he remains a constantly moral character, everything he does is for \"the greater good\", yet his likeability does remain divisive among fans. Lelouch and his closest friends/family share an incredibly well woven relationship. The start of the series has a light feel to it, but as the story progresses the show becomes emotionally charged by the breaking or strengthening of bonds between them. Somehow Code Geass manages to give depth to not only the main characters, but also the myriad of supporting cast are each given unique personality and set of relationships. I was impressed at how such a large cast was assembled yet almost all of them were memorable in their own way.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it's a highly enjoyable show. From the first episode the pacing is set to turbo and it never relents, with the final few episodes culminating in a crescendo that ends with one of the most heartbreaking, bittersweet or even happy endings depending on your point of view. If you want to experience the ultimate creation of \"extravagant anime\" then there really is no better choice.",

Unlike the first part - which I recommend you read my review of - this one left me outright bored in some parts, when I wondered whether or not they were just wasted time, or why the enemy didn't just take care of Lelouch - because they had so many opportunities to easily kill him. I was less forgiving to this part than I was to the original, because I felt as if part two could have been done in a shorter amount of time.\r\nSo why does it have the same score as the first part then, ifit worse?\\n\\n\r\nThis review isn't going to be long, because this is all I have to say: Code Geass R2 has some of the most memorable moments of any anime. Unlike the first series, which had about one memorable death in the entire 25 episodes, this one makes you constantly wonder who will be next, and if you can even hope to predict who, when, and how. Even moving past deaths, we see such memorable moments as Lelouch's confrontation with his father and the ending, which is, in my opinion, the best anime ending ever.",

            "content": "So the stage is set, for Lelouch's final and most audactious act!!\r\nSince the beggining of Lelouch's story I was hooked, I enjoyed every time spent with him, from the culmination of all of his despair, emptyness and desire to protect his sister that created his motivation for the rebelion against Britanian Empire, to the conclusion that I wasnt expecting... I wont spoil, but for everyone that enjoyed Lelouch character for what he is, and tries to achieve in his truthness, the conclusion of Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2, is a marvel. After season 1, the stacks were sky high, R2 delivered it andimproved! \\n\r\nIt was a hell of a ride since his \"humble\" beginnings, that meet his deserved, appropriated end!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very well crafted, complex with lots of twists, it simply grabs you, and makes you desire for more of its resolution, there was never a single episode (also counting season 1), that I was bored or reached the end and didnt wanted to continue, on the contrary!  I have seen these 50 episodes of season 1+2, in less than 8 days (season 2 I saw in less than 72 hours), that is how much I loved the whole journey, there are some anime you cant marathoon, that you need a break of!!  Code Geass tries to cover a wide range of different settings and goals, suceeds at them , and ultimately suceeds in the most important of all, what truly matters, entertain the viewer!\\n\r\nStory 10\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is a fundamental requirement to imerge the viewer into the world of Code Geass, and it is a superb one at that too!\\n\r\nThe stage is a alternative futuristic world, well built, that harbors many great action mecha scenes, along the way with the great presentation and animation to the cast. The main award goes to the extravagant and superb animation of Lelouch, the world is indeed his stage, from beginning to the end, he masters it like no one else!\\n\r\nArt 10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nLets not forget the music, there are some highs and downs about the OP's and END's, as I mainly enjoyed more the ones of the first season... that doesnt matter at all!! Why?? The whole soundtracks that plays along the scenes is very appropriate and even memorable, including some songs are of now my personal favorites! There are many memorable scenes in the anime, brought along by memorable songs.\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe whole story is about Lelouch, and the alter ego Zero, he creates to wage the rebelion, to destroy the almighty powerfull Holy Britain Empire, he is the main character, saying he is well developed, isnt enough, he is far more than just well developed!! \\n\r\nHe may take actions at parts that question the viewer of its persona, is he really trying to built a better peaceful world for his sister to live in, for the weak to live in, free on the schemes and tirany of the strongest?? Or his he the worst of them all?!?! \\n\r\nWhat his inner desires and ambitions are, are truly very noble ones! \\n\r\nEven if it means going through a painfull hell, even if it means gathering all the hate and evil towards himself, by the cost of his actions, even with all these mental scars he brings to himself, all of it, he shares it with non, and keeps going and going, falling at times, showing his fragile nature. The means to achieve his noble goals arent the purest ones, but he will do them, because \"The only ones who should kill, are those who are prepared to be killed.\"! He is prepared to change the world, even if he has to cover himself in dirty, blood and despair to do so!\\n\r\nLelocuh Lamperouge aka Zero, is one of the most likeable characters I had the joy to meet in anime story, there are obvious traits that link him to Light of Death Note (love alot), but he surpassed him by a large margin IMO! He is more human, more likeable, his development and personality are deep and complex, higly charismatic, he suceeds at surprising the viewer the whole way to the conclusion, and like I said what a damm good one at it! Fitting the character of Lelouch, like a glove!\\n\r\nCode Geass is about Zero/Lelouch, but the other cast is also pretty enjoyable and well developed. Formed and hardened by Zero decisions, either clashing agaisnt his will, either supporting him and lending him their strenght. If this is the amazing journey it indeed is, the characters are the main driving force responsable for all these feats!\\n\r\nCharacter 10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass Lelocuh of the Rebelion R2, is an example of how good can a anime be! I believe perfection is impossible, but this anime reachs the highest possible value, very close to it! There is nothing I would change, all and all I cant point any faults or stuff that should had been diferent in the anime. It may have its faults for some, but for me it was a very emotional journey (even more than season 1), full of intrigue, cleverness story and character development that keep me at the edge of my seat, shocked me (as much or even more than episode 22 of season 1) , moved me... I was caring for what happened, for the future of the world, of Lelouch, of his goals and his peers!! \\n\r\nAt the end, the epic conclusion, it brought tears to my eyes, bittersweet ones, I m very happy for having seen this amazing story taking place, and now that it is over... all the good things come to a end, and that is what gives me the desire to appreciate and love these special moments even more. Worthy of many re-watchs! :]\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall  10\\n\r\nThis is a masterpiece, of the best seen in the industry, an example of the potential of the creativity and effort that the human mind is capable of!!\\n\r\nThis anime is pure shining gold, it is philosophical, emotional, clever and a very human story, Lelouch will forever be engraved in my mind, heart and soul! He was unique, clever, had the guts to change the world, accepting the consequences, he was truthfull to his believes and his noble bloody actions werent effortless!! \\n\\n\r\nALL HAIL LELOUCH vi BRITANIA !!    \\n",

            "content": "As well done as the first season was, I can only say that R2 has done far better. Backed up by great [English] voice acting, artful character designs, an overwhelming plot, dynamic story and character development, an enthralling soundtrack, and great action, R2 earns its place in the Top 10 anime of all time (ranked by AnimeNewsNetwork).\r\nOne of season one's strong points was its ability to, in the plot, build up anticipation and suspense to the viewer, using cliffhangers and twists. R2 follows the same trick as its predecessor, but delivers much better. The best way to describe the plot of R2 is dynamic, meaningit changes very much. The story that is created and built in season one is, without spoiling too much, completely turned around and changed from what any viewer would expect. By doing this, the viewer goes through a whole different experience. Rather than allowing a viewer to think and predict what will happen in the future, they are presented something completely new, which makes the story that much better. Plot devices such as the chess motif is still used, and may I say, used a little better.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as production value goes, I'd like to say it's great. The animation is astounding, mostly in the mecha action scenes. But character designs and environment, directing, and the like are good as well. I don't think CLAMP could have done a better job at making character designs the way they did, as they fit the character remarkably well. I'd also like to give R2 and its predecessor kudos for its voice acting. I watched both seasons in English, because compared to other shows, its pretty damn good. It's not very easy to tell what good and bad voice acting is in a foreign language, so because it's in English, I can safely say it's damn good.\\n\\n\r\nI would also like to note it's moral value, at least what I got out of it. The ends justify the means, correct? Or does it? Is it really worth going through what you will to get to your goal, even if it is a good intention? Or is the evil that spawns from your good intentions too great? I'm sure there is a little more to it, but this is the jist of it.\\n\\n\r\nFor insert songs, OP's and ED's, and soundtracks, R2 surpasses season one. The songs alone are good, but used in the way they were in the anime made it much better. The timing and choice of music made the show much better than it would have without, not saying that it wouldn't be good without it. It just wouldn't be as good.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like most about R2 is the ability to be dramatic. It is the likes of which I haven't seen since Clannad, and even though the two are completely different, I can say that the dramatic effect on me from R2, while not as strong as Clannad, was much more drastic than other shows. With the use of the dynamic story as I stated above, R2 increases its dramatic effect on its viewers. Of course, I can't exactly tell you what happens, so all I can say is watch it for yourself, and you'll understand.\\n\\n\r\nR2 is good. It's great. Hell, it can be called brilliant. It makes little to no mistakes, and works hard. Overall, it's incredible. I recommend it to anyone, and obviously the first season.",

            "content": "Preface:\t\r\n \tCode Geass R2 is just like Pizza Hut\u2019s double pepperoni pizza, cheesy and enjoyable to the very last bite. I had hope for R2 even though I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of season one, and let\u2019s just say R2 delivers just as well as  the high quality employees at Pizza Hut do. R2 does what season one did on a grander scale, and is more compelling as a result. Also this is quite bit shorter than my review of the first season since a lot of it spills over.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\n \tIt\u2019s been a year since Zero\u2019s revolution attempt along with Lelouch\u2019s memorybeing altered. C.C. restores Lelouch memories, and it\u2019s time that Britannia finally falls to its needs as Zero creates the peaceful world he's envisioned since the beginning. R2 compared to the season one is way more bombastic and grandiose though I didn\u2019t really like how serious and philosophical the show tried to be, especially revolving around the Charles Britannia\u2019s master plan. It reminded me a bit of the Human Instrumentality Project in Eva but worse. The show gets more ridiculous and ridiculous as it goes along, but that\u2019s what also made it so entertaining this time around. Finally the show ended really well, with Lelouch\u2019s efforts not in vain, and I want go anymore specific than that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n\tLelouch is as strategic and cunning as ever, doing whatever it takes to reach his goal, even if it harms himself. We learn more about C.C.\u2019s past giving her more depth, plus better explains her actions and feelings for Lelouch. At the beginning of R2 i despised Suzaku, but he slowly grew on me over time. The supporting cast is pretty strong overall this season.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/ Art Style: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n \tMeh. My opinion is the same as the first season, It works but it never has me gaping in awe. It does the job of visualizing the story, but I wouldn\u2019t complain if either the character designs or backgrounds were changed. Still the mech battle animations are pretty\u2026 pretty\u2026 dope.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n \tThe show\u2019s music is something I never really took notice of, so it definitely works as background music. The Openings are average, they do a great job of showing off the large supporting cast, but it doesn\u2019t get me hyped to continue with the story, the best way to describe it is that it does not inhibit the excitement I get from each episode's cliffhanger. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n \tDue to the scale and ridiculousness of R2\u2019s plot, it exudes excitement. It features a ton of twists and turns some working out better than others, but that\u2019s what I admire about R2. And I\u2019m so happy that the series finishes on a satisfying and happy note. The series is over hyped for sure, but it is still a an entertaining series, that should be experienced for the splendor of its compelling plot and thrilling strategic battles.",

            "content": "\u201cThe world won't change with pretty words alone!\u201d  Zero\r\n-\tNote that this review is on both R1 & R2. Preferably watch them both before reading this one. \r\nCode Geass starts with a story of a highly intelligent boy named Lelouch who later on become known as a British prince who can see the corruption of the current system and planning to CHANGE it. \r\nCharacters:\r\nLelouch Vi Britannia : \"One must destroy before creating.\"\r\nThe idea is reminding us the famous mythical creature, Phoenix, the beautiful bird that when gets old builds itself a nest of twigs that then ignites; both nest and bird burn fiercely and arereduced to ashes, from which a new, young phoenix arises, reborn anew to live again. \\n\r\nIn the first episode of R1, he encounters a mysterious girl who proposes to give him power in exchange he has to fulfill her one and only wish. Gaining the power, Lelouch put a mask of a rebellion leader, Zero, and start his rebellion against a world of corruption which in his point of view isn\u2019t worthy of any attempt to repairing it but rather destroying it for good so that a new system gets born in the ruins of the older one with the hope of getting better. \\n\\n\r\nSuzaku Kururugi:  \u201cI am going to change this world from the inside.\u201d\\n\r\nSuzaku is the embodiment of the idea of using the resources at hand in the current system to build the better future within, trying hard to be abiding by the rules. He has a paradoxical character who stubbornly believes in being able to achieve a peaceful society without breaking the rules. In the first season he says that \u201cI believe that using the ends to justify the means is wrong.\u201d but as the story goes we see him struggling to hold on to his idealistic perspective which wounding him in every step on the way till he breaks and finally come to terms with the side of himself who desired gaining RESULTS.  \\n\\n\r\nC.C.: \"Without death, all we have are random events, accumulation, you can\u2019t call that life!\"\\n\r\nThe mysterious girl name C.C. is an immortal being who can give power to humans. She seems to be apathic to humans\u2019 struggles and the reason for her to giving power to Lelouch is wanting him to fulfill her one wish. Living for a long time she seems to have forgotten the taste of winning and losing.  \\n\r\nWhat this character adds to the anime is a point of view in which so much of the humans\u2019 sadness and excitements are for nothing. As she tells Lelouch \u201cNo matter how great you make yourself sound, you're still just a naive boy who's all talk and who only dreams of victory in his head.\u201d  \\n\r\nOn the other hand she finds herself at a loss by not being able to feel the change through endless flow of time. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack & sounds\\n\r\nThe music along with the opening and ending theme songs are great. The gentle themes along side with the some scene of murderous attempts allow the viewer to see beyond the excitements and observe the rapid flow of events. \\n\r\nThe voice actors and actresses are very well chosen; especially the voice for the leading role, Zero performed by Jun Fukuyama which was the best. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nWhat I like the most in Code Geass was the fast narration despite the eventful story line.  The other positive point about it was the great ending in which the last judgments were left for the viewer. Does it worth to rebel against the current system and pay the prices? Can we approve of the works of the rebellious leaders who use people as their mere pawns? \\n\r\nDoes destroying the current system mean achieving the peace? Hell no. As we see the survivors to keep on struggling to build a new world based on the false/true hope they gained after successfully (!) destroy the old regime. \\n\\n\r\nLelouch Lamperouge: Yes... I... destroy the world... and create it... anew.\\n",

            "content": "If there's one word to describe R2, it's more: more emotion, more mecha fights and powers, more philosophy, more revelations and subplots, more fanservice, and a lot more absurdity.  Naturally, opinions of the show are quite polarized and depend on which aspects you care about most.  If you prefer a carefully planned and masterfully executed story, you're going to long for the days of the first season.  If you're willing to excuse some poor writing and delivery in exchange for more excitement and substance, you'll love this one.  I tend to come down somewhere in the middle: while R2 is undoubtedlya masterpiece, continuing and in many respects improving upon the legacy created in season 1, it often tries to do too much and fails.  The result is essentially a wash: R2's story, while better, is held back by weak execution and zany plot devices.\\n\\n\r\nI'll assume you've watched season 1, and if not I suggest you stop here because I'll be spoiling it.  Last time we saw Lelouch, he and Suzaku were screaming and pointing guns at each other's heads.  Enter R2, with one of the most well-written first episodes of any anime due to its ability to completely throw you off, only to explain everything by the end.  Lelouch is back in school and everything seems to be fine.  His friends act like nothing happened, Villetta Nu is his gym teacher, and he now has a brother named Rolo while Nunnally is nowhere to be found.  He also appears to be ignorant of Geass and his identity as Zero.  I won't spoil the remainder of the episode, but rest assured that Zero makes his comeback and engulfs Japan in turmoil once again.\\n\\n\r\nWhile R2 follows the Black Knights' struggle to liberate Japan, don't expect a repeat of season 1.  This time the battle goes global, with Britannia's Knights of the Round joining the fight, and the setting shifting frequently between Japan, the Chinese Federation, and Britannia.  With the world at war, the mecha fights are also now a mainstay, not to mention immensely better thanks to tons of fast-paced sky combat and constant power upgrades.  Most importantly, we finally get answers: who is C2 and what does she want, who is V2, what is Geass, who killed Marianne, and what does the Emperor seek?  Although some of these could have been clearer (e.g., the Emperor's motive for using the Sword of Akasha and Lelouch's reason for reacting as he does), they're there if you look hard enough, and they're generally satisfying.  In typical Code Geass fashion, R2 also manages to ask new questions even as it answers the old.  One is philosophical, represented by the competing visions of the Emperor, Schneizel, and Lelouch: should humanity seek to resurrect its past, freeze time in the present, or march onward into an unknown future?  The other, raised in one of the greatest and most beautiful anime endings ever made (I teared up), can never be entirely resolved.\\n\\n\r\nR2 also shines in its character development, perhaps even more than its superb predecessor.  While Euphemia is gone and Cornelia is relegated to a minor role, others move in to fill the void.  Of the characters from season 1 - and apart of course from the ever-interesting and dynamic Lelouch - the stand-outs have to be Kallen, who proves herself entirely capable of taking on the almighty Knights of the Round, all while holding together the Black Knights and Lelouch; and C2, who is rendered tremendously more complex and beautiful through the revelation of her past and the focus on her evolution alongside Lelouch.  Suzaku sees some nice development too, particularly on a philosophical level (ends vs. means debate) in and after episode 20.  R2 also introduces a host of new characters, all of whom are fine, if nothing special.  Of these the best are probably Rolo, who transitions from twisted sociopath to somewhat human and empathetic, and the (not entirely new) Emperor Charles, who is a great villain, if not at times inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nBy going bigger in virtually every respect, R2 is able to deliver a considerably more complex and substantive story than season 1.  Yet in so doing, it also has more opportunities to stumble, and does.  And so we repeatedly see wacky plot devices - first in episode 8, again at the end of episode 9, and arguably twice in episode 13 - that make the story feel sloppy, and there are occasionally problems with pacing and transition.  There's also a lot more fanservice, especially in the opening episodes where Kallen goes from Black Knight Ace to ass and tit eye candy.  Most damningly, R2 undermines the entire series by creating some major plot holes.  In episode 8, for instance, Villetta realizes that Oghi is the person wearing a Zero mask based on his voice alone.  But since Lelouch uses his normal voice too, there is no reason why people who know him haven't been able to identify him as Zero.  Even worse, on two occasions we find Lelouch ordering people to \"obey him from this moment forward\" or to \"be his slave.\"  Yet this renders the one-time-per-person Geass rule meaningless, and makes it hard to understand why Lelouch would ever order anyone to do anything else.\\n\\n\r\nWhile R2's story admittedly has some issues, they don't really matter.  In part this is because the series can rest on its laurels: season 1 was so good that fans would be happy with just about any sequel, and it receives a lot of leeway simply because it's Code Geass.  Even so, despite some setbacks R2 is generally very well done, and a highly engaging and satisfying continuation of the Code Geass saga.  It also somehow manages to improve upon season 1's stunning animation and soundtrack, with far better mecha fights and special effects, more scenery shots, and some gorgeous new tracks (e.g., Hitomi's Continued Story).  Even Nina's voice changes for the better, allowing her to go from shrill and whiny to a bearable, relatively interesting character.  All of which makes R2 a difficult show to review.  In many respects it is unquestionably superior to season 1, yet there's also no denying that it is weaker on execution.  Which is more important, I'm unable to say.  In the end, loving both seasons, I am content to call them both masterpieces and to recommend the entire series to anyone.",

            "content": "\"Those who fire should be prepared to be fired at.\"\r\nAfter the first season, we were left with a cliff hanger with Lelouch and Suzaku both firing at each other at the same time. Who won? Where is Nunally? and Who is this V.V? Unfortunately nothing was revealed after that. \r\nLuckily our prayers were answered and now Lelouch is back for a second round.Why is he alive? Does that mean Suzaku died? All these are quickly explained at the beginning of the second season. The main plot is briefly told in narrative style. Following it explains how Lelouch has ever been since and new characters werequickly introduced. As a result, R2 is more jam packed with political crash and action compared to the first season and strived not to waste any time. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is basically a political battle with a combination of mecha. The art is again superb courtesy of clamp. The OP songs are upbeat and the ED themes match perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nFans can now enjoy another thrilling ride of action and power struggling series. Who will be the victor at the end? Will everything end in peace? Will C.C. ever escape her immortality? There's only one way to find out! Hopefully, this is a satisfying closure for this well-planned masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give it a 10.",

            "content": "\"Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2\", the sequel to the first \"Code Geass\", is a very fun series that can make you think twice, or even more times about what will happen next and what is going on.\r\nIt suffers from the same problems as the first series, but here, it's even more so.\r\nAfter Lelouch meets up with Suzaku at the final episode cliffhanger of R1, we are treated to a \"1 Year Later\" event, where the events of that year are explained over time. You'll be surprised at how well they explain it, even though most of the explanations are made up, they're still explanations.\r\nTherest of R2 is a series of twists and turns. It keeps getting more and more ridiculous until it literally breaks its back, and you're just expecting a twist every 10 minutes or so.\\n\\n\r\nUp to a certain point in this series, the reality of this world becomes a mess, and the show becomes more of a mediator for the writers philosophies, let alone an attack on government and politics, rather than a driven series that is realistically well controlled with its politics and drama.\\n\r\nThat doesn't stop the fun though, but the huge twists are almost too ridiculous to take seriously, especially near the end.\\n\\n\r\nI must give it to the writers though, the execution of the plot is like something I have not seen before or after the creation of this series, there are times where you think the show could have ended, but they managed to create something more from that event, and so on, and so on, and so on... It's almost too much.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen Goro Taniguchi's Gun X Sword in 2005, there are similarities to key elements of Code Geass that are similar to Gun X Sword, especially when comparing the Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia and \"The Claw\".\\n\\n\r\nThe art is what you would expect, like the first season, except on a bigger scale.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is once again very well done, the seiyuu are still excellent, and the SFX fit.\\n\\n\r\n:Semi Spoiler: \\n\r\nThis series plays with the idea that the world is created and run with lies, truth is a false hope that cannot be obtained. Everyone wears a persona, a mask.\\n\r\nIt is the basis of this series, you will see every leader lying to each other and their comrades to continue their reign of power, and their drive for \"World Peace\" which up to a certain point, it is obvious that this is also a lie.\\n\r\nYou even see it in the first season, just not up to this scale.\\n\\n\r\nI must mention, the last episode is much more powerful than I expected, this series, may be chaotic, but the last episode did impress me.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nI actually had more fun watching this series than the first one, no matter how clustered the world of Code Geass became. \\n\r\nThey're selling a product, I think they did a great job as business goes.\\n\r\nIf you've seen the first season, there is no reason to skip the second one.\\n\r\nHave fun, and watch with an open mind.\\n\\n\r\nI believe the last episode of Code Geass R2 made the whole series worth it.",

            "content": "In my perspective, Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 serves both as a continuation to Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion and as a remake. The anime studio Sunrise pretty much built a second season of Code Geass from scratch due to budget issues and low confidence during the airing of the first season; things weren\u2019t going as planned. But the second season shows: Everything is more cohesive and the story actually gets somewhere. That\u2019s not to say that the first season isn\u2019t canon, though. \r\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\r\nCode Geass was meant to be a megaproject consisting of two seasons containing 50 episodes, like Gundam Seed.The end result was a mostly gutted first season and a dense second season which had no room for error. As I\u2019ve said in my review of the first season, it\u2019s a 6. The second season, however, is a 10. Not only is it independent and competent, it\u2019s monumental. \\n\\n\r\nQuite the ride.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: \\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10  \\n\\n",

It will seem like they are repeating everything at first, but that is because with Zero reemerging he needs to establish himself as the real deal. After those first couple episodes, Lelouch hits the ground running and getsright back to working towards obliterating Britannia. If you think you may get disinterested from this continuing story, don't worry, that won't be an issue by the halfway point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: All unfinished character development is taken care of in R2, and even the new characters introduced have time to become well developed. Motives become clearer, friends become enemies, enemies become friends, your heart gets broken, just another day at the office.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Same thing I said in my review of the first season, I've watched Code Geass and R2 at least 10 times each, so of course I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: After the final episode aired, I didn't know what to do with myself; I would watch the episode again every morning before going to school for the longest time, just to start the day with a sense of wholeness.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason this show holds so much importance to me is because it really helped me out during a down time in my life by getting the lesson through to me that you can't dwell in the past, or only live in the present, but to always keep the future in mind. I hope it can do the same for everyone else who watches it.",

            "content": "First of all, I would like to mention that this will serve as my review of both Code Geass R1 and R2. I decided to review the whole series as a whole instead of the seasons separately and my scores are based on considering both seasons. The best way to introduce Code Geass is simply to call it Death Note with mechs (though not literally). You can clearly see that Code Geass  is one of the most recommended anime for Death Note fans and visa-versa. Code Geass has all the intelligence, well craft plans and strategies shown in Death Note, but applied to amilitary formula.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get the negatives out of the way.. My complaints on the story are largely based on fillers like the infamous cat episode. Don\u2019t bother watching the fillers because they really kill the mood of the anime and aren\u2019t even slightly funny. There is also a significant amount of fanservice during these episodes (and sometimes even in the main episodes) that distracts from full immersion but it\u2019s not too excessive that the anime because a \u201chigh school of the dead with mechs\u201d anime. In the end, I did not find that these issues detract from how good the story really is.\\n\\n\r\nWhen a Code Geass episode is not a pointless filler and following the main story, it\u2019s simply awesome The world is well crafted and possibly inspired by George Orwell\u2019s 1984, but in a future setting. Lelouch Lamperouge is an exiled prince of the Holy Brittanian Empire that vows revenge against the emperor and creates an insurgent organization known as the Black Knights whose goal is to destroy the Empire.  He does this with the help of Geass, a power that lets him control people completely. The story is very interesting to watch as Lelouch dismantles the empire on battle at a time and grows a strong reputation in Japan (area 11). The tension in this show can only matched by Death Notea\u2019s as the viewer sees Lelouch\u2019s plans unravel. The story has excellent build up, despite the fact that the first episode was a bit too fast paced and the anime struggles to easy the viewer into the world. However, once you\u2019ve been sucked in it\u2019ll be hard for you to escape the magic :D\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Animation: 9\\n\\n\r\nMy major complaint with the art is the character design. At first they looked like stretched pieces of spaghetti to me, but I got used to it quickly enough. In the end, the art and animation are superb. The environments are beautiful and there is clear attention to detail, the mechs look great, the animations are smooth and precise, etc. Basically, all the things you expect from a very well animated anime will be present here. It should not disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is awesome and played well. I didn\u2019t like most of the opening themes after the intial one and hated all the ending themes. However, I will still give it an 8 due to the fact that the soundtrack within the anime (outside of OPs/ED) are fantastic and the voice acting is great in both the sub and the dub. Furthermore, all the sound effects sound as expected and I did not kill immersion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nLelouche is easily the best character in this show. All the other characters are interesting, but some are downright annoying. I deeply hated Suzaku\u2019s idiotic view of the world and his hypocrisy sickened me. Nina was also extremely annoying so thank god she didn\u2019t get too much screen time.  The student council members are sometimes annoying and sometimes great depending on the episode. I would rank them as below average slice of life characters. Well, that basically sums up all the \u201cmeh\u201d or poor characters in this show. The rest are fantastic and trust me, there are a TON of fantastic characters in this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe fillers sometimes ruined the experience, but I would consider Code Geass as one of the most entertaining anime\u2019s I have ever seen. Its main story is exciting with an excellent protagonist; it has a cool setting, awesome mecha action and finally, some of the best tension and suspense in anime. If there is one thing Code Geass can do, it\u2019s entertain an audience.\\n\\n\r\n Overall: 9\\n\r\n+ excellent story\\n\r\n+ cool and well developed setting\\n\r\n+ Excellent protagonist and mostly great supporting characters\\n\r\n+ some of the best tension and suspense in anime\\n\r\n+ Awesome soundtrack\\n\r\n-- Fillers\\n\r\n-- Fan service\\n\r\n-- Some bad and annoying characters\\n",

            "content": "[Note: Assumed that readers are familiar with First Season]\r\nCode Geass R2 is a continuation of Code Geass and a step up from Death Note and Fullmetal Alchemist - with improvements in characters and one of the best endings of all time - though some may consider it cliche it is quite moving and is the defining moment of Lelouch and the show itself.\r\nThe array of plot twists from the betrayal of Lelouch's sister to his ultimate rise to power, the power struggle between him and his brother and the killer conclusion - It is all you could ask for. The ending sums up the entirestory and utilizes one of the greatest aspects of life - sacrafice.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a love hate relationship between all the characters, but perhaps the most controversial character is Lelouch lays the foundation for his exit from the center of the world.  Unlike many stories with perfect predictable endings - R2 shakes it up and throws a dagger at you heart. The constant ups and downs is a great aspect that adds depth to Lelouch's persona.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is phenomenal. Especially C.C's flashbacks. The fight scenes were flawless, the camera angles and panoramas takes the animation to another level.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you havent watch it, then it is something you need to do. If your a fullmetal alchemist, death note, or even Gundam fan you'll absolutely fall in love with Code Geass. However do remember this is the second season.",

To be able to convey such a story through an anime is just above and beyond. \r\nThey say a picture is worth a 1000 words, but what about an anime? \r\nAn anime like code geass is to be admired forever for it has done what most animes cant do. It touched my heart in so many ways and i believe it can touch everyone.\r\nThese were the thoughts that gone through my head when i watched thisanime and everything was done perfectly. The first and second seasons were filled with anticipation making this a very addictive anime. Every episode was outstanding and starting from episode one of the first season, this anime draws you in and never keeps you wanting more. Be warned if you start this anime you probably wont stop until you have finished it. For me, the second i laid hands on this anime i mightve just watched both seasons straight if i didnt have school to go to and even so my brain was constantly trying to convince me to watch another chapter regardless of what midterms i had coming up. Probably the most well done series ive ever watched there is nothing i can hate about this anime although i just may be absolutely obsessed with code geass...",

When I look back on Season 1, I realize that its ending built the perfect pathway onto R2.\r\nI'll make this short because words cannot really describe how good the series was.\r\nStory: If you watch it till the very end, you will be amazed. This story does NOT disappoint.\r\nArt: Simply gorgeous. Beautiful sharpness of the lines in the face, just the right amount of sparkle in the eyes, and tear-jerking expressions.\r\nSound: Likedit enough, I don't worry too much about this.\\n\r\nCharacter: Generally very well-developed characters, even in people who are not very important. There's a side-story for almost every individual and whether or not you adore the main plot or the sub ones, R2 will keep you on edge.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I've watched it twice, and I've cried both times. Mind you, these tears explain not the sadness of the series, but rather the magnificence in its quintessence. I cannot stress enough how complete this series was compared to many other series.\\n\r\nOverall: I've got nothing bad to say. I loved every little bit down to the subtle complex love relationships going on. And although I know it'll never happen, I will always forever be waiting for R3. \\n\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "Today I have finished the complete Code Geass series and I feel obliged, no, compelled to write my review on this. Although Im about 5 years late in writing this, I feel as though I should voice my opinion because Code Geass was one of those animes that after you finish, you need to take a break from anime for about 2 weeks because you are still left in the essence of what you just saw.\r\nSo the plot of the 2nd season is essentially the same as the 1st. Lelouch, along with his accomplice C.C. and his army called the \"Black Knights\" plan to overthrowthe Brittanian Government from Japanese territory using Geass, a power that enables one to do something such as make anyone do anything for you. I could not tell you how many times I had to restrict myself from watching in the weekdays because I knew that each episode would end in a cliffhanger and I would not stop myself from watching the next. Yes. Its that good. I'm not really into Mechas at all (Die-hard gundam fan here..) However I cannot believe I let something like that hold me back from watching this. To all of you comparing Code Geass to Death Note, I can definitely see where you are coming from, however, the \"Lesson (Like a life tip it gives you such as: \"Too much power will destroy one\" or something like that.)\" of both animes are completely different thus making me make the conclusion that you will get different experiences from watching both animes.\\n\\n\r\nArt was fine, nothing good. After all, it was produced between 2006 and 2008. However its not at the point where its unbearable, coming from someone who thinks bad artwork is a turnoff in anime, I can assure you that you wont be disappointed. Hmm.. a 8 should be sufficient.\\n\\n\r\nNot gonna lie I was thinking \"What the fuck\" for the OP and ED of the first season, but by the 2nd season I didnt really care anymore. It was nothing special so Ill give it a 7. Feelin pretty generous.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters. WOW. How should I even start to comprehend how to dive into this category. Since typing a paragraph about each character is going to be tedious and pretty much a TL;DR thing, let me just try to summarize in a couple sentences. Everyone, EVERYONE, is Code Geass is different. Each has his/her own \"thoughts\" that make it a complete character, and each makes his or her own rational decisions that make one not help but to relate to it. The enemies in this anime are legit. Like \"I wanna rip your goddamn head off.\" legit. They knew exactly the tools needed in order to make a character either likable, or annoying. The main character, Lelouch, is nothing less than a badass and nothing more than a God of an MC. His smart ability to make rash decisions or choices in dire situations present nothing but a \"Gaped mouth\" to the watchers. I think this deserves more than a 10 but since I'm limited to a 10, that'll do.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Did I enjoy this anime? What I'm wondering is why I took so long to even watch this anime. The producers knew exactly what kind of elements they needed to implement into the anime in order for this to become a masterpiece. At the end of each episode I found myself to always be saying \"Just 1 more wont hurt, SURELY I can wake up for school tomorrow. Damn... maybe just one more..\" Don't hold back because the word \"Mecha\" is in the genre. Don't. Enjoyment deserves nothing less than a 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, with the mindfucks and surprises this anime has given me I could not think of any other way to show appreciation other than to write a review. Do not hesitate to watch this anime, and with that, let me conclude with: ALL HAIL LELOUCH!",

However, the second season did not live up to the first seasons reputation with the military theme changing from \"superior tactics and stratagems can beat any enemy no matter the size\" in the 1st season to \"who's got the better giant fighting robot\" in the 2nd season. \r\nNow dont get me wrong, i loved the 2nd season i mean the animation, music and characters are perfect. i just have a problem that the series seems to lose some of its realism that it had in the 1st season \r\nI personally have to give great credit the creatorsfor creating Lelouche who i will forever view as THE anti-hero of anti heroes. On the flipside however, some characters get extremely annoying with Suzaku Kururugi being the single biggest arse hat i have ever witnessed in fiction. \\n\r\nBut i digress, this is a great show, watch it\\n\r\n9/10",

            "content": "It's a solid 8 and here's why:\r\nStory: During the course of the series I was starting to wonder if the writers were big Shyamalan fans.  The number of twists and \"gotcha\" moments were starting to get almost tiresome, but then they were wrapped up nicely at the end.  I'm sure a lot of fans will be disappointed at the ending, but it's really a good one and the most satisfactory one that could be reached by that point.  I also felt that the part of the series around episode 20 was written by someone who hated the end of Evangelion as muchas I did and seemed to be a combination tribute/&quot;up yours&quot; moment.\\n\r\nOh, I almost quit watching when the truth about what happened to Lelouch's mother is revealed.  I have to ask  why the writers even bothered including it because it just cheapened the whole thing and didn't affect matters in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The one change in art between the series that I found intriguing is how they managed to make Suzaku look older and less trusting in this series.  It was just a slight narrowing of the eyes and lower eyebrows but it nicely mirrored the changes in him.  I think they almost skimped on illustrating Lelouch because of it.  He had only showed three emotions the whole time, shock, boredom, and arrogance.\\n\\n\r\nSound: It was a nice soundtrack.  The final ending song was probably the best credits song of the series.  The singing of soft melodies during prolonged combat scenes stands out in both series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: As with the first one, this is where this series really shined.  Lelouch matures and grows in this one, but alas in a very predictable trajectory.  His acknowledgment of the evil in his actions is the only surprise.  His willingness to sink to any depths to achieve his goal becomes a real drag as time goes on.  The pleasant surprise is Suzaku, who makes a slow but steady change towards coming more and more like Lelouch.  His ambitions for a better future and the geass that forces him to live eventually force him into a mirror image of Lelouch and the end result makes sense no matter how shocking it is when it happens.  Even the outward changes in his appearance and dress reflect this and his original plan to interrogate Karen is right down evil.\\n\r\nC.C. actually became more boring, which is sad because she had a lot of potential.  Most of the characters remain static or don't matter much except as plot drivers.\\n\r\nI found Schneizel as a villain to be interesting, simply because he seemed to lack the motivation.  He's as calloused as Lelouch but lacks his passion and will to succeed.  His eventual end was almost a snore since you could see it coming a mile away.  They never explained his point of view well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: At times I loved it, at times I hated it.  The ending makes it all worth so don't give up before watching it all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It was inferior to the original, maybe just because of novelty.  The whole first half and the return to school theme made me gag reflexively but it recovers from that and has one of the best anime endings I've seen.  I can't help but wonder if the rumors of last minute rewritings due to it's timeslot and what shows were on at the same time were true and affected the scattershot nature of the first half of this series.  It definately could have been &quot;stronger&quot; emotionally and in scope.  I can definately say that I enjoyed the fast pace and the lack of recaps and long drawn out internal debating.",
