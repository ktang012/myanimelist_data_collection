            "content": "If you're looking for an anime with romance and relationships, this isn't what you're looking for. If you're looking for an anime with endless hilarity and gags that runs off love and romance, this is what you're looking for. This anime thrives off misjudgments and the characters. \r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is an anime thats been the laughing central of this summer. With the theme of manga-artists becoming more popular lately such as, Manga-ka to assistant-san or mangirl ,it's becoming much more attractive and interesting to watch. This is a gem that's becoming popular due to its laughable characters and misinterpretations that occur all the time.\r\nThestory follows Sakura, a girl who tries to tell her crush that she likes him, but gets misinterpreted and ends up becoming his assistant. She often tries to get closer to him, but always gets misjudged and makes for some hilarious comedy. The story follows their life at school along with some other cast members to make the show enjoyable and a lot more entertaining to watch as a whole. With the running gag of it being comedy, some things may seem predictable, but it still stays original and has comedy in every episoded.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all really unique in their own way and is the strongest part of the show. With all the different characters you get hilarious situations that really makes the show stand out from the rest that's airing and one that takes comedy to the next level with their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nYou have Sakura, a girl who tries often to get close to her crush, but is always misinterpreted. She's a great person who makes the show better with her retorts and delusions that she thinks is going to happen, but the exact opposite happens. Over time she develops a bond with Nozaki and really makes for some friendship and gave a light feeling to make you smile at every scene.\\n\\n\r\nSecond you have Nozaki, a manga artist and one that people often misjudge. Since he stays up to draw and produce manga, he looks like he gets into fights, but really is only just aches and pains from the constant drawing and late nights. He's oblivious to Sakura's feelings and really makes up for some hilarious reactions that he gives to what he thinks she's doing. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is nothing new to the 2014 style, yet brings out details that makes it better than some of the anime airing. With all the details in the characters clothes, to the beautiful scenery that they go through in their situations, it brings out a sense of comedy to support the bickering and the interactions between all the characters. With the art being one of the strong points, you have beautiful details in every aspect that they bring to the table. The characters all have unique features and traits that belong to them and wonderful backdrops such as the school, or just at their house.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is nothing to be praised for, but is super catchy. The background music for this anime is one that supports the mood that the anime gives off perfectly. The opening and ending gives off the perfect feeling to start every episode and is one that I never skip. The voice actors are all really well and give the characters life to make the anime as enjoyable as possible. The voice actor for Sakura is relatively new to voice acting, but does a wonderful job portraying her character and is one of the best in the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is one of the best of Summer 2014 line up and is definitely worth watching. With it's wonderful characters and hilarious situations they get themselves into, this is one that brings out the comedy in the simplest things. You have the standard 2014 art style, yet it makes it better by adding details to make every quality shine and make it so everything stands out to the fullest. The OST is wonderful and support each scene perfectly and the opening is so catchy that you just can't help but enjoy listening to. I recommend anyone who didn't check this out yet to start watching it.",

            "content": "\"Humor has to surprise us; otherwise, it isn't funny.\"\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is about a girl named Chiyo who tries to confess to her crush. He misunderstands her confession and decides to take her as his assistant, because, as it turns out, he is a romance manga author, and he seeks inspiration from the people he knows to create his characters. Hilarity is supposedly ensues, but doesn't really.\r\nDespite premises like that having been done before, I thought that was an interesting idea. However, comedy anime is unfortunately not very good at remaining consistently funny, and often would rather remain repetitive rather than come up with somethingnew or original. This is sadly the case with this show.\\n\\n\r\nIt has the same problem as a lot of anime comedies seem to have these days, which I like to call \"punchline decay\": it gives the characters one or two personality traits and bases all of its jokes around them. I certainly don't watch comedy shows expecting deep, three-dimensional characterization, but it gets stale quick if the characters have nothing more to them.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, the show is serviceable enough at what it does, it's your average character-driven comedy. It introduces the characters and establishes their personality. It's nothing special, but it has potential. Yet, this is where it remains the whole way through. I'm not knocking this show for having one-dimensional characters (I expect it from an anime these days), but rather for not doing anything new with them.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single joke that ever gets made in this show always boils down to the exact same punchlines: Nozaki is oblivious; Chiyo thinks a moment with Nozaki is going to turn out romantic, and then it turns out the opposite; Mikoshiba is feminine and gets embarrassed; Seo is rude; Kashima is flirtatious towards other girls, which Hori beats her up for; Wakamatsu dislikes Seo but loves someone called Lorelei, whom he doesn't realize is the same person; etc.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, they're not so much characters as much as they are running gags. But running gags require variations in order to stay fresh, which doesn't happen with the characters in this show. Much like how a harem show has characters that can barely even be called that, made to fit into a specific character archetype, the only novelty in the show comes from introducing new characters that also fit into one character archetype, and after the show has ceased to introduce new characters and has already beaten all of their gimmicks into the ground, the show has nothing to offer.\\n\\n\r\nTo put the character's lack of dynamism into perspective, half of the characters don't even have any personality of their own, and instead their personality is entirely dictated by their relation to another character. Chiyo's personality is dictated by her love of Nozaki, Wakamatsu's personality is dictated by his dislike of Seo and Hori's personality is dictated by him beating up Kashima, etc.\\n\\n\r\nBut is there anything else to these characters? Doesn't seem like it. That level of shallowness in regards to personality is the sort of thing that I would expect from secondary characters, not from the (ostensibly) main ones. \\n\\n\r\nThe point of a comedy is to subvert your expectations. Does Mikoshiba saying one of his dating sim lines and getting embarrassed subvert your expectations? Sure. But does it still subvert your expectations later on, the 50th time that happens? How about the hundredth? That's the problem; it only subverts your expectations once for every one of its characters, and then never again. The only time your expectations are subverted is the first time a joke is used; but then after that, since they keep reusing the same jokes over and over again, everything gets predictable in a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIt's like the \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\" joke. When someone first came up with it, it was funny, but nowadays, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who still finds the joke funny. Guess why? Because everyone has already heard it a million times. It's the same thing here.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is supposedly a parody of shoujo romance manga, which is part of what got me interested in watching in the first place. I've read a certain amount of those out of curiosity, so I know how dumb they can be. The characters are one-dimensional, the romance is forced, they're all just variations on the same story, etc. If you've read one, you've read them all. So when I heard this was a parody of that, I was looking forward to it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as it turns out, it doesn't really parody romance manga that much. It makes a few obvious jokes about that, while the rest of it is spent parodying (I guess?) what it's like working as a mangaka. Along with that comes jokes about being a mangaka that I've already seen in plenty of other shows where characters are mangakas.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the problem comes in. Most of the parody just boils down to taking romance character stereotypes, changing the gender... and that's it. There isn't anything to the parody beyond that, especially pointless since the same character types had already been gender-reversed in quite a few romance manga to begin with. Very rarely does the show ever actually do anything of actual substance with the parody aspect, which is a shame, since the show is at its best whenever it does that.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, there were a couple of moments I thought were hilarious: the dating sim in episode 4, and the boxes in episode 8. However, in both of those cases, I thought the rest of the episode was mediocre, for reasons which I already outlined earlier. And even then, while these two scenes were funny, I didn't feel like it was worth watching the whole show just to laugh at only two scenes and be bored for the rest. I can't help but feel like even if I had dropped the show, I wouldn't have missed out on anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe show, theoretically, has a lot of good ideas, which could have ended up resulting in a genuinely clever show, but it never attempts to actually do anything with said potential nor does it take any risks, merely relying on the same 5 or 6 jokes with no thought involved, and ends up a mediocre comedy, just as forgettable as the very same romance manga that it supposedly parodies. At the very least, it's cute, but I tend to like shows when they have more substance than that.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're fine with repetitive humor, then watch this if you'd like. Otherwise, if you're looking for something original in terms of characters and humor, you're better off looking for something else instead. There's certainly worse shows out there in regards to this, but there's also far better ones as well.",

            "content": "It's a rare thing to find a romance anime that appeals to both a male and female audience. It is even rarer to find one that does so without sexualising its characters.\r\nGekkan Shoujo gives us hope for the stagnant, often juvenile climate of the romance genre. It doesn't rely on obnoxious misunderstandings to keep the two main characters from joining together (although misunderstandings do still exist with a sense of self-aware humour), nor does it need onsen scenes, pantyshots and implied homolust to keep the audience's attention towards its characters. All it's interested in doing is giving the audience a good laugh while nudging afew heartstrings along the way, and it does so with its head held high.\\n\\n\r\nA quick glance at the synopsis would be enough for some to roll their eyes and dismiss the show as 'Yet Another Shoujo Anime'. An innocent girl attempts to confess to the boy she likes in an empty classroom room dyed of scarlet (the setting of seemingly every confession scene in anime), only to find out that he is actually a famous shoujo mangaka. And one of her favourites, no less. Uh-huh. Right. \\n\\n\r\nBut Gekkan Shoujo knows better. It is aware of its absurd premise and the clich\u00e9s inherent to the genre. It embraces them, plays with them with a clever sort of irony, never taking itself too seriously nor forcing its viewers to feel a certain way. At its core it is certainly your typical shoujo anime, but the way it handles itself is quite the opposite. \\n\\n\r\nThe story primarily follows the events of Chiyo and the titled Nozaki. Chiyo, perhaps reluctantly, but nonetheless willing to follow the company of the boy she likes, assists Nozaki in his daily tasks as a mangaka, hoping one day he might realise and respond to Chiyo's feelings. Gradually she begins to understand that Nozaki doesn't quite live up to the 'cool, handsome and composed' image she had of him, and that in reality, he is so lacking in common sense that it is a mystery how he was even serialised in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nNozaki's obliviousness is undoubtedly the show's main source of laughter. In one scene, Nozaki accidentally draws one of his characters above the ground and, having the issue pointed out to him, draws a random box underneath the character, nodding his head and acting like everything is now right with the world. He then starts drawing boxes underneath the character in every scene afterwards, which understandably results in one of Nozaki's friends yelling to him how it makes no sense for the character to be carrying around and standing on random boxes all the time. Nozaki's response? \"Right. I have to add an explanation.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy works so well because Nozaki's train of thought always makes, at least in his own little world, a slight fraction of sense. He just has no idea how people actually behave and ends up misinterpreting the actions of others in a completely asinine, facepalm-inducing and yet hilarious manner. That's not to say that each joke is masterful and clever, or even that all of them work (because a few certainly do fall utterly flat), but the simple manzai format works in perfect harmony with the ridiculous premise of the story. It knows how to make fun of itself while still holding onto a semblance of sincerity. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the more respectable aspects of Gekkan Shoujo is how it also focuses on its side characters beyond the usual 'idiot friend', 'strict class president' and 'arrogant love rival' archetypes. Hori and Wakamutsu in particular are two characters who would normally be treated as nothing more than background fodder in the average anime for not having a colourful character design or 'wacky' personality. But in Gekkan Shoujo they are given important roles and treated with about as much attention and respect as Nozaki and Chiyo. They even have their own love interests who play relevant roles on their own (as opposed to simply being a plot device, as many often are in anime). There's a surprising amount of complexity to the character dynamic despite the general simplicity of the show's format. \\n\\n\r\nI suppose if there was one thing to criticise about the characterisation, it would be the inconsistency of Mikoshiba. He's handsome, eloquent-- so much so that virtually every girl in the school is head-over-heels for him-- but at the same time he is portrayed as introverted, socially awkward and obsessed with otaku hobbies, to the point where he uses eroge to study real-world interaction. The latter aspect of his personality does not feel convincing in the slightest, so his comedic scenes often fall pretty flat. To feel comedy is to empathise with the characters, and there was little to no empathy between me and Mikoshiba. \\n\\n\r\nThose watching strictly for the romance will likely find themselves disappointed, because, really, aside from a small handful of scenes, maybe three or four, it is virtually non-existent. The most heartwarming thing about the show is not the idea of the two slowly becoming a couple, but that Chiyo still loves Nozaki from the bottom of her heart despite finding out about his glaring flaws. The love here feels genuine, far more so than most 'serious' romance anime where the girl screams at the guy when he stops acting like a prince. Progression itself isn't what makes or breaks the romance in a story. \\n\\n\r\nGekkan Shoujo is visually pleasant. The characters (particularly the males) are drawn realistically, and while it does still portray them all as idealised and attractive, it never goes overboard by drawing them in lewd or excessively 'moe' scenarios. The sound on the other hand is nothing special aside from the opening track, although, to be fair, it is a pretty great OP. It captures the silly yet relaxed nature of the show exceptionally well, and by the final episodes I found myself thinking it sacrilege to skip it.\\n\\n\r\nSure, while it may not be doing anything outstanding enough to be remembered decades in the future, Gekkan Shoujo is still an excellent experience for anyone who simply wants to relax and have a few laughs. It doesn't bombard the viewer with melodrama or degrade its characters through fanservice, and what little romance there is is handled with care and sincerity. That it also happens to appeal to so many people at once without leaving anyone uncomfortable is perhaps just a bonus. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and Chiyo is possibly the cutest thing ever.",

            "content": "*WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, BUT NOT HEAVY SPOILERS*\r\nThe idea behind the story is not an entirely bad concept. Of course it has become a generic plot idea to base an anime on creating a manga. I mean c'mon, it seems like every year there is either an anime or a manga where the theme is based on creating a manga. However, the way this show presents the manga creator and the interactions between him and his assistants can be quite warm on the heart. \r\nSo, why does the story get a lower score from me? Because of HOW it tells this story and how itall goes to shit at a fast paced speed. \\n\\n\r\nThe story goes something like this....\\n\r\nThe main character is Sakura Chiyo, who happens to be in love with the most painfully aloof guy in the entire fucking world, Nozaki Umetarou. One day Sakura confesses her love to Nozaki while they're at school. Because of the fact that Nozaki is either in complete denial, or possibly stupid, he assumes she's a fan and signs an autograph for her despite her not even asking for one. So, this eventually leads to Nozaki asking Sakura to become his assistant since she's an artist herself. Obviously, like any other generic anime female character would, she doesn't try to explain to him what she really meant and she agrees to becoming his bitc...I mean assistant. \\n\\n\r\nNow the thing about this plot is that it heavily revolves around the interactions the characters have with one another. This is why I say that despite the IDEA of the story not being a bad one, it's told in one of the worst ways possible. Why is it told in one of the worst ways possible? Because majority of the characters you meet throughout the series make you cringe.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just start off by saying which character I like the most, and that would be Mikoto (Mikorin) Mikoshiba. It is surprising that with such poorly written characters that Mikorin managed to stay consistently well written and consistently entertaining. You see, Mikorin is obviously supposed to be the hot guy of the show (and the guy Sakura should have chosen, but that's for another story). Even though Mikorin is considered very good looking, he is a complete otaku dweeb who gets painfully shy around a group of people. Some have considered his character too far-fetched and that if someone was that good looking then they would not behave like such a socially scared nerd, but that is all far from the truth. We cannot simply dismiss a character because he doesn't appear realistic, or just because he doesn't fit other generic anime stereotypes everyone seems to be used to. \\n\r\nMikorin is definetly one of the better written male characters in a slice of life anime, and he was the main reason I was able to finish this series.\\n\\n\r\nNow you are probably wondering what was so wrong with the rest of the cast if Mikorin was so great. Just keep in mind that this is purely based off of what I consider to be my objective reasoning as well as subjective reasoning (because nobody in this world can be 100% objective all the time).\\n\r\nLet's start with Sakura, who was not terrible nor great...she was who she was. Her entire existance is based on the fact that she loves Nozaki. There is really nothing else about her that makes her standout as an individual character other than the fact that she's the main character (and kind of cute at times).\\n\\n\r\nNozaki is someone who is mentally unaware of almost everything around him, despite him being this so called amazing manga creator. He comes off as so bland and so unaware of social cues that it begins to infuriate you by the second episode. We all know his character isn't supposed to be this sporadic and overally emotional guy, but his drab demeanor could have benefited from some sort of development of his personality.\\n\\n\r\nSince the two main characters are obviously nothing special, and since the entire plot is based upon Sakura's love for Nozaki, the series was in dire need of some dynamic characters. Although, the series could have possibly been better without the rest of the cast altogether...\\n\\n\r\nYou have Yuzuki, who happens to be great at sports and great at singing despite being even more aloof than Nozaki. That's right boys and girls, we couldn't have just one severely obtuse character that already intensifies the frustration factor. Instead, the creators decided to give us two severely obtuse characters, hooray!\\n\\n\r\nThere is also Yuu, a girl who hits on all the other girls at the school and makes all the guys jealous of her \"swag\". I actually thought the idea of her character was quite enticing, but the writers fell flat with keeping you entertained by her. \\n\\n\r\n There is also the worst character of this entire fucking series, Masayuki...we'll get to why he's the worst a little later.\\n\\n\r\nThe last person I will name is Hirotaka, the character that nobody gives two damns about. The only reasons why I am mentioning him is because of his interaction with Nozaki and Yuzuki.\\n\\n\r\nI would name everyone else, but the rest of those characters either don't matter and should have never been in the series in the first place, or they were there because they HAD to be in the series but they didn't contribute to making the plot any better. \\n\\n\r\nFrom watching this series it appears as though the creators wanted to defy typical anime stereotypes that are shown in every other series known to man. There is only one problem, they decided to take these stereotypes and simply switch the genders...which makes them what? Still stereotypes!\\n\\n\r\nInstead of Yuu being a man who gets all the girls, her character is a woman. And despite Masayuki being the opitomy of an abusive tsundere piece of shit (which is a more common stereotype for female characters in anime) his character is a man.\\n\r\nMasayuki always seems to be annoyed with Yuu for absolutely NO reason, and if he has a reason it is never ever justified. Now, I am already uncomfortable with how physical female tsundere characters can be towards other male characters, but when it is the other way around it becomes even more uncomfortable (especially since the ONE thing that seperates men and women is physiology, and unfortunately the general amount of women are not able to physically handle a hit from a man). Masayuki is constantly punching and kicking Yuu around, despite Yuu never really doing anything for it to be deserved. However, the creators are trying to convince that since Yuu seems to be into other women and because she comes off as a male character that we should all be okay with this already fucked up stereotype of beating up people you call your friends (or those they have a crush on). Normally you see in other anime that when a female character hits a male character it is okay because of the fact that it is a woman hitting a man, which is already not okay. However, the stereotype is switched here and we should all simply except it because a female character is considered \"barely female\" so long as she behaves like a man *rolls eyes*. \\n\r\nYou can claim that I may be reading into it, but even if their interactions don't require anyone to read into that deeply it doesn't stop it from being exaspirating to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nYou also have the interactions between Yuzuki and Hirotaka, whom depending upon who you are, had probably contributed to some of the more pointless scenes of this series. Yuzuki could have been entertaining by herself, but the fact that she was dragged down by Hirotaka's obsession for why he thought Yuzuki would pick on him added to the amount of frustration I already had for this show. More often you see in other anime series that cliche of the male character coming across as if he didn't like another cliche female character, even though he did actually liked her (which I guess we are to assume was the case here). However, I could have excused this cliche so long as there was some sort of development between the two...but there was none.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of character development, did I mention there is none?...abso...lutely...none. \\n\r\nNow, I was willing to look past that flaw, but the problem is that these characters are so poorly written and their interactions are so cringe worthy that if each one had developed in a fervent way then it could have saved the plot.\\n\r\nThe only character that was a well written cliche and wasn't in dreadful need of development was Mikorin and his \"otakuness\". \\n\\n\r\nThis series had the opportunity to defy cliche stereotypes and create a great and unique slice of life anime. Instead the writers not only contributed to these cliche stereotypes, but they made them more profound.\\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind, this is a more popular aime series and is well loved by many fans. So my reasons for not liking it does not reflect the way you as an individual has to feel about this series. \\n\r\nI say give this a shot regardless of how I feel, but no amount of convincing will change my opinion on why I gave this show the rating that I did.\\n\\n\r\nSIDE NOTE: I heard from a friend that they happened to enjoy the manga more than they did the anime. So I suppose that is always worth looking into. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is about a high school girl, Sakura Chiyo, who has a crush on her schoolmate, Nozaki Umetarou, a shoujo manga artist. She tried to confess to him but was mistaken as a fan of his manga and ended up as one of his assistants. Then, revolving around these two, the story goes on.\r\nSounds a lot like a typical shoujo romance, right? Let me correct that, GSNK is all about comedy. Bits of cute moments here and there but mainly comedy and it's done right.\r\nWhile the plot is simple enough to be summed up in mere sentences, character is definitely the strongest pointof this anime. The main cast consist of seven. There are four guys \u2014 the mangaka, the self-proclaimed playboy, the drama club senpai plus the basketball kouhai. And three girls \u2014 the heroine, the oblivious Lorelei and the prince of the school. Yes, prince. You read it right. Individually, they have their quirks and are so likable you'll have a hard time picking a favorite. (In case you happen to hate all of them, fear not, there are also lots of tanukis)\\n\\n\r\nThe best parts, however, are their relationships and their interactions. Thanks to the creativeness of the author, this group of characters plays off of each other so well you can randomly throw any two or more of them in a normal high school life situation, add some shoujo manga related topic, think from their perspectives, let them converse for a while and get a laugh or two out of it.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, that's what GSNK is all about.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is what you would expect from a 2014 anime and the art style is faithful to the original manga. OP and ED songs are very catchy and fit for the light-hearted atmosphere of the anime. I actually like the opening song a lot. As for other OSTs, I honestly couldn't catch it because I was busy laughing. The VAs are great. There're many famous names in the cast (Miyano Mamoru is the protagonist of Nozaki's manga, mind you) but my favorite is Ozawa Ari. She portrayed Sakura perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nFor enjoyment, I didn't read the manga before and I enjoyed it very much. I also prefer the anime version even after reading.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is fun, refreshing and very easy to get into. Personally, I love it so if you're looking for something different, if you like comedy or if you want a shoujo version of Gintama, I highly recommend this anime.",

            "content": "Before writing the actual review, I'd just like to throw something out there. I am  a HUGE fan of romance. About 90% of the entries in my anime & manga list have some form of romance. I'm the kind of guy who'd drop a point or two if there isn't a conclusive ending. However, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is an exception. In fact, after some time, I really didn't care if the show was going to be conclusive or not. This should show you just how great of a show it is for me to toss aside my ideals. If you're looking for a romance,turn back now because for the most part, the romance aspect is only implemented for comedic and adorable situations, not actual romance.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of plot, I'd say it doesn't really have one. Yea, in the first episode, Chiyo Sakura tries to confess to Nozaki and accidentally becomes his assistant, but this was just to get things started. If anything Gekkan (How I'll refer to the show whenever I bring it up) is like The Daily Lives of High Schools Boys and Nichijou, in that the show mostly focuses on the characters, mostly the main group of friends, and their interactions with one another plus their antics on a day to day basis, so basically an episodic anime. Episodic anime can be a hit or miss depending on what you're looking for, but if it's comedy, it's usually a hit and Gekkan is definitely a hit.\\n\\n\r\nQuite frankly, the interactions in Gekkan are absolutely heart-warming. Unlike most romance anime, Gekkan doesn't give you false hope. In romance anime, some interactions may piss you off because you don't want anyone intervening between two certain characters or you know its going to lead to some face-palm inducing misunderstanding. On the other hand, Gekkan gives you moments that you just want more and more of. Being they're adorable and they don't throw in characters for the sake of wavering feelings. Not to mention, a majority of the moments are extremely hilarious. Most, if not all them, got laughing me for at least a good minute. Gekkan is just that good at portraying certain scenarios. In other shows, these scenarios just wouldn't be as funny, they might even make you shake your head or cringe in embarrassment. In the end, Gekkan's \"plot\" gives a wide array of heart-warming, adorable, and amusing moments.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing as how the show revolves around the lives of people who do some form of art work, it'd be really sad, if the art turned out to be lackluster. Thankfully, it isn't. The characters are drawn very well and their reactions never fail to amuse me. The scenery isn't bad itself.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the OP is one of the catchiest openings, I've ever heard. I always find myself humming or singing parts of the song from time to time. The ending as well is pretty good. I don't know really know if this makes sense, but the ending just gives off a vibe that's the ending. It just actually sounds like the end of something. Lastly, the voice actors are amazing too, their voices perfectly align with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what I find to be the strongest part of the show. Without their quirks, the show just wouldn't be the same. Never have I seen an anime that has such a likable cast. \\n\\n\r\nThe first character of this wonderful cast is Chiyo Sakura. A petite and extremely adorable girl who tries to win over Nozaki, but unfortunately fails, due to Nozaki's unusual density. She is also quite optimistic believing certain situations will finally bring her and Nozaki together, but it's never the case, with it being either a misunderstanding or insensitive actions on Nozaki's side. \\n\\n\r\nThe second character is Umetarou Nozaki. A tall man who is completely oblivious to real life scenarios despite being an author of romantic manga. A good portion of the comedy comes from this guy. He works on a logical level rather than an emotional one thus he doesn't hesitate to do things, others would see as rude or inconsiderate. With these actions, comes misunderstandings or thoughts of how indirectly cruel Nozaki is. It may sound bad at first, but these scenes are always hilarious. You may feel bad for Chiyo, but it will still leaving you laughing. \\n\\n\r\nThe third major character were introduced to is Mikoto Mikoshiba, a gorgeous and smooth-talking man. Guys like these tend to come off as annoying in Shoujos, but Mikoto isn't exactly as I described him to be. In reality, he blushes every time he tries to smooth talk a girl and even though he can get any girl he wants, he's an avid player of dating sims and collector of female figurines. \\n\\n\r\nNext, we have Masayuki Hori, the president of the Drama Club. He's an astounding actor who punishes Yuu Kashima almost every episode for either laziness, flirting, or just idiotic antics. \\n\\n\r\nYuu Kashima is the arch-rival of Mikoto as well as the Prince of the School, but she's also a girl. Essentially, she's a reverse trap. Kashima frequently tries to impress Hori, but he just finds it annoying. Many would say he's just a tsundere though. \\n\\n\r\nNext, we have Yuzuki Seo, a cruel cruel mistress. She's quite socially inept as she can never sense the atmosphere and she finds great pleasure in using pain to get what she wants. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have Hirotaka Wakamatsu, an innocent and naive basketball player, who is always on the receiving end of Seo's painful actions. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also supporting characters such as Mitsuya Maeno, Nozaki's former editor, a guy you should hate but just can't. In short, the cast of Gekkan is extremely likable to the point, where  they can turn annoying tropes into wonderful and fabulous characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gekkan is a great show that knows how to play its cards right when it comes to using romance for comedy. They know their boundaries by not taking a complete 180 and start becoming serious. It truly is a wonderful show because they never cross the line between romance for comedy and romance so you don't have to experience getting your hopes up. You just continue enjoying the cute moments between the characters without expecting. I highly recommend you watch it because it is a comedic masterpiece that knows when to tone things down and how to utilize a colorful cast for the most gloriously hilarious moments.",

            "content": "NOTICE ME SENPAI.\r\nThis show is probably the epitome that defines the meme. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun) is about this cute girl named Chiyo Sakura who tries to get the attention of the manly Umetaro Nozaki. You might probably guess it but she has a crush on the guy. From her initial introduction, it\u2019s clear that she wants his attention. But in a show like this, one should also acknowledge the denseness of Nozaki. In fact, his misunderstanding of Sakura as a \u2018hardcore fan\u2019 only begins the first steps of this hilarious gag anime.\r\nDirected by Mitsue Yamazaki, it\u2019s refreshing to see this piece ofwork based off the manga being animated. The adaptation is actually based on a comedy gag 4-koma with each chapter telling stories about the characters. In the anime, they are interconnected each episode in a way that tells a story. That story is about Nozaki and Sakura with their little adventures. I should probably reword that and say that their adventure is recognized as more of an experimental journey. Their goal? To create a shoujo manga of the coming ages.\\n\\n\r\nA success to the show combines the formula of romance and comedy. The romance part is the weaker of the half as Nozaki is dense as a rock. But taken the comedy part for granted, the show succeeds with its delivery. Most of it comes from the characters but also the clever timing. It is the precision that plays a key role as comedy scenes are usually created by character expressions and dialogues. In particular, Sakura\u2019s over analysis of certain situations and her delusion from reality makes for some great laughs. Furthermore, there\u2019s Nozaki that often sticks with too much common sense and misinterprets certain situations. If you\u2019re looking for one of those anime where a cute girl tries to the attention of her senpai, this is it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story on most parts is constructed by the context of character relationships. In fact, most of the characters (besides Nozaki and Sakura) gets a good amount of screen time. The show emphasizes their relationship in a more comedic way with gags rather than any serious development like you would see though. Yet, it creates that atmosphere of fun. In essence, this series puts fun first and almost everything else second. This also includes the series\u2019 premise to create shoujo manga. Throughout the series, we do see progress on the manga our main characters tries to create. However, it\u2019s also easy to notice that he gets a lot of his ideas from character relationships. It\u2019s like an experimental way of crafting his work with the characters as framework. This also extends further with Nozaki\u2019s ambition to get himself involved in events as long as his work entails its ideas. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, the show depicts them comically by each of their presence. Characters such as Yuzuki Seo and Yu Kashima attracts more attention than others; although very differently. In fact, the show commits to the characters and bring out their best. Seo\u2019s tomboyish personality combined with her opera-like voice is a prominent example of this. On the contrary, the show also likes to make fun of its characters by creating anti-thesis of their outer shells. Mikoto Mikoshiba is a good example of this as his princely outlooks are used to hide his feminine personality. This is taken further with Kashima, a female character who shows almost 90% of her personality as a male. In retrospect, the show maintains its position as a rom-com shoujo with humor coming to blight first. The romance is hardly noticeable but rather played out as a spoof. Character relationships are beta level at best so don\u2019t expect any sort of strong commitment. There\u2019s no emphasis on powerful characterization through flashbacks. Rather, it\u2019s a journey of fun with our characters as they spend their daily lives.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being lean on romance, there\u2019s a lot of feminine dynamics focused on the show. One noticeable aspect involves the shoujo manga Nozaki tries to create. His work \u201cLet\u2019s Fall in Love\u201d is saturated with so much clich\u00e9s that it outshines Nozaki and Sakura\u2019s relationship in terms of their romance development. This is because his manga is developed throughout the show with ideas from the show\u2019s events itself. Nozaki takes experiences and perfects them into his manga. In essence, he plays the role of a professor to learn about the manga world, in particular shoujo. In fact, there\u2019s a wide spectrum of ideas including delinquents, tomboys, and school girls all packaged into his work. All of them are inspired directly or indirectly from other characters. There\u2019s some ways fans could see this as a parody of the show itself. Either way, it can be hard to take it seriously as the show doesn\u2019t focus the idea with coming-age development. This and the romance ships will play you like a fool if you expect any endgame.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is defined by mostly with its trademark expressions. Characters portrays a wide variety of expressions but the most easily recognized is Sakura and her moments. This is especially true when she over-thinks a situation and deconstructs its reality. It sharply contrasts with Nozaki who is designed like a manly guy and with a dull expression. Otherwise, the other main characters are designed with bishounen-esque framework such as Kashima and Mikoshiba (minus that skirt of course). Animation studio Dogakobo (Love Lab, GJ-Bu, Mikakunin de Shink\u014dkei) animates most of the characters to life similar to their other works. It\u2019s noticeable how they are able to focus each character individually and collectively as ensemble. In this show, they achieve their purpose again and even conveys its message that it\u2019s based off of a manga with the polka dots and generic backgrounds. Oh and don\u2019t expect much fan service, at least for the guys anyways. This show\u2019s artwork offers much more service for the ladies.\\n\\n\r\nAs for soundtrack, the show isn\u2019t very noticeable. Most of the soundtrack is pretty standard and unremarkable. Because comedy makes up the major toppings of the show, the soundtrack too plays with itself in repetitive cycles. It almost feels as if the soundtrack feels exactly the same with little mood change throughout the series. Only during a few moments when situations gets a bit tense does the soundtrack offer a degree of highlight. Luckily, the character voice mannerisms make up for this. Every main character has a flair to define their personalities when it comes to their voices. The only problem I have is with Chiyo\u2019s voice as she sounds too much like a child. The endless dense moments from Nozaki puts her efforts to shame as she blames herself from not coming out of her shell. Luckily, this isn\u2019t much of a distraction as some of the other characters. The OP and ED songs are brutally cute with the lyrics that will knock you into this world.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is great of a laugh. I don\u2019t mean it just laughing at the characters or what the show it\u2019s trying to do. Rather, it\u2019s about the way characters play their roles and how it connects each episode. The chemistry mostly comes with character relationships. And despite not to be taken seriously for development, it\u2019s humorous with their behavior. It\u2019s like taking a group of characters and put them into a fantasy world where they use their experiences to tell a story. That\u2019s exactly what Nozaki has been doing with his shoujo work. In the end though, you\u2019ll be getting a whole load of laughs so lock your windows before the neighbors tells you to shut up. \\n",

            "content": "What? Another show where they write manga? And it\u2019s romance, too? Haven\u2019t we seen these tropes already?\r\nI warn thee, do not be so dismissive of Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun just from reading its summary. This show may surprise you. And to anyone who says these words with excitement rather than skepticism, sit back and grab your computer, because you will definitely enjoy this.\r\nOkay, here we go.\r\nPlot\r\nUmetarou Nozaki is a high school student highlighting as a popular shoujo manga artist, recruiting his friends to help him. This show doesn\u2019t have too much of a basic plot. Instead it relies on the interactions between its characters to providehumor in small scenarios. Most revolve around the characters planning or \u201cresearching\u201d the most common shoujo tropes despite their relative inexperience with romance. This show highlights the ridiculousness of romance stories in general by . Although he second main character, Sakura Chiyo, has a terrible crush on Nozaki, nothing is ever played as over angsty. All the characters interactions were refreshingly pure. The show lets us into the fact that romance and friendships in high school don\u2019t have to be dramatic, but can and probably should be fun and silly.\\n\r\nConsidering this anime was adapted from a 4koma I think this show does a marvelous job of translating gag strips into coherent, albeit shortened plotlines. Most episodes have two back-to-back episodic mini-plots that make this show very good for casual or repeated viewing.\\n\r\nHowever, I would say that the show doesn\u2019t really come into its full stride until perhaps the third episode when enough dynamic characters have been introduced that the humor in-group interplay can be fully milked.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe real standouts in this show are really its characters. For starters we have a pretty even split of male and female, who also each get equal amounts of screen time. Their designs are a bit too similar, but this is lamp shaded within the material and they each have such distinct personalities (not to mention colour schemes), that the same face is never an issue.\\n\r\nThe titular character (who looks more like a 20 something salary man than a high school student, but I digress) appears to be our basic stoic type, but taken to a humorous extreme. This keeps his character from falling into the dangers common around this archetype, either ending up being just boring and needlessly callous. We are also given moments of ranging emotion from tenderness, to embarrassment, to excited passion that lend him needed humanity. So I can say, I know boys like this. \\n\r\nNext is our pigtailed heroine. Do not let the first five minutes let you mistake her for an eternally blushing doormat of a high school girl with a crush. Sakura Chiyo is a developed character that is not defined by her relationship, but defined by her pre-meditated actions towards furthering her relationships to others (whether her plans are successful or not is another matter). I found her very relatable from my high school years. Her obsession with Nozaki is comedic, but never pitied or mocked by the narrative, as is so common in teenage girl crush plotlines. And the last episode gave her (to keep spoiler free) a level of maturity that I did not expect from her type of character. Also, did I mention she\u2019s ADORABLE?\\n\r\nThe rest of the ensemble is composed of quirky misfits who are celebrated for their oddness, each of them brining something extra to the table that truly makes this anime fun. While I could go into detail on why I love the personality design of each, in order to save space I will not. (Go watch it and find out.)\\n\r\nThe characters don\u2019t really go through too much development over the course of the twelve episodes, but we get so little screen time that I didn\u2019t really expect it and it would be jarring if there were huge changes.  However, Nozaki and Sakura each get subtle developments; mostly in their attitudes are relationship towards each other that gives the series enough momentum to feel like it naturally progresses towards a finale, despite its episodic nature.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetic\\n\r\nI adore the look of this show. The palettes are bright, but not blinding and the backgrounds wonderfully detailed. The characters seem to fit within their environments rather than placed on top of them.  The animation is good, taking advantage of the form. Much situational humour is dependent upon sight gags through off model or caricatured facial expressions, this variety adds to the charm and visual interest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nThe incidental music is pretty standard and not anything to write home about (except the intro which is wonderfully upbeat and sets the tone perfectly), but the score does its job in enhancing the comedic effect of the series. Examples being, exaggerated scores during purposefully overdramatic scenes of trivial events, or played straight tender music during romantic scenes only to be dashed through the sharp stop of a punchline. Otherwise, it does its job providing a cheerful background to the series.\\n\\n\r\nSub/Dub\\n\r\nAll the voice actors did great jobs on this show and it seems obvious it was fun for them to work on. All are good at swinging between the different emotions in the script. Special mention to Nakamura Yuichi (Nozaki) for going monotone for three eps and then breaking out with an impassioned speech and hilariously embarrassed groans and shocked exclamations while all still feeling in character.\\n\\n\r\nCurrently, there is no dub version of Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\r\nMonthly Girls Nozaki Kun is honestly one of my new favourite animes and definitely my must watch pick of this last season (yes, I thought it was better than Free!). It\u2019s colourful and earnest, funny without deprecating a single gender, engaging and entertaining, everything I want from a comedy. \\n\r\nScore: 9/10\\n\r\nHIGHLY RECCOMENDED\\n\\n\r\nYou can watch this show for free on CrunchyRoll\\n",

            "content": "Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is an anime that I believe anyone will enjoy, but I would recommend it especially to viewers who are looking for a romance anime without necessarily wanting to go on a powerful emotional rollercoaster; in fact, in many ways this show is a parody of your typical sh\u014djo romance anime, and it's handled wonderfully. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is high school comedy done right.\r\nThe anime follows Sakura and her endless struggle with confessing her feelings to her schoolmate Nozaki, who also happens to be a sh\u014djo manga artist who goes under the pseudonym Sakiko Yumeno. Nozaki mistakes her for a fan, but invitesSakura home and eventually she becomes his assistant. This is where the anime really begins. What this show does so well is how fluidly it introduces its character cast and their lives as high school students. The anime is filled with running gags, clich\u00e9 sh\u014djo elements turned upside down, witty jokes and scenarios, and the great characters really make it all come to life. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely the highlight of the anime. The show introduces a quirky and colourful cast of unique characters that compliment each other nicely. They create great dynamics throughout the anime and it's nothing but a joy to watch them interact with each other. I'm not going to spend time describing what each character is like, because I want you to find out on your own, but I'm sure that you'll love them just as much as I did, especially if you are into slice of life or high school comedies. What Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun does is that it takes time to develop the side characters as well, instead of just treating them as one-dimensional sidekicks that don't serve much purpose except for just being there. I feel that many shows walk into this trap, but this anime isn't just about Sakura and Nozaki, but about all the characters in the cast, and the show isn't afraid of focusing its attention away from our lovestruck heroine and towards the other characters and their lives as well. This is key to developing compelling characters, and while this is not always a must as far as comedies are concerned, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun really succeeds in this regard, and you will want to follow each one of them.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to art and sound the show also delivers. The artstyle is colourful and pleasing to the eye; the characters are distinct and neatly designed, and the music compliments the setting and atmosphere nicely. In fact, the music can be so good and evocative at times that I managed to have emotional responses to scenes that were meant as jokes. The seiyuu do a wonderful job at portraying each character, and the opening is one of the catchiest I've heard in recent anime, and the ending radiates a very nice and appropriate feeling. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, you've got a hilarious parody of the sh\u014djo romance genre in a typical high school comedy setting, and it's beautifully executed. It has wonderful characters that are a joy to follow, and countless situations that will have you laughing. I definitely recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys slice of life comedies. It doesn't redefine the genre in any way and it won't blow you away, but it doesn't have to. If there is a 2014 anime that is worth checking out, it's Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. \\n\\n\r\nA solid 7/10",

            "content": "Story: (9/10)\r\nNozaki-kun doesn't really have a story, unlike One Piece where it has a goal of becoming the Pirate King and obtaining One Piece. What it has is what I would call an outline.\r\nNozaki, our male hero, misunderstood our heroine, Sakura, feelings and what happens next is what makes this anime golden! The interactions between the characters are what makes this anime alive and using the traditional Japanese comedy style, the manzai. It involves two people, one the straight man and the other being the funny man and it involves mutual misunderstandings, double-talk, puns and other verbal gags. So if you were thinking this isa romance story then stop right there because the misunderstood confession between our main characters are only the foundation of this anime and once again the interaction between the characters are what makes this anime what it is. Even so, if this anime knows what they are doing, then they will know that even though the comedy is what makes their audience comes, it is the blossoming love between our main characters that makes us stay! So if they do know what they are doing, this anime might contain some very cute romance moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, the interactions between the characters are what makes this anime comes alive, but this won't work without interesting characters now won't it?\\n\\n\r\nEvery characters are beautifully written and you cannot hate any of them. Well... maybe there is one... just watch episode 5 okay...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway! Every comedy out there includes the so normal characters (the straight man) and the weird characters (the funny man) and when they meet, ta-dah! comedy happen!\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Nozaki-kun so good are probably because you don't know who's going to be the normal one and who's gong to be the weird one. \\n\\n\r\nEach character are very much normal, that's why they could live in school so peacefully but they are added a little bit of a hidden personality that only comes out when the characters we are given talk to each other. If it's anyone else, they will be most likely conceive as normal.\\n\\n\r\nWe have our main heroine, Sakura Chiyo! Who confesses to our other main character, Nozaki, but uses the wrong phrase and founds out her crush secret. That is, him being a shoujo mangaka! That itself is a gag, a big burly man writing a girly love story when he, himself, has yet know love. Sakura is most of the time the normal one, the straight man, the one that calls out on the weirdness that the other characters are doing. But she too can be the funny man, for her crush on Nozaki can't really be called a crush but an obsession.\\n\\n\r\nOur other main character, Nozaki Umetarou, a shoujo mangaka, who misunderstood Sakura's confession and somehow got her to be his assistant. Oblivious to Sakura's feeling, he lives his days trying to make his manga better and trying to get more materials for it. \\n\\n\r\nOur other recurring characters too are what you can call reverses. Think of many tropes that our manga/anime are using right now and I can assure you that our recurring characters are the opposite of it. I don't want to give any spoilers so go watch it right now!\\n\\n\r\nArt: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nAnimes this year do not disappoint! And that includes Nozaki-kun! True to its title, the art are very shoujo like with huge eyes that takes half of the face without really seeing the nose and small mouth. But the animation is steady and does not disappoint. The faces and reaction are a huge plus too!\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhy does all of the animes this year have such good openings?! Nozaki-kun start with a happy and upbeat opening that makes you hum along. The ending is nothing special but it totally sounds nice. \\n\\n\r\nThe background music makes the interaction between the characters comes more alive and they are used very well. While they do not make your eyes wander from the show because how awesome it is but you will at least once notice them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nSome of the jokes are unfortunately are not done right for me, for someone who already read the manga, so some of them seems like it wasn't transitioned right. But for the people who don't know anything about this anime or manga then it will be totally okay. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime includes some of the animes traditional tropes, comedy, and puns so for someone who has yet watch many anime it might be difficult to understand why its funny so be careful!\\n\\n\r\nBut should you watch this anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer is YES!\\n",

            "content": "There's always two kinds of anime that are really hard to find whenever you look for them: a) a consistent one, and b) a comedy that caters to everyone's taste. Taking the huge amount of series that come out every year, one might find oneself baffled to know that there's just so many of them that actually manage to have some sort of balance. It makes you wonder whether there's no point in expecting something good to come out at all, but, just like everything, there's always an exception. And this season, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is the one that took the anime world by itsfeet.\\n\\n\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is the ultimate shoujo parody. Taking the premise of a teenage shoujo mangaka, the show uses any mean to mock most of the common clich\u00e9s and tropes of the genre, taking them to the ridiculous extent or showing the inherent flaws of their existence. With Nozaki as the central character and Chiyo as the female lead and romantic interest, what one might find at first to be a lighthearted romcom turns out be one of the funniest anime in existence.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is far from special. Is pretty much as the synopsis says, with little to no romantic progress to all of the \"pairings\". However it is hard to complain about this, given that the ingenious quality of the gags and sketches is what makes this show unique and worthwhile. It manages to stay consistently funny through all of its season, provoking from chuckles to histerical laughter in every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, it is probably the best part of the show. From the dense Nozaki, to the tender yet down-to-earth Chiyo, to a certain male heroin, and the rest of the cast, they all have a special charisma to them, making them all likeable and funny. Their interactions are gold (especially when it comes to the pairings), and one might find oneself rolling on the floor of laughter by the brilliance of their antics coming in opposition to each other. It's also worth mention that some of their personalities come from subversions of shoujo archetypes, which only adds to their uniqueness.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is done by Dokagobo, and I must say, it's great. It's devoid of all the big shonen fights or the rather extravagant imagery one would find in animes of Shaft, but it's still better than most. It's fluid, consistant, and no matter the angle, the characters are always well drawn. The colors are vivid and wonderful, adding to the light atmosphere of the show. The backgrounds are all well and everything is in its place. If we talk about character desing, then it's kind of generic, but good enough for a series like this.\\n\\n\r\nThe music isn't epic or amazing, but fits every scene. Every sound is ritghtly timed for comedic effect, and the bgm does its work well. The seiyuu, for their part, have all a good understanding of their character, and fit them perfectly. This is especially true in the case of Ari Ozawa (Chiyo), something laudable given that's her first leading role in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in terms of enjoyment, where does this show stand? Pretty high, I must say. I laughed every single episode, and loved all of the characters. There was nothing I could really complain too much about, so, if you ask me, I would say you'd be wasting a great treat if you don't watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nLet me repeat it: Watch this. You won't regret becoming a Nozaki's character.",

            "content": "After watching all 12 episodes, I would have to say that Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is by far one of the best romantic comedies I have watched, and probably the best anime of the summer 2014 season. Here's why.\r\nStory- The story was great, and I found it very enjoyable to watch. The plot follows a girl named Chiyo Sakura, who confesses to her crush, Nozaki, but gets misunderstood which leads to her becoming his assistant. Despite her attempts to get closer to him this way, she ends up getting misunderstood each time which makes for great comedic, hilarious moments. Eventually, she meets the rest of Nozaki'sassistance and things just get even crazier. No matter where they are at, or what they're doing, there are always a bunch of crazy, stupid moments that will make you laugh in every episode. There are times where the story seems to get little serious, but the complete opposite ends up happening, and it's so stupid, that I couldn't help but laugh and feel amused. The show is a romantic comedy, but I found that there was a lot more comedy than romance, but you see elements of both into play which keeps the show interesting. Between all the comedy and misunderstandings, you can't help but wonder if the romance will go anywhere or what the characters will do next. The comedy is a bit predictable at times, but it didn't really take away the enjoyment of the show and most of the times, it still funny. It stays original for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The animation was great. The colors and backgrounds popped out, and it flowed smoothly throughout the show. The character details, wonderful scenery, it was all executed well. It's what you would expect from a 2014 anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The OP and ED were't the best, but I thought it fit the show really well and it was kinda catchy too. As far as the BGM's go, they were placed in the correct scenes and fit the mood. I didn't find anything wrong with the voice acting, it was solid and I thought each character was conveyed well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The characters are probably the best part of this show. The comedic moments, and what they do in their daily lives make them hard to forget. They are all unique, with various different personalities, and all the characters combined together make the show more enjoyable to watch as a whole. Their interactions with each other create funny, random moments. There are also times where you find yourself rooting for one specific character mainly because of how hilarious or unique they are. I even found that some of the side, supporting characters stood out despite not being a main. Whether it's Nozaki for his dedication, Chiyo for her cuteness, Seo for her craziness, You'll find a character you adore and love.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Overall, I loved this show and couldn't stop watching it from episode one. The characters are so memorable, and story is just great. If you're looking for a light-hearted, funny anime to watch, this is for you. \\n\r\n-RayRay-Kun",

But,nevertheless I still enjoyed how all of them are conveyed.the main 2 leads are okay and I like their personalities.I like how Chiyo is mature compared to the rest of the cast but can be just as wacky if Nozaki is involved. I like how eccentric Nozaki is especially when he is trying to find inspiration for his manga and he uses his friends as bases for his characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10)\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime a lot and I was sad to see it end.if it will ever be a season two, I would definitely watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(10/10)\\n\r\nGekka Shoujo Nozaki-kun is not a typical romantic comedy ,but it is still an anime worth watching,I recommend this anime for people like romantic comedy but with only a little romance.",

I kindly recommend you to step back if you're expecting a Shoujo anime andI give you a warm welcome if you're into a comedic show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in a high school with a female student as our main protagonist, Chiyo Sakura, who has a crush on a fellow student, Nozaki Umetarou, who is in the same grade. With Chiyo's misunderstood confession to Nozaki she gains the knowledge that he is actually a Mangaka whose Shoujo manga is published monthly in a magazine and somehow ends up as an assistant of his and thus we begin our daily life featuring Chiyo and Nozaki and their fellow companions.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, there isn't much to say since it doesn't follow a solid main story line of any sort except for the daily lives of Nozaki as a mangaka and how he sees the world differently from every other \"normal\" person would do.\\n\r\nI can't give a professional answer for the art & sound field since I don't usually pay much attention to it, but the art was definitely well-done. I wouldn't call it particularly great, but it was on an acceptable level to enjoy the show. For the sound, I found the opening song outstanding and very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nComing to characters this is probably one of the shows that has the most diverse characters that are typically to be seen in a manga or an anime. I believe this is what makes the show really enjoyable for they lead the show to multiple unexpected outcomes of events which turns out absolutely hilarious. The humor is very different from any other I have seen so far as well.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe this is a show that can be enjoyed by anyone and I recommend this to anyone who are into comedic shows and don't mind having it a solid plot line. If you decide to give it a go I hope that you will find your enjoyable moments as I did. \\n\\n\r\nI give this a show a 9/10.",

            "content": "Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun (Monthly Girls' Nozaki-Kun) is a fantastic comedy anime. Throughout all twelve episodes the show was great fun to watch and was in general, one of the most fun anime's of the 2014 summer season.\r\nStory and Characters \r\nThe story for the show is quite simple but is really fun. With the exeption of Bakuman I have never really been fond of the other animes out there that follows characters making manga,but this is one of the few ones out there I believe to be done well. Which to me is suprising considering that the original magaka's other works have not very well recievedas far as I know.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very likeable and fun to watch and I believe are what makes the show so great. Starting with Nozaki, the writer and artist of the manga, \"Let's fall in Love\". Who despite writing shoujo manga, has no personal experience in love whatsoever. So he is completley oblivious to Sakura's feelings towards him. And in general is quite weird. Then there's Sakura, a member of the school art club and a girl who admires Nozaki, and is the character who's point of view we see througout. Then there's the rest of Nozaki's assistants, starting with Mikoshiba, who is quite popular and flirtatious with girls. Though on the inside he's really shy otaku and often hides in embarassment after saying bold statements. There's also Hori, president of the school drama club and is very self consious about his short height. Then there's Wakamatsu, who joins Nozaki later to apply screentones to panels. He is part of the basketball team. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the art and animation this show is not a technical marvel by any strech of the imagination, but what's here is very well done and does what it's supposed to do. The expresions on the characters faces are varied, and there is no point in the series where the animation is noticabley off-model. Overall Dogakobo did a good job on the animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the series fits the situations the characters are in well, but are not really anything that I would listen to on it's own, with the exeption of the track that plays during the credits of the final episode, as it is really catchy. The OP is also great, and the ED is okay but nothing spectacular. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nThis show is just a blast to watch. The jokes thrown at the screen are almost always hilarious, the characters are lovable and are great fun to watch, and while the story is simple, it is much better executed that most animes about people making manga (with the exeption of Bakuman. That shall never be topped.). This series is definetly worth watching, and since it's free on Crunchyroll you really have no excuse not to watch it, unless you are not into comedies. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nOverall - 9 \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun does a great job adapting its manga counterpart to the small screen. The manga is written in 4-koma style, which can cause the storyline to become choppy and confusing at times. The anime really brings all of the smaller scenarios together to create one fluid story.\r\n[ Nozaki-kun adapts content from chapter 1 to chapter 31 of the manga; the two stories are identical up to chapter 13 (where you will find small tidbits and/or explanations not present in the anime). From this point forward, you will find new stories (e.g. chapter 21 featuring Ken-san's background) as well as content seen in theanime, but in a different order. These differences are negligible and do not detract from the overall story. ]\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\r\nThe art and sound are great and stay consistent throughout the series. The opening intro is upbeat, catchy, and full of color. (Definitely a favorite of mine!) The closing credits were lackluster in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nAlthough the characters could be described by many tropes prevalent in anime, each and every one one was extremely like-able. You can almost see the punchlines coming, but the execution is so well done, you'll still be left in laughter.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series so much, I ended up watching it twice: once alone and twice when I had company over. After previewing the first two episodes, each one of my friends continued watching until the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun was definitely a hit for the summer 2014 season. I watched it on a whim thinking I was getting myself into another typical shoujo romance (and boy was I wrong). It started as something to pass time, but shortly became one of the series I had to watch as soon as the simulcast became available. If there's any series you should watch when you've got nothing in your queue, pick Nozaki-kun and you won't regret it.",

            "content": "I guess this beats Isshuukan Friends in terms of friend-zoning? heh...\r\nThe 'manga' theme stays alive in anime after 'Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to' with this interesting anime. I knew I would be expecting something grander like this. The first time I looked upon this before it aired, I wonder if it would be the same as the anime I mentioned earlier, but it happens not to be.\r\nThis season has quite a number of anime that varies in a lot of genres. While there's the dramatic Aldnoah.Zero, and the intense romantic-driven Ao Haru ride, we have the comedic heart-warming Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. Produced by Dogakobo, who madecute fascinating slice of life comedies, this anime never fails to make people enjoy. While we weep at those sad moments from other anime, we also smile at the wonders and joys in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOne fateful day, Chiyo confesses her love to Nozaki in a classroom. Mistaking her as a fan, he signs an autograph to her before inviting her to his house, where she finds out he is a manga artist. From there, she learns more about him and meet more characters Nozaki has worked alongside with his manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has a lot of hilarious comedy in it, from Nozaki's misunderstanding to the characters' personalities. I like how it uses a lot of shoujo manga tropes, as Nozaki draws shoujo manga, to make it funny as he often finds ways to make them appear in his manga. He has no experiences in love, hence his love manga may be a bit awkward, even his editor gets upset. It also portrays a typical high school crush, or one way love, as Chiyo tries to have Nozaki fall in love with her. Despite trying so, she always doesn't work out well, but in the end, she still feels a bit satisfied the way she is with him.\\n\\n\r\nMany times, this anime is very cute, not only because of Chiyo but also some of the characters as well. The story isn't very serious in terms of romance and I liked it. Sometimes, there are anime where they took romance too seriously that it went off-track with the main story.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion leaves a sweet feeling, yet a bit unexpected, for me at least. But it does close a good story well, although there is a continuation after the anime ending in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I would think that the characters are just another boring bunch of typical characters you see in slice of life anime. But I was surprised by the personalities of these characters which are quite unexpected. Of course, I love how these personalities portray the comedy the anime offers.\\n\\n\r\nNozaki seems to be feel neutral throughout the story, with the way he speaks, and the way he expresses his emotions. There isn't nothing negative about this. But sometimes he does smile or act happily with his friends or his thoughts. Meanwhile, Chiyo is the character which I find very pleasant about. She's very cute and I quite like her thoughts and decisions, which turned out to be the opposite effect sometimes. She hangs out with her friends well and definitely is rounded with her emotions. She is a character that doesn't seem to fit in a romantic-drama story, because she's unique in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters, naming some of them, Mikoto, Seo, Kashima, Hori, and Wakamatsu, whom are quite surprising with their personalities. Obviously, I would thought that they are just static characters that acts what they act as always. But I was happy to find out that they are also rounded characters because of their personalities and feelings towards one another.\\n\\n\r\nDespite not having a serious romance story, there are actually a number of ships in the story. While Chiyo goes for Nozaki, Kashima goes for Hori while Seo goes for Wakamatsu. Whatever the reasons shall be, I find that the story has some emphasis in these shippings as well and I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nThere is character development in some characters, mostly because they bonded together one another. Chiyo and Nozaki still has that 'friend-zoning' relationship which is still funny, while the rest still chases for their counterpart.\\n\\n\r\nI'm impressed with the art style that shows vibrant colours and nice tones. The scenery is spectacular and sometimes, the atmosphere is lively with idling animations from minor characters. The character designs are nice with a touch of matching personality with each character. Facial expressions are exaggerated to put up the comic relief, and most of them are very cute, especially from Chiyo. There is never any fan-service, which I find it satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nManga takes a role in this anime and Nozaki's drawings, with the help of others with their roles, make his manga looks cool. The opening visuals are awesome that feels like characters coming out from a manga book. The ending visuals, however, is a bit plain, but is still cute with Chiyo minding her own business.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song has to be the best opening of this season, due to its catchy beats and astounding vocals from Masayoshi Ooishi. I got to love how he sings and it makes me grove into the tunes. The ending is quite different, and it is such a heart-warming song. Sung by Chiyo's VA, Ari, it feels like I'm drowning in tears of joy and the rhythm just plays in galore. Both songs have some relation into the anime and I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the time, the background music is quite relaxed and it matches the mood of the scenes, along with the sound effects. The voice acting is perfect, with a lot of voice actors putting a lot of effort into voicing their respective characters. There are a number of recognisable voice actors such as Yuuichi (voicing Nozaki) and Miyuki (voicing Seo). Ari is relatively new into voice acting, and I think she did an awesome job voicing her first main character.\\n\\n\r\nI have absolutely enjoyed this anime from the start and I really hoped to see more of this in the future. I am glad this anime takes a huge following from the viewers and it is quite shocking because I thought it wouldn't be that famous. It has certainly became one of the best anime I have watched this season and I'm proud to feel that way.\\n\\n\r\nWell... I guess I must say goodbye to this wonderful cheery anime for now. I want my second season please!",

            "content": "Let me start by saying that I really, really enjoyed Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. When I first heard of this anime, my reaction was 'What the heck kind of name is that?!' In case you're wondering, the name comes from Nozaki-kun, one of the main characters who is a manga artist in a monthly girl's manga magazine.\r\nThe main strength of GSNK is in its ensemble cast. Apart from the main character (Sakura), the rest of the supporting cast are VERY unique and interesting individuals that make you want to know more about them. The characters play off one another in somewhat predictable ways once you knowthem, but the execution is flawless and had me laughing out loud many times. As a series about a guy writing girls' manga, it is very good at subverting gender roles for comedic effect in a way which won't make you feel uncomfortable, while also making fun of shoujo manga tropes.\\n\\n\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (GSNK) is adapted from an ongoing series of 4-panel comics and this is obvious if you know what to watch for. If you try hard, you can kind of see where the 'skits' start and end in each episode, though they are almost seamlessly stitched together in a coherent fashion. Because of this, there is not much character progression from the start to the end of the anime, though this may also be because it is only a 12 episode series which features a strong ensemble cast. By the time all the characters had been introduced and I felt comfortable with them, it was already episode 7 or 8, which only left a few episodes till the wrap up. The ending was extremely unsatisfying for me as there were just so many open threads which were left open. It almost feels like they were expecting more seasons, but unfortunately no news has been heard on that front to date :( (as of April 2015)\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I would like say that in order to fully enjoy this anime, you should have at least a passing familiarity with shoujo manga, or at least non-shounen battle-type manga (I read Ouran Highschool Host Club before watching this, and I believe this helped me appreciate the themes and subject matter a lot more).",

            "content": "If you're looking for an anime with romance and relationships, this isn't what you're looking for. If you're looking for an anime with endless hilarity and gags that runs off love and romance, this is what you're looking for. This anime thrives off misjudgments and the characters. \r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is an anime thats been the laughing central of this summer. With the theme of manga-artists becoming more popular lately such as, Manga-ka to assistant-san or mangirl ,it's becoming much more attractive and interesting to watch. This is a gem that's becoming popular due to its laughable characters and misinterpretations that occur all the time.\r\nThestory follows Sakura, a girl who tries to tell her crush that she likes him, but gets misinterpreted and ends up becoming his assistant. She often tries to get closer to him, but always gets misjudged and makes for some hilarious comedy. The story follows their life at school along with some other cast members to make the show enjoyable and a lot more entertaining to watch as a whole. With the running gag of it being comedy, some things may seem predictable, but it still stays original and has comedy in every episoded.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all really unique in their own way and is the strongest part of the show. With all the different characters you get hilarious situations that really makes the show stand out from the rest that's airing and one that takes comedy to the next level with their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nYou have Sakura, a girl who tries often to get close to her crush, but is always misinterpreted. She's a great person who makes the show better with her retorts and delusions that she thinks is going to happen, but the exact opposite happens. Over time she develops a bond with Nozaki and really makes for some friendship and gave a light feeling to make you smile at every scene.\\n\\n\r\nSecond you have Nozaki, a manga artist and one that people often misjudge. Since he stays up to draw and produce manga, he looks like he gets into fights, but really is only just aches and pains from the constant drawing and late nights. He's oblivious to Sakura's feelings and really makes up for some hilarious reactions that he gives to what he thinks she's doing. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is nothing new to the 2014 style, yet brings out details that makes it better than some of the anime airing. With all the details in the characters clothes, to the beautiful scenery that they go through in their situations, it brings out a sense of comedy to support the bickering and the interactions between all the characters. With the art being one of the strong points, you have beautiful details in every aspect that they bring to the table. The characters all have unique features and traits that belong to them and wonderful backdrops such as the school, or just at their house.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is nothing to be praised for, but is super catchy. The background music for this anime is one that supports the mood that the anime gives off perfectly. The opening and ending gives off the perfect feeling to start every episode and is one that I never skip. The voice actors are all really well and give the characters life to make the anime as enjoyable as possible. The voice actor for Sakura is relatively new to voice acting, but does a wonderful job portraying her character and is one of the best in the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is one of the best of Summer 2014 line up and is definitely worth watching. With it's wonderful characters and hilarious situations they get themselves into, this is one that brings out the comedy in the simplest things. You have the standard 2014 art style, yet it makes it better by adding details to make every quality shine and make it so everything stands out to the fullest. The OST is wonderful and support each scene perfectly and the opening is so catchy that you just can't help but enjoy listening to. I recommend anyone who didn't check this out yet to start watching it.",

            "content": "\"Humor has to surprise us; otherwise, it isn't funny.\"\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is about a girl named Chiyo who tries to confess to her crush. He misunderstands her confession and decides to take her as his assistant, because, as it turns out, he is a romance manga author, and he seeks inspiration from the people he knows to create his characters. Hilarity is supposedly ensues, but doesn't really.\r\nDespite premises like that having been done before, I thought that was an interesting idea. However, comedy anime is unfortunately not very good at remaining consistently funny, and often would rather remain repetitive rather than come up with somethingnew or original. This is sadly the case with this show.\\n\\n\r\nIt has the same problem as a lot of anime comedies seem to have these days, which I like to call \"punchline decay\": it gives the characters one or two personality traits and bases all of its jokes around them. I certainly don't watch comedy shows expecting deep, three-dimensional characterization, but it gets stale quick if the characters have nothing more to them.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, the show is serviceable enough at what it does, it's your average character-driven comedy. It introduces the characters and establishes their personality. It's nothing special, but it has potential. Yet, this is where it remains the whole way through. I'm not knocking this show for having one-dimensional characters (I expect it from an anime these days), but rather for not doing anything new with them.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single joke that ever gets made in this show always boils down to the exact same punchlines: Nozaki is oblivious; Chiyo thinks a moment with Nozaki is going to turn out romantic, and then it turns out the opposite; Mikoshiba is feminine and gets embarrassed; Seo is rude; Kashima is flirtatious towards other girls, which Hori beats her up for; Wakamatsu dislikes Seo but loves someone called Lorelei, whom he doesn't realize is the same person; etc.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, they're not so much characters as much as they are running gags. But running gags require variations in order to stay fresh, which doesn't happen with the characters in this show. Much like how a harem show has characters that can barely even be called that, made to fit into a specific character archetype, the only novelty in the show comes from introducing new characters that also fit into one character archetype, and after the show has ceased to introduce new characters and has already beaten all of their gimmicks into the ground, the show has nothing to offer.\\n\\n\r\nTo put the character's lack of dynamism into perspective, half of the characters don't even have any personality of their own, and instead their personality is entirely dictated by their relation to another character. Chiyo's personality is dictated by her love of Nozaki, Wakamatsu's personality is dictated by his dislike of Seo and Hori's personality is dictated by him beating up Kashima, etc.\\n\\n\r\nBut is there anything else to these characters? Doesn't seem like it. That level of shallowness in regards to personality is the sort of thing that I would expect from secondary characters, not from the (ostensibly) main ones. \\n\\n\r\nThe point of a comedy is to subvert your expectations. Does Mikoshiba saying one of his dating sim lines and getting embarrassed subvert your expectations? Sure. But does it still subvert your expectations later on, the 50th time that happens? How about the hundredth? That's the problem; it only subverts your expectations once for every one of its characters, and then never again. The only time your expectations are subverted is the first time a joke is used; but then after that, since they keep reusing the same jokes over and over again, everything gets predictable in a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIt's like the \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\" joke. When someone first came up with it, it was funny, but nowadays, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who still finds the joke funny. Guess why? Because everyone has already heard it a million times. It's the same thing here.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is supposedly a parody of shoujo romance manga, which is part of what got me interested in watching in the first place. I've read a certain amount of those out of curiosity, so I know how dumb they can be. The characters are one-dimensional, the romance is forced, they're all just variations on the same story, etc. If you've read one, you've read them all. So when I heard this was a parody of that, I was looking forward to it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as it turns out, it doesn't really parody romance manga that much. It makes a few obvious jokes about that, while the rest of it is spent parodying (I guess?) what it's like working as a mangaka. Along with that comes jokes about being a mangaka that I've already seen in plenty of other shows where characters are mangakas.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the problem comes in. Most of the parody just boils down to taking romance character stereotypes, changing the gender... and that's it. There isn't anything to the parody beyond that, especially pointless since the same character types had already been gender-reversed in quite a few romance manga to begin with. Very rarely does the show ever actually do anything of actual substance with the parody aspect, which is a shame, since the show is at its best whenever it does that.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, there were a couple of moments I thought were hilarious: the dating sim in episode 4, and the boxes in episode 8. However, in both of those cases, I thought the rest of the episode was mediocre, for reasons which I already outlined earlier. And even then, while these two scenes were funny, I didn't feel like it was worth watching the whole show just to laugh at only two scenes and be bored for the rest. I can't help but feel like even if I had dropped the show, I wouldn't have missed out on anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe show, theoretically, has a lot of good ideas, which could have ended up resulting in a genuinely clever show, but it never attempts to actually do anything with said potential nor does it take any risks, merely relying on the same 5 or 6 jokes with no thought involved, and ends up a mediocre comedy, just as forgettable as the very same romance manga that it supposedly parodies. At the very least, it's cute, but I tend to like shows when they have more substance than that.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're fine with repetitive humor, then watch this if you'd like. Otherwise, if you're looking for something original in terms of characters and humor, you're better off looking for something else instead. There's certainly worse shows out there in regards to this, but there's also far better ones as well.",

            "content": "It's a rare thing to find a romance anime that appeals to both a male and female audience. It is even rarer to find one that does so without sexualising its characters.\r\nGekkan Shoujo gives us hope for the stagnant, often juvenile climate of the romance genre. It doesn't rely on obnoxious misunderstandings to keep the two main characters from joining together (although misunderstandings do still exist with a sense of self-aware humour), nor does it need onsen scenes, pantyshots and implied homolust to keep the audience's attention towards its characters. All it's interested in doing is giving the audience a good laugh while nudging afew heartstrings along the way, and it does so with its head held high.\\n\\n\r\nA quick glance at the synopsis would be enough for some to roll their eyes and dismiss the show as 'Yet Another Shoujo Anime'. An innocent girl attempts to confess to the boy she likes in an empty classroom room dyed of scarlet (the setting of seemingly every confession scene in anime), only to find out that he is actually a famous shoujo mangaka. And one of her favourites, no less. Uh-huh. Right. \\n\\n\r\nBut Gekkan Shoujo knows better. It is aware of its absurd premise and the clich\u00e9s inherent to the genre. It embraces them, plays with them with a clever sort of irony, never taking itself too seriously nor forcing its viewers to feel a certain way. At its core it is certainly your typical shoujo anime, but the way it handles itself is quite the opposite. \\n\\n\r\nThe story primarily follows the events of Chiyo and the titled Nozaki. Chiyo, perhaps reluctantly, but nonetheless willing to follow the company of the boy she likes, assists Nozaki in his daily tasks as a mangaka, hoping one day he might realise and respond to Chiyo's feelings. Gradually she begins to understand that Nozaki doesn't quite live up to the 'cool, handsome and composed' image she had of him, and that in reality, he is so lacking in common sense that it is a mystery how he was even serialised in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nNozaki's obliviousness is undoubtedly the show's main source of laughter. In one scene, Nozaki accidentally draws one of his characters above the ground and, having the issue pointed out to him, draws a random box underneath the character, nodding his head and acting like everything is now right with the world. He then starts drawing boxes underneath the character in every scene afterwards, which understandably results in one of Nozaki's friends yelling to him how it makes no sense for the character to be carrying around and standing on random boxes all the time. Nozaki's response? \"Right. I have to add an explanation.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy works so well because Nozaki's train of thought always makes, at least in his own little world, a slight fraction of sense. He just has no idea how people actually behave and ends up misinterpreting the actions of others in a completely asinine, facepalm-inducing and yet hilarious manner. That's not to say that each joke is masterful and clever, or even that all of them work (because a few certainly do fall utterly flat), but the simple manzai format works in perfect harmony with the ridiculous premise of the story. It knows how to make fun of itself while still holding onto a semblance of sincerity. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the more respectable aspects of Gekkan Shoujo is how it also focuses on its side characters beyond the usual 'idiot friend', 'strict class president' and 'arrogant love rival' archetypes. Hori and Wakamutsu in particular are two characters who would normally be treated as nothing more than background fodder in the average anime for not having a colourful character design or 'wacky' personality. But in Gekkan Shoujo they are given important roles and treated with about as much attention and respect as Nozaki and Chiyo. They even have their own love interests who play relevant roles on their own (as opposed to simply being a plot device, as many often are in anime). There's a surprising amount of complexity to the character dynamic despite the general simplicity of the show's format. \\n\\n\r\nI suppose if there was one thing to criticise about the characterisation, it would be the inconsistency of Mikoshiba. He's handsome, eloquent-- so much so that virtually every girl in the school is head-over-heels for him-- but at the same time he is portrayed as introverted, socially awkward and obsessed with otaku hobbies, to the point where he uses eroge to study real-world interaction. The latter aspect of his personality does not feel convincing in the slightest, so his comedic scenes often fall pretty flat. To feel comedy is to empathise with the characters, and there was little to no empathy between me and Mikoshiba. \\n\\n\r\nThose watching strictly for the romance will likely find themselves disappointed, because, really, aside from a small handful of scenes, maybe three or four, it is virtually non-existent. The most heartwarming thing about the show is not the idea of the two slowly becoming a couple, but that Chiyo still loves Nozaki from the bottom of her heart despite finding out about his glaring flaws. The love here feels genuine, far more so than most 'serious' romance anime where the girl screams at the guy when he stops acting like a prince. Progression itself isn't what makes or breaks the romance in a story. \\n\\n\r\nGekkan Shoujo is visually pleasant. The characters (particularly the males) are drawn realistically, and while it does still portray them all as idealised and attractive, it never goes overboard by drawing them in lewd or excessively 'moe' scenarios. The sound on the other hand is nothing special aside from the opening track, although, to be fair, it is a pretty great OP. It captures the silly yet relaxed nature of the show exceptionally well, and by the final episodes I found myself thinking it sacrilege to skip it.\\n\\n\r\nSure, while it may not be doing anything outstanding enough to be remembered decades in the future, Gekkan Shoujo is still an excellent experience for anyone who simply wants to relax and have a few laughs. It doesn't bombard the viewer with melodrama or degrade its characters through fanservice, and what little romance there is is handled with care and sincerity. That it also happens to appeal to so many people at once without leaving anyone uncomfortable is perhaps just a bonus. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and Chiyo is possibly the cutest thing ever.",

            "content": "*WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, BUT NOT HEAVY SPOILERS*\r\nThe idea behind the story is not an entirely bad concept. Of course it has become a generic plot idea to base an anime on creating a manga. I mean c'mon, it seems like every year there is either an anime or a manga where the theme is based on creating a manga. However, the way this show presents the manga creator and the interactions between him and his assistants can be quite warm on the heart. \r\nSo, why does the story get a lower score from me? Because of HOW it tells this story and how itall goes to shit at a fast paced speed. \\n\\n\r\nThe story goes something like this....\\n\r\nThe main character is Sakura Chiyo, who happens to be in love with the most painfully aloof guy in the entire fucking world, Nozaki Umetarou. One day Sakura confesses her love to Nozaki while they're at school. Because of the fact that Nozaki is either in complete denial, or possibly stupid, he assumes she's a fan and signs an autograph for her despite her not even asking for one. So, this eventually leads to Nozaki asking Sakura to become his assistant since she's an artist herself. Obviously, like any other generic anime female character would, she doesn't try to explain to him what she really meant and she agrees to becoming his bitc...I mean assistant. \\n\\n\r\nNow the thing about this plot is that it heavily revolves around the interactions the characters have with one another. This is why I say that despite the IDEA of the story not being a bad one, it's told in one of the worst ways possible. Why is it told in one of the worst ways possible? Because majority of the characters you meet throughout the series make you cringe.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just start off by saying which character I like the most, and that would be Mikoto (Mikorin) Mikoshiba. It is surprising that with such poorly written characters that Mikorin managed to stay consistently well written and consistently entertaining. You see, Mikorin is obviously supposed to be the hot guy of the show (and the guy Sakura should have chosen, but that's for another story). Even though Mikorin is considered very good looking, he is a complete otaku dweeb who gets painfully shy around a group of people. Some have considered his character too far-fetched and that if someone was that good looking then they would not behave like such a socially scared nerd, but that is all far from the truth. We cannot simply dismiss a character because he doesn't appear realistic, or just because he doesn't fit other generic anime stereotypes everyone seems to be used to. \\n\r\nMikorin is definetly one of the better written male characters in a slice of life anime, and he was the main reason I was able to finish this series.\\n\\n\r\nNow you are probably wondering what was so wrong with the rest of the cast if Mikorin was so great. Just keep in mind that this is purely based off of what I consider to be my objective reasoning as well as subjective reasoning (because nobody in this world can be 100% objective all the time).\\n\r\nLet's start with Sakura, who was not terrible nor great...she was who she was. Her entire existance is based on the fact that she loves Nozaki. There is really nothing else about her that makes her standout as an individual character other than the fact that she's the main character (and kind of cute at times).\\n\\n\r\nNozaki is someone who is mentally unaware of almost everything around him, despite him being this so called amazing manga creator. He comes off as so bland and so unaware of social cues that it begins to infuriate you by the second episode. We all know his character isn't supposed to be this sporadic and overally emotional guy, but his drab demeanor could have benefited from some sort of development of his personality.\\n\\n\r\nSince the two main characters are obviously nothing special, and since the entire plot is based upon Sakura's love for Nozaki, the series was in dire need of some dynamic characters. Although, the series could have possibly been better without the rest of the cast altogether...\\n\\n\r\nYou have Yuzuki, who happens to be great at sports and great at singing despite being even more aloof than Nozaki. That's right boys and girls, we couldn't have just one severely obtuse character that already intensifies the frustration factor. Instead, the creators decided to give us two severely obtuse characters, hooray!\\n\\n\r\nThere is also Yuu, a girl who hits on all the other girls at the school and makes all the guys jealous of her \"swag\". I actually thought the idea of her character was quite enticing, but the writers fell flat with keeping you entertained by her. \\n\\n\r\n There is also the worst character of this entire fucking series, Masayuki...we'll get to why he's the worst a little later.\\n\\n\r\nThe last person I will name is Hirotaka, the character that nobody gives two damns about. The only reasons why I am mentioning him is because of his interaction with Nozaki and Yuzuki.\\n\\n\r\nI would name everyone else, but the rest of those characters either don't matter and should have never been in the series in the first place, or they were there because they HAD to be in the series but they didn't contribute to making the plot any better. \\n\\n\r\nFrom watching this series it appears as though the creators wanted to defy typical anime stereotypes that are shown in every other series known to man. There is only one problem, they decided to take these stereotypes and simply switch the genders...which makes them what? Still stereotypes!\\n\\n\r\nInstead of Yuu being a man who gets all the girls, her character is a woman. And despite Masayuki being the opitomy of an abusive tsundere piece of shit (which is a more common stereotype for female characters in anime) his character is a man.\\n\r\nMasayuki always seems to be annoyed with Yuu for absolutely NO reason, and if he has a reason it is never ever justified. Now, I am already uncomfortable with how physical female tsundere characters can be towards other male characters, but when it is the other way around it becomes even more uncomfortable (especially since the ONE thing that seperates men and women is physiology, and unfortunately the general amount of women are not able to physically handle a hit from a man). Masayuki is constantly punching and kicking Yuu around, despite Yuu never really doing anything for it to be deserved. However, the creators are trying to convince that since Yuu seems to be into other women and because she comes off as a male character that we should all be okay with this already fucked up stereotype of beating up people you call your friends (or those they have a crush on). Normally you see in other anime that when a female character hits a male character it is okay because of the fact that it is a woman hitting a man, which is already not okay. However, the stereotype is switched here and we should all simply except it because a female character is considered \"barely female\" so long as she behaves like a man *rolls eyes*. \\n\r\nYou can claim that I may be reading into it, but even if their interactions don't require anyone to read into that deeply it doesn't stop it from being exaspirating to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nYou also have the interactions between Yuzuki and Hirotaka, whom depending upon who you are, had probably contributed to some of the more pointless scenes of this series. Yuzuki could have been entertaining by herself, but the fact that she was dragged down by Hirotaka's obsession for why he thought Yuzuki would pick on him added to the amount of frustration I already had for this show. More often you see in other anime series that cliche of the male character coming across as if he didn't like another cliche female character, even though he did actually liked her (which I guess we are to assume was the case here). However, I could have excused this cliche so long as there was some sort of development between the two...but there was none.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of character development, did I mention there is none?...abso...lutely...none. \\n\r\nNow, I was willing to look past that flaw, but the problem is that these characters are so poorly written and their interactions are so cringe worthy that if each one had developed in a fervent way then it could have saved the plot.\\n\r\nThe only character that was a well written cliche and wasn't in dreadful need of development was Mikorin and his \"otakuness\". \\n\\n\r\nThis series had the opportunity to defy cliche stereotypes and create a great and unique slice of life anime. Instead the writers not only contributed to these cliche stereotypes, but they made them more profound.\\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind, this is a more popular aime series and is well loved by many fans. So my reasons for not liking it does not reflect the way you as an individual has to feel about this series. \\n\r\nI say give this a shot regardless of how I feel, but no amount of convincing will change my opinion on why I gave this show the rating that I did.\\n\\n\r\nSIDE NOTE: I heard from a friend that they happened to enjoy the manga more than they did the anime. So I suppose that is always worth looking into. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is about a high school girl, Sakura Chiyo, who has a crush on her schoolmate, Nozaki Umetarou, a shoujo manga artist. She tried to confess to him but was mistaken as a fan of his manga and ended up as one of his assistants. Then, revolving around these two, the story goes on.\r\nSounds a lot like a typical shoujo romance, right? Let me correct that, GSNK is all about comedy. Bits of cute moments here and there but mainly comedy and it's done right.\r\nWhile the plot is simple enough to be summed up in mere sentences, character is definitely the strongest pointof this anime. The main cast consist of seven. There are four guys \u2014 the mangaka, the self-proclaimed playboy, the drama club senpai plus the basketball kouhai. And three girls \u2014 the heroine, the oblivious Lorelei and the prince of the school. Yes, prince. You read it right. Individually, they have their quirks and are so likable you'll have a hard time picking a favorite. (In case you happen to hate all of them, fear not, there are also lots of tanukis)\\n\\n\r\nThe best parts, however, are their relationships and their interactions. Thanks to the creativeness of the author, this group of characters plays off of each other so well you can randomly throw any two or more of them in a normal high school life situation, add some shoujo manga related topic, think from their perspectives, let them converse for a while and get a laugh or two out of it.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, that's what GSNK is all about.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is what you would expect from a 2014 anime and the art style is faithful to the original manga. OP and ED songs are very catchy and fit for the light-hearted atmosphere of the anime. I actually like the opening song a lot. As for other OSTs, I honestly couldn't catch it because I was busy laughing. The VAs are great. There're many famous names in the cast (Miyano Mamoru is the protagonist of Nozaki's manga, mind you) but my favorite is Ozawa Ari. She portrayed Sakura perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nFor enjoyment, I didn't read the manga before and I enjoyed it very much. I also prefer the anime version even after reading.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is fun, refreshing and very easy to get into. Personally, I love it so if you're looking for something different, if you like comedy or if you want a shoujo version of Gintama, I highly recommend this anime.",

            "content": "Before writing the actual review, I'd just like to throw something out there. I am  a HUGE fan of romance. About 90% of the entries in my anime & manga list have some form of romance. I'm the kind of guy who'd drop a point or two if there isn't a conclusive ending. However, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is an exception. In fact, after some time, I really didn't care if the show was going to be conclusive or not. This should show you just how great of a show it is for me to toss aside my ideals. If you're looking for a romance,turn back now because for the most part, the romance aspect is only implemented for comedic and adorable situations, not actual romance.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of plot, I'd say it doesn't really have one. Yea, in the first episode, Chiyo Sakura tries to confess to Nozaki and accidentally becomes his assistant, but this was just to get things started. If anything Gekkan (How I'll refer to the show whenever I bring it up) is like The Daily Lives of High Schools Boys and Nichijou, in that the show mostly focuses on the characters, mostly the main group of friends, and their interactions with one another plus their antics on a day to day basis, so basically an episodic anime. Episodic anime can be a hit or miss depending on what you're looking for, but if it's comedy, it's usually a hit and Gekkan is definitely a hit.\\n\\n\r\nQuite frankly, the interactions in Gekkan are absolutely heart-warming. Unlike most romance anime, Gekkan doesn't give you false hope. In romance anime, some interactions may piss you off because you don't want anyone intervening between two certain characters or you know its going to lead to some face-palm inducing misunderstanding. On the other hand, Gekkan gives you moments that you just want more and more of. Being they're adorable and they don't throw in characters for the sake of wavering feelings. Not to mention, a majority of the moments are extremely hilarious. Most, if not all them, got laughing me for at least a good minute. Gekkan is just that good at portraying certain scenarios. In other shows, these scenarios just wouldn't be as funny, they might even make you shake your head or cringe in embarrassment. In the end, Gekkan's \"plot\" gives a wide array of heart-warming, adorable, and amusing moments.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing as how the show revolves around the lives of people who do some form of art work, it'd be really sad, if the art turned out to be lackluster. Thankfully, it isn't. The characters are drawn very well and their reactions never fail to amuse me. The scenery isn't bad itself.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the OP is one of the catchiest openings, I've ever heard. I always find myself humming or singing parts of the song from time to time. The ending as well is pretty good. I don't know really know if this makes sense, but the ending just gives off a vibe that's the ending. It just actually sounds like the end of something. Lastly, the voice actors are amazing too, their voices perfectly align with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what I find to be the strongest part of the show. Without their quirks, the show just wouldn't be the same. Never have I seen an anime that has such a likable cast. \\n\\n\r\nThe first character of this wonderful cast is Chiyo Sakura. A petite and extremely adorable girl who tries to win over Nozaki, but unfortunately fails, due to Nozaki's unusual density. She is also quite optimistic believing certain situations will finally bring her and Nozaki together, but it's never the case, with it being either a misunderstanding or insensitive actions on Nozaki's side. \\n\\n\r\nThe second character is Umetarou Nozaki. A tall man who is completely oblivious to real life scenarios despite being an author of romantic manga. A good portion of the comedy comes from this guy. He works on a logical level rather than an emotional one thus he doesn't hesitate to do things, others would see as rude or inconsiderate. With these actions, comes misunderstandings or thoughts of how indirectly cruel Nozaki is. It may sound bad at first, but these scenes are always hilarious. You may feel bad for Chiyo, but it will still leaving you laughing. \\n\\n\r\nThe third major character were introduced to is Mikoto Mikoshiba, a gorgeous and smooth-talking man. Guys like these tend to come off as annoying in Shoujos, but Mikoto isn't exactly as I described him to be. In reality, he blushes every time he tries to smooth talk a girl and even though he can get any girl he wants, he's an avid player of dating sims and collector of female figurines. \\n\\n\r\nNext, we have Masayuki Hori, the president of the Drama Club. He's an astounding actor who punishes Yuu Kashima almost every episode for either laziness, flirting, or just idiotic antics. \\n\\n\r\nYuu Kashima is the arch-rival of Mikoto as well as the Prince of the School, but she's also a girl. Essentially, she's a reverse trap. Kashima frequently tries to impress Hori, but he just finds it annoying. Many would say he's just a tsundere though. \\n\\n\r\nNext, we have Yuzuki Seo, a cruel cruel mistress. She's quite socially inept as she can never sense the atmosphere and she finds great pleasure in using pain to get what she wants. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have Hirotaka Wakamatsu, an innocent and naive basketball player, who is always on the receiving end of Seo's painful actions. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also supporting characters such as Mitsuya Maeno, Nozaki's former editor, a guy you should hate but just can't. In short, the cast of Gekkan is extremely likable to the point, where  they can turn annoying tropes into wonderful and fabulous characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gekkan is a great show that knows how to play its cards right when it comes to using romance for comedy. They know their boundaries by not taking a complete 180 and start becoming serious. It truly is a wonderful show because they never cross the line between romance for comedy and romance so you don't have to experience getting your hopes up. You just continue enjoying the cute moments between the characters without expecting. I highly recommend you watch it because it is a comedic masterpiece that knows when to tone things down and how to utilize a colorful cast for the most gloriously hilarious moments.",

            "content": "NOTICE ME SENPAI.\r\nThis show is probably the epitome that defines the meme. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun) is about this cute girl named Chiyo Sakura who tries to get the attention of the manly Umetaro Nozaki. You might probably guess it but she has a crush on the guy. From her initial introduction, it\u2019s clear that she wants his attention. But in a show like this, one should also acknowledge the denseness of Nozaki. In fact, his misunderstanding of Sakura as a \u2018hardcore fan\u2019 only begins the first steps of this hilarious gag anime.\r\nDirected by Mitsue Yamazaki, it\u2019s refreshing to see this piece ofwork based off the manga being animated. The adaptation is actually based on a comedy gag 4-koma with each chapter telling stories about the characters. In the anime, they are interconnected each episode in a way that tells a story. That story is about Nozaki and Sakura with their little adventures. I should probably reword that and say that their adventure is recognized as more of an experimental journey. Their goal? To create a shoujo manga of the coming ages.\\n\\n\r\nA success to the show combines the formula of romance and comedy. The romance part is the weaker of the half as Nozaki is dense as a rock. But taken the comedy part for granted, the show succeeds with its delivery. Most of it comes from the characters but also the clever timing. It is the precision that plays a key role as comedy scenes are usually created by character expressions and dialogues. In particular, Sakura\u2019s over analysis of certain situations and her delusion from reality makes for some great laughs. Furthermore, there\u2019s Nozaki that often sticks with too much common sense and misinterprets certain situations. If you\u2019re looking for one of those anime where a cute girl tries to the attention of her senpai, this is it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story on most parts is constructed by the context of character relationships. In fact, most of the characters (besides Nozaki and Sakura) gets a good amount of screen time. The show emphasizes their relationship in a more comedic way with gags rather than any serious development like you would see though. Yet, it creates that atmosphere of fun. In essence, this series puts fun first and almost everything else second. This also includes the series\u2019 premise to create shoujo manga. Throughout the series, we do see progress on the manga our main characters tries to create. However, it\u2019s also easy to notice that he gets a lot of his ideas from character relationships. It\u2019s like an experimental way of crafting his work with the characters as framework. This also extends further with Nozaki\u2019s ambition to get himself involved in events as long as his work entails its ideas. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, the show depicts them comically by each of their presence. Characters such as Yuzuki Seo and Yu Kashima attracts more attention than others; although very differently. In fact, the show commits to the characters and bring out their best. Seo\u2019s tomboyish personality combined with her opera-like voice is a prominent example of this. On the contrary, the show also likes to make fun of its characters by creating anti-thesis of their outer shells. Mikoto Mikoshiba is a good example of this as his princely outlooks are used to hide his feminine personality. This is taken further with Kashima, a female character who shows almost 90% of her personality as a male. In retrospect, the show maintains its position as a rom-com shoujo with humor coming to blight first. The romance is hardly noticeable but rather played out as a spoof. Character relationships are beta level at best so don\u2019t expect any sort of strong commitment. There\u2019s no emphasis on powerful characterization through flashbacks. Rather, it\u2019s a journey of fun with our characters as they spend their daily lives.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being lean on romance, there\u2019s a lot of feminine dynamics focused on the show. One noticeable aspect involves the shoujo manga Nozaki tries to create. His work \u201cLet\u2019s Fall in Love\u201d is saturated with so much clich\u00e9s that it outshines Nozaki and Sakura\u2019s relationship in terms of their romance development. This is because his manga is developed throughout the show with ideas from the show\u2019s events itself. Nozaki takes experiences and perfects them into his manga. In essence, he plays the role of a professor to learn about the manga world, in particular shoujo. In fact, there\u2019s a wide spectrum of ideas including delinquents, tomboys, and school girls all packaged into his work. All of them are inspired directly or indirectly from other characters. There\u2019s some ways fans could see this as a parody of the show itself. Either way, it can be hard to take it seriously as the show doesn\u2019t focus the idea with coming-age development. This and the romance ships will play you like a fool if you expect any endgame.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is defined by mostly with its trademark expressions. Characters portrays a wide variety of expressions but the most easily recognized is Sakura and her moments. This is especially true when she over-thinks a situation and deconstructs its reality. It sharply contrasts with Nozaki who is designed like a manly guy and with a dull expression. Otherwise, the other main characters are designed with bishounen-esque framework such as Kashima and Mikoshiba (minus that skirt of course). Animation studio Dogakobo (Love Lab, GJ-Bu, Mikakunin de Shink\u014dkei) animates most of the characters to life similar to their other works. It\u2019s noticeable how they are able to focus each character individually and collectively as ensemble. In this show, they achieve their purpose again and even conveys its message that it\u2019s based off of a manga with the polka dots and generic backgrounds. Oh and don\u2019t expect much fan service, at least for the guys anyways. This show\u2019s artwork offers much more service for the ladies.\\n\\n\r\nAs for soundtrack, the show isn\u2019t very noticeable. Most of the soundtrack is pretty standard and unremarkable. Because comedy makes up the major toppings of the show, the soundtrack too plays with itself in repetitive cycles. It almost feels as if the soundtrack feels exactly the same with little mood change throughout the series. Only during a few moments when situations gets a bit tense does the soundtrack offer a degree of highlight. Luckily, the character voice mannerisms make up for this. Every main character has a flair to define their personalities when it comes to their voices. The only problem I have is with Chiyo\u2019s voice as she sounds too much like a child. The endless dense moments from Nozaki puts her efforts to shame as she blames herself from not coming out of her shell. Luckily, this isn\u2019t much of a distraction as some of the other characters. The OP and ED songs are brutally cute with the lyrics that will knock you into this world.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is great of a laugh. I don\u2019t mean it just laughing at the characters or what the show it\u2019s trying to do. Rather, it\u2019s about the way characters play their roles and how it connects each episode. The chemistry mostly comes with character relationships. And despite not to be taken seriously for development, it\u2019s humorous with their behavior. It\u2019s like taking a group of characters and put them into a fantasy world where they use their experiences to tell a story. That\u2019s exactly what Nozaki has been doing with his shoujo work. In the end though, you\u2019ll be getting a whole load of laughs so lock your windows before the neighbors tells you to shut up. \\n",

            "content": "What? Another show where they write manga? And it\u2019s romance, too? Haven\u2019t we seen these tropes already?\r\nI warn thee, do not be so dismissive of Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun just from reading its summary. This show may surprise you. And to anyone who says these words with excitement rather than skepticism, sit back and grab your computer, because you will definitely enjoy this.\r\nOkay, here we go.\r\nPlot\r\nUmetarou Nozaki is a high school student highlighting as a popular shoujo manga artist, recruiting his friends to help him. This show doesn\u2019t have too much of a basic plot. Instead it relies on the interactions between its characters to providehumor in small scenarios. Most revolve around the characters planning or \u201cresearching\u201d the most common shoujo tropes despite their relative inexperience with romance. This show highlights the ridiculousness of romance stories in general by . Although he second main character, Sakura Chiyo, has a terrible crush on Nozaki, nothing is ever played as over angsty. All the characters interactions were refreshingly pure. The show lets us into the fact that romance and friendships in high school don\u2019t have to be dramatic, but can and probably should be fun and silly.\\n\r\nConsidering this anime was adapted from a 4koma I think this show does a marvelous job of translating gag strips into coherent, albeit shortened plotlines. Most episodes have two back-to-back episodic mini-plots that make this show very good for casual or repeated viewing.\\n\r\nHowever, I would say that the show doesn\u2019t really come into its full stride until perhaps the third episode when enough dynamic characters have been introduced that the humor in-group interplay can be fully milked.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe real standouts in this show are really its characters. For starters we have a pretty even split of male and female, who also each get equal amounts of screen time. Their designs are a bit too similar, but this is lamp shaded within the material and they each have such distinct personalities (not to mention colour schemes), that the same face is never an issue.\\n\r\nThe titular character (who looks more like a 20 something salary man than a high school student, but I digress) appears to be our basic stoic type, but taken to a humorous extreme. This keeps his character from falling into the dangers common around this archetype, either ending up being just boring and needlessly callous. We are also given moments of ranging emotion from tenderness, to embarrassment, to excited passion that lend him needed humanity. So I can say, I know boys like this. \\n\r\nNext is our pigtailed heroine. Do not let the first five minutes let you mistake her for an eternally blushing doormat of a high school girl with a crush. Sakura Chiyo is a developed character that is not defined by her relationship, but defined by her pre-meditated actions towards furthering her relationships to others (whether her plans are successful or not is another matter). I found her very relatable from my high school years. Her obsession with Nozaki is comedic, but never pitied or mocked by the narrative, as is so common in teenage girl crush plotlines. And the last episode gave her (to keep spoiler free) a level of maturity that I did not expect from her type of character. Also, did I mention she\u2019s ADORABLE?\\n\r\nThe rest of the ensemble is composed of quirky misfits who are celebrated for their oddness, each of them brining something extra to the table that truly makes this anime fun. While I could go into detail on why I love the personality design of each, in order to save space I will not. (Go watch it and find out.)\\n\r\nThe characters don\u2019t really go through too much development over the course of the twelve episodes, but we get so little screen time that I didn\u2019t really expect it and it would be jarring if there were huge changes.  However, Nozaki and Sakura each get subtle developments; mostly in their attitudes are relationship towards each other that gives the series enough momentum to feel like it naturally progresses towards a finale, despite its episodic nature.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetic\\n\r\nI adore the look of this show. The palettes are bright, but not blinding and the backgrounds wonderfully detailed. The characters seem to fit within their environments rather than placed on top of them.  The animation is good, taking advantage of the form. Much situational humour is dependent upon sight gags through off model or caricatured facial expressions, this variety adds to the charm and visual interest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nThe incidental music is pretty standard and not anything to write home about (except the intro which is wonderfully upbeat and sets the tone perfectly), but the score does its job in enhancing the comedic effect of the series. Examples being, exaggerated scores during purposefully overdramatic scenes of trivial events, or played straight tender music during romantic scenes only to be dashed through the sharp stop of a punchline. Otherwise, it does its job providing a cheerful background to the series.\\n\\n\r\nSub/Dub\\n\r\nAll the voice actors did great jobs on this show and it seems obvious it was fun for them to work on. All are good at swinging between the different emotions in the script. Special mention to Nakamura Yuichi (Nozaki) for going monotone for three eps and then breaking out with an impassioned speech and hilariously embarrassed groans and shocked exclamations while all still feeling in character.\\n\\n\r\nCurrently, there is no dub version of Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\r\nMonthly Girls Nozaki Kun is honestly one of my new favourite animes and definitely my must watch pick of this last season (yes, I thought it was better than Free!). It\u2019s colourful and earnest, funny without deprecating a single gender, engaging and entertaining, everything I want from a comedy. \\n\r\nScore: 9/10\\n\r\nHIGHLY RECCOMENDED\\n\\n\r\nYou can watch this show for free on CrunchyRoll\\n",

            "content": "Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is an anime that I believe anyone will enjoy, but I would recommend it especially to viewers who are looking for a romance anime without necessarily wanting to go on a powerful emotional rollercoaster; in fact, in many ways this show is a parody of your typical sh\u014djo romance anime, and it's handled wonderfully. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is high school comedy done right.\r\nThe anime follows Sakura and her endless struggle with confessing her feelings to her schoolmate Nozaki, who also happens to be a sh\u014djo manga artist who goes under the pseudonym Sakiko Yumeno. Nozaki mistakes her for a fan, but invitesSakura home and eventually she becomes his assistant. This is where the anime really begins. What this show does so well is how fluidly it introduces its character cast and their lives as high school students. The anime is filled with running gags, clich\u00e9 sh\u014djo elements turned upside down, witty jokes and scenarios, and the great characters really make it all come to life. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely the highlight of the anime. The show introduces a quirky and colourful cast of unique characters that compliment each other nicely. They create great dynamics throughout the anime and it's nothing but a joy to watch them interact with each other. I'm not going to spend time describing what each character is like, because I want you to find out on your own, but I'm sure that you'll love them just as much as I did, especially if you are into slice of life or high school comedies. What Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun does is that it takes time to develop the side characters as well, instead of just treating them as one-dimensional sidekicks that don't serve much purpose except for just being there. I feel that many shows walk into this trap, but this anime isn't just about Sakura and Nozaki, but about all the characters in the cast, and the show isn't afraid of focusing its attention away from our lovestruck heroine and towards the other characters and their lives as well. This is key to developing compelling characters, and while this is not always a must as far as comedies are concerned, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun really succeeds in this regard, and you will want to follow each one of them.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to art and sound the show also delivers. The artstyle is colourful and pleasing to the eye; the characters are distinct and neatly designed, and the music compliments the setting and atmosphere nicely. In fact, the music can be so good and evocative at times that I managed to have emotional responses to scenes that were meant as jokes. The seiyuu do a wonderful job at portraying each character, and the opening is one of the catchiest I've heard in recent anime, and the ending radiates a very nice and appropriate feeling. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, you've got a hilarious parody of the sh\u014djo romance genre in a typical high school comedy setting, and it's beautifully executed. It has wonderful characters that are a joy to follow, and countless situations that will have you laughing. I definitely recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys slice of life comedies. It doesn't redefine the genre in any way and it won't blow you away, but it doesn't have to. If there is a 2014 anime that is worth checking out, it's Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. \\n\\n\r\nA solid 7/10",

            "content": "Story: (9/10)\r\nNozaki-kun doesn't really have a story, unlike One Piece where it has a goal of becoming the Pirate King and obtaining One Piece. What it has is what I would call an outline.\r\nNozaki, our male hero, misunderstood our heroine, Sakura, feelings and what happens next is what makes this anime golden! The interactions between the characters are what makes this anime alive and using the traditional Japanese comedy style, the manzai. It involves two people, one the straight man and the other being the funny man and it involves mutual misunderstandings, double-talk, puns and other verbal gags. So if you were thinking this isa romance story then stop right there because the misunderstood confession between our main characters are only the foundation of this anime and once again the interaction between the characters are what makes this anime what it is. Even so, if this anime knows what they are doing, then they will know that even though the comedy is what makes their audience comes, it is the blossoming love between our main characters that makes us stay! So if they do know what they are doing, this anime might contain some very cute romance moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, the interactions between the characters are what makes this anime comes alive, but this won't work without interesting characters now won't it?\\n\\n\r\nEvery characters are beautifully written and you cannot hate any of them. Well... maybe there is one... just watch episode 5 okay...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway! Every comedy out there includes the so normal characters (the straight man) and the weird characters (the funny man) and when they meet, ta-dah! comedy happen!\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Nozaki-kun so good are probably because you don't know who's going to be the normal one and who's gong to be the weird one. \\n\\n\r\nEach character are very much normal, that's why they could live in school so peacefully but they are added a little bit of a hidden personality that only comes out when the characters we are given talk to each other. If it's anyone else, they will be most likely conceive as normal.\\n\\n\r\nWe have our main heroine, Sakura Chiyo! Who confesses to our other main character, Nozaki, but uses the wrong phrase and founds out her crush secret. That is, him being a shoujo mangaka! That itself is a gag, a big burly man writing a girly love story when he, himself, has yet know love. Sakura is most of the time the normal one, the straight man, the one that calls out on the weirdness that the other characters are doing. But she too can be the funny man, for her crush on Nozaki can't really be called a crush but an obsession.\\n\\n\r\nOur other main character, Nozaki Umetarou, a shoujo mangaka, who misunderstood Sakura's confession and somehow got her to be his assistant. Oblivious to Sakura's feeling, he lives his days trying to make his manga better and trying to get more materials for it. \\n\\n\r\nOur other recurring characters too are what you can call reverses. Think of many tropes that our manga/anime are using right now and I can assure you that our recurring characters are the opposite of it. I don't want to give any spoilers so go watch it right now!\\n\\n\r\nArt: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nAnimes this year do not disappoint! And that includes Nozaki-kun! True to its title, the art are very shoujo like with huge eyes that takes half of the face without really seeing the nose and small mouth. But the animation is steady and does not disappoint. The faces and reaction are a huge plus too!\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhy does all of the animes this year have such good openings?! Nozaki-kun start with a happy and upbeat opening that makes you hum along. The ending is nothing special but it totally sounds nice. \\n\\n\r\nThe background music makes the interaction between the characters comes more alive and they are used very well. While they do not make your eyes wander from the show because how awesome it is but you will at least once notice them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nSome of the jokes are unfortunately are not done right for me, for someone who already read the manga, so some of them seems like it wasn't transitioned right. But for the people who don't know anything about this anime or manga then it will be totally okay. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime includes some of the animes traditional tropes, comedy, and puns so for someone who has yet watch many anime it might be difficult to understand why its funny so be careful!\\n\\n\r\nBut should you watch this anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer is YES!\\n",

            "content": "There's always two kinds of anime that are really hard to find whenever you look for them: a) a consistent one, and b) a comedy that caters to everyone's taste. Taking the huge amount of series that come out every year, one might find oneself baffled to know that there's just so many of them that actually manage to have some sort of balance. It makes you wonder whether there's no point in expecting something good to come out at all, but, just like everything, there's always an exception. And this season, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is the one that took the anime world by itsfeet.\\n\\n\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is the ultimate shoujo parody. Taking the premise of a teenage shoujo mangaka, the show uses any mean to mock most of the common clich\u00e9s and tropes of the genre, taking them to the ridiculous extent or showing the inherent flaws of their existence. With Nozaki as the central character and Chiyo as the female lead and romantic interest, what one might find at first to be a lighthearted romcom turns out be one of the funniest anime in existence.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is far from special. Is pretty much as the synopsis says, with little to no romantic progress to all of the \"pairings\". However it is hard to complain about this, given that the ingenious quality of the gags and sketches is what makes this show unique and worthwhile. It manages to stay consistently funny through all of its season, provoking from chuckles to histerical laughter in every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, it is probably the best part of the show. From the dense Nozaki, to the tender yet down-to-earth Chiyo, to a certain male heroin, and the rest of the cast, they all have a special charisma to them, making them all likeable and funny. Their interactions are gold (especially when it comes to the pairings), and one might find oneself rolling on the floor of laughter by the brilliance of their antics coming in opposition to each other. It's also worth mention that some of their personalities come from subversions of shoujo archetypes, which only adds to their uniqueness.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is done by Dokagobo, and I must say, it's great. It's devoid of all the big shonen fights or the rather extravagant imagery one would find in animes of Shaft, but it's still better than most. It's fluid, consistant, and no matter the angle, the characters are always well drawn. The colors are vivid and wonderful, adding to the light atmosphere of the show. The backgrounds are all well and everything is in its place. If we talk about character desing, then it's kind of generic, but good enough for a series like this.\\n\\n\r\nThe music isn't epic or amazing, but fits every scene. Every sound is ritghtly timed for comedic effect, and the bgm does its work well. The seiyuu, for their part, have all a good understanding of their character, and fit them perfectly. This is especially true in the case of Ari Ozawa (Chiyo), something laudable given that's her first leading role in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in terms of enjoyment, where does this show stand? Pretty high, I must say. I laughed every single episode, and loved all of the characters. There was nothing I could really complain too much about, so, if you ask me, I would say you'd be wasting a great treat if you don't watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nLet me repeat it: Watch this. You won't regret becoming a Nozaki's character.",

            "content": "After watching all 12 episodes, I would have to say that Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is by far one of the best romantic comedies I have watched, and probably the best anime of the summer 2014 season. Here's why.\r\nStory- The story was great, and I found it very enjoyable to watch. The plot follows a girl named Chiyo Sakura, who confesses to her crush, Nozaki, but gets misunderstood which leads to her becoming his assistant. Despite her attempts to get closer to him this way, she ends up getting misunderstood each time which makes for great comedic, hilarious moments. Eventually, she meets the rest of Nozaki'sassistance and things just get even crazier. No matter where they are at, or what they're doing, there are always a bunch of crazy, stupid moments that will make you laugh in every episode. There are times where the story seems to get little serious, but the complete opposite ends up happening, and it's so stupid, that I couldn't help but laugh and feel amused. The show is a romantic comedy, but I found that there was a lot more comedy than romance, but you see elements of both into play which keeps the show interesting. Between all the comedy and misunderstandings, you can't help but wonder if the romance will go anywhere or what the characters will do next. The comedy is a bit predictable at times, but it didn't really take away the enjoyment of the show and most of the times, it still funny. It stays original for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The animation was great. The colors and backgrounds popped out, and it flowed smoothly throughout the show. The character details, wonderful scenery, it was all executed well. It's what you would expect from a 2014 anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The OP and ED were't the best, but I thought it fit the show really well and it was kinda catchy too. As far as the BGM's go, they were placed in the correct scenes and fit the mood. I didn't find anything wrong with the voice acting, it was solid and I thought each character was conveyed well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The characters are probably the best part of this show. The comedic moments, and what they do in their daily lives make them hard to forget. They are all unique, with various different personalities, and all the characters combined together make the show more enjoyable to watch as a whole. Their interactions with each other create funny, random moments. There are also times where you find yourself rooting for one specific character mainly because of how hilarious or unique they are. I even found that some of the side, supporting characters stood out despite not being a main. Whether it's Nozaki for his dedication, Chiyo for her cuteness, Seo for her craziness, You'll find a character you adore and love.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Overall, I loved this show and couldn't stop watching it from episode one. The characters are so memorable, and story is just great. If you're looking for a light-hearted, funny anime to watch, this is for you. \\n\r\n-RayRay-Kun",

Hearing this,Nozaki gets her to assist him in his manga,as he turns out to be a mangaka who goes by the name Yumeno.so Chiyo decides to be his assistant in hopes of Nozaki returning her feelings.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nThe art is appealing and the characters are drawn very well,the backgrounds are okay and coloring of the characters are nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound(8/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack  is okay,and I really like opening theme\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(9/10)\\n\r\nFor me,the most interesting part of Gekkan are the characters,they never fail to make you laugh,and each of them are characterised very well.the supporting characters though in my opinion don't really develop much. But,nevertheless I still enjoyed how all of them are conveyed.the main 2 leads are okay and I like their personalities.I like how Chiyo is mature compared to the rest of the cast but can be just as wacky if Nozaki is involved. I like how eccentric Nozaki is especially when he is trying to find inspiration for his manga and he uses his friends as bases for his characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10)\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime a lot and I was sad to see it end.if it will ever be a season two, I would definitely watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(10/10)\\n\r\nGekka Shoujo Nozaki-kun is not a typical romantic comedy ,but it is still an anime worth watching,I recommend this anime for people like romantic comedy but with only a little romance.",

And excuse me for my poor English in case I make mistakes! Hope it doesn't disturb you too much.\r\nAt first sight Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun might look like one of those typical Shoujo anime which follows a typical storyline, but hey guess what? This is actually an incredibly hilarious anime that will blow your mind with all these unexpected scenes. I kindly recommend you to step back if you're expecting a Shoujo anime andI give you a warm welcome if you're into a comedic show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in a high school with a female student as our main protagonist, Chiyo Sakura, who has a crush on a fellow student, Nozaki Umetarou, who is in the same grade. With Chiyo's misunderstood confession to Nozaki she gains the knowledge that he is actually a Mangaka whose Shoujo manga is published monthly in a magazine and somehow ends up as an assistant of his and thus we begin our daily life featuring Chiyo and Nozaki and their fellow companions.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, there isn't much to say since it doesn't follow a solid main story line of any sort except for the daily lives of Nozaki as a mangaka and how he sees the world differently from every other \"normal\" person would do.\\n\r\nI can't give a professional answer for the art & sound field since I don't usually pay much attention to it, but the art was definitely well-done. I wouldn't call it particularly great, but it was on an acceptable level to enjoy the show. For the sound, I found the opening song outstanding and very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nComing to characters this is probably one of the shows that has the most diverse characters that are typically to be seen in a manga or an anime. I believe this is what makes the show really enjoyable for they lead the show to multiple unexpected outcomes of events which turns out absolutely hilarious. The humor is very different from any other I have seen so far as well.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe this is a show that can be enjoyed by anyone and I recommend this to anyone who are into comedic shows and don't mind having it a solid plot line. If you decide to give it a go I hope that you will find your enjoyable moments as I did. \\n\\n\r\nI give this a show a 9/10.",

            "content": "Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun (Monthly Girls' Nozaki-Kun) is a fantastic comedy anime. Throughout all twelve episodes the show was great fun to watch and was in general, one of the most fun anime's of the 2014 summer season.\r\nStory and Characters \r\nThe story for the show is quite simple but is really fun. With the exeption of Bakuman I have never really been fond of the other animes out there that follows characters making manga,but this is one of the few ones out there I believe to be done well. Which to me is suprising considering that the original magaka's other works have not very well recievedas far as I know.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very likeable and fun to watch and I believe are what makes the show so great. Starting with Nozaki, the writer and artist of the manga, \"Let's fall in Love\". Who despite writing shoujo manga, has no personal experience in love whatsoever. So he is completley oblivious to Sakura's feelings towards him. And in general is quite weird. Then there's Sakura, a member of the school art club and a girl who admires Nozaki, and is the character who's point of view we see througout. Then there's the rest of Nozaki's assistants, starting with Mikoshiba, who is quite popular and flirtatious with girls. Though on the inside he's really shy otaku and often hides in embarassment after saying bold statements. There's also Hori, president of the school drama club and is very self consious about his short height. Then there's Wakamatsu, who joins Nozaki later to apply screentones to panels. He is part of the basketball team. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the art and animation this show is not a technical marvel by any strech of the imagination, but what's here is very well done and does what it's supposed to do. The expresions on the characters faces are varied, and there is no point in the series where the animation is noticabley off-model. Overall Dogakobo did a good job on the animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the series fits the situations the characters are in well, but are not really anything that I would listen to on it's own, with the exeption of the track that plays during the credits of the final episode, as it is really catchy. The OP is also great, and the ED is okay but nothing spectacular. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nThis show is just a blast to watch. The jokes thrown at the screen are almost always hilarious, the characters are lovable and are great fun to watch, and while the story is simple, it is much better executed that most animes about people making manga (with the exeption of Bakuman. That shall never be topped.). This series is definetly worth watching, and since it's free on Crunchyroll you really have no excuse not to watch it, unless you are not into comedies. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nOverall - 9 \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun does a great job adapting its manga counterpart to the small screen. The manga is written in 4-koma style, which can cause the storyline to become choppy and confusing at times. The anime really brings all of the smaller scenarios together to create one fluid story.\r\n[ Nozaki-kun adapts content from chapter 1 to chapter 31 of the manga; the two stories are identical up to chapter 13 (where you will find small tidbits and/or explanations not present in the anime). From this point forward, you will find new stories (e.g. chapter 21 featuring Ken-san's background) as well as content seen in theanime, but in a different order. These differences are negligible and do not detract from the overall story. ]\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\r\nThe art and sound are great and stay consistent throughout the series. The opening intro is upbeat, catchy, and full of color. (Definitely a favorite of mine!) The closing credits were lackluster in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nAlthough the characters could be described by many tropes prevalent in anime, each and every one one was extremely like-able. You can almost see the punchlines coming, but the execution is so well done, you'll still be left in laughter.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series so much, I ended up watching it twice: once alone and twice when I had company over. After previewing the first two episodes, each one of my friends continued watching until the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun was definitely a hit for the summer 2014 season. I watched it on a whim thinking I was getting myself into another typical shoujo romance (and boy was I wrong). It started as something to pass time, but shortly became one of the series I had to watch as soon as the simulcast became available. If there's any series you should watch when you've got nothing in your queue, pick Nozaki-kun and you won't regret it.",

            "content": "I guess this beats Isshuukan Friends in terms of friend-zoning? heh...\r\nThe 'manga' theme stays alive in anime after 'Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to' with this interesting anime. I knew I would be expecting something grander like this. The first time I looked upon this before it aired, I wonder if it would be the same as the anime I mentioned earlier, but it happens not to be.\r\nThis season has quite a number of anime that varies in a lot of genres. While there's the dramatic Aldnoah.Zero, and the intense romantic-driven Ao Haru ride, we have the comedic heart-warming Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. Produced by Dogakobo, who madecute fascinating slice of life comedies, this anime never fails to make people enjoy. While we weep at those sad moments from other anime, we also smile at the wonders and joys in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOne fateful day, Chiyo confesses her love to Nozaki in a classroom. Mistaking her as a fan, he signs an autograph to her before inviting her to his house, where she finds out he is a manga artist. From there, she learns more about him and meet more characters Nozaki has worked alongside with his manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has a lot of hilarious comedy in it, from Nozaki's misunderstanding to the characters' personalities. I like how it uses a lot of shoujo manga tropes, as Nozaki draws shoujo manga, to make it funny as he often finds ways to make them appear in his manga. He has no experiences in love, hence his love manga may be a bit awkward, even his editor gets upset. It also portrays a typical high school crush, or one way love, as Chiyo tries to have Nozaki fall in love with her. Despite trying so, she always doesn't work out well, but in the end, she still feels a bit satisfied the way she is with him.\\n\\n\r\nMany times, this anime is very cute, not only because of Chiyo but also some of the characters as well. The story isn't very serious in terms of romance and I liked it. Sometimes, there are anime where they took romance too seriously that it went off-track with the main story.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion leaves a sweet feeling, yet a bit unexpected, for me at least. But it does close a good story well, although there is a continuation after the anime ending in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I would think that the characters are just another boring bunch of typical characters you see in slice of life anime. But I was surprised by the personalities of these characters which are quite unexpected. Of course, I love how these personalities portray the comedy the anime offers.\\n\\n\r\nNozaki seems to be feel neutral throughout the story, with the way he speaks, and the way he expresses his emotions. There isn't nothing negative about this. But sometimes he does smile or act happily with his friends or his thoughts. Meanwhile, Chiyo is the character which I find very pleasant about. She's very cute and I quite like her thoughts and decisions, which turned out to be the opposite effect sometimes. She hangs out with her friends well and definitely is rounded with her emotions. She is a character that doesn't seem to fit in a romantic-drama story, because she's unique in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters, naming some of them, Mikoto, Seo, Kashima, Hori, and Wakamatsu, whom are quite surprising with their personalities. Obviously, I would thought that they are just static characters that acts what they act as always. But I was happy to find out that they are also rounded characters because of their personalities and feelings towards one another.\\n\\n\r\nDespite not having a serious romance story, there are actually a number of ships in the story. While Chiyo goes for Nozaki, Kashima goes for Hori while Seo goes for Wakamatsu. Whatever the reasons shall be, I find that the story has some emphasis in these shippings as well and I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nThere is character development in some characters, mostly because they bonded together one another. Chiyo and Nozaki still has that 'friend-zoning' relationship which is still funny, while the rest still chases for their counterpart.\\n\\n\r\nI'm impressed with the art style that shows vibrant colours and nice tones. The scenery is spectacular and sometimes, the atmosphere is lively with idling animations from minor characters. The character designs are nice with a touch of matching personality with each character. Facial expressions are exaggerated to put up the comic relief, and most of them are very cute, especially from Chiyo. There is never any fan-service, which I find it satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nManga takes a role in this anime and Nozaki's drawings, with the help of others with their roles, make his manga looks cool. The opening visuals are awesome that feels like characters coming out from a manga book. The ending visuals, however, is a bit plain, but is still cute with Chiyo minding her own business.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song has to be the best opening of this season, due to its catchy beats and astounding vocals from Masayoshi Ooishi. I got to love how he sings and it makes me grove into the tunes. The ending is quite different, and it is such a heart-warming song. Sung by Chiyo's VA, Ari, it feels like I'm drowning in tears of joy and the rhythm just plays in galore. Both songs have some relation into the anime and I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the time, the background music is quite relaxed and it matches the mood of the scenes, along with the sound effects. The voice acting is perfect, with a lot of voice actors putting a lot of effort into voicing their respective characters. There are a number of recognisable voice actors such as Yuuichi (voicing Nozaki) and Miyuki (voicing Seo). Ari is relatively new into voice acting, and I think she did an awesome job voicing her first main character.\\n\\n\r\nI have absolutely enjoyed this anime from the start and I really hoped to see more of this in the future. I am glad this anime takes a huge following from the viewers and it is quite shocking because I thought it wouldn't be that famous. It has certainly became one of the best anime I have watched this season and I'm proud to feel that way.\\n\\n\r\nWell... I guess I must say goodbye to this wonderful cheery anime for now. I want my second season please!",

            "content": "Let me start by saying that I really, really enjoyed Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. When I first heard of this anime, my reaction was 'What the heck kind of name is that?!' In case you're wondering, the name comes from Nozaki-kun, one of the main characters who is a manga artist in a monthly girl's manga magazine.\r\nThe main strength of GSNK is in its ensemble cast. Apart from the main character (Sakura), the rest of the supporting cast are VERY unique and interesting individuals that make you want to know more about them. The characters play off one another in somewhat predictable ways once you knowthem, but the execution is flawless and had me laughing out loud many times. As a series about a guy writing girls' manga, it is very good at subverting gender roles for comedic effect in a way which won't make you feel uncomfortable, while also making fun of shoujo manga tropes.\\n\\n\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (GSNK) is adapted from an ongoing series of 4-panel comics and this is obvious if you know what to watch for. If you try hard, you can kind of see where the 'skits' start and end in each episode, though they are almost seamlessly stitched together in a coherent fashion. Because of this, there is not much character progression from the start to the end of the anime, though this may also be because it is only a 12 episode series which features a strong ensemble cast. By the time all the characters had been introduced and I felt comfortable with them, it was already episode 7 or 8, which only left a few episodes till the wrap up. The ending was extremely unsatisfying for me as there were just so many open threads which were left open. It almost feels like they were expecting more seasons, but unfortunately no news has been heard on that front to date :( (as of April 2015)\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I would like say that in order to fully enjoy this anime, you should have at least a passing familiarity with shoujo manga, or at least non-shounen battle-type manga (I read Ouran Highschool Host Club before watching this, and I believe this helped me appreciate the themes and subject matter a lot more).",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nShoujo manga, stories about love and relationships aimed mostly at girls. But is that all that makes up shoujo manga? What goes on behind the scenes that lets it come to fruition? In Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, its take on the subject, combined with great humor and unique characters, sets it apart from other romantic-comedies in the field.\r\nSTORY\r\nGSN starts with our main protagonist Chiyo having the courage to confess to the boy she loves. However, after certain events, she finds herself as part of his team in the creation of his own line of shoujo manga.\r\nWhile Gekkan Shoujo's mainshtick and source of comedy comes from the genre, the show itself is actually not shoujo. It is entirely a comedy, and a good one at that. Much of what GSN does is play on the tropes and stereotypes of shoujo to create the numerous situations that the characters are put through. The show takes place in high school, and therefore uses strange relationship combinations to poke fun at shoujo and get its points across.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of relationships, this is also what the show does so expertly. The character interactions are solid, and are another main source of the comedy. The cast works extremely well together because of disparity that is apparent between them. For example, Kashima and Hori represent the love-hate relationship but with roles reversed. This provides many interesting gags that the show executes very well. And this is true for each relationship within the show.\\n\\n\r\nI never felt the comedy to grow weak. Its quality stayed consistent throughout the entirety of the season. Certain episodes are stronger than others but each episode easily had you laughing with a big grin on your face.\\n\\n\r\nMy only gripe with the story is the lack of romance. Romance itself is always hinted at, joked about, and alluded too throughout the show. Those times are as every bit as funny as the rest of it. However, being a romance buff myself, I would have liked to have seen at least a bit more in this department. The show is probably nine-tenths comedy and one-tenth romance; I would have liked it to have been three-quarters comedy and one-quarter romance.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nGSN's art style is somewhat generic. The environments generally take place within the same few areas (Nozaki's apartment, the school, etc.) but everything was still adequate in detail.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the art style is lacking, the character designs and animation quality is not. Starting with the designs, I loved them all. Again, going against shoujo stereotypes, the characters are designed in such a way so as to make them realistic but also comedic. Chiyo especially gets mentioned. I loved the way she was depicted in the show, and was always happy to see her on screen.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, the character's show nice movement. But above all, their reactions are priceless. I enjoy good \"reaction faces\" in anime, and this was another staple of the show that allowed for great hilarity. Once again, Chiyo takes the spotlight: her differing faces of confusion, happiness, and \"What the hell?\" always made me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nArguably the strongest part of the show, GSN's characters are vibrant, funny, and above all, unique.\\n\\n\r\nKashima represents an \"anti-trap\". She is a girl, who dresses in girl's clothing but is often mistaken for a guy. Hori is a guy who acts somewhat like a tsundere. Mikoto is a very handsome guy with feminine appeal. Seo is a girl who is very direct and honest about what she wants whereas Wakamatsu always has a wild imagination about the outcomes of events. These characters are the opposite of the tropes that are normally prevalent in the genres that they are found. And much of the comedy comes from this. The characters work wonderfully in harmony, and are always utilized to their fullest in their respective scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest leads, Chiyo and Nozaki, are also of note because their roles are reversed, too. In shoujo fashion, Chiyo is the girl looking to get Nozaki the guy, but instead of them gradually coming together, their relationship is rife with missed signals and pretty much zero progress. Again, while this may seem tedious or boring, it's not; because the whole point is in the way everything is delivered. It is always funny to see Chiyo try to advance her relationship towards Nozaki only to have him worried about boxes instead.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is true for all of the pairings in the show. Kashima x Hori and Seo x Wakamatsu are role-reversed, and because of this, the comedy speaks volumes. At the same time, they are some of the most and least trope-y characters I have seen but it is for this reason that the characters work so well.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note here, special shout out to Chiyo. I adore her character, not only for being cute but for being extremely likable and cheerful. She has been one of the better lead female comedy characters in a while, and give her big props for what she brought to the show.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP for GSN is quite catchy. The guitar slapping and general smoothness of the beat makes it easy to listen to and gets you in the mood for the show. The ED is all about Chiyo and is very \"hip-hop\"-esque in its repeated lines that make it easy to remember and nice to hear.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the rest of the soundtrack doesn't necessarily have anything too outstanding, it is still nicely composed and used appropriately throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, Ari Ozawa's performance of Chiyo was exceptionally done and deserves high praise. She captured her voice beautifully and did a stand-out job. I hope to hear more of her work in the future!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is a fantastic comedy. It's hilarious the whole way through, and coupled with its cute and endearing moments, there is nothing really to complain about. Again, much of the show's appeal comes not from the actual art style or story, but from the unique characters and the way they interact between each other during their situations.\\n\\n\r\nWhile wanting more romance is more of a personal feeling, the comedy is top-notch. None of the jokes felt stale or overused and the scenarios that develop are varied enough to make you wanting more and more. On top of that, the reactions from the cast will always bring a smile to your face, whether this be when Chiyo grins enthusiastically because Nozaki walked her home or because Seo maniacally laughs during a movie with Wakamatsu. The characters are all lovable for what they do and say, and I loved seeing them every week.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, solid romantic-comedy with just not enough romance\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, animation and designs are high but art style is low\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, unique and funny is a profitable combination\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, OP, ED, and Chiyo's VA are a pleasure to hear\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, too many laughs to count\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "If you get reeled in by seeing the word \u2018romance\u2019, then you probably would be the first person to drop this anime as the romance aspect of this anime is pretty much scanty and one-sided in all possible ways. Fret not, as this anime still provides one of the best comedies that will entertain you to the very last episode. When I saw the anime\u2019s name, the very worldly presence of the word \u2018Shoujo\u2019 didn\u2019t fit well with me and hence didn\u2019t bother to watch the first episode. Then, as usual, I was proven wrong once the news floated around in the internet that thefirst episode was promising and hence with no real expectations, saw the pilot episode and the interest levels were growing at an alarming rate. Note that this anime progresses in an episodic manner except when the all important \u2018new character\u2019 introduction takes place. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire plot is filled with alarming but comical misunderstandings and the way the characters jump to conclusions by playing it in their mind were hilarity personified. Although the presence of romance is very less, there are still some romantic scenes that take place only to be followed methodically by obliviousness and screw-ups. This show also depicts how a shoujo manga can possibly become either a hit or a dud. A worthy thing to consider is the interactions between the editor-in-chief and the authors. The main character Nozaki Umetaro researches quite a bit for his manga and his research; which consists of the interactions between the 7 characters that helm this show, makes up the 12 good episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art and the animation had the usage of vibrant colors and vivid backgrounds. One nice point to be taken note of is that, the manga which Nozaki draws. The 2 main characters of the manga, Mamiko and Suzuki-kun have their own voices and it was a different experience. The artwork of the manga was of a typical shoujo manga and the details regarding shoujo manga were neatly analyzed even though they did not delve deeper into the topics related. The OST was good and the timing of the music was good with the music accentuating the situation persisting over in the anime. One piano sonata caught my attention and the OP and ED are normal but catchy, especially the ending. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: This is where the entire anime excels the most and where this anime became a runaway hit among the audiences. Each and every character portrayed in this anime is unique and have its own quirks that are very much necessary for the progression of each episode. \\n\r\nNozaki is the protagonist. He is diligent, intelligent but highly oblivious. He is unable to detect the easiest of advances by the only normal and level-headed character, the female protagonist, Sakura Chiyo. Sometimes, it might seems hilarious but at other times the \u2018I\u2019mma gonna fucking punch the screen\u2019 feeling arises. Next, Mikoshiba (Mikorin) who thinks he is a playboy (actually, he is, in a way). Wakamatsu, a first year, he is like Kise Ryouta without basketball and handsomeness. They both have the same voice-actors too. Hori is a third year student who is bullied by his underclassman prince(ss) Kashima without her knowledge that she is bullying him. One of the wonderful traps provided to us in recent times is Kashima. Then, finally another oblivious freak who speaks her mind without knowing that she lacks the utmost delicacy, Yuzuki Seo. \\n\r\nAll these whacky characters come together in various episodes and the unbelievable incidents that these characters get entangled into duly forms the entire body of the anime. When any one of these characters is missing, this anime would not have thrived like it did. Unlike many anime where the focal point is either the extravagant plotline, animation or the music composition, Nozaki-kun\u2019s engine is the characters. Without the characters\u2019 interaction, this anime would not have become what it is now. The comebacks (tsukkomis) and retorts provided by the characters are magical and seem to be realistic but at the same time it felt as if with each passing episode, the retorts became somewhat predictable, at the least to me. Maybe they should or should not have toned down on the retorts. Note that, the extravagance of the voice-crew for this anime is unmatched by any other Summer \u201914 anime excluding Nobunaga Concerto; another vital reason why the characters\u2019 speeches and interactions looked lively. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, a hilarious anime that employs misunderstandings to narrate a great story regarding on how to and not to craft a shoujo manga is the gist of this show. Animation, music and plot all seemed normal and maybe this is where the anime comes good owing to its normality although there were some instances (only scanty) that seemed not believable. Animation could have been improved, so could have been the music but even still, it was good. DAT ending to the final episode might not have been the perfect one, but the aptness of it was impressive.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: 8/10\\n",

            "content": "[intro with compelling quote here that somehow relates to what I want to say next]\r\n[write-up of the show in pseudo-intellectual text that relates to the compelling quote]\r\n[reasons why you should watch this show]\r\n[paragraph that wraps up everything I said up there because let's face it, you probably forgot]\r\nThat's my review, folks! [that stupid part where I ask for you to rate the review as helpful]\r\nActually, I do get tired of reading reviews here because they follow this format. I do understand the informative part, but to be honest, I feel like there's a template when it comes to writing reviews, one that people blindly followin the same way writers decide there must be a template to making a good anime show (or manga, for that matter). What was that?! Did you just say we can all become critically-acclaimed in a liberal art career field?! HAHAHAHAHAHA no. It's not like following the template all the time will win you a fanbase (unless most of your viewers watch TMZ, or some shit. Seriously, fuck TMZ), but every time I turn my back and decide to score something, given enough thought, there MUST be a template to all this that they ALL follow. It gets incredibly boring.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, something I found impressive about GSN was the way it gave me an expectation, then delivered it. No, it did not say \"this is what to expect, here you go, DEAL WITH IT.\" If that was the case then I would have simply asked you all to read the first few lines of my review which deals with writing a review. It's like a genie granting a wish. When you ask for something, the genie gives you what you ask for, but in a way you don't expect. The thing is, you still got what you asked for, but the expectation versus the reality leaves you with some kind of shock. Or trauma. Or pleasure. It really depends on whether you're the S or the M in \"S&M.\"\\n\\n\r\nLet's just say this: after watching GSN, there's no doubt in the back of my mind that it compares to Neon Genesis or Madoka Magica. If there was an anime genre that focused solely on shattering expectations, you just found your comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOn second thought, I'll take credit for introducing it to you. You're welcome.\\n\\n\r\nOh, also, [insert section where I explain I have no spoilers here, when in reality I probably have a spoiler or two so you've been warned, joke's on you].\\n\\n\r\nStory: Yes, I'll tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was nothing. And it stayed that way. The end.\\n\\n\r\nJust kidding.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, as far as adaptations of 4-panel komas go, the story is flimsy. Every half-episode focuses on a different problem and the last episode feels heavily accelerated when they rushed into the \"overview\" of everything and \"all that time we spent together\" and \"cherry blossoms and butterflies\" and all that (I don't know if that last part actually happened. I started drinking at the last episode for no reason at all).\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the plot ran into a tree and it was hilarious. Take one for expectations.\\n\\n\r\nPossibly the only real progression of a story comes from Sakura Chiyo, the focus of the entire show, and her feelings towards Umetarou Nozaki (oh, by the way, SPOILER. Unless of course you read the show's synopsis so shut the hell up about it). As the show progresses, we see her feelings grow, we see some more development, but otherwise, that's about it. Beyond that, there's nothing to look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nArt: As expected of a 2014 anime, the art is noticeably modern. I only bring that up because I saw Ao Haru Ride and I thought we were taking a trip back to the '90s. I'm fine with that, but then all that bullshit '90s kid hype will come back so I decided to get over it.\\n\\n\r\nI did watch GSN, though, because of the art. It was reminiscent of the show Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou, and to be honest, that's the only reason I wanted to watch it. What I do like about this show is the use of manga drawings to explain some situations or give a sense of what the characters were seeing, especially given the fact that the show revolves around Sakura who has a crush on Nozaki the manga artist.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation depending on the character portrays a distinctive style as well. Seo Yuzuki, the oblivious tomboy, for example, has a pretty radical, spontaneous style surrounding her character. Mikorin is depicted with the pretty boy style, while the frustrations of each character in troubling situations  is exaggerated, most likely to stop us from feeling sorry for them.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I'm not an art major so if anything I said makes no sense, SUCK IT.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Yes. There is sound. Yes. There are voices. There is also background music and special effects.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Remember that whole intro about expectations? This is that section about expectations. How we prejudice comes down to this, and quite frankly, because of the characters in this show, you could simply call GSN a Public Service Announcement against discrimination. \\n\\n\r\nHere's what I'm talking about: if someone introduces a sensitive person with a cutesy nickname, we expect a shy girl. If someone introduces a womanizer, we expect a tall, handsome man. If someone introduces a person who's always being chased by guys, we expect a popular girl.\\n\\n\r\nUmm....yeah. About that.\\n\\n\r\nThink about it this way with the characters: GSN was casting. They then decided to seek out the actors and were given a production deadline. The talent scouts went out to find their actors, but with a minor problem: they can't find anybody. The position for a shy, petite shoujo character was given to a somewhat two-faced child actor. The position for the incredibly-sensitive character was given to a male, teenage pop idol with a nasty attitude. The role of the \"womanizer\" was shortened..... to \"woman.\" But did the producers care that the characters were completely mismatched? Absolutely not! They have a production deadline to meet!\\n\\n\r\n\"Aaaaaaaaaand that's your line-up! Ready? ACTION!\"\\n\\n\r\n*two minutes later*\\n\\n\r\n\"THAT'S A WRAP! I know you all fucked up somewhere down the line but it's okay, the footage is still watchable every Monday night 8/7 central!\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Looking back on it, Character and Enjoyment go hand-in-hand. Without the characters' obscure logic, there wouldn't be any \"good\" moments, especially regarding Nozaki, the male lead. Want to walk home with him? Nozaki will do that. Want to stay the night? Sure, why not? Want to eat his cooking? Absolutely, Nozaki will arrange that. Of course, remember what I kept saying about expectations. Be careful what you wish for.\\n\\n\r\nBut something that really gave GSN its humor was the fact that it went over-the-top without going completely \"over-the-top.\" Some shows take pleasure in exaggerating moments or portraying crude, perverted humor to generate big laughs, but I suspect they only do that because it's easy to gain a couple brain-dead perverts by doing it. GSN seems to have taken a different approach, using events or common cliches that most would find mundane and finding a \"loophole\" that makes them enjoyable. I'm not talking about amplifying a funny moment to make it funnier, but finding an event so mundane and so boring that we generally overlook it, then turning THAT into the punchline. Example? Like the time Nozaki and Mikorin-- never mind, I'll spoil that. Or that time Nozaki and Sakura were-- I'll spoil that too.\\n\\n\r\nI think probably the only dull moment in this show was the density of Nozaki, but that's because I've already gotten over the whole \"dense character\" bit with Infinite Stratos (take a hint, dumbass!). Otherwise, there is so much to describe about the show, yet I do not want to talk about because these events are really the first time I've seen them ever happen in an anime show. This really requires the salesman's pitch to describe: \"see it to believe it!\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A solid 8. While GSN is not your typical comedy show, disregarding all those other morons who say \"not your typical anime show\" for something with more cliches than a B-list children's movie, I have no doubt in my mind that if it wasn't for my low expectation for this show, given the fact that I only wanted to see this because of the art style, I would have rated it higher.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I have nothing else to say, other than if you're looking for a shining example of how good the quality of comedic content can really get, then search for GSN Episode 1 and start watching, otherwise [insert some kind of conclusion that conveniently wraps up this review and ties back to the intro. Some shit like that, I don't really care.]\\n\\n\r\n.......\\n\\n\r\nYeah, fuck this. I'm over the inserts.",

            "content": "This is my first review, excuse me if it is not that great.\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun (Girls Monthly Nozaki-kun) was a rare and amazing anime for me to find. I tend to not go anywhere near romance in anime, probably because I find the female characters clingy and annoying. But after the first episode of this anime, I was in love. Many of the items that I would find not that great in other romance anime, or sometimes other anime in general, will make up for it here.\r\nStory: The story and plot is similar to most romance anime. A girl falls for a guy, not havingenough courage to say, goes through many problems and good times with him and friends. You would think it would be an average romance/school anime, but it exceeds that. Sakura, a regular high school student, ends up falling in love with a tall, regular looking guy. Only to find out he's a famous mangaka. They become good friends, meeting new people who all together with Sakura, help out Nozaki on his books.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was very bright and beautiful, I never got tired of it. I don't usually dislike the art of an anime, so I would find it nice. But this anime's art and faces the characters make are beautiful and priceless. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I don't particularly like the sound/music of anime. I tend to skip the opening and ending songs, but I could listen to the opening a ending songs over and over if I wanted. They were light and very nice sounding. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: All the characters have their own style. A girl who acts like a prince. A guy who charms girls, only to be completely embarrassed about it and shy around any new people. Nozaki, who is not afraid to try on a sailor costume at a store, only to be sad he is not a slender \"bishounen\" and is completely oblivious to everything. They are all unique in their own ways, and they all make the show more amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this anime much more than I thought. When I started it, it only had 2 or 3 episodes out, so when I got caught up, I was wanting to see much more of the show and the characters. The humor is great. You will laugh probably every minute. Once you think the moment will be cute and light, Nozaki brings something weird in. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10. This was an outstanding series I did not think I would ever enjoy as much as this. I highly recommend this, for romance, as you can ship and there is romance with about everyone in here, but also just for the comedy and moments.",

Strange characters of all types are brought together because of Nozaki, and they work well off of each other because of their strange attitudes. It shows how people are not 2D, and that characters are not defined by their genre. It bridges slapstick with Japanese humor, and makes for a great watch. Whether you know shoujo cliches well or not, this series can be appreciated for its endearing wackiness. You grow to love each of the different characters for their absurdities, and realize that you actually kind of know people like them.I found this show more real than any shoujo series simply because the characters were unique and contradictory. For one there\u2019s Nozaki, a big masculine guy who draws shoujo manga. Then there\u2019s Mikoshiba, a popular attractive guy who\u2019s very insecure. The list goes on and on, and rather than spoil it I encourage you to explore it for yourselves. This series has easily one of the best list of characters I\u2019ve seen in a long time. And the humor is just totally spot on.\\n\\n\r\nMore at modernjosei.tumblr.com",

(moments: the ink, the curry, etc) \r\n-not too serious (compared to sth like Ao Haru Ride) which I appreciate and which I think it works--it leaves a positive atmosphere and amood boost.\\n\\n\r\nCONS\\n\r\n-the anime's gimmick is to take a meta/parody approach to shoujo manga/anime. However, cliches like the Japanese festival or the completely romance-clueless male protagonists were never addressed nor did they try to at least take a new approach. Of course, sticking to a tradition itself is nothing to criticize, but as a viewer, I've always found their complete unawareness to romance to be so unrealistic for high school people that it takes me out of the experience quite often.  \\n\r\n-some of the meta-jokes and dialogues missed--when you know just about any cliche is going to be turned around itself, that itself becomes the cliche.\\n\r\n-didn't feel like they pushed the 2 main characters and the plot enough.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this is a bubble gum anime, but I did find myself re-watching it. Personally, I'd prefer to view this as a manga than anime for its strength is the dialogue and the animated scenes can get repetitive and unnecessary. I do praise this anime for being able to garner such popularity despite not resorting to harem-esque scenes and other cheap humor. The best thing about it imo is its light-hearted approach so it's a good anime to watch weekly for a mood boost.",

            "content": "A show about a guy writing a shojo manga who somehow forces a girl that likes him to help in writing/drawing this manga (along with a couple of other guys who are pretty embarrassed about it).\r\nSo, I\u2019ll start off by saying the art in this, I thought, was really appealing. Nothing was hard to look at, there were no times I kinda had to casually just look up to avoid embarrassment at seeing some ecchi sort of shot and everything was just nice to look at. The character designs were really good (it made me want to style my hair like Sakura\u2019s haha) and pretty.I\u2019d give it about 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the characters. I generally just enjoyed them. I typically don\u2019t watch a lot of anime in this kind of genre, so they might be typical characters of shows like these, but I wouldn\u2019t know and, frankly, I wouldn\u2019t care. There were an array of characters that ranged from the overly confident \u2018playboy\u2019 who had major self-confidence issues when he wasn\u2019t trying to show off (God, Mikoshiba was adorable) to the practically psychotic girl who laughed as others died in a movie, was way too blunt and had a secret talent that wasn\u2019t a secret to everyone but the boy she liked. I personally thought they were funny, and interesting, and I found I could relate in some way to most of them. Even if they are your kind of \u2018oh, we always get these kind of characters\u2019 characters, well, I don\u2019t mind because they\u2019re entertaining as hell, or, at least they are for me when I need a good, solid stress reliever. So, another 8/10, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot isn\u2019t much to go by. It\u2019s literally explained in the first sentence of this review and it doesn\u2019t go off much from that. A few \u201cOh, did that really just happen?\u201d moments here, a few, \u201cWhy am I even watching this?\u201d moments there. All in all, it\u2019s pretty much more centered around the relationship between Sakura and Nozaki, as well as what\u2019s going on with the other more minor characters (Nozaki\u2019s characters in his manga included). I liked the progress of the relationships going on. I thought they were well-paced, nothing happened too fast, there was just the right amount of teasing for me to swear at the ending, but also feel really happy about how it ended. I wasn't quite expecting that, but I'm glad that was how it was. I think it fitted well with how their relationship had built up so far after I thought about it and I'm glad they didn't push that last scene. It just made it all the more satisfactory for me. So for pure plot, I'd give it like a 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, however, I must say that, damn, did I enjoy this. The amount of times this show had me cracking a goofy grin, trying to stifle a giggle and shaking my head were crazy. I probably questioned why the hell I was watching this more than five times, but that's when I know I've enjoyed it. It's been great for me personally because I enjoy silliness and lame moments and awkwardness in a show. If you perhaps can't stand that, then maybe it's not for you. But, hey, it doesn't hurt to try, right? I know people say this all the time, but you don't know you won't like it unless you try it. I think a lot of people can enjoy this. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I'd give it an 8/10 based purely on how much entertainment I got from it since that is what anime essentially aims to do. \\n",

            "content": "Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, although not perfect, is probably the funniest and happiest anime I've seen in a while. The art sets the tone for the show, as it's not too showy nor is it too plain. The show's OP takes the cake for being my jam for this summer season, since whenever it comes on all I do is dance even though I can't dance and lip-sync even though I don't know Japanese. All the characters are lovable/likable (Seo's character being more likable than lovable) and there's a type for everyone. I personally loved Mikorin, since he was so dangadorable and stupid. As for the story, it's not really a story, more of a documentation of the little things in the character's life. There's no one goal, but that's cool with me, as long as it's enjoyable in all of it's nonsense. Overall, I really liked this series, and I'll be sure to read the manga just cuz i want more. I really recommend this to anyone who's looking for a good time.\\n\\n\r\nBut I have to say, at the last episode, I became so frustrated that I threw my phone and screamed \"NOOOOZAAAAAKKIIIIII\" because I am so fed up with his shit obliviousness like no. I don't give a shit bout your love for fireworks. Fall in love with Chiyo already! GOD! AKJGDYIHBJKHDIAHDU! \\n\\n\r\n:P",

            "content": "Another mangaka themed anime has ended and frankly, I was taken as to how a reverse romance between mangaka X assistant has taken place, where it's a girl that's going after a guy, oh and the guy, however was still the usual oblivious about the girl's feelings for him, however the story part of this anime, in my opinion deserves a fair 6, since it was more like a almost there kind of thing where in the end gets spoiled up, ok so it was a bit of turn off, but then again the romance genre of this anime did played up well, but stillin my opinion it wasn't enough for me to give it a high score than 6. Art was good, but the turn off was how Kirishima Yu was illustrated in which the way she was drawn isn't consistent, at one point she wore a maxi skirt and on the next she would be seen wearing a mini skirt, also, I hate the way that she looks more of a bishoene than a bishojo, however I gave it a 6, since Seo and Chiyo's design were good, but still the way they're designed wasn't consistent in some episodes, the sound part of this anime, well.......I just have nothing to say about it (so mods, don't give anymore fuss about it, if you guys please). Ok, the characters, the characters, the characters , the characters, so what we have was a multiple romance arc that not only involves not only Nozaki X Chiyo, but also Seo X  Wakamatsu,  Kashima X Hori and  Mikoshiba X Mikoshiba ( and yeah, he is his own romance arc) well it was pretty obvious that the characters themselves where divided into a couple of romance arc and this part deserve a 7, and that's where the enjoyment part is, but in a overall sense where I'm pertaining to the last episode, where I won't say co'z there is this mod on my back stalking me on my reviews and recommendations, all I can say is that I can never understand why the Nozaki X Chiyo moment where it would have been great was suddenly given an almost there ending. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo here are my ratings:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nSince the plot was just too simple and yet a bit unique.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nDespite of the inconsistencies as to how the character's were designed when it come to one of them and I'm referring to Kashima, it was still ok, but I still give it a 6.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nNo comment here, so mods back off, pls.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nSince they way that it was divided into 3 romance arcs was unique.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good 7.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for this anime really was depended on the said 3 romance arc. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I could explain about the last episode of the anime, however there is this _ghost_  who is been stalking my reviews and recommendations lately. Well, it was good but the last episode was a let down but not enough for me to give it a low score. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Adapted from manga with same title, I have heard many good reviews for this. A refreshing romcom with manga at its base, I must say it exceeds my expectation. Not only the characters are unique and hilarious, it also has great quality of art and sound. Well, I just can\u2019t stand series with bad quality of art after all. xD\r\nOkay, let\u2019s begin my review!\r\nMusic - 10/10\r\nFrankly say, i love both the opening and ending song. For the opening song, dunno why, but I get the comedy-secret-agent-club feeling at first hear it. The melody just brought me to this kind of atmosphere. Then, I fall inlove in the chorus. What a nice harmony between the melody and visual. And for the ending, i like how they repeat \u201chantai no\u201d many times. It gives me that cute feelings. And, Sakura Chiyo as the background picture just make it better!\\n\\n\r\nFor the background music, I amazed at how it blend with the situation. Mostly when, the comedy yet serious scene. How this series using serious music in comedy scene just hilarious. And not just that, there\u2019s one more thing which is more hilarious. That is\u2026 when someone give idiotic advice, yet the music play a mellow piano as the background. HAHAHA. This show always make my day.\\n\\n\r\nVisual - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEffect-wise. That\u2019s a perfect word for this series. They know well when to use effect and do not overused it. From the first episode, I have known it has a great quality of art. Colorful environment which adapt every situation. When romantic scene, it becomes warm and comfortable (well, it is afternoon and they succesfully build the environment romantic). And when the comedy comes up, it adapts to shoujo situation which is hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing, I loved it when the \u201cmanga\u201d scene takes part. How it moves between pages is beautiful. And, how the background music and voice actor blend with this situation just makes it better. I don\u2019t really know why this scene leave good impressions in my heart, but I just can\u2019t forget how I enjoy this series in my looong holiday.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one thing I truly like from this series. Why? Because, there are so many unique personalities here. Let\u2019s say Mikoshiba, a narcissist but shy. Saying really cool things but can\u2019t act after it. Or Kawashima, a prince (or princess?) but\u2026 a true fool. Oh wait, all of them are fools anyway. But, i just can\u2019t hate them, they are lovable in their unique ways. Gekkan shoujo is charming because of its foolishness, and it\u2019s a perfect way to produce comedy.\\n\\n\r\nWay better, all the characters have the room to develop properly. This is why the environment seems lively and not rigid. All of their fool actions connect each other. Well, they are a \u201cgroup\u201d with every single person have unique characters. And, when a unique person meet others, the comedy starts. In my opinion, this is the hardest part to built romcom story, when we need to connect all the characters but still at its track. But, this show done it beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, it\u2019s common knowledge that comedy film doesn\u2019t need a decent plot. If we can enjoy how the story flow, then it succeed. This series\u2019 plot is quite simple, just revolve around how mangaka (in this case, Nozaki) live his lives. But, the spices make this series enjoyable. A fall-in-love assistant, a true fools friends as model characters, and an idiot editor. Feels like a simple white rice, but with nice choice of ingredients. With it, they changed the \u201csimple one\u201d to \u201camazing one\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nAh but, I can\u2019t give it  full points because the originality of this series. There a lot of anime with this kind of thing out there. Manga, highschool romance, unique person. The difference lies in how it develop. Personally, I don\u2019t think how  the story starts is the most important thing. How the story flow is key to make one show interesting. That\u2019s why I still love this series although its originality.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s all from me, thanks for reading! c:",

            "content": "Gekkan Shoujo Nosaki-Kun is most definitely one of the stars of the romantic comedy world, and will be held on a pedestal for me for quite a long ways into the future. The jokes, situations and personalities are on point, making it one of the best animes I have followed during the summer season.\r\nAs far as the story goes, Gekkan is adapted from 4-Koma comics, meaning there is not a mysterious over branching plot, and the series relies on its bountiful humor, but this does not disappoint. The story begins with young Sakura Chiyo confessing to her crush, Nozaki. Sakura, being terrible with words, decidesto confess in such a way that Nozaki mistakes her for a fan of his manga. A love story between the tall, monotone mangaka and his twin-bowed companion ensues, rife with incredibly amusing situations around every corner. \\n\r\nThis is of course a slice of life anime, but it is among the best. The day by day account of the students working in the manga world is a colorful one, and it makes for an onslaught of great punchlines.\\n\r\nMy one blip is viewers may find a touch of unsatifaction regarding the love story itself, but other than that each episode is something to look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing too out of the ordinary, but each character is color and wonderfully expressive. It is not hard to lose track of who's who, and the bright colors bring on a great enthusiasm, fitting the tone of the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, the OP, in my opinion, is very catchy, and a nice change from the usual j-pop associated with most rom-coms. Instead, viewers are created with an interesting beat layered over a colorful, fun atmosphere. The ED is rather irritating, and everything in between suites and assists Gekkan's portfolio of humor.\\n\\n\r\nEach character within the series is well crafted and fun to watch; everyone has a specific relationship with each other, and each relationship is unique and almost always humorous. The pairings having a new flair to them, dragging them out of the typical tropes of 'the tsundere' and 'the prince'. Your prince is a clueless female who gets more girls than the men of the series, your best friend is an unapologetic delinquent, your usual pervy guy is adorably embarrassed by whatever junk spills out of his mouth. All in all, I believe the freshness of each individual is what makes Gekkan so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEvery joke and situation in Gekkan is played out on point, leaving your appetite for enjoyment well fed. It will be difficult to reach the twelfth episode without a favorite character, and without a good laugh. I encourage and implore all of you to jump right into Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun to raise your stand for comedy anime, because this is one of the funniest I've seen. Well done.",

Its an anime that doesn't really stand out at all but excels with its well written story, witty puns, and very well developed characters, never leaving anyone out or making them feel like a side character. The anime also has great art, with vibrant colours that are pleasant to the eye, but doesn't make it feel like you are looking at the end of a unicorns butt. It has great use of music that is correct with the setting andbackground. The characters have properly matched voice acting, sometimes making you forgot you are watching an anime. Once again, it is like a ramen you ordered but got something else by mistake, but you finish it with enjoyment, drink the soup until there is no more... until another bowl comes.",

            "content": "Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is truly an example of comedy and moderation done right. While some may be unable to appreciate exactly how the show chooses to manifest itself, the audience nonetheless realize that the unique humor implemented within creates harmony amongst characters, story, and the overall progression. Therefore, nothing is essentially \"shoved\" down people's throats and nothing is forced, making the ride smooth from start to finish. \r\nI particularly enjoyed Gekkan Shoujo because of the refreshingly strange cast of characters. Every single one of them are so very loveable in one way or another, as they all possess their own individual charm. All of themare \"main characters\" in their own sense, not depending on any other character in order to create situational atmosphere, conflict, and resolution. They simply stand out that much. Sakura was and still is one of my favorite girl characters in any anime. And as much as I tried, I simply could not fit any of them into a \"stock character\" trope, a formula for which many anime shows re-use, over and over again. GS breaks through the clich\u00e9 saying, \"If it isn't broken, don't fix it.\" It proves that there is ALWAYS room to improve, and even more potential to be tapped into, so long as the creators are in the right mindset and remain objectively calm in their work. The voice acting is spot-on. The punch-lines are quirky. The romance is desirable. \\n\\n\r\nA not-so-typical romcom that has everything you'd expect from a slice of life and comedy, and much more. Romance is certainly very prevalent, but one would be somewhat disappointed if he/she began watching it for the sake of a full-blown love story with a clearly defined happy ending. And it isn't the whole point of the show, either. The emphasis on every character makes sure that as you watch, you watch with everyone in mind. \\n",

            "content": "Neko again here, it's my first time writing review for popular anime series, so I'm a bit nervous to write and dunno what to write. But I'll try my best to present something from what I've seen in this anime.\r\nI usually decide to watch a anime from what I saw in the art & illustration. Then I dropped this anime before watching it, since it have shoujo-themed art. But suddenly my friend recommend me this anime, I watch the first episode and I really enjoyed this while laughing my ass off..\r\nThis is different from what I see, I mean, the art have shoujo style, themale character is really 'beautiful-teenage-guy'. But the story itself is really funny. I looking forward to watch this anime every week. Even I might compare this anime to Daily Lives of High School Boys as equally hilarious!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a damn-she-is-really-cute-i-wanna-hug-her maiden in love Sakura Chiyo, and her super-airhead-scary-faced-guy-crush Nozaki Umetarou. She confessed, but what was she saying is like 'liking as a fan of her work since nozaki is a comic artist'. Then, typical misunderstanding-teen-anime situation occured.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode is filled with comedy. Absurd imagination of Nozaki and his friends make the anime really funny. Every misunderstanding situation is epic. Then Sakura always played the role of straight-man wonderfully. This is best anime of this season. (source : my local club in MAL) \\n\\n\r\nYou might watch some cute expression of Sakura Chiyo when she blushes. But since Nozaki is airhead male character, don't expect romance story.\\n\\n\r\nIdiot, is the very first impression of me about Nozaki anime. Why? Because.. Because.. It's him!! I couldn't even understand the way he think!! Yet he's soo hilarious!!!\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I'm back to normal, forget what I'm sayin', feel free to push helpful or not helpful button. See you later on my another review..",

That special kind of emotional retardation, the total obliviousness, and in particular, the sort of 'alien' behavior (if that is even adequate to describe the behaviors of half the cast, especially Nozaki himself) is just my cup of tea.\r\nIf that is not your thing, you probably shouldn't bother, as the show itself has little else to offer\r\nThe characters seems to be sort of your archetypes, but genderswitched, and with an attached 'quirk' that might as well have been chosen from a pair of dice. They'rea bit plane beyond that, but enjoyable nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nNozaki deserves special attention for the little quirks he acquired in his quest to continue writing mediocre shoujo. It is certainly unique. I can barely describe it. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is fine, kinda charming, cant recall any of the sound so nothing outstanding either, story never goes anywhere or changes any status quo, its a sort of one trick pony that might tickle a very specific fancy",

There are sweet moments in the anime, but that should not be seen as romance. Romance requires development of some sort. A one sided crush, is simply a one sided crush. And it's used for comedy. \r\nThis anime is glorious. Doesn't rely on tropes and even though it doesn't have a plot, it's episodic nature keeps you entertained. Part of the humor is taking apart gender roles and stereotypes. While this isn't the first anime todo it, it is one of the first I've seen that can do it in such a comedic way. The jokes are a constant reversal of expectation, and while you know this, it doesn't make it less funny.",

            "content": "There is a lot of space for a cynic to hate on Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. In the most sarcastic internal voice you can muster, you might think to yourself watching the first episode: \u2018Oh great, another romance anime with one of those clueless protagonists who can\u2019t take a hint. Just what we need\u2019. You would be right \u2013 it turns out another one of those anime was exactly what we needed, because rarely is the concept so well executed, or stretched to such hilarity, as it is in Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun.\r\nGekkan Shoujo is about Nozaki-kun, a high-school student who is secretly a shoujo manga artist,and his life. (The anime is based on a manga as well, so I guess it\u2019s manga-ception?) Now Nozaki-kun is not the world\u2019s most perceptive character, and so when his adoring fan and the anime\u2019s main character Sakura tries to ask him out, he infers that she wants an autograph, much to his satisfaction and her dismay. Similarly dense moments make the biggest running gag of Gekkan Shoujo. This is a show that creates scenarios so that the relationship between our protagonists might develop, only in order that they can be shut down in the most hilariously tragic way possible. You might be wondering whether it\u2019s a parody of the shoujo genre or just a funny shounen? It doesn\u2019t really matter when you\u2019re laughing.\\n\\n\r\nSakura is a feisty protagonist if I ever saw one, the polar opposite to the Nozaki\u2019s docile silence. But she\u2019s very sweet and loveable all the same, such that you\u2019re always excited when her relationship with Nozaki seems to be getting better. And what better way is there for it to improve than to help Nozaki with his manga? That\u2019s right, not only is this show funny, you\u2019re getting an insight into how manga is made at the same time! It\u2019s not Bakuman levels of complexity, but it\u2019s nevertheless really interesting to see all the different roles that make up the creation of a manga.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, Sakura can\u2019t do this job on her own however, so this is where Gekkan Shoujo brings in its remaining cast of quirky characters. There\u2019s Mikoshiba, our very own male tsundere with a talent for spouting cheesy pick-up lines and becoming embarrassed immediately after saying them. Then there\u2019s Seo, the most insensitive best friend you could ever have \u2013 she\u2019s desperate to attract the attention of one of Nozaki\u2019s assistants Wakamatsu, but will happily compare Wakamatsu to a dog without so much as considering it might be insulting. Finally, there\u2019s the drama club dream team Kashima and Hori. These two are the Laurel and Hardy of the show, and Hori is always Kashima\u2019s throat trying to drag her away from her doting female fan club.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s great about this rag-tag bunch is that they\u2019re all given room to let the story explore their relationships. All of them are also built into storyline of Nozaki\u2019s manga, often in ridiculously roundabout ways. Mikoshiba (a guy) is used as reference for the school-girl heroine Mamiko! What\u2019s more, Kashima then becomes the reference for the hero\u2019s rival, who tries to snatch up Mamiko\u2019s love! With the sheer eccentricity of all these characters, Nozaki wisely decides to use his entire school life as one big reference for the manga. This results in all sort of comic situations for Nozaki and Sakura, including Nozaki trying to get into the mind of his manga characters (and possibly the best line ever muttered in anime: \u2018I wish I\u2019d been born a slender bishounen!\u2019) Needless to say, when summer arrives Nozaki suddenly seems very keen to organise a guy\u2019s pyjama party...\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of Gekkan Shoujo, I don\u2019t really feel as though the story progressed all that much, and certainly Sakura and Nozaki are nowhere near the relationship level Sakura pines for. So if that\u2019s something you\u2019re looking for, you might want to look to something a bit more focused on the serious romance department. But as a comedy which uses romance as its medium, Gekkan Shoujo certainly delivers. I look forward to season 2, where perhaps Mikoshiba will learn not to volunteer for nude modelling until after he\u2019s calmed down a bit.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendations: School Rumble \u2013 Romance may be an element of both shows, but it\u2019s an excuse in both to laugh at whichever wacky situation the characters will plunge into next!\\n",

            "content": "(This review will be updated once I can catch up with all the series on my \"currently watching\" list.)\r\nGoddamn this show was funny. If you think this is going to be a tension filled, tear jerking, romantic drama, reread the genre list tags. COMEDY. Yeah. And lots of it.\r\nNozaki-kun was a show I was looking forward to since its anime adaptation announcement in March. I'm happy to say, the anticipation that I had for this show did not go to waste. In fact, instead of matching the bar I set for it, Nozaki-kun easily surpassed it.\r\nFirst, we have Chiyo. Chiyo has a crush on herclassmate Umetarou Nozaki. Due to a failed confession, she now finds herself in a world she never knew. Who would have known that her classmate, Nozaki-kun, was a popular shoujo manga artist! Next, we have our male protagonist, Umetarou Nozaki (Nozaki-kun for short), who this series is named after. A shoujo manga artist, Nozaki-kun is mostly stoic individual, who is COMPLETELY oblivious to Chiyo's feelings. Then we have the other characters: Yuzuki, Kashima, Hori, Mikoshiba. If there was one thing to describe ALL of the characters in this series, it's that they are so eccentric, so out there, that if you locked them all in a room and left them to interact with one another, you would have scenarios so funny that they would give you a heart attack. In short, the characters are hilariously interesting. They ARE the driving force behind why this series is so funny and easy to watch. If it weren't for them, I feel as though this series wouldn't have received such high marks.\\n\\n\r\nNow, as for the story, there isn't really an overarching plot to this show; it's pretty straightforward. The story consists of putting the characters listed above in situations that lead to back-breakingly funny outcomes. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want a series to pick up that will leave you laughing (or at least grinning) throughout each and every episode, be it because you want a breathe of fresh air from a serious or sad show (ex. Clannad or Anohana), or perhaps you just love the comedy genre in general, check out Gekkan Shojo Nozaki-kun. If you don't at least laugh a few times, I'd be pretty surprised.",

            "content": "The shoujo anime that hurt several stomach, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. Honestly, I skipped this in the course of Summer 2014 lineup since I'm too picky to watch now. I watched AoRide, TG, Glasslip, A/Z, Re Hamatora, and ZnT and I'm confident to say that I am disappointed to all of 'em (Well, the last two did well). My eye then caught on Gekkan. It's on #111 in MAL so I decided to watch this. I did think that this is gonna be one of those shojou clich\u00e8 flicks, but I read some of the reviews and it liven up my expectations. Anyways, here's my review:\r\nStory(7)\\n\r\nGekkan is one of those shows that feature several stories while holding a central plot. Usually, this type of anime will just focus on the mini-stories and seldom on the central story, so this type of anime fails to end properly. Unfortunately, Gekkan is one of them. I am not satisfied with the ending solely because I feel it shouldn\u2019t end. I want to see more of it. Anyways, I started reviewing the ending, so now let\u2019s skim up to the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe series started introducing the central point. You have your usual girl-boy confession. The girl later realized that the boy is a mangaka. Then after that, she realized that he\u2019s an idiot. She liked that idiot. After then, she met people associated to Nozaki aaaaannnnd she got caught up with their idiotic mischiefs. The premise isn\u2019t shoujo-like nor shounen-like. The writer did a great job making this appropriate for both audiences. That\u2019s why many loved this show.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to note though, the central point went sideways and it\u2019s treated as if it\u2019s not really important. The central plot is inserted whenever the timing is great. A moment of one-sided love is shown but ultimately brought down by Nozaki himself. Their comedic ways often ends superb and it leaves a good impression. However, it feels like a secondary plot and it did not developed until the latter part of the anime. Because of that, the Chiyo-Nozaki relationship fell flat as it didn't felt cheesy as it supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe mini-stories are very enjoyable, as Gekkan never fails to give me laughter on every episode. The mini-stories are about character introduction and development. We get to meet the characters and their connection to either Nozaki or Chiyo and later develop with one another.  Some of the characters are working for Nozaki's manga and some are friends with Chiyo. Speaking of Nozaki's manga, the anime tackled about manga, specifically, shoujo ones. Nozaki's manga is your usual dose of romantic shojou sh*t. It's interesting though, because the characters in the manga reflect the main characters in reality. Mamiko's reflecting character is so clever, it's so damn funny.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8)\\n\r\nThe art is great. I loved how the anime puts some effects whenever Chiyo is either cheerful or upset. I loved how the anime gives a shoujo effect whenever Mikoshiba/Kashima says something lavish. I loved how the backgrounds look slick and realistic. I loved how Nozaki's manga looked distinct from the reality. And I loved the complex yet simplistic character design. Nozaki\u2019s character design does not stand out and it\u2019s good. Majority of shoujo flicks has a main male character which looks very glamorous. However, Nozaki is not. That\u2019s one way to let out all the shoujo shows I watched. I\u2019m still questionable on why several anime characters have colored hair. I know that it hooks viewers to remember these characters and watch the show further but still\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nThere are some parts though where the background didn't quite match up the effect of the situation, but it doesn't stand out too much. Also, they used too much comedic effects and it's annoying. Nevertheless, they did a good job with living up several comedic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7)\\n\r\nLet's start with the voice acting. Nozaki, in my opinion, did the best yet worst voice acting in the anime. What do I mean? Well, Nozaki is boring. He is very serious and he is not lively unlike the rest. He is only complimented by Chiyo's ultra-lively attitude. However, this is the reason why he did best. The seiyuu matches Nozaki's tone simply because they are both serious. So whenever Nozaki is being made a joke it'll surely make you laugh (like the huge bear-like costume). The rest of the characters sound equally comedic and it's great.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s this background music I like the most; the one with the melodic piano whenever the scene is dramatic or there is the Chiyo-Nozaki shipping time. Usually at the middle of the tone, it immediately cuts because something idiotic happened. You\u2019ll burst into laughter because of that..\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are interesting. The OP sounds rhythmic and fun but it\u2019ll start to wear you off. This OP is one of the greatest OP in this season though. It matches the fun Gekkan has. The ED (those hentai-no-hentai-no-hentai-no-hentai-noes) is also fun. But personally, it's not the type of song that I'd like.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9)\\n\r\nThis is where the show shined. They are all interesting and they will not bore you. All serve a special purpose to either Chiyo or Nozaki. And I admit that they all made me laugh. It\u2019s hard not to review them all so let\u2019s call these characters as the Rainbow Cast.\\n\\n\r\nFirst is Mikoshiba. Personally, he is my favorite character in the show. At first, I thought he was one of those clich\u00e9 hot bishounen dude that will steal the girl of the main character. But rest assured \u2018cause he\u2019s another idiot. I thought he was a cool dude. He is in some way, but then again, he\u2019s another idiot. I liked his fragile personality where you can manipulate him into embarrassing things. And the reaction he does whenever he feels embarrassed is a +1 for girl viewers. He is also an otaku. His likes playing with virtual dating simulator and likes to collect bishoujo figures. He is really interesting and he\u2019s fun to watch. He is popular to girls but Nozaki and Chiyo knows that he can\u2019t handle it. However, there is no character development. He\u2019s a fragile handsome otaku dude and that\u2019s it. After all, if he did develop, I would miss his fragileness, so that\u2019s okay. Aaaaaaaaand I think that he\u2019s gonna die single.\\n\\n\r\nSecond is Chiyo, the main character. Chiyo is the most mature character of all of \u2018em. She is not childish as she seems to be and she\u2019s C2 (cool and cute). She is like butter that is sweet but melts when someone does stupid things. She sympathizes whenever the 6 others do something idiotic. Well, she\u2019s idiotic too (whenever it\u2019s about Nozaki), but not like the others. And that\u2019s why I liked her character; a girl with a well-rounded character. She tries her best to be noticed by Nozaki but Nozaki himself turns her down. She\u2019s interesting in that way.\\n\\n\r\nThird and fourth are Yuzuki and Wakamatsu. Yuzuki is a she-man-she; a girl who is boyish but holds a great secret that indirectly touched the basketball player Wakamatsu. Their relationship is like Nozaki and Chiyo, where Wakamatsu is Chiyo (whose feelings are neglected by their partner) and Yuzuki is Nozaki (who always neglects the feelings of their partner). Sadly, their relationship is not fully explored, and it ended without the resolution of Yuzuki\u2019s secret to Wakamatsu. I liked their individual character though.\\n\\n\r\nFifth is Nozaki, the titular character. He is Chiyo\u2019s love interest. He is very serious, very monochromatic and very idiotic. He writes this shoujo manga where his life and the people around him reflect into. He\u2019s also awkwardly analytical. He looks into others life just so he could put it in his manga. He\u2019s no doubt a boring but interesting character. So then again, whenever he makes a joke, it\u2019ll sure laugh your arses off. Though the Chiyo-Nozaki relationship didn\u2019t quite work well, it\u2019s nice to see Chiyo cope Nozaki\u2019s faults since Nozaki can\u2019t understand the situation around him. Though he\u2019s a main character, he did not develop much. He stayed monochromatic as always and he\u2019s ignorant of Chiyo\u2019s true feelings. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed his personality. \\n\\n\r\nSixth and seventh are Kashima and Hori. They\u2019re twin deaths. Kashima is a reverse trap. At first I thought she was a he, until I saw her skirt. She is also a mess. I liked her jolly personality while constantly being cleansed by Hori. You\u2019ll feel sorry for Hori for handling a mess like Kashima. Though he is short, he is very tall inside as he can handle Kashima\u2019s mischief. Hori is a mature character, as the club president, he can handle being both president and an actor and also someone who can handle Kashima. Though clich\u00e9d, their relationship is very intense. I liked their chemistry together. Unfortunately, like Yuzuki and Waka, their relationship did not regulated properly. The show ended without any leads of their relationship.  \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed all of the characters and they all brought fun to the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9)\\n\r\nI enjoyed it because I loved it. The simple yet smart premise of the story brought all sorts of possibilities. The anime did great on bringing a laugh to its audience. The mini-stories always end with a twist where in you\u2019ll surely laugh. The fun I had when watching Gekkan overshadowed the faults of it. You all know that I really liked Gekkan so I\u2019ll end it here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8)\\n\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is a well-done anime suitable for all audiences. It brings fun and enjoyment and it\u2019ll never bore you. It saddens you when you realize that you are near the end of the series since you want it to last longer. The manga world is also discussed and this is the reason why the characters are even connected to Nozaki in the first place. All the jokes are well done. The characters are well introduced. However, since the show only has 12 episodes, it does not answer all of the relationships and their resolution with one another. But all those negatives are overshadowed by the fun and laughter. It will never stop to bring you happiness and all those mischiefs that connect to one another. The anime does not focus on one sole relationship and it\u2019s good. This is one of the best anime of Summer 2014. \\n",

            "content": "Let me be honest. When I read the manga I didn\u2019t find Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun that funny. Sure it has it\u2019s moments but ultimately it might not pull you in\u2026until you watch the anime. It was one of those cases for me that the anime surpassed the manga. the quality here is simply amazing and I am not talking about the quality of the animation. I am talking about the amount of detail and care you can see in this anime. Specially the voice acting that really gave soul to the whole thing.\r\nThe story is about a girl that fell in love with a Mangakanamed Nozaki and become his assistant so she can win his heart. She gets to know a bunch of weird people through Nozaki and vice versa and lots of funny situations arise from their encounters. Fortunately characters are mostly already paired and there is no unnecessary harem. (not against harem just find most of them unnecessary). Each character as you can expect has it\u2019s own unique joke but fortunately they don\u2019t feel forced and the timing for most of them are right. Sometimes some jokes are just repeated to show you that the story still remembers the things that happened previously.(drawing a house as a background joke) The anime had to cut some of the stuff sadly even though they were funny (Nozaki saving all of his ex-editor\u2019s messages so he can tattle him later and OMG NO BEACH EPISODE) while leaving some unnecessary ones in. \\n\\n\r\nThe good part of Gekkan Shoujo is where it pokes fun at Nozaki\u2019s manga. sometimes when you read a manga you find things that are unintentionally funny, Gekkan Shoujo focuses on that aspect sometimes. For example Nozaki\u2019s manga is about a girl named Mamiko that fell in love with a boy named Suzuki and at some point Nozaki\u2019s new Editor notices some panels are exactly the same with Mamiko saying \u201cSuzuki-kun\u201d over and Over again (this reminded me of Orihime from Bleach). Another funny example is when Nozaki found it easier to leave backgrounds black (again Bleach? :P). As I said the anime has a good amount of details. For example they cared enough to show you a basketball poster in Nozaki\u2019s room just to foreshadow his previous involvement in Basketball and his friendship with Wakamatsu.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the anime is the voice acting and is filled with experienced voice actors.(Ari Ozawa, Sakura\u2019s VA is still new and it is her debut role as a main character and she really done a great job). Sometimes they make even unfunny jokes funny. As for most of comedy shows there are no memorable tracks or music but it is fine. The animation  while is good is not something special either. Character designs are faithful to manga and everything is smooth. also i find the OP good and silly at the same time. also thank god for the character designs. sometimes only main characters are drawn good but here everyone feels the same and the whole world is pretty not only the main guys !\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not like Gekkan Shoujo has no weak points at all though, for example some characters act ignorant or stupid very convieniently sometimes(Seo is probably doing it on purpose, at least to Wakamatsu) or they act way too unreal. \\n\\n\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun can be a weird anime. It is one of those that you think it is not that good but you keep watching it and keep enjoying it. Ultimately Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun and Barakamon are my comedy suggestions of Summer 2014.\\n",

            "content": "Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun: Don't judge a manga by its cover. \r\nFirst and foremost Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is a romantic comedy, and although it never strays from that path it also never bogs itself down with many of the typical trappings that often accompany shows of this genre. Relying more heavily on the comedy aspect for the greater part of the series it offers a solid overall balance of comedy and romance often at times forgetting about the romantic interactions completely. Gekkan Shoujo paces itself slowly and deliberately and isn't afraid of placing it's side characters in the spotlight for an entire episode at a time.This however is one of the more glaring faults to it's credit, as it causes episodes with little to no story progression and the characters placed at the center of these episodes garner no development themselves, but rather are simply used as tools to promote various gags or misunderstandings of comical nature.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the driving plot points and a recurring theme throughout the anime is a parallel that is continually drawn between the manga that Nozaki is writing and the actual events taking place within the show. The first of these parallels is that the characters in Nozaki's manga are directly based off of his friends, the second being that he draws inspiration for his plot by simply watching the interactions between him and his friends and then casually edits it to fit the shoujo genre. These parallels are one of the two main sources of comedy that this show uses, often changing the mundane happenings of Nozaki's life into outlandish shoujo manga settings, and the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast is not anything that could be considered surprising for a a show of this nature. The two mains consist of Chiyo Sakura, who is energetic, cute, and always willing to help. Then there is her counterpart Umetarou Nozaki, who is quiet, calm, and has a penchant for misunderstanding the situation. Although this balance of characters is quite common overall it is certainly played out to the best of its abilities, knowing when to use the comical nature of such a pairing, and when to slow the pace for the more romantic scenes.\\n\\n\r\n The plot mostly revolves around these two as Chiyo helps Nozaki with his manga not only by working directly on it, but by explaining and helping him understand certain misconceptions he has about girls in real life compared to girls in shoujo manga. The second main culprit of the humor in this series is derived from the misunderstandings that Nozaki has with both real life and fictitious girls and romantic interactions, often to the point of complete obliviousness on his part. Chiyo, unlike Nozaki, is often quick to understand the situation at hand, though sometimes she still falls victim to Nozaki's misconceptions.\\n\\n\r\nThe remaining cast of characters follows suit in that none of them particularly stand out, and generally follow typical shoujo character designs, aside from certain twists. The first twist, and general pattern that the side characters follow, is that they all are somewhat gender swapped, that is to say the males are usually put into situations that you would commonly find female characters in and vice versa. This is made more obvious during the series as Nozaki uses his male friends as inspiration for the female characters in his manga. The second twist, only applying to some of the side characters, is that they are stereotypical shoujo characters on the outside, but almost completely different on the inside. \\n\\n\r\nAmong these characters are Mikoto Mikoshiba, a smooth talker who is never afraid to be a braggart on the outside. On the inside he is easily embarrassed, often embarrassing himself with the way he speaks, and needy, complimenting others or acting aloof as to gain compliments or attention himself. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is Yuu Kashima, playing the part of the ever charming \"prince\", except she's a girl. Always willing to sweet talk other girls she is seemingly charming and charismatic. She has a problem remembering the names of her followers and is easily misunderstood, often trying to make a positive impression, only to have the end result be the polar opposite of her intentions. \\n\\n\r\nLastly is Yuzuki Seo, for those who are unfamiliar she may appear as a talented beauty, being referred to as Lorelei, the Adonis of the choir club. To those that know her she is a wrecking ball of energy and crass behavior and can often be found laying waste to the boys basketball team, even though she believes she is helping.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the musical score is concerned Gekkan Shoujo boasts a slightly above average sound track. The best of the tracks being the fantastic opening song, both unusual and catchy it's an energetic way to start each episode on a high note. Otherwise aside from a well placed piece every so often the background music is fairly standard, nothing overly dramatic, and also nothing worth complaining about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Gekkan Shoujo is a pleasantly funny, if not slightly standard, romantic comedy that is certain to make you laugh more than feel for the characters. I would recommend this show to those who are fans of either romance or comedy, but would suggest that those looking for more depth from their romances look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nI gave Gekkan shoujo Nozaki-kun an overall score of 7/10",

            "content": "Thankfully short. Spoiler free. \r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is a charming, light romance anime that takes those popular shoujo romance tropes and subverts them. Our leading man, Nozaki, is a manga artist who creates popular shoujo romance with zero personal experience. Our leading lady, Sakura, is an art club member who bungles up her confession and ends up as a Nozaki's inker. A wonderful partnership is born.\r\nWarning: This series has more manga-making than romance.\r\nThe deconstruction of shoujo tropes was very well done. Much of the comedic material hinges on the \u201creal life to manga to real life\u201d deal. Nozaki takes inspiration from his friends with plentyof misunderstandings and even experiments on himself, without the malice or angst. One thing you\u2019ll love about this series is that the supporting characters shine, not only our leads. Most of Nozaki's resources and quests for inspiration are written for hilarity, however, upon reflection, some may not be as funny. But don't let this stop you. If there\u2019s a low comedic point in its 12 episode run, it isn\u2019t noticeable.  \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is a success as a parody. Under that self-effacing humor is something quite cerebral. If you enjoy shoujo romance without putting it on a pedestal, this series is for you.\\n",

            "content": "A Comedy of Misunderstanding\u2019s\r\nHilarity comes from many parts of life. But, misunderstandings can create some of the biggest laughs. Think back on your life, the most embarrassing instances. I\u2019ll bet quite a few of those moments can be chalked up to misunderstandings. Yeah, those moments might be embarrassing, but put yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes and thinks about those moment in your life. Chances are you might laugh at those misunderstandings. Hell you might even laugh at those moments as you grow older, and as you recount the stupid mistakes of you past.\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is a comedy all about misunderstandings. From Nozaki misunderstanding Sakura\u2019sconfession to Hori-sempai mistaking Kashima for a man. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun thrives off of misunderstandings, and this drives the comedy that is the center piece of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story is a simple one. Sakura, Chiyo is girl in love with a boy named Nozaki. She confesses to Nozaki that she has always been his fan. But, unbeknownst to Sakura, Nozaki is a famous shoujo manga writer. So Sakura instead getting a date, gets an autograph, and an invite to Nozaki\u2019s home, but only to assist him with his shoujo manga. Thus begins the comedy of misunderstandings, which only continues with more misunderstandings as we are introduced to the cast of assistants and inspirations of Nozaki\u2019s manga. To give away anymore would be criminal, because the comedy is again experienced from the misunderstandings, and the shock value of some them will have you rolling on the floor.\\n\\n\r\nFor those expecting your traditional Rom-com though be forewarned. Nozaki-Kun is not a traditional Rom-Com. It is Rom-Com, heavy on the Comedy, with just a sprinkle of Romance. Most of the Comedy comes from the cast\u2019s misunderstandings or analysis of Romance. This could be from the almost eccentric Nozaki\u2019s study of Romance for his inspiration, or the confusion of a cast of characters experiencing love for the first time. However, there are a few tender moment\u2019s (and I mean very few) that will have you squeeing your little fanboy and fangirl hearts out. At least until you smacked in the face with by the blue ball gods who will have you wishing for more, as laugh through tears. \\n\\n\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun is easily my favorite Rom-Com of all time. I\u2019m hard pressed to find any faults with it. You won\u2019t understand why until you see it for yourself. I know I will be re-watching this show, as I patiently wait for a second season, which I hope will someday come.  Hopefully someday soon.\\n",

            "content": "Prior knowledge\r\nManga: None\r\nWith so many popular action anime taking the spotlight this Summer season, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun stands out being one of the more lighthearted shows. Relying mainly on its comedic factor to grab the viewers. But with many of these (rather depressing) shows sporting loads of hype, big budgets, and flashy action does GSN do well with so many other heavyweight contenders? Does a comedy show still have a place in the viewers interests? Let's find out.\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nLet's be very clear. GSN is not a shoujo romance. If you came here looking for another Ao Haru Ride or Sukitte Ii na yo thenit's time to back up and try again. Because this show is all about the comedy. It's not even a RomCom. It's all comedy. The romance hinted at the beginning of the show is simply a backdrop to set the setting for the overall tone of the show. So it's better to come into the show knowing there will be no romantic development at all. Even if the show continuously teases this. The last episode especially.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, there is not 'story' so to speak. There isn't any clear linear plot where the main characters go from A to B. It's just the main cast and their shenanigans. In this sense, it's very similar to Nichijou although it's much more grounded. While the fact that there isn't a 'proper' plot may be a turn off for some people it's nothing to fret over much in the context of the show. However, with a show where much of it's focus is on the comedy, there will be moments of GSN where it feels boring or uninteresting to the viewer if the jokes or gags don't appeal to them. And it's a main problem with any show that chooses to focus on one genre in detail or go through with no solid plot. That said, GSN did had me laughing for most of the show's episodes and successfully did its job in keeping me entertained through its use of comedy. While there were some moments where I was left unentertained (Nichijou is notorious for this) it's certainly a show that would make anyone feel good after watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does stick to its manga artist subplot for the first few episodes and this was used as a good plot device to introduce all the characters as neatly (and hilariously) as possible. This subplot does get dropped as the show continued. It would have been nice to keep it going or at least shift the focus more subtly. The drop was too abrupt as by the time all the characters were introduced, the manga artist plot device became quite integral that leaving it out so suddenly was a little disappointing and made it very clear it was primarily a plot device. The situation does get revisited sometimes in later episodes but simply as a reminder of the show's initial setting.\\n\r\nOne minor problem I had was the actual romantic 'subplot'. While it was clearly used as a backdrop to set up certain jokes or scenes between many of the main characters (not just Nozaki and Sakura) I felt that it became distracting at times. The show sometimes resorts to romantic teasing or hinting. While this may be part of a joke or gag, I found it distracting as it took away the show's value as a comedy. It also felt out of place, as since there was zero romatic development, the use of a sudden couple-shipping scene felt like a jarring change of pace. However, the show doesn't do it so many times that it becomes some badly written romcom.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThere's a weird contrast of quality in this show in terms of art. The character designs are very over the top. From the red hair to the handsome trap-girl to the blonde Japanese. It really shows that this show was originally a manga. And there's nothing wrong with that. Their designs match their personalities more or less and is generally fitting. Character expressions were used really effectively. The last time I've seen such faces being shown was with Nisekoi. Sakura's reaction faces specifically are funny to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flipside, the backgrounds felt like I was seeing a template. The school backgrounds looked like something out of a low budget anime or visual novel. I'm not expecting Aldnoah.Zero levels of art but the backgrounds simply looked like a fake stage backdrop. The show didn't have it's own 'style' so to speak. While this is a bit of nitpicking on my part it did feel at certain times that the characters were acting on some stage than actually being in school.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP's sequence was the last thing I expected from a show with this tone. It complemented the music very well and was very pretty to watch. Likewise for the ED.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to be said. The show's comedy relied heavily on visual gags and character jokes. While utilizing the hearing sense to add to the comedy might have added to the show's comedic value, it already did well enough on its own with the visuals. The soundtrack is a bit generic but does the job well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter voices were a strong point in this show. Every character had their own unique voice that viewers could easily associate with a specific character. The voices suited the character's personalities and appearances well. And shouts and laughter complimented well with the jokes. All in all very good voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP for this show is simply fantastic and always manages to put me in a good mood before the show starts. I feel this is a very important yet overlooked part of any anime. If an OP does well in setting the right mood for the viewer, they will naturally feel much more positive receiving the show. The spunky beat and lively trumpets showed the fun and lightheartedness of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast has plenty of diverse, fun, and memorable characters.There were many different personalities in the cast and it effectively created a lively atmosphere when they interacted with each other. Seeing as how the show relies much of its entertainment value on comedy, the characters do well in carrying the show. Reactions, interactions and personalities are critical for a show like GSN and how each of these aspects are used and executed can mean the difference between a good show and a bad one. Fortunately, the execution carried out by the characters is done well. \\n\\n\r\nGSN's characters are very archetypal and it isn't afraid to show this. Flaunt it even. As with shows like GSN, reactions are highly exaggerated and this show will use it every single time when they can. Each character represents one focused group of a personality trait, and its because of this that the conflict and comedic interaction with the cast is very strong. However, such characters suffer a weakness similar to that in its plot. Make no mistake, there is close to zero character development here at all. The cast never strays away from the personality tropes given to them. While this does help in its jokes, it does mean that people would quickly find the show boring if the characters don't fit well together in certain situations or if they simply don't like them. That said, this rarely happens, if ever. But if you miss a gag or don't get a joke after a long scene, you're going to feel dissatisfied. Just for that moment. But it's enough to break away from the 'feel good' momentum you've built up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show very much. It managed to do many things right. The jokes were funny and the characters were very likeable. The show was more or less consistent with the level and quality of their jokes. While I did feel some episodes were stronger than other in terms of their jokes and gags, as a whole it does its job well as a lighthearted and fun show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's a show that manages to use what it had correctly. Many comedy shows are a hit and miss but GSN manages to stay consistent throughout. The gags and jokes themselves were funny but the character delivery and execution was what really sold the show and made it entertaining. The character chemistry being quite high. The OP always had me comfortable and ready to be entertained by a lively cast. While a more structured plot could have made the show a little more concrete the setting of the show is suited enough for the atmosphere. All in all, a very good comedy that's sure to leave you entertained.\\n\\n\r\nFeeback is welcome! Do visit my blog as reviews are posted there first. And with pictures!",

            "content": "Episodes: 12\r\nA really fun and nice anime to watch.\r\nIt's your average romcom school anime but with much less romance and hilarious comedy.\r\nThe one thing I loved about this anime is how each episode made me burst out laughing. It's truly hilarious. And the characters are really well designed and funny in their own ways.\r\nThe story is something like this; a girl messes up her confession to a boy who is a mangaka and she spends her days working in his apartment as his assistant.\r\nAlong the way, we meet the boy's and the girl's friends who have their own problems and some of which are alsoassistants of the boy.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is the best part of this anime. Though the romance is nothing much and if you want a total romance anime, steer clear from here. But if you're looking for a warm, fuzzy kind of anime with loads of laughter, this is the best choice.\\n\r\nIt's quite similar to Ao Haru Ride; just add a lot of comedy and decrease the romance aspect. As for those who've already see AHR, you know what decreasing the romance could mean.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a really enjoyable anime and you'll have fun watching it!",

You become sucked in and you feel the feelings they feel, you enjoy the things they enjoy, and you are basically living their lives with them.\r\nIf you enjoy humor, romance, friendship, and/or entertainment, this anime is definitely for you.\r\nI wish I watched this anime after it had already come out so I could've binged watched it. It was torture having to wait a week for every episode. You really feel like you are in the anime yourself,living the characters lives with them. You feel every emotion possible: enjoyment, laughter, sadness, nervousness, excitement, etc. You come to love the characters on the very first episode and you soon start rooting for different relationship couples all while laughing at the humor that is constantly being thrown in there.\\n\\n\r\nI have recommended this anime to so many friends, and I will continue to do so. I gave a 10 in almost every category because I love this anime so much and I feel other people will enjoy it as much as I did.",

            "content": "\"Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun,\" a comedic Slice-of-Life, contains the most hilarious interactions between characters.\r\nI was a bit hesitant to check this anime out, but I finally gave in, and I am glad I did!\r\nThis shy, innocent, yet endearing Sakura is voice by Ozawa, Ari. Ozawa hasn't voiced any well known characters so far, so this must be a big step in her career. Ozwa's voice captures the cute Sakura, and voices her anywhere from innocent to highly confused and slightly appalled by what's happening around her. Moving onto Nozaki, the blunt and oblivious, he is voiced by Nakamura, Yuuichi (Gray[Fairy Tail]). With his deep, raspy, butvelvety voice, Nakamura easily conquers the taste of using voice inflection to play the series, but clueless Nozaki. Introducing the shy and awkward Mikoshiba \"Mikorin,\" one of Nozaki's assistants, who is played by Okamoto, Nobuhiko (Rin [Blue Exorcist]). Okamoto's voice bears a vague resemblance with popular Utaite, Amatsuki (especially when he sings). I do think that this is my favorite voice of all the characters. His words get slurred (as they should) when acting embarrassed, and he perfectly controls his accents on certain words and phrases. Moving on, Yuzuki is Sakura's very interesting friend that doesn't notice how negatively she affects others. She also has an annoying snark and thins she's perfect. Sawashiro, Miyuki's (Kurapika [HxH 2011]) sharp, edgy voice digs deep into this cocky character, and makes Yuzuki loveable even though she's so clueless. Next is Ono, Yuuki (Kagami [Kuroko no Baset]) voicing Hori, another of Nozaki's assistants and part of the theatre club. Hori is probably the most normal of all the characters, but his voice sure isn't boring at all. Without Ono voicing Hori, I don't think he would have been such an in depth character. I can't explain it, but Ono brought him to life. The last girl is Kashima, Hori's kouhai who causes him much trouble and pain, but loves senpai with all her might. Kashima is often mistaken for a guy, and is the start of the theatre club. Girls fawn over her, and who other to voice this female heartthrob than Nakahara, Mai (Nagisa [CLANNAD])? Nakahara's voice is obviously female, but adds such a boyish quality that it's hard not to swoon over her and her character. I applaud. I do applaud. And last is Wakamatsu, a misunderstood character who doesn't get much screen time, but when he does, it's bound to be either cute or funny. He is voiced by Kimura, Ryouhei (Hinata [Angel Beats]), who's voice is thin and childish, but perfect for the formal and polite Waka. I seriously loved all the voice actors in this anime. They all did such an amazing job, and the characters wouldn't be as good without them.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I loved about \"Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun\" was that despite having romance themes in it, the anime didn't center around the romance between Sakura and Nozaki. In fact, no matter what Sakura did to get closer to Nozaki, it seemed like something bad always happened to top her before she seriously confesses. And this continues all the way into the end. I also loved that instead of just watching the character help make Nozaki's manga, I actually got to see what the manga was about, and see that also acted out. I think that was great, because most animes don't do that, and I'm always left to wonder about the type of story that took place. Another great thing about this anime were the side characters which are main-ish in a way. All the side characters who's voices I mentioned were perfect. Their personalities were all so diverse, and made the show a joy to watch! The comedy was also timely placed.\\n\\n\r\nDo you want a comedy that will put you in a good mood? Do you want a simple anime that won't require you to think much? Do you want to enjoy every aspect of an anime? Then look no further! \"Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun\" is the anime for you. Specially delivered in a bundle full of laughs, or will have you holding your sides, anticipating the next episode, and leave you with mixed feelings about the end. Even if you are a more action oriented person, I believe that this anime will suite your needs (there are some lovely action scenes included). \"Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun\" was a truly pleasant watch.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nThis story was positively great. And not only did it follow seven very diverse people, but it also gave an insight as to what Nozaki's manga was about. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nThe art style is cute, clear, and although maybe a bit on the plain side, very colorful and the good kind of simple. The colors are all very warm colors -- each color on each character truly matches them.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 8\\n\r\nI found myself singing to the opening and ending every time they played. The opening is a nice country-ish song that's nice a quirky (and damn, can that guy sing). The ending is cute, and matches the chibis in the animation. The OSTs were nice too, and gave the anime that jumpy, bubbly feeling.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nI seriously loved each and every character. There was not a single character that annoyed me -- which is rare. Nozaki was a wonderful main character, and I found it lovely that he was a bit stupid in his own right. Sakura was the same way. I loved to see her obsessed with Nozaki, and her comparisons of real life to shoujo manga. Yuzuki was a beautiful character who probably made me laugh the most. Kashima, being a pain in the but to Hori, was the wonderful womanizer who was actually a woman. Very different, but a bit alike to her best friend Mikoshiba, who flirted with women, but instantly regretted his actions, regressing into a cute blob of moe. Hori and Wakamatsu were perhaps the two most normal characters, but each quirky in their own way. Hori with his intense need to respect and beat Kashima up at the same time, and Waka's want to be able to talk back and be rude to Yuzuki, but never actually able to go through with it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime so much. It was probably average in my hype, but turned out to be one of my top five Summer animes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8.8\\n\r\nThis was a very good anime, bringing me laughter and sunshine on a cloudy day. The ending wasn't a resolution, but it wasn't a cliff hanger, so I'm pretty satisfied.",

            "content": "By seeing its title, you would think it is a shoujo anime, but the reality it's a shounen. Like people say, don't judge book by its cover. First time i watched it, i thought the anime was really weird and bad, but my minds changed when i went through its episodes. Gekkan Shoujou Nozaki-kun is definitely a romance-comedy you should-- er i mean you must watch. \r\nThe Story was begun when Sakura Chiyo, a second-year high school student confessed his love to Nozaki Umetarou, a shoujo manga artist who sakura didn't know. Nozaki thought Sakura as a big fan and later Sakura became Nozaki's mangaassistant. As you can see it's a one-sided love story, but is still great to me. The best thing of this anime is its comedy. Every single episode never fails to make me laugh. Also its characters, they always make my stomach hurt. Beside Nozaki and Sakura, there are other characters, who are also the main characters, that have their own unique personalities. Since it has gag stories, every episode or story has different character focuses. Trust me they won't make you bored,but make you laugh instead.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gekkan Shojo Nozaki-kun is pretty much enjoyable to me. If you want to find something that makes you relax, enjoy, and happier than ever, then this anime is the answer.",

            "content": "Take a love-struck high school girl and make her an assistant for her favorite mangaka, who, as it turns out, is actually her crush. What do you get? You get a shounen anime that actually should be a shoujo yet is hilarious, beautiful, and overall at least close to a work of art that would exceed any expectations you have of it. Trust me, I didn't have a lot of expectations for Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, or Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun, at first, but over time, it just got to the point where this would become my favorite anime of July 2014.\r\nOur protagonist here is Chiyo Sakura,a girl who is in love with her classmate, Umetarou Nozaki. She finally manages to confess, and you know how he responds? He gives her an autograph. After that, Nozaki-kun invited Chiyo to his house, where he makes her help him out with his manga. As Chiyo discovers, Nozaki-kun is actually a shoujo manga artist by the penname of Yumeno Sakiko. In order to get closer to Nozaki-kun, Chiyo ends up becoming his assistant, and over time, she meets a bunch of people who help him and/or serve as inspirations for his manga.\\n\\n\r\nThere may not be a huge story in Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, but it's just one of those anime that relies on comedy. It does an EXCELLENT job with comedy. There aren't that many flops with the comedy, leaving you to just laugh at the many things that Chiyo, Nozaki-kun, and every other character in the series go through in their lives.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, this anime provides us with many likable characters. My favorite character is Mikoshiba; he's just so adorable in many ways and has made me laugh from the moment he first appeared. Chiyo is quite outstanding herself (RIBBONS IS LOVE), and Nozaki-kun may be oblivious but in a hilarious way that just makes it likable. Most of the other characters are amazing in their own ways, as well. If there's one Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun character I don't like, it's Maeno, Nozaki-kun's previous editor. He's just so annoying!\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound here is just plain amazing. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun was animated by Dogakobo, the studio that brought us YuruYuri (another great anime), and trust me when I say that Dogakobo has done a good job with animation once again. Also, each one of the voice actors fit the character they're playing very well. The music is amazing, as well, especially the OP, \"Kimi ja Nakya Dame Mitai\" by Masayuki Ooishi. Whenever it plays, I just know that I'm in for another outstanding episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is a great anime. I honestly wanted to give it a 10, but the flops in comedy that it's had (not to mention Maeno) made me drop it to a 9. Even so, it's something you won't want to miss. Who knows? You may get a look at exactly how comedic the world of shoujo manga may be!",

            "content": "The first thing I'm going to say is: throw all your assumptions out the window and stomp on them a bit. Then look at it, and you might be a bit closer to what this anime's really about. \r\nI'm assuming most people probably don't look at the tags. If you haven't, I highly suggest you go look at them. Guess what it says? That's right. Shounen. This anime is not, despite it's generic shoujo summary and art, a shoujo anime. It is probably the complete opposite of it, in fact. \r\nThe story starts with Sakura Chiyo, a girl who confesses to her crush. He mistakesher intentions and assumes she's a fan of his manga work, because the truth is, he's actually a manga artist. So she inadvertently becomes his assistant, and this is where the story begins. If you're looking for a story, this anime doesn't have one. It's story is episodic in manner, with new and different events happening in each episode. This isn't unusual for a comedy anime, and it's in this way that we can appreciate the full effect of the jokes and set ups. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I'd like to address is the romance. I realize that romance is also listed as a genre, but really, it's probably pretty low in importance in the anime. It's pretty much non-existent. Usually it's only brought up as a cause of humorous misunderstandings, or the cause of a joke. So if you're watching simply for the romance, I wouldn't waste your time. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, we have to address the characters. Ah yes, the stars of the show. You know the piece of advice I gave at the beginning of the review? Do it again. The characters are as far from every shoujo trope you can think of. The actions between them, and their relationships are simply brilliant. We have about seven main characters, each with their own unique characteristics and personalities. There's Sakura, the protaganist. She's a bit dreamy and off in the clouds sometimes, but also very down to earth. She actually acts as the \"straight man\" a majority of the time. There's her crush, Nozaki, who's extremely, extremely dense and oblivious to anything remotely romantic, despite being a shoujo manga artist. Then there's Mikoshiba, introduced later on, the standard \"cool\" guy. Except, he's actually a delicate, sensible, and easily embarrassed by his own words. Kashima, the school prince, in actuality is a girl who all the girl's like. Hori, the violent senpai. Wakamatsu, the innocent kouhai. And Seo, completely oblivious. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters and their interactions are what make the show so enjoyable. I'd be surprised if you aren't able to find a favourite. I'd be even more surprised if there was someone you hated. There wasn't a single episode in which I wasn't giggling and smiling like an idiot at. Being a comedic anime, there isn't much development, but that's usually to be expected. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening of this anime is an extremely catchy song that definitely suits the mood. You'll find yourself humming along with it before long. I didn't really like it at first, but it grew on me. The ending is no less catchy, but a little more calm. OST's were fine. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation of this anime was very nice! I also rather liked the clean cut art and the bright colours. Both of these aspects suited the anime nicely! Overall, this anime was my favourite, and a definite highlight of the Summer 2014 anime list.\\n",

            "content": "I stumbled upon this series while searching for a romantic comedy that was heavier on the comedy and lighter on the romance. Despite the romance tag on this series, this series main focus is comedy, and is a series that was able to create a constant stream of chuckles like few other.\r\nThis relatively short series starts with a confession of love by our \"straight man\" in the series to her crush, Nozaki. However he misunderstands this confession as  Chiyo stating that she is a fan of his shoujo manga. From here hilarity ensures, and the plot of the series is rather character driven aswe are introduced to the various wacky characters, with the underlying theme of romance driving most of the character's actions. The series is able to succeed so well because the humor is intricately crafted around literature's oldest friend, irony. The majority of the humor of the show is caused by the various juxtapositions and paradoxes created by the main characters and their interactions in everyday school life. By doing so the series is able to make normally mundane school activities go from ordinary to extraordinary funny as the characters struggle to complete the simplest of tasks due to ridiculous misunderstandings. Their are some great sight gags in the series as well, and it still is able to create some strong laughs even when straying from the ironical and paradoxical humor and situations that it does so well. If there are any aspects that could leave you disappointed after watching this series the most glaring  is that despite the fact that romance is teased several times, the series offers no closure to the numerous couples that it teases throughout its run. Romance takes a back seat in this series, but it still is a driving force for the character's actions and causes a great deal of the humor as the characters struggle to grasp the concept.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are easily the highlight of the show, and I will not discuss specifics as I feel that learning more about the characters and their ridiculous behavior is what makes the show worth watching. When a character that you enjoy watching is absent for an most of an episode, it really is noticeable as each character is able to bring so much to the table in terms of humor and personality. I particularly would lie to praise the character of Nozaki, as his deadpan delivery of lines is expertly done to create the most laughs possible. \\n\\n\r\nOverall despite not being the next great romance series, this anime brings a fantastically whimsical cast to the table. It also has a funky OP and soundtrack, and has some sharp crisp art. All in All this series is  able to effectively make use of irony and misunderstandings to create one of the funniest series that I've seen in quite a while.",

            "content": "Monthly Girls\u2019 Nozaki-kun is an ongoing manga series that started in 2011. In 2014, it received a 12 episode anime.\r\nOkay, stop me if any of this sounds familiar. Nozaki-kun is about a high school girl named Chiyo Sakura. Like many girls her age, she has A Boy She Likes, a fellow classmate named Nozaki. She finally works up the nerve to tell him how she feels about him. However, instead of saying something like, \u201cI\u2019m in love with you! Let\u2019s hang out!\u201d she instead says, \u201cI\u2019m your biggest fan!\u201d His reaction? He fills out an autograph. Chiyo\u2019s reaction is the same as the audience\u2019s; huh?She clarifies that she wants to be with him. Nozaki then invites her over to his apartment, not to be romantically together with her, but rather to have her assist in his manga. It turns out that Nozaki is a shoujo manga author, and he thought Chiyo was a fan of his work, so much so, that she wanted to be an assistant producer. Bewildered but not put off, she agrees to help him, hoping she\u2019ll get closer to him. The only problem is, despite writing mushy love stories, Nozaki is completely unaware of how she feels for him, indeed, he hasn\u2019t even been in love himself!\\n\\n\r\nThe whole thing about Nozaki-kun is that it\u2019s a shoujo romance that pokes fun at shoujo romance. (The fact that the manga runs in a shonen serial might be a giveaway) Like many artists, Nozaki takes inspiration from the people around him. Since everyone acts like a shoujo manga clich\u00e9, or at least something akin to that, this gives him a lot of good material, and a lot of laughs for the audience. For example, there is Mikoto, the charming red-haired stud, who loves to flirt with girls...and also suffers from a frail ego. He is always embarrassed by his words. Nozaki bases one of his female characters off of him, hinting that a lady\u2019s man like Mikoto can be like a stereotypical girly girl. There is also Seo, the beautiful girl with an angelic singing voice...who is also disrespectful, unfeminine, and loves to be violent on the basketball court. And there\u2019s also Yuu, the \u201cPrince\u201d of the school...who is actually a girl, just very masculine in appearance. She plays male characters in the theater club, and is the heartthrob of other girls, regardless of their preferences. That\u2019s not even mentioning the other oddball personalities, like the two manga editors Maeno (conceited) and Ken (\u201cnormal\u201d, yet beloved by Nozaki). The two mains are quirky in their own right. Chiyo is cheery and bright, though not as ditzy as characters like her usually are; her facial reactions should be proof of this. Nozaki is a talented author and artist, yet does and says nearly everything with a poker face, and when he does get emotional, it\u2019s over the strangest of things.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Nozaki-kun makes a lot of fun of shoujo romances, it never does so in a mean-spirited manner. One can be a fan of the genre, or not, and still enjoy Nozaki-kun for what it is. Many of the jokes work even if you know nothing of how these sorts of love stories play out. There\u2019s humor in gender stereotypes, meta gags, slapstick, dialogue, and all other variety of humor. Unlike some comedy anime, which rely mostly on otaku references or tired physical gags, Nozaki-kun rarely gets tiresome in how it presents itself. I say rarely, for some of the later episodes recycled gags at times. It wasn\u2019t a huge detriment, but I did remember that.\\n\\n\r\nAlso of note is the animation. In short, it looks much better than most other high school comedies. The animation itself is very fluid for a tv series, with bright colors that don\u2019t get too garish, and I was unable to locate any off model shots. The character designs are typical of shoujo, with the men being tall and with handsome faces, but there\u2019s variety, for Chiyo is the only girl with an overly childish appearance, Yuu\u2019s princely figure is unique, and Ken the editor looks rather plain for an anime character, but it all helps for the different personas to stand out, not just in behavior, but in appearance too.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme song is a catchy tune, as is some of the background music. The audio doesn\u2019t fail, and this extends to the voice acting, which is spot on. There are many recognizable names in the cast, including Yuuichi Nakamura, Mai Nakahara, Daisuke Ono, and Norio Wakamoto. Of particular note is Miyuki Sawashiro. Normally, I find Sawashiro\u2019s performances sounding like she\u2019s bored out of her mind, but not here; she really chews the scenery as Seo, in a good way. Even the actors I don\u2019t know by name sound great. There are no weak links in the Japanese cast, for sure.\\n\\n\r\nUpon finishing the last episode, I had two thoughts. One, there needs to be more Nozaki-kun! Two, why didn\u2019t anyone think of spoofing shoujo romances like this before!? Okay, aside from Ouran High School Host Club, I can\u2019t think of anything else like Nozaki-kun, certainly not anything new. This is a fresh take on the high school comedy anime, and a fresh take on the strange things love does to us, and one I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing continued in animated form.",

            "content": "This is my first review. Very minor spoilers, at least to me.\r\nI thought Nozaki-Kun was just...alright. I had read many comments and mentions from many people saying it was the shit. That it was the funniest anime of 2014 that it was really good, etc. Even the reviews posted before mine illustrate this. But I found this show just...alright. From the very first episode, I found myself chuckling at most of the jokes, I laughed at some that I found legitimately funny midway through the season and other times, the jokes just weren't funny at all . The story while certainly different than most anime,isn't praiseworthy, and certainly isn't groundbreaking in any way. The characters, although I felt were just ripped off from other animes and slapped onto here, certainly did have their own personalities and quirks that made them enjoyable and fun to watch. So much so in fact, that I actually found the school \"prince\" and the drama club president MORE interesting than Nozaki-kun and...the girl with the ribbons in her hair. I legitimately can't remember her name even though she's a main character, she was really that uninteresting to me. (Looked it up: Chiyo Sakura). Chiyo and Nozaki are boring characters. Chiyo really doesn't have much character or much of a personality besides having a crush on Nozaki and not being able to express her crush to him. That's it. Nozaki is a 16 year old stoic mangaka who has the body and personality of an oblivious 40 year old man. Seriously this dude is supposed to be 16? He's worse than an Austrian playing an American cop disguised as a Kindergarten teacher! Going back to the other characters, I feel as though the anime could have gone farther in terms of breaking stereotypes, than just making Mikoshiba a tsundere dumbass who's design suspiciously looks like Kauru/Hikaru from Ouran. Or the school prince being a 16 year old girl who dresses and looks like a guy. Both of these character traits are just played for laughs are aren't taken seriously in the show as actual human traits that belong to these characters. The show flirts with the idea of homosexuality in one episode, but that was also just played for laughs as well. The art style is not unlike anything we see in other animes shows. It's sad actually, while compared to American cartoons, the backgrounds of animes are always so detailed and realistic, but when compared to other animes, you start to find them generic and boring and sort of just blend in and you end up taking it for granted. The sound....There really wasn't anything that stood out for me. The OP and ED songs were boring and I ended up just skipping through the OP and clicking on the next episode before the ED started. The one thing that did stand out a bit for me was the last episode with the fireworks. The sound of the fireworks was great almost as if it was recorded from an actual fireworks show and used in the show. Enjoyment? I enjoyed it fine, but it wasn't something I just HAD to watch. I just binge watched it as a good time waster and because everybody was shitting themselves over this anime. Although a lot of the stuff mentioned above bothered me a bit, sometimes the actions of the characters don't make sense. Like, in many episodes, characters end up sleeping overnight at Nozaki-Kun's house. Don't they have families to go to? Parents? It just seemed odd to me. Another thing that bothered me is Nozaki--Kun himself. He's the elephant in the room. This dude is 16 years old and lives by himself as a Mangaka in an apartment. Does nobody else find this strange for a 16 year old? All in all, it was fine, but not something I'd buy from Sentai on blu-ray.\\n\\n\r\n- Seriously, I found Kashima and Hori so much more enjoyable and entertaining as a couple and as characters. Although after a couple of episodes their gags started feeling more abusive than chuckleworthy.",

            "content": "Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun) is a typical romantic comedy that adds a few unique elements to what you would normally expect out of this genre.  I can not express enough how much laughs one can potentially take from this show and is good for anyone who is interested in (shoujo) manga or is just looking to brighten the mood. Nevertheless here's my review, continue to read and see if this show is for you. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story is brought up right away with the introduction of the first episode and is pretty typical for a romantic comedy. Which means that the onlydrive for the story overall is the eventual and/or sought after confession of a couple that may or may not be perfect for each other.  I will say however that you are not watching this anime for the story, at least not entirely, it is the humor in the story that will keep most longing for what happens next in this anime and Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun provides much humor. As an added bonus, it doesn't really leave that \"what happens next?\" feeling that most anime of this nature will leave, but rather a \"I like how it is.\" sort of conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is very manga like, and the colors will probably make one think happy thoughts more than anything else. The backgrounds that this anime provides are not entirely detailed, or at least not as detailed as most. Most backgrounds that lack detail are also not areas we see our characters around a lot.  I found no qualms with general animation and this anime does provide a variety of animation styles which will be seen by any who decide to watch this show. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNo synchronization problems with the dialogue are present in Nozaki-kun, and there isn't too much sound to really judge other than that.  We do see some comedic scenes that include more of your non-everyday sounds but these seem to work well with the animation.  As far as the soundtrack is concerned, I would give a lot of credit to the OP.  The in-show music is also fitting and really conveys a romantic comedy feel.    \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters in this show are meant to convey perfect examples of manga stereotypes/archetypes, and it is so overdone that it is hard to give this category any hate.  The characters are what provide the humor, the love, and are the main thing that keeps audiences intrigued.  The protagonist is a cute young woman trying to express her feelings to her crush, and almost every character she comes across in her pursuit to this goal are all worth meeting. For these reasons I give this category a high score. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI truly loved this show for the fact that it never failed to give me a good laugh at least once per episode.  It is a typical high school romance setup sure, but it plays it out in a unique way by making the characters extremely unique to the point where realism is no longer questioned. I will definitely be seeing this one again very soon.",

While watching GSN i was half expecting Nozaki to suddenly become uncharacteristically romantic or Sakura to try force feelings on Nozaki or even for Mikoshiba to come out as a brooding character hiding behind his cheer, but nope. All wrong :D\r\nI loved the fact that all characters were true to what they are and still managed to incorporate each other into their lives without intrinsically changing what they are (which is what happens in real life). The gagswere hilarious. i laughed my butt off when  Sakura was supposed to praise Mikoshiba and she went \"-___-  Sugoi sugoi\", when Mikoshiba finds out dating sim games and he and Nozaki play together, yo get the point.\\n\\n\r\nI genuinely enjoyed this anime. If you like something with a light mood but still pretty satirical and witty, this is an anime for you. Don't expect romance, just watch it for what it is. Pure awesomeness. \\n\\n\r\nP.S.

            "content": "Romantic, school, comedy, 4-koma manga adaptation... It's rare for me to even hear these four things and actually then watch the series, never mind enjoy it to the extent I did. \r\nThe show's overly clich\u00e9d premise has to be one of its biggest strengths as without it, the show's tongue-in-cheek humour would be out of place. Gekkan Shoujo knows it sounds clich\u00e9d, it knows we think we've seen all this before, it knows what the genre expects of it... and it goes in the complete opposite direction. \r\nI have never actually laughed out loud whilst watching comedy anime, until now. There was one episode inparticular which was the turning point for me: episode 5. Also known as the tanuki episode (you will understand). Before episode 5 I had written off Gekkan Shoujo as nothing more than one of 'those' series which would stop at nothing to make me laugh. If I had to explain the reasons behind this turning point, it would have to be the characters. At this point in the story the series is allowed to be what it wants to be: a character-driven comedy. The comedy in the show doesn't come from bizarre and 'hilarious' scenarios the cast are thrown into, but from the every day interactions of the cast with each other. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the cast really are something splendid. Most of the comedy comes from Nozaki's completely clueless behaviour towards Sakura and to pretty much everything in the series. I am a self-proclaimed hater of the 'clueless air-head character trope' but even I have to admit that Nozaki's comedy hits the spot every time. This is how you make a character like this. \\n\r\nSakura is the normal happy-go-lucky cute girl who has fallen in love with Nozaki. Sounds completely boring, right? And, for the most part she is just the set up for Nozaki to deliver punchlines, but she also brings something very interesting to the romance aspect. Sakura spends the series learning about Nozaki's endless list of flaws and ignorance when it comes to love but, despite all this, she still loves him. In the time they spend together throughout the series, they only grow as friends and thus Sakura's love for him develops as she learns more and more about him. \\n\r\nMikoshiba, the dumb best friend of Nozaki. Except he isn't dumb. Mikoshiba is a complete flirt on the face of it but is also a socially awkward shy otaku who is only truly comfortable around the likes of Nozaki and Sakura. Most of Mikoshiba's scenes do fall a bit flat due to the inconsistency of his character and it's possible that he is the reason behind me only giving the cast a 9/10. \\n\r\nHori is the mature upperclassman... Who isn't really mature. \\n\r\nKashima is the popular flirtatious prince of the school... Who is actually a sensitive girl.\\n\r\nSeo is Sakura's best friend who fades into the background... Except she doesn't fade into the background; she's really loud and forces herself to take centre stage in every scene she is in. \\n\r\nWakamatsu is the normal background character.... Except he isn't a background character, appears in nearly all the episodes and is actually an interesting character. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing more or nothing less than you'd expect from anime of this decade and I did not see the quality falter in any scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing really special, the EP is forgettable but the OP was nice enough for me not to skip. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, the show's is fuelled by it's ironic comedy and by characters which do not fit the tropes we have come to expect from these types of shows. Because of this, the series is a pleasant watch and is, in my mind, the best comedy in recent seasons.",

The way it presented satire is hilarious upon realizing it makes fun of itself and its origin.\r\nTruth be told, the story didn't get any impact on me. For one, I'm not into shoujo anime much, so I'm not sure how the plot usually goes. In fact, every scene resembled 4koma style of narration. If you're familiar with seitokai yakuindomo, you'll know when and where the jokes would come in. Still, kudos for the creators for making me laugh out loud.\r\nAt first, when I saw the characters, I thought, \"it'sgonna be another girl loves boy\" situation. But as this was a satire, it totally proved me wrong. Each character were representations of your usual shoujo casts, but they also had their own sets of personalities to make them unique among these typical casts.\\n\\n\r\nBut the one thing that reeled me in to this show was the soundtrack. It was simple but effective. It used the same melody but used different interpretations according to the mood of the scene. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, this anime was so good, I'd love it if it had a second season. If you liked seitokai yakuindomo, you should definitely give this a try. Who knows? You mght even end up making a shoujo manga yourself after you're done.",

            "content": "An enjoyable RomCom anime that is very \"self-aware\", taking plenty of opportunities to comment on or poke fun at manga's quirks and cliches. \r\nThis anime is up my alley because what's focused on most is the characters and their comedic interactions with each other. It can take what would otherwise be a bland story premise, and then make it enjoyable just because the characters are that likeable. Nozaki's aloof and oblivious nature makes him a classic \"my art is my life\" archetype. He never really takes a day off as he's always focused on what he can add to or use to enhance his manga,but he doesn't take it or himself too seriously, he's just always thinking about his art. He may come off pretentious at first, but that isn't the case once you get to know him. Sakura is a decent main character, but she comes off kind of bland on her own without others to interact with. Her awkward attempts to grow her relationship with Nozaki are natural and seem like genuine scenarios. It can get a bit much at times, you sort of wish she'd just carry on and that the scene would end. Standard RomCom stuff though, it's the central plotline of the show after all. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are great, giving the show much needed flavor since things with Nozaki and Sakura can get dry at times. Mikoshiba is hilarious and one of the characters we are introduced to early on. When someone calls his bluffs, the reactions are priceless. Kashima and Hori's interactions are great, as are the exchanges between Hori and Nozaki as well. Seo is a character that works great in smaller, concentrated doses. Adding Wakamatsu gives some much needed balance, as her character can be very abrasive. The series does a good job keeping a cycle of characters flowing so we don't get tired of them. It may seem like an adaption technique to make up for flaws in character writing, but at least they are focusing on what works. \\n\\n\r\nNo spoilers, but the ending was kind of lackluster. It wasn't a BAD ending, just disappointing. It also feels like it stopped short, as if a 2nd season were almost planned, but it never happened. We had so much to explore with the side characters that it felt like the anime should have been twice as long. Regardless, it was solid and worth watching for the laughs and the characters involved. If you don't like SoL RomComs then skip this, it will NOT be up your alley. I gave this a high rating because of how easy it was to watch and likeable it was. It's a genre I prefer, so naturally I'm going to think of it positively. The male characters in this show were very likeable, something I don't always run into with the anime I've watched. Definitely worth a watch.",

            "content": "Apart from the hordes of Romance and Comedy anime I'm addicted to there's always that one genre I don't watch that much but love unconditionally, that is the Slice of Life genre. Not to mention Shoujo anime. I'm a huge fan of shoujos like Kaichou wa Maid Sama and now Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nAs if the setting wasn't unique enough, being a slice of life, Gekkan Shoujo didn't have to worry about a proper plot and so we didn't have to either. It just showed us the sweet daily life of Nozaki and Sakura and their group of friends in their daily shenanigans. What wasamazing about the story was that it felt familiar yet new at the same time. It went smoothly and although each episode was kind of independent there was a loose roping between episodes to hold the plot. Although in the middle I felt it strayed from Nozaki-kun to Hori San and Kashima, just for a while, thought it bounced back immediately. And did I mention that epic twist the ending was? Watch and you'll find out yourself!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis time the faces of the characters were more rounded so it felt new and fun to watch as well. The backgrounds had some impressing detail and complimented the sweet nature of the characters very well. Even in 480p I was in awe at the color and quality of the art style. A huge deal for me, a guy who atm is low on storage. Another thing I liked was how there were some more reactions used for characters (example when an embarrassing ituation happens a drop appears on the head of the characters), now this is obviously ere in almost every anime, but Gekkan Shoujo not only increased this but they made it look better and funnier than usual.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI never expected a shoujo to have such a brilliant and beautiful sound track. The OP perfectly showed the anime's message while the ED was one of the catchiest EDs I've ever heard and I loved listening to it. The BGM (that's background music to those who don't know) was also fun to listen to and contributed to the humor a lot as well. It had it's soft notes and it's upbeat notes and suited Sakura the most in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs far as I've seen, Shoujo romances have the upper hand in characters and character development so I'm not surprised to admit that Gekkan Shoujo once again had some of the best characters out there. Nozaki, our title character, was dense, but dense in a good way, and it's very tough to explain in writing how that was so, I can only tell you that you will get it once you watch it. In some sort of miracle, his higher than usual denseness made him better as a character. Sakura on the other hand was not only the Moe face of the anime, even her personality had a cute outlook and she developed as well, albiet not as much as you'd expect. I also love how they made Sakura a part of the comedy as well since in many romances I've seen the girls are only used for fanservice-esque comedy (then again, I didn't say ALL), so it was refreshing see Sakura being actively a part of the comedy as well. Huge shout-out to the supporting characters as well, a huge reason I gave it a 10 was because of them as well. Unlike most other romances the supporting cast had their important part to play as well and two of them namely Hori San and Kashima got a lot of screentime as well. Mikorin also got his time to shine. All in all, the characters were what made this anime so amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was a lot of fun watching Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. It's soft and pure comedy was just the cherry on top of the excellent slice of life scenarios that were presented. I never once thought I'd love a shoujo anime as much as I loved Kaichou wa Maid Sama or at least this soon. And I was glad to be wrong, as Gekkan Shoujo was one of cutest romances out there. Sakura is the cutest thing alive as well! Being a genre I tend to overlook, Gekkan Shoujo taught me to avoid this habit and pay more attention to more slice of life anime too. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.4 (Averaged)\\n\\n\r\nI'm totally not surprised I averaged a 9.4 for this. It's obviously one of the purest and most fun anime out there and I'm sure every Shoujo and slice of life fan will enjoy it like I did. A unique story, lovable characters, brilliant soundtrack, breathtaking art all prove that it totally deserves that score. Definitely must try for everyone and definitely one of my top favourite anime as well!\\n\\n\r\nP.S: I already said this, but Sakura is the cutest thing alive <3",

I've never read the manga, I've discovered this anime for pure case, in the recommendation of Gugure! Kokkuri-san, but it was probably one of the best choices in my life.\r\nStory: 8\r\nStory? What story? Gekkan Shoujo is a slice of life, it's plot\u2013less. Well, you may think it's supposed talk about Chiyo and Nozaki-kun's love. Yes, you may think that.\r\nBut forget about it.\r\nThat's as important as panties in hentai.\r\nThere's no plot. Despite this you won't find hard to catch up with the anime's pace. Ittakes you wherever it wants to, and you're there, following all it happens and cheering for poor eternally mangazoned Chiyo.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nSurely it's not something to be amazed by, but it's pretty good. The opening is manga-styled in some parts, with screen-tones, colors and action. Some scenes are ridiculous but what are you expecting? It's Gekkan Shoujo.\\n\r\nThe character design too isn't particularly appealing.\\n\r\nWell, I guess tanukis win over everything. Tanukis and boxes.\\n\r\nOh, and Suzuki. Yes. I think he has the most original character design (no, wait, just kidding here).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nWhile the ost is not outstanding but neither particularly bad (I can dare to say that it's pretty nice sometimes), the opening and the ending are something that I've instantly fell in love with. Particularly the opening song. Its theme is really catchy, so you won't help but love it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not exaggerating.\\n\r\nThose character are probably the best ones I've ever seen on an anime TV. They're not stereotypical, they're meant to mock everything that is common in anime/manga.\\n\r\nNozaki is dense, he's honest and in some ways he resembles (of course, in my opinion) Saitama, from One Punch Man. He loves his work and the way he acts towards his editor is of pure devotion.\\n\r\nChiyo is the forever and ever friendzoned protagonist. She's cute in the way she fails at catching Nozaki's attention. She may seem annoying, with all her Nozaki-kun\", screaming all the way long, but there's worse out there. She may look like that boring heroine from your usual otome game but deep inside, what makes the difference is that she's always failing at her attempts at being noticed, so you can even feel some pity for her.\\n\r\nThen, we get to Mikorin, a totally unusual tsundere, that says hot lines and gets embarrassed by the things he says. I'd really love to add more about Kashima-kun and the theater club's president (forgot his name), but really, they're cool.\\n\r\nReally cool.\\n\r\nThe point is that every character is unique in his own way and that's what makes the difference, what makes me give a full 10 to this.\\n\r\nI've forgot to tell you about Maeno-san. He and his tanuki are the real deal of the anime. And he's voiced by Daisuke Ono. Enough to make him epic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI was crying. I've never laughed so much and I've never re-watched an anime as much as I did with Gekkan Shoujo.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nWatch it. You'll tell me if you liked it.",

            "content": "[Spoiler Free Review!]\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun. If you like comedy anime with a hint of romance, you'll love Nozaki-Kun. This twelve episode series (with 6 small specials) is full of totally unexpected and equally hilarious Japanese humor. In a similar fashion to the great \"Baka To Test\", this anime will leave you in tears of laughter and the end of each episode.\r\nStory: 9\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun does not try to have a complex plot. However, this is exactly why it is deserving of praise. The anime does not try to flesh out romance over a mere 12 episodes but instead focuses on the sitcom-like episodic shorts and,as a result, feels a lot more satisfying to watch.\\n\r\nSomething that Nozaki-Kun manages to do extremely well is that it creates humor without sexual jokes. This anime doesn't rely on cheap, overused, sexual situations and doesn't stray away from the story in order to throw in some panty shots or something.\\n\r\nWhilst the story isn't on the level of multi-season shounens, it does what it was intended to do and it does it damn well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nI'm very critical when it comes to art (partly because I've seen visual beauties like \"Nagi No Asukara\") but Nozaki-Kun's art style sure does its job. The vibrant colors add to the lighthearted feeling of the series and the character designs are all very unique with my personal favorites being Sakura and Seo. The animation in the opening is chaotic and very well done. One feature of the art that really stood out was the design on characters' reaction faces. Somewhat similar to Shaft's \"Nisekoi\", the characters' faces only add to the already existing hilarity of the series.\\n\r\nHowever, there were some scenes that seemed somewhat lazily animated. Sometimes characters would talk and their mouths just seem to move up and down as the only form of animation on screen. Although, that being said, if you're reading subtitles, you're quite unlikely to notice it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun's soundtrack is very diverse and superb. Ranging from typical 'slice of life' upbeat background tracks to dramatic and amusingly over the top orchestral pieces, the soundtrack compliments this anime very well and is very noticeable in places.\\n\r\nThe opening is very catchy with some awesome slap guitar and a male singer, which is a nice change. Although, the ending falls short is very typical and somewhat annoying. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned it earlier on the review but the mix of eclectic characters in this anime is deserving of a 9. They're all very well designed and have their own unique traits. However, the best thing about the way this anime handles characters is that they got the male to female ratio right! Most animes in the genre overload their show with kawaii waifus which, don\u2019t get me wrong, is great but overused, unrealistic and, quite frankly, boring. In Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun, there are a few more male characters than female characters, which is a much better balance than most slice of lifes and makes it a refreshing watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nHilarious, lighthearted, really chill and just overall very enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d definitely recommend Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun. It\u2019s a must watch for anyone who likes slice of life comedies. Whilst the theme of romance is present in the anime, it may disappoint you if you\u2019re looking for a thrilling love story. The rewatch value is great, considering there are no plot twists or anything and you\u2019re pretty likely to forget most of the jokes they use.\\n",

            "content": "\"I've always been your fan!\"\r\nAnd with that simple misunderstanding, this master of comedy begins.\r\nA show that takes the humor of misunderstandings to a whole new level, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun completely surprised me with just how funny it was. Sure, I was expecting it to be funny, but I didn't expect it to make me laugh uncontrollably in the middle of the night, which thus resulted in a fairly long lecture by my mother. A show that can disturb family peace is a 10/10 in my book.\r\nThis show, despite being a typical romcom, has some of the highest quality and most unpredictable comedy that I've everexperienced. Literally anything in this show will be used as a joke in the most creative and hilarious ways. The way the characters misinterpret others, resulting in the most awkward and humorous of situations, is pure gold. This show plastered a smile on my face throughout the entire show. If you want to just laugh your ass off to pure comedy, this show has got you covered.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Some of the most colorful cast of characters ever. They fit so many tropes and fit them perfectly.\\n\r\n- The romance has a lot of potential, and the romantic tension was very well executed.\\n\r\n- Superb skits, slapstick comedy, running gags, character interactions, and just pure hilariousness that will make you laugh out loud like crazy.\\n\r\n- Amazing art and character designs.\\n\r\n- OP is catchy as hell.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Plot? What's that? (Although, that really doesn't matter.)\\n\r\n- In typical short romcom fashion, no serious romance ever happens. (Again, that's not really a problem though.)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nSure, there isn't really any story. But does that matter? This show is basically 12 episodes of skits. The events that unfold are just pure gold. Your sides will literally be sucked into a black hole. The comedy is amazing, diverse, and unpredictable, and will catch you off guard. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe characters are on fleek. Chiyo is absolutely adorable, and each character just looks straight up amazing. The highlights on shoujo manga style was also well expressed. Also, the facial expressions are 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nNot only is the OP super catchy, but the voice actors did a splendid job. They fit their characters perfectly, and pulled of their skits masterfully. This show was basically a sitcom, and the voice actors made the show even funnier with their performances.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThis cast of characters is one of the funniest around. Not only do they fit anime character tropes (such as dense airheads, tsundere characteristics, a bishounen girl, and a girl too scared to pursue her love interest), but they also fill real life character tropes (such as attention whores and people who overthink things). It's rare to find a cast of characters where every character is absolutely lovable, and this show is definitely one of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis show definitely raised my happiness points by over 9000.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nA show I believe that everyone should experience for the enjoyment.\\n",

I found myself smiling, giggling and often laughing out loud at how the comedy was delivered. And the source of my cheeks hurting after smiling so much? Definitely the characters who really are a strong point in this story!\r\nI really enjoyed the way every character was introduced and slowly finding a place in Nozaki-kun's shoujo manga. They are all a source of inspiration for him and ironically, everyone turn to his manga's for life advices and help.\\n\r\nThe cast is full of life and unique in their own quirky way making it easy for viewers to find their own favorite! \\n\r\nEvery character have their own fair share of screen time where they can showcase their bizarre yet hilarious personalities. The amazing cast makes sure there's a lot of space for comedic situations! \\n\\n\r\nThis story creates comedy in the most simplest situations making you laugh at it's absurdity and creativity. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the OST's were very few and were reused many times with variations, I still enjoyed it's light tone. I only wish they had made a little more on that department.\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are no masterpieces but still enjoyable in their own cute way. \\n\\n\r\nI found myself enjoying this one more than what I had anticipated. I can assure you that Gekkan shoujo Nozaki-kun can at least put a smile on your face. Especially the story's cutie -  Sakura will definitely make you smile and feel like \"aaaw\"! \\n\\n",

            "content": "Romance and comedy, without showing any ecchi sounds like an anime that wouldn't be popular, unless done beautifully. This anime showed almost no ecchi and personally, this anime succeeded with flying colours.\r\nRom/com stories are usually the hardest to make, mainly because it can get boring if the jokes aren't funny or the romance isn't working out and people don't like it. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun, did both of those mentioned beautifully. It wasn't boring at all, though I couldn't find much story in the anime, though the jokes made up for it. The story personally didn't drag out a lot, for an anime that doesn't havea lot of story. The comedy in this anime is very random and unexpected and sometimes may leave you laughing or cringing. The romance(s) in the anime isn't too developed, but I think that's for the better. If there is a relationship, then there will always be a breakup. Drama in this anime would have disappointed me, because sometimes it can get annoying. Moving aside, the only story I could dig out of the anime was relationship developments.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty refined and smooth and something about Sakura's facial features remind me of someone. The art is very nice, vibrant and happy. The animation is very smooth, not choppy. I just realised for there are a lot of different types of eye designs in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound section for me is probably the most boring to review, if the OP or ED is mediocre or boring. The only thing I could comment on the anime is the beautiful piano soundtracks that impact the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nI would think that this is the first time to put a full score on characters, because the side or main characters are unique, random and have their own loveable characteristics, such as Seo's carelessness. Nozaki was the dense type of character but he's actually likeable, because he can turn any awkward moment into a funny moment. Sometimes, he can be random and that's why I also like him. Sakura has a massive crush on Nozaki, but everytime she tries to be romantic, it always turns into a funny scene. She is very cute and isn't very needy or selfish, unlike other female characters. She's very kind and gentle to other people, especially people who are her friends. There are also a lot of relationships developing throughout the anime, which is very cute and their relationship is very funny, due to their reactions to each other.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyed this anime a lot, since I would watch it on my phone until 12 am. Damn, sleeping schedules are screwed up. There is never an episode where I wouldn't laugh or even giggle at all, because this anime is too funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a 9/10. The reason it isn't a perfect 10 is because there are a lot of anime which do Rom-com genre and it gets overused. Yes, this anime did it succesfully but if it was a bit more unique, then I would've given it a 10/10. Would I rewatch this? Yes, if I ever want a laugh.\\n",

But, when you're looking for something, sometimes you find something even better. That happened when I started to watch Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. I was looking for some romantic shoujo anime, when I found this title on the list of thesummer anime, a very deceitful title, this anime is a shonen anime. A romantic shounen anime, whithout ecchi, whitout harem. Not only that, this anime have a higher numer of escenes whit the boys, than the number of scenes whith. Also, there are more boys than girls in the casting of characters \u00bfThis is really a shonen anime?\\n\\n\r\nYes, it is. And it's a breaths of fresh air.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows our main girl, Sakura Chiyo. She felt in love whit Nozaki-kun, wich draws shoujo manga. Well, that's basically the entire story, it's a very simple story, but it doesn't need nothing more. It's a school (romantic?) comedy, you can't really expect more from the story, but the plus point on the story it's that, it's simplicity, and the comedic scenes, that allows and facilitates the character development. The characters doesn't need make a boring melodrama to be developed.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the strong point in this anime, beacuse the story isn't really a candidate. However, the characters are perfectly developed. More exactly, the are perfectly characterized. The personalities of every character are completly defined and well done, making every character an another world apart.\\n\\n\r\nBegining with Chiyo, she is not like another main girl in a romantic anime, she isn't sweet, or kind, o depending, a tsundere or another \"-dere\". She is a type of character that you have a million of times but with a fresh touch. She have the basic cualities of another random main girl: She is very femenine, and, obviously, she felt in love. But, the thing that characterizes, it's her freshness and realism. She act like a normal girl would act, that's a think that's more rare that you could imagine.\\n\\n\r\nThen, you have Nozaki, our main boy. He have an special power. Yes, an special power. He can take any random situation of the day and use it in his manga. Also, he use his assistant and friend, Mikorin (Mikoshiba) has model for his main character.\\n\\n\r\nFor Mamiko, the girl one.\\n\\n\r\nGoing on talking about Nozaki, I have to admit, he is not the most original character in the cast, in the way, he is a typical boy who doesn't mind about the girl feelings, even when those are too obvious.\\n\\n\r\nBut, my favorite character is Mikorin. Yes, the Mamiko inspiration. He is a Casanova when he has a girl in his front, but when the girls finaly vanish, he breaths relieved because he has survive. However, he is a very funny character, and one of most unique.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of main characters are, within the main characters, the less important characters. We have \"Lorelai\", Seo Yuzuki, our batch girl with an angelic voice, and it's the most important star in school chorus, and wh have Kashima, the \"prince\", even when she is a girl, Hori-chan-sempai, who cares about Kashima, and Wakamatsu (Waka) who loves chorus' Lorelai, but fears Yuzuki.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about tecnic aspect, begginig with the music, the opening theme it's very catchy, and obviosly composed to be the opening of this anime, the lyrics makes it too obvious. And the ending sung by Chiyo's seiyuu is very catchy too.\\n\r\nAn talking about seiyuus, we have Yuuichi Nakamura (Tomoya, Gray) as Nozaki, Ari Ozawa (Minor roles) as Sakura Chiyo, Okamoto Nobuhiko (Niizuma Eiji, Usui) as Mikorin, Miyuki Sawashiro (One of more expert seiyuu in the cast, and one of my favorites, Ul, Ultear, Kanbaru Suruga,  Celty, Shinko, Saeko), as Yuzuki, Mai Nakahara (Rena Ryuugu, Nagisa Furukawa), as Kashima, Ono Yuuki (Kagami Taiga) as Hori and Kimura Ryouhei (Kodaka, Kise Ryouta) as Wakamatsu.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good, very colorfull and well done, but maybe not awesome. Very good drawn characters and good but simple scenaries, makes a very good art.\\n\\n\r\nFinaly, the most strong pont, was this, the enjoyment. I laught, and I feel the necesity to watch the next chapter. Very good comedy, without any drama.\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nSpanish:\\n\r\n\"Estaba siendo amable conmigo ayer, aunque no es que me guste ni nada de eso...\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Solo necesito verte de inmediato y aprender la verdad, acerca de los principios del mundo... el significado del amor... y las categor\u00edas de la felicidad\"\\n\\n\r\nLyrics del Opening\\n\\n\r\n\u00bfEstad buscando la t\u00edpica historia rom\u00e1ntica y empalagosa?\\n\r\nEn ese caso, \u00bfes este anime lo que busco?\\n\\n\r\nBueno, no realmente. Pero, mientras buscas algo... puede ser que te encuentres algo incluso mejor de lo que buscabas, y ese fue caso con Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun... Estaba buscando alg\u00fan anime rom\u00e1ntico para ver, cuando entonces, en los estrenos de verano encontr\u00e9 el t\u00edtulo de este anime. Nada mas enga\u00f1oso, puesto que este anime no es nada mas alejado del shounen. Un romance shonen, en el que no hay harem, ni ecchi, ni tampoco le hace falta en absoluto, no solo eso, si no que adem\u00e1s hay mas escenas en las que participan los personajes masculinos, que en las que salen las protagonistas femeninas... \u00bfY de verdad es shonen?\\n\\n\r\nSi, lo es. Es un soplo de aire fresco.\\n\\n\r\nLa historia sigue a nuestra protagonista, Sakura Chiyo, la cual cae perdidamente enamorada de Nozaki-kun, el cual dibuja manga en una revista shoujo mensual. La historia es simplona hasta decir basta, y es que adem\u00e1s no le hace falta mas. Es una comedia escolar, realmente no se puede pedir mucho mas, pero lo que realmente da puntos a favor para GS Nozaki-kun, es su desarrollo, apoy\u00e1ndose solo en la comedia, no le hace falta un desarrollo progresivo del romance, ni hacer a los personajes simples para que acaben haciendo un aburrido melodrama. \\n\\n\r\nLos personajes son el punto fuerte de este anime, por que realmente la historia no es un candidato para serlo por su simpleza, sin embargo los personajes est\u00e1n perfectamente desarrollados sin necesidad de que en ning\u00fan momento se centren en ello. Mas concr\u00e9tamente, la personificaci\u00f3n de ellos es absolutamente perfecta. Las personalidades de cada personaje est\u00e1n perfectamente definidas, bien hechas y les hace completamente inconfundibles, haciendo a cada personaje un mundo a parte, empezando por Chiyo, que no se parece en absoluto a cualquier protagonista de un anime rom\u00e1ntico, que es dulce, amable, o dependiendo del caso, tsundere u otro \"-dere\". No, Chiyo es un tipo de personaje que has visto un mill\u00f3n de veces pero con un toque fresco. Aunque tiene las cualidades b\u00e1sicas que podria tener una hero\u00edna cualquiera: es femenina y, obviamente, enamorada. Sin embargo, lo que la caracteriza, es su frescura como personaje, y su realismo. actua como una persona normal (cosa que aunque parezca una tonter\u00eda, es algo bastante raro encontrar un personaje que actue de manera realista).\\n\\n\r\nViendo por el resto de personaje protagonistas, encontramos al chico principal, Nozaki-kun. Pero aunque no lo parezca, tiene un poder especial... y ese es la capacidad de introducir cualquier tipo de situaci\u00f3n aleatoria dentro de su manga, y que incluso quede bien. Adem\u00e1s, usa a nuestro otro chico principal, Mikoshiba (Mikorin), como modelo para Mamiko, la protagonista de su manga. \\n\\n\r\nS\u00ed, usa a un chico como referencia a un chico para la chica protagonista de un manga shoujo. El poder de Nozaki-kun.\\n\\n\r\nAlgo que quiz\u00e1s no es completamente original en su personaje, es su poco tacto en lo referente a los sentimientos de la gente a su alrededor, cayendo un poco en el t\u00f3pico del \"Una chica guapa est\u00e1 enamorada de ti y no te das cuenta\"\\n\\n\r\nDespu\u00e9s, uno de mis personajes favoritos de Gekkan Shoujo es Mikoshiba. Es un Casanova cuando est\u00e1 frente a las chicas, pero cuando estas ya se han ido, felices de haber hablado con el bishounen del instituto, Mikoshiba sopla aliviado por haber sobrevivido a ello. Es un personaje realmente gracioso y \u00fanico en muchos sentidos, igual que el resto de los personajes, pero a mi gusto, Mikorin es el que mas.\\n\\n\r\nEl resto de personajes principales, son, dentro de los principales, los mas secundario. Tenemos a \"Lorelai\", Seo Yuzuki. Es la tipica marimacho, pero que canta en el coro con una voz angelical. Despu\u00e9s, a Kashima, el \"principe\", a pesar de ser una chica, a Hori-chan-sempai, el que mantiene a ralla a Kashima, a Wakamatsu, el fan incondicional de Lorelei, pero que teme a Yuzuki, sin saber que ambas son la misma persona, siendo este (Wakamatsu) el personaje mas especialmente inocente del anime.\\n\\n\r\nHablando del apartado t\u00e9cnico, empezando por m\u00fasica, el Opening me ha gustado especialmente, con una letra que hace que sea obvio que la canci\u00f3n fue compuesta para ser el Opening de este anime, pegadiza y con buen ritmo, y con un Ending cantado por la seiyuu de Chiyo Sakura, nuestra protagonista, tambi\u00e9n muy pegadizo.\\n\\n\r\nDespu\u00e9s, hablando de seiyus, tenemos a Yuuichi Nakamura (Tomoya, Gray) haciendo el papel de Nozaki, Ari Ozawa (Roles menores) haciendo de Sakura Chiyo, Okamoto Nobuhiko (Niizuma Eiji, Usui) como Mikorin, Miyuki Sawashiro (De las mas expertas entre el reparto, Ul, Ultear, Kanbaru Suruga,  Celty, Shinko, Saeko), como Yuzuki, Mai Nakahara (Rena Ryuugu, Nagisa Furukawa), como Kashima, Ono Yuuki (Kagami Taiga) como Hori y Kimura Ryouhei (Kodaka, Kise Ryouta) como Wakamatsu.\\n\\n\r\nDespu\u00e9s, la animaci\u00f3n es bastante buena, muy colorida y bastante bien hecha, sin ser especialmente elaborada, de todas formas estuvo muy bien hecha, con los perosonajes bien dibujados, sin cambiar el dise\u00f1o original del manga.\\n\\n\r\nAun as\u00ed, lo que brill\u00f3 sobre todo en este anime, fu\u00e9 la diversi\u00f3n. Me hizo reir a carcajadas y otras veces estar pendiente por ver que pasar\u00e1 continuaci\u00f3n, aunque esta mas raramente, puesto que brilla mas la comedia y las risas, que el drama, el cual casi completamente nulo en este anime.",

They do stupid things but the show is not stupid at all. The overall story seemed superficial but they made it in a way where you can look at things differently. It's very interesting not to mention funny. I was only planning to watch a few episodes but I kept wanting more and ended up finishing the whole series in one night.\r\nPlus points also for the art and for Nozaki-kun's voice. It matched reallywell his personality, and to think that it was also the voice of Dotachin from Durarara, more plus plus points. :)) \\n\\n\r\nI also liked Sakura's personality which isn't very whiny. Actually, I loved everyone from the show. They've all got really unique and interesting personalities. Not to mention they're all kind of stupidly funny. The thing about girls ending up as boys and vice versa in manga is also very cool. Haha. I hope there will be more of this anime in the future.",

            "content": "Review of Monthly Girl\u2019s Nozaki-kun \r\nMonthly Girl\u2019s Nozaki-kun (Gekkan Sh\u014djo Nozaki-kun) is a romantic comedy anime adapted from the manga of the same name. The studio behind it is Dogakobo, who have also done Majestic Prince and other shows. The director was Mitsue Yamazaki and the music by Yukari Hashimoto. The manga is published Square Enix in Gangan Online and is currently still running.\r\nThe show revolves around the relationship (or lack of) our main two protagonists: Chiyo Sakura and Umetar\u014d Nozaki. Sakura one day confesses her love for Nozaki, however he mistakes her as his fan and gives her his autograph, and she then triesto tell him that she wants to be with him forever. Nozaki takes this the wrong way and takes her to his house where he tells her that he is actually the mangaka for a Sh\u014djo series called Let\u2019s Fall in Love. He then enlists her help as an assistant which Sakura takes to try and get closer to him.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is simple but entertaining. Each episode is pretty episodic however still follows the overall plot of the show, Sakura trying to get Nozaki to notice her love for him. All the episodes revolve around Sakura helping Nozaki with his manga or helping him find inspiration for it. There are many reoccurring side characters in the show that either provide inspiration or help Nozaki with his manga. The plotlines are very well done and the comedy hits the mark. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters in the show and it can feel a bit overwhelming. Each either helps Nozaki with the manga or provides inspiration for characters. Each character has their own story which adds to show, giving us the viewer a reason to care for them and like them. But since there is such a big cast sometimes characters felt a little under developed even with this. However when it comes to them being on screen they were well voice acted and very likeable. The main two protagonists Sakura and Nozaki were well crafted. Sakura was cheerful, bubbly and caring whilst Nozaki was stern but eccentric. They both complimented each other. However as the series got on it was easy to tell what the reactions and actions were going to be. The character designs suited the show but nothing revolutionary.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good. It was fluid when it needed to be and very colourful. The series involved a lot of talking so the animation didn\u2019t need to be balls to the walls epic, but it was still good. The animations on the opening and ending were also good and captured what the show was about. \\n\\n\r\nThe music fitted the show but it was not outstanding. It was cutesy and it helped with comedic effect when needed. The opening did a good job drawing you in and the ending was nice and cutesy fitting the show. However overall the music was good and did its job. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the Monthly Girl\u2019s Nozaki-kun is a nice, sweet romantic comedy which doesn\u2019t fail to make you laugh or put a smile on your face. I would definitely recommend it if you need a break from the more serious anime out there. The show is incomplete as it ended with an opening for another season. At the moment there has been no announcement of a second season but take that how you may. Overall I found this show very entertaining and a good escape. It is currently licensed by Sentai Filmworks and is available on Crunchyroll for streaming. I will leave a link and if you want you can sign up to a two week free trial of Crunchyroll to watch Monthly Girl\u2019s Nozaki-kun in HD with no ads. Thank you for reading my review and till next time sayonara! \\n",

But the originality of each character is what makes this anime so amusing and enjoyable... each of them seem to be constructed in order to break an anime/manga stereotype in which people tend to categorize them. \\n\\n\r\nNozaki is an anime about how you can't judge a book by it's cover. Each character Sakura (female lead) meets each episode, including Nozaki itself, prove to be the polar opposite of what she expects them to be.  The cool silent guy is actually silly and brainless, the 'bad boy' is actually a shy whiny boy, the pretty girl with a delicate voice is actually aggresive and self-centered,... and so on. \\n\r\nAnd that's what makes the experience so enjoyable and relatable. I believe i'm not the only one who feels related to one or two of this characters. You won't find mary sues here, but characters making fun of their quirks and flaws. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy character-driven comedy don't miss out on this one!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Comedy is a very difficult thing to pull off in anime, I find.  When you make a comedy series, you have to keep in mind certain qualities that are known to either make, or break any sort of comedy related series.  When you mix it incorrectly, you get a pile of forced crap.  But, when you get that perfect combination, you make gold.  And that gold from the 2014 summer season, was Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun.\r\nStory (8.23/10): The story of Nozaki-kun, as I call it, is rather simple.  A girl by the name of Sakura Chiyo has a crush on thisguy in her class named Nozaki.  Having been in love with him for a few months now, (for reasons I will never understand completely), she finally musters up the courage to try and confess her love in the most Shoujo way imaginable.  (Which is basically an empty classroom scene with the sun setting behind them.)  Upon screwing up the words of what she was going to say, she finds out that Nozaki, the guy she is in love with, is actually a Shoujo manga writer and well...things happen.  \\n\\n\r\nAs I had mentioned before, comedy in anime needs to have certain elements in order to be successful in any way shape or form.  One of those elements is to have jokes and gags that just roll off of the story's plot.  If a series feels like it's trying to be funny, then it really isn't in reality.  This series succeeds in branding its own form of comedy and for pretty much the entirety of the show, rolls off its jokes rather well.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show itself doesn't have a very complicated plot.  You can sum it up with a bunch of friends from all over talking and interacting with each other, whilst making fun of any generic shoujo scene in existence.  Nozaki-kun excels at doing this.  It wil take any scene from a shoujo, (let's say a girl riding on back of the guy's bike), and turn it into something else, not only changing what the feeling or emotion of the scene, but also making it unusual whilst also making it hilarious at the same time. (Have a 2-manned bike.)  \\n\\n\r\nThere are however a few downfalls I see with the series.  The first being the whole \"romantic subplot\" between the main two characters, Nozaki and Sakura.  While personally, I do find it cute that there is this adorable girl who swoons for a guy who only sees her as free labor, there really isn't much substance to it as it is clear from the very beginning that this guy cares only for his work, and nothing really else.  The subplot wasn't bad by any means since the other main characters in the series get shipping partners (for the most part), it just didn't feel as needed or required for the series, since it wasn't really the main focus.  In addition, the series had flaws with character introductions.  There are 7 main characters in the series.  The show shows about 4 of them in the first two episodes, then forgets about them to make room for more, then gets rid of them to add in the last one, before sort of cycling them through in terms of focus.  See the problem here?  The show I feel doesn't utilize its characters as much as it could've been.  Don't get me wrong, the places where certain characters show up is gold, but I felt throughout the series that certain characters were lacking some screentime compared to others.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the show is really just good fun.  The pacing is decent enough, there are plenty of memorable scenes in the series itself that you can LOL at, and the show is just all around enjoyable.  Personally, I don't like the ending because in all seriousness, I want more of this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\n+  Fantastic comedy\\n\r\n+  Simple plot idea (to make room for the funnys, of course)\\n\r\n+  Good pacing\\n\r\n-   Somewhat unessecary romantic subplot (very minor problem really)\\n\r\n-   Didn't utilize characters as much as it could've\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9.00/10):  Alright, now we're getting to the best part of the show.  In addition to easy flowing comedy, a comedy series must have memorable characters.  The characters must be independent in that they have their own quirks and personalities that make them unique from any other.  \\n\\n\r\nNozaki Umetaro, or simply Nozaki, is our sort of \"main character\" in this show apart from Sakura.  As a character, he's rather bland in the sense that he speaks with little emotion, he always has a straight face, and doesn't really have any sort of hobbies.  That is, unless you're talking about manga, which in any scene, sparks a hilarious amount of reaction from him.  Nozaki is a character who is very focused on his work, even to the point that he gets excited over certain events and holidays just because he might be able to fit a similar sort of event into a chapter of his manga.  He's quite an interesting character due to the amount of contrast he actually has.  (I respect this guy for what he does.)\\n\\n\r\nSakura Chiyo, or simply Sakura as she's called in the series.  (Honestly, I don't know which one's her first name.)  Sakura is a very smitten girl.  She's very dedicated to her crush and enjoys spending time with him and understanding more about who he is as a person, whilst getting dragged into hilarious scenes where she is asked for her opinion on a certain manuscript page which always ends in comedy.  Personally, I find Sakura to be an adorable character due to her character design and her reactions to the amount of situations that occur within the series.  (This is Higurashi Rena level of adorableness where you want to take the cute thing home.)\\n\\n\r\nAside from these two characters that are in every episode, we have the rest of the main cast featuring various hilariously inverted troupes of different Shoujo steryotypes.  Kashima, the \"prince of the school\" (who's also a girl), Yuzuki, the \"best singer ever\" (who is rather brash and lacking common sense), Wakamatsu (who is introduced way later than he should be), Hori, and my personal favorite, MIKORIN!  (Who behaves exactly like a shoujo heroine, hilariously.  And yes, I do call him Mikorin, not Mikoshiba.  Don't judge me.)\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes these main characters memorable is not only the nice twist that they have in terms of Shoujo manga character twists, but also because each of them have their own character and resonate each other well rather than require another character in order to get their personality from.  They're all independent, and that's what makes these characters memorable.  On the flipside however, there are a few problems.  The most noticeable one is the lack of character use.  These characters are fantastic, that much is true.  It's just that they're not used as much as they could be.  Every episode focuses on a duo of characters aside from Sakura and Nozaki, shoving all the others into the \"save you for the next one\" category which I really see as lost potential.  (Hell, Wakamatsu doesn't show up till 2/3 of the series is over.)  In fact, you don't even get to see all of the characters in one place until the very last episode, and even then they're not in the same frame.  \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters of this series are interesting as there are more main characters than there are side.  All 3 of them don't serve too much in terms of actual story development, but rather get their own sort of 4-koma esque story where we get these little insights as to who these characters are with a little short side story (usually involving tanukis) at the beginning before the opening scene.  They suffer the same problem as not getting as used as they could've been, but for what we did get out of them, they were quite entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  VERY memorable main cast\\n\r\n+  Sakura   :)\\n\r\n+  Decent soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment (9.21/10):  If the fanboying over the flowing comedy of this show, the hilarious artwork, and the sheer love for Sakura herself wasn't enough to state my personal opinion, well, here it is.  Gekkan-Shoujo Nozaki-kun.  I wasn't really expecting too much from it at the start cause it looked to be a Bakuman sort of show since it involved romance (kind-of), and a mangaka.  And boy, was I glad to be wrong.  Nozaki-kun was a very enjoyable show for me.  The flawless comedy made me laugh at every moment due to how comedically executed they were, the characters themselves were fantastic and memorable, and I finally had a character that I would go gay for.  (We all have those, I'm sure.)  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like it?\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely.  It was a great kickback show that didn't have a serious plot, staying true to its nature by just being pure comedy all the way through.  Nothing turned stale whilst watching the show, and every episode gave a new comedic experience.\\n\\n\r\nIs there anything I didn't like?\\n\\n\r\nWell for one thing, MAENO!  (Hate him as much as kyubey.)  Wakamatsu himself didn't get many appearances, which was a shame since he was a part of the main cast and played a unique role.  In addition, the ending was a bit more cliched than I would've liked, but, it's livable.  (It would've been better if this didn't end because I haven't seen a comedy gold series since GJ-bu.)\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it?\\n\\n\r\nYES.  Absolutely yes.  This show might not appeal to everyone, but it's at least worth a try to watch.  It has a very unique brand of \"deconstruction comedy\" where it takes a normal anime/manga genre, and uses the stereotypes from that genre to make scenes of comedy and hilarity from it.  (Noucome does a similar thing for the harem genre)  It should at least be given a try because it has a lot of good qualities about it and it does have a lot of positive feedback from its viewers.  If you're looking for a good comedy series, this one will fit the bill.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: (8.88/10)",

            "content": "Well, disappointment. If I had to chose 1 word, it would be disappointment. This anime started well, presenting us a fresh anime with likeable characters but it soon fall off into repetition leading us to no where. \r\nWhere is the rest ? Is that it ? What about the others? Were the questions left behind without an answer.  \r\nGekkan Shoujo is a anime that thrives only on comedy and apparently tries to make some romance, unfortunately such thing is non-existent. \r\nStory: 6/10.  Well, the concept was fine, a bunch of guys working on a shoujo manga helping out his friend (Nozaki) when allof a sudden Chiyo appears. A lovely girl who loves Nozaki and when she tries to tell him that she loves him, she ends up at his house helping him with the manga as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing is.. where is the setup? Where is the plot line? We literally don\u00b4t have anything more than that. A group of people working on manga. The romance created isn\u00b4t developed.. neither the story moves on. We end up like we started.. It was the first anime that i watched and did not had any kind of plot line.. and it went terribly wrong for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that is left, is the comedy. At least the comedy was good, otherwise this rate would be way worst. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending is not satisfying at all. I wanted something to happen, i wanted some emotion attached to this anime but they don\u00b4t even try. No cliffhangers or something like that, no proper ending, we don\u00b4t have nothing. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. Well at least the anime looks really nice. I personally loved each character design, which is rare. Taking out some minor flaws (like Chiyo's hair cut) the rest is fine. Nice backgrounds, nice movements.. nice art overall. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10. Great opening.. really great opening. I loved it. Cool, fresh, funny, the clip was awesome.. The rest is meh though. I watched it 2 days ago but i don\u00b4t remember anything from the OST. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10. Well .. where are they? Really where are they? Matching up with the lack of plot line, the characters were at least useless to the plot. If we took out the main character, Chiyo Sakura, the anime would remain the same. I mean we could took out every single character except Nozaki, replace them with some others characters that it wouldn\u00b4t make a difference. They are useless .. this show thrives on comedy, so they don\u00b4t care about character develop or anything like that, they just wanted them to be funny, and don\u00b4t get me wrong, they are funny but .. i wasn\u00b4t looking for this. Comedy has limits. \\n\\n\r\nBeing one dimensional, the characters are as interesting as a rock. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10. I just didn\u00b4t give it a worst rate because I still enjoyed it. The comedy was still funny and saved this anime from a 4/10 or something ..\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of an ending was the biggest problem. We don\u00b4t see anything being resolved .. I don\u00b4t tell you more because i would be spoiling but i think you got the point. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Even though it was bad for me , i still reccomend it. I know that I can be a little bit \"bad\" with comedy anime sometimes but I do realize that the majority of you loves more comedy than I do, and I think that's why the anime has the rate it has. If you want some good laughs .. YES WATCH IT. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are like me .. if you want some romance, if you want a STORY, then look out for other anime.",

            "content": "Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun sort of left me a little disappointed at first. I was suggested to this anime as a romance, which was a problem, since after finishing this anime, I can barely even consider it one. But this doesn't mean that I didn't like this anime. I am mostly a romance-anime watcher, and usually no romance is a bit turn off for me with an anime. Despite this, I actually really enjoyed this anime. If you are looking for a good romance anime- this show it NOT for you! But comedy-wise, this anime does not fail to serve, and is where it shines themost.\\n\r\nPlot- 8/10\\n\r\nI wouldn't really say that Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun really had a plot. It more of took an episodic approach, with a new character being introduced, or situation occurring each episode. I don't always like this kind of style, but I think that it flowed nicely with Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. \\n\r\nThe story starts off with Sakura Chiyo, confessing her love to her crush, Nozaki Umetar\u014d, a manga writer. Nozaki, being oblivious to this, thinks of Sakura as his biggest fan, and thus she becomes his co-worker helping him out with his manga. Now get used to situations like this, because that's going to be one of the main themes occurring through out this anime. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is a rom-com, and as a comedy, I think it's amazing! I don't really watch too many comedies, but I found myself laughing pretty hard during this anime. The only thing that I'd really want to see in this anime is some romance! I mean, it IS a ROM-com. I guess being mainly a romance watcher I will be a little biased towards that, but a little bit of romantic development wouldn't hurt... right? \\n\r\nThe anime's comedy focuses mainly on each of the characters fails with romance, and because of that, there is no romantic development between any of the characters. But as stated before, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is a comedy, and this serves as great comedic relief. If anything, I'd consider Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun as a parody to most shoujo anime today.\\n\r\nArt/Sound- 9/10\\n\r\nThe art/animation is very appealing. I can't really find much fault in it, but I wouldn't consider it a masterpiece. The sound falls into the same category. Nothing too special, but the background music is pleasant. I did find myself really liking the opening theme, which has become one of my favorite anime openings. It's different from most ops I've heard, so it's unique in that aspect meanwhile being extremely catchy. I never skipped over it once and I always find the tune stuck in my head.\\n\r\nCharacter- 10/10\\n\r\nEnough gushing about the opening theme, time to move onto the category where Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun strives the most, character. Each of these characters are unique, and together create amazing comedy and hilarious scenarios. As Sakura helps Nozaki with his manga, she meets the other people helping him out. None of these characters really represent an anime stereotype which is refreshing in a sense. (Well, I guess you could consider Mikoshiba a male tsundere, but still.)\\n\r\nYou have Sakura and Nozaki, the main pair throughout this show. Sakura is about as blunt as you can get with her feelings for Nozaki, even all of the other characters catch on while Nozaki, being oblivious as ever, still can't catch a hint, despite being a shoujo manga writer. This creates hilarious situations between the two, but can be a little frustrating at times. Nozaki's personality and complete innocence really makes most of the comedy and can be hilarious at times. His innocence can be a bit unrealistic, but I still find it cute and funny. \\n\r\nNow I'm not going to go over each of the characters, but the cast of Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is really what makes this show. Since this anime's plot is practically non-existent, it focuses on the interactions of these characters and the antics that occur between them while helping with Nozaki's manga. All of these characters are very likeable, and I love to see them interact with each other and the amusing situations that they create together. \\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10\\n\r\nWell, most reviews that I write are usually based off of anime that I enjoy... so a 10/10 was sort of a given. I was a little bit disappointed with the romance aspect of this anime, but the comedy more than makes up for it.\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10\\n\r\nAveraging up all of the scores comes to a 9.2, or a 9. I really enjoyed watching this anime, despite not being what I had expected. I've actually heard of this anime for a while now, and I'm glad that I finally decided to give it a chance. I'm not a big manga reader, but this is the second anime that has gotten me to start reading the manga (Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun, and now also Ouran High School Host Club) and that really says something enjoyment-wise. I would recommend this anime to anyone, really. Even mostly romance watchers. I'm hoping for a season two sometime in the near future, since so far I'm enjoying the anime more than the manga. The way this anime executes its characters is perfect, which creates a pleasant and heart-warming anime that is worth a watch for anyone looking for a good laugh.",

            "content": "I am a big fan of the manga so when the anime came out I was really excited. This is very different from the normal Shoujo anime. If you are looking for an anime in which the story revolve around love then this anime is not for you. It is worth watching though.\r\nStory: 10/ 10\r\nBasically, the story is about Chiyo trying to get closer to her crush Nozaki-kun, who is completely oblivious about her feelings.  So every time she does something *romantic* it always failed and ended up in those hilarious moments. So her should be colorful ala shoujo manga love life turnedinto those funny moments.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is great. In anime they often show a manga which Nozaki made and it's just amazing how they made it look like as if we are really reading the manga as if they are not in anime and the characters are really good looking.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nAlthough I am not a fan of the opening theme, it's not so bad that I will want to skip it. I love the sound effects that they used especially during the funny scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nI think what made this anime great are the characters. It just doesn't revolve around the two main characters, each characters have their own funny moments that even if they don't show the main characters you will not be bored or feel that something is missing. It's impossible not to love each one of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I will rate it as 9/10\\n\r\nI couldn't rate it 10 because for some reason something in the anime is missing. I don't know what it is  but I find the manga more entertaining or funnier.  It didn't give me the same feeling that the manga did. But still it's definitely one of the best! I love the special episodes too (^_^)",

            "content": "This is a grand example of how to make an anime without sexualizing the female characters. Seriously, why can't this be the norm in the anime industry? No Fanservice is just the tip of the iceberg. There are multiple reasons why I love this \"Romantic\" Comedy show. \r\n\"My name is Chiyo Sakura, 16 years old. I asked out the boy that I like, and he gave me his autograph.\" -Chiyo Sakura\r\n[Story]\r\nHigh School student Chiyo Sakura has a crash on her classmate Umetarou Nozaki, who turns out to be a shoujo manga artist under the pen name Sakiko Yumeno. Sakura eventually agrees to be his assistantto try and get close to him. From there on, they met other students who will serve as \"models\" for his characters in his story. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime does not have a romantic story nor does it have a romantic progression between the 2 characters. Is that a bad thing? For most romantic animes, of course. But..for Gekkan Shoujou, it's not. The Romance isn't even the focus in the series, thus you shouldn't watch this show for the romance. Gekkan Shoujou is more of a Parody/Comedy. It makes fun of cliches that you usually see in Romantic Comedy shows. For example, there was a scene (I think it was Ep. 9) where Sakura and Nozaki were walking home together with 1 umbrella because it was raining. This is known as the \"rainy day\" cliche. A perfect moment for the 2 characters to get even closer...literally. In here, they deconstructed all the romantic moments that usually happens when a \"rainy day\" cliche occurs and straight up makes fun of them. Like how Sakura forgot her umbrella even though she knew the chances of raining is 100%. In a regular romantic situation, Nozaki would be a gentlemen by sharing his umbrella with her but wrong! He also forgot his umbrella. Another example is Sakura walking too close to the road so Nozaki switched sides with her. In a regular romantic situation, Nozaki switched sides so he would be splashed should a car pass by and thus, preventing Sakura from getting wet. How romantic! In here, they still both got wet. Watching the 2 scenes I mentioned above is way funnier than reading it of some guy's review.   \\n\r\nThe episode is just one hilarious scene after another. There are a lot more examples that I could provide but that will mean another paragraph or 2. \\n\r\nTo make things short, if you know all the cliches in a Romantic Comedy show then the chances of you getting the jokes here are high...Very High. \\n\\n\r\nI'm a big fan of romance and I hate it when the characters in a Romantic show don't get together just because of certain issues or something. Does that mean I hate this show? No! Definitely not! While the show lacks romance, the comedy is just on another level. The show is hilarious and it had me in tears from time to time due to how extremely funny some of the scenes are. This is one of, if not, the funniest show that I have ever watched. I know what you're going to say Gintama and OPM fans so just stop. \\n\\n\r\nComedy aside, you'll also learn a bit on how manga's are made even though that isn't the focus of the show. If you want to be a manga author then go watch this and knock yourself out, I guess. Maybe you'll learn a thing or two..\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (8/10)\\n\r\nThe Animation isn't really one of the best but it does hold up on its own. Their other works like Yuru Yuri didn't really have the best animation so I wasn't surprised that the animation for Gekkan Shoujou isn't one of the best either. The character design does look great though and some of the character designs really fooled me. For example, Yuu Kashima. They were obviously intentional. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is what you'd expect from a \"Romantic\"-Comedy show. Though, there's that one soundtrack that felt really familiar. I'm talking about the soundtrack that played in the first 10 seconds of the first episode. That soundtrack also played throughout the show. I can't remember where I heard it but I'm sure I've heard of it before. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is Kimi ja Nakya Dame Mitai\" by Masayoshi Ooishi and the ED theme song is Ura Omote Fortune\" by Chiyo Sakura. Hands down, Gekkan Shoujou has one of the best OP theme songs that I have ever heard. It sounds great, it sounds funky and it's catchy as hell. I like the ED theme song because of the constant use of the word \"Hentai\". Just in case anyone takes my last sentence seriously and thinks I'm deaf/stupid..I'm joking. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9.5/10) \\n\r\nRule number one of creating comedy shows is to have a great cast of characters that are likable and hilarious. Gekkan Shoujou followed that rule and we got ourselves a bunch of characters that have a unique personalities, are likable and they are each hilarious in their own ways. \\n\\n\r\nFirstly, we have the main protagonist of the series or at least, I think she is..Sakura Chiyo. A high school girl who proposed to a high school guy but instead got his autograph. She's a cheerful young girl and is often annoyed/surprised at her friend's odd personality but she still remains their friends regardless. I like her character. Her reactions to Nozaki's actions and to her friend's weird actions are hilarious and I like watching her attempts to get closer to Nozaki fail multiple times. Then there's Nozaki Umetarou, a talented shoujou manga artist. Nozaki is one of the biggest troll I have ever seen. Seriously, this guy is so dense and by dense, I mean hilariously dense and not those stupid ass protagonists on other Rom-Com/Harem shows. This guy is a creator of a Shoujou Manga but ironically, he's not even great in real-life romance. If he is then he would have gotten together with Sakura a lot sooner. Just watching him not noticing Sakura's feelings is just extremely hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Mikoto Mikoshiba, His knowledge of communicating to girls were all gathered from a Visual Novel that he plays. This is due to the fact that he's embarrassed and shy most of the time. He's also the supposed \"heroine\" of the series.  Then there's Yuu Kashima, a high school boy...*Ahem* I mean, a high school girl surrounded by fangirls. Her interactions with that male Senpai always and I mean always cracks me up. Especially that scene where she puts on a horse mask..I mean, a bull mask. Last but not least is Yuzuki Seo, a \"perfect\" high school girl who is \"considerate\"of others, \"cares\" for others and can \"easily read\" situations around her. She's basically a \"perfect chick\". She's so \"perfect\" that \"everyone\" asks for her \"help\" if they ever needed one. Notice the quotes? She also has the best singing voice in the entire school. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has a non-existent relationship development. So what does that tell you? That's right, an almost non-existent character development. The characters stay almost the same throughout the show and they didn't go through heavy changes in 12 episodes. I said 'almost'...twice...because there is a tiny bit of development but I wouldn't be surprised if you don't spot those tiny changes.\\n\r\n_________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe first episode was extremely cliche and boring, hence the reason why I decided to put the show on hold for like 2 weeks. I decided to re-watch the first episode and moved on to the 2nd episode quickly because I wanted to just get it over with. When I watched the 2nd episode, I was shocked. It had me in tears and by tears, I mean I was laughing my guts out. As the show progressed, each episode made me laugh so hard that I completely ignored the romance part of the show. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Gekkan Shoujou Nozaki-kun\" or \"Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun\" (in English) is one of -- if not -- the funniest anime that I have ever watched. It deconstructs the Rom-Com cliches that you mainly see in Rom-Com shows and makes those clich\u00e8s even funnier. If you're a fan of comedy shows or if you want to see a show tear apart a Rom-Com tropes and cliches then this is for you. If you don't care about the comedy and you want some romance then this is not the show for you. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Top-Notch Comedy\\n\r\n+Deconstructs the Romantic Comedy genre and uses the tropes and cliches as a joke\\n\r\n+Great Character Designs\\n\r\n+Well-Done Soundtrack\\n\r\n+One of the best funky OP theme song\\n\r\n+Great casts of characters\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-This series is not for everyone, especially to the viewers who wants to see Romance. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019m very wary when it comes to romance anime. These days, it\u2019s difficult to find anime of this category that break the mold, many of them coming off (In my opinion) cringe-worthy and generic. I admit that I had the same doubts before watching this anime, but due to its interesting premise, I decided to give it a go. And boy, was this worth my time.\r\n\tThe story revolves around Sakura Chiyo and how her feelings towards the boy she likes, Nozaki Umetarou, are misinterpreted. She eventually discovers that he is a famous shoujo mangaka, and in an attempt to get closer to him, she becomeshis assistant. A comedic premise, indeed, though one I believed difficult to follow up and build on. After finishing the first episode, I was entertained, but concerned about how repetitive the series might get. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The series doesn\u2019t hesitate to make fun of typical shoujo stereotypes and tropes, often leading the user by the nose then hitting them with a twist.\\n\\n\r\n\tAs the show goes on, more and more characters are introduced, all of them unique and entertaining in their own way. They come off stereotypic at first, but don\u2019t be fooled: many of them have a flawed, comedic side to them. Some are, in fact, combinations of shoujo character tropes which are normally not seen together. For example, one of the major characters is a combination of a tomboy and a clueless airhead. What makes the show entertaining is the strange chemistry between them all, and how their differences can turn the simplest of events into something hilarious.\\n\\n\r\n\tLet\u2019s not forget, however, our main duo. Nozaki is a clueless individual who appears to have no idea regarding how life works at times. His oblivious and bizarre reactions to Sakura\u2019s feelings is a running gag throughout the show. Mind you, it does get tiring and frustrating at times (especially the ending), but for the most part, it keeps the show going. It\u2019s enjoyable to see how his experiences with the other characters contribute to the manga series he is writing. Sakura, on the other hand, is a bright, cheerful individual, and was personally my favourite character throughout the whole show. Her character is different from the typical romance protagonist: she isn\u2019t clueless or hesitant to attempt to express her feelings towards Nozaki. Her failed predictions as to how Nozaki will react to her actions break many typical romance anime tropes. Overall, I enjoyed her character very much.\\n\\n\r\n\tDespite all these comedic interactions between characters, the story remains somewhat linear. One is aware that time is passing as the episodes go on, unlike many comedy series nowadays. However, the romance in the show does not develop very much by the end, which may disappoint some. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe art in the show is very clean and well-drawn. Each of the characters has a distinguished look, and there is no fanservice in the show, from what I recall. The expressions are hilariously drawn, especially Sakura\u2019s reactions after her attempts to convey her feelings fail. \\n\\n\r\n\tOne of the most enjoyable things for me was the OST. The music was very fitting throughout the whole show, adding to the atmosphere of each scene. The OP and ED are pleasant songs which are definitely worth a listen. The opening is a colorful display of each of the characters present in the show, and is very catchy. The ending is a cute, colorful tune with still shots of Sakura. Sung by her voice actor, it represents her personality very well. Throughout these 12 episodes, I\u2019ve only skipped the opening once or twice, and have not skipped the ending at all.\\n\\n\r\n\tOverall, Gekkan-Shoujo Nozaki-kun was an enjoyable series, one that almost seems to parody the romance genre. It\u2019s unpredictable yet somewhat linear, with dynamic characters and an interesting premise which is carried out well. This is a show aimed for both male and female audiences, and one that you should definitely check out.\\n",

            "content": "*SPOILER ALERT*\r\nI watched this awhile back so I will keep this review short and sweet. This is probably the BEST anime I've watched in a while! It was the best because it's unlike anything and everything I've watched in the post. I honestly loved the characterization of all characters. Each character is loveable in his/her own unique way. So why exactly is this anime SO HILARIOUS (to the point of tears)? Nozaki's insensitivity towards Sakura's feelings, Sakura's delusional fantasies, Mikori's feminine qualities and easily-embarrased personality, Seo's BLUNTNESS AND INSENSITIVITY, Kashima's manly charm, Hori's maturity...all in all, this is a great anime, guys. Plus I absolutelyadore the satirical nature of the anime. This anime mocks the typical shoujo anime. And it's HILARIOUS. WOULD DEFINITELY REWATCH IT AND RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE FOR SURE! Though I would probably only recommend this to shoujo anime VETERANS because a newbie to anime probably wouldn't get the funny/satirical scenes :/ I loved this anime. So many funny moments that I don't know which one to NAME! They are all unique in their own way. I cherish every single episode. Usually I skip the \"boring\" parts..but for this anime? Not only did I NOT skip anything, but I also REWATCHED numerous parts NUMEROUS times. That should tell you how good this anime is. Some funny parts include: when Hori teaches Mikorin how to be a proper \"maid\", when Mikorin stays over at Nozaku's place to play otome games, when Nozaku bikes with Chiyo, the ending (when Nozaku tells Chiyo that he loves the fireworks...puahahahahahah)...this anime is embedded with countless priceless and hilarious moments. In fact, the anime itself is a huge joke, and this is precisely why I LOVE THIS ANIME SO MUCH! 10/10 for its novelty. Never have I watched any anime like this. AWESOME! Super unconventional--- TOTALLY my type of anime!",

This guy is your typical \"i kinda like this guy, but right now i'm already in love with another guy so you can't proceed in my heart. BUT ACTUALLY I WANT YOU TO!\" kind of crush. Not to mention his overwhelming popularity(if exposed). And im not even talking abouthis talent. And Money.\\n\r\nA tall, cool, handsome guy, with stable financial and nation-class popularity, plus bountiful amount of talents.\\n\r\nBut what about his social skills? love experience? friends' quality? 'what women want and need' quality? His 'etc' skills? LESS THAN ZERO.\\n\r\nClumsy, klutz, insensitive, misunderstandful-mind, and cant go out of his mangaka's world. This guy will take your time just for you to figure out about him. And even if you spend a day just to figure his traits out, you might not even reach 20% of conclusion about him.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Sakura Chiyo is his perfect prey. This girl is your typical 'Shoujo Anime Heroine' brought to Shounen Manga. Cute, small, yet-specified 3size, loveable, and never giving up on love. Classic girl who (un)fortunately took the wrong train on the first day of school's opening ceremony and happen to met Nozaki-by fate. The rest is a cliche.\\n\r\nOR IS IT?\\n\r\nNope. She also has handy artsy skills and with good fate, her 'line' crossed again against Nozaki. So she became one of his assistant. And this is what we'll enjoy in the series.\\n\r\nAnd if you worry about another character's development in this anime, never worry. GSNK has 7 Main Character and some important supporting with well distributed screen time. This series has merciless ammunition of extra-ordinary character.\\n\r\nThe-anything but good girl- 'Lorelei' Seo Yuzuki\\n\r\nThe-pain in the ass prince- 'Mikorin' Mikoshiba Mikoto\\n\r\nand so many more.\\n\r\nThis anime depicts the character's personality so well. Yamazaki Mitsue kinda outdo herself in this anime. And the 'small details' department also doesn't lack one bit. Almost flawless.\\n\r\nNot to mention, the opening is something i can't skip and already on my 'top 25 most played' playlist 2 days after i downloaded it.\\n\r\nGSNK will serve you a very fresh humor which is a mixture of rom-com slapstick with parody spices and stupid conversation as topping with great amount of miscommunication gag for complimentary snacks.\\n\r\nThis anime is not a Romantic comedy. For me it is Romantically Comedic series. You won't fall in love with anybody in particular here, but you will absolutely get tickled by everybody in the series. Worth every single minute of those 23 minutes. And if you even wanted to hate this series, you can't.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Go.fucking.watch.it.now. thanks",

            "content": "STORY\r\n\tThe plotline of GSNK is a very standard high school romance setting, with the main character, Chiyo Sakura, being in love with the upperclassman Nozaki; however, Nozaki doesn't know about Chiyo's love for him despite her obvious efforts to get with him. Being mainly a comedy anime, Nozaki's obliviousness to Chiyo is the stem of most of the show's gags.\r\n\tThe series starts with Chiyo confessing her love to Nozaki, only for him to completely missunderstand and end up giving her his autograph. We find out that Nozaki is actually an illustrator for popular shoujo manga \"Let's Love\"; a generic Shoujo love story acting as aparody to the genre as well as a parallel to the main storyline.\\n\r\n\tThroughout the show, Chiyo helps Nozaki out with his manga along with his other school friends, each portraying a popular shoujo manga trope: Kashima is the \"ouji-sama\" character, who turns out to actually be a girl. Mikorin is a deredere style character, despite being male. Seo is the delinquent-style \"ore\" character; but, you guessed it, is female. Hori is a male tsundere who acts as a 'tsukkomi-boke' duo with Kashima. Finally Wakamatsu, a basketball jock who is afraid of Seo's aggressive strength even though he's a guy.\\n\r\n\tI would say that the show is not so much of a romcom as a parody of shoujo manga, adding twists to the character tropes for comedic effect. The show often compares the 'real' world with that portrayed in Nozaki's manga with some of the character's in \"Let's Love!\" being directly based on the personalities of Nozaki's friends.\\n\r\n\tA common complaint with romance in anime and manga is that it hardly ever has a good ending, with no real conclusion of who gets with who ever being reached. While this is most certainly present in GSNK, it is there as a parody of the trope and the show often mocks itself for this flaw.\\n\\n\r\nPRODUCTION\\n\r\n\tThe animation for this show was pretty standard for a comedy anime, with bright colours and an over-abundance of \"only the mouths move\" scenes. Somthing that it does do quite well is to incorporate some of the genre-mocking tropes into the animation. Many visual effects such as the \"action lines\" or the \"fluffy backdrop\" are used in bucket fulls.\\n\r\n\tThere is nothing particularly interesting about the show's soundtrack, although the show's OP is some wierd jazzy song which I didn't really think fit with the show's tone, but was a nice song nontheless.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\n\tOverall the show was most definately a comedy, rather than a romance; so if you're looking for any kind of solid romantic storyline go somewhere else. On the otherhand if you are well versed in the Shoujo or romance genres then you will probably find many jokes pretty relatable.\\n\r\n\tAlthough I have avoided talking about the source material, it is one of the very few that I can actually I say that I read before watching the anime. It's an ongoing 4koma that has much of the same content as the anime. If anything I'd probably say that the manga works better due to the nature of mocking the very thing that it is.\\n\r\n\tIt also has a wide range of nichijou-esque reaction faces, which can further your collection of images perfect for arguing over the internet.\\n\\n\r\nMETA\\n\r\nLength- \t1 cour / 12eps / 4.8 hrs\\n\r\nRelease-\tSummer 2014\\n\r\nStudio-\t\tDogakobo\\n\r\nSource-\t\t2011 4koma by Izumi Tsubaki\\n\\n\r\nRATING\\n\r\nWatch?-\t\tYes, as a comedy\\n\r\nBest Character-\tSeo\\n\r\nWorst Character-No one\t\\n\r\nBest Feature-\tChiyo's reactions",

            "content": "After getting bored by a couple of supposedly \"funny\" series, I came to learn that comedy is highly subjective and only appeals to those that can in a sense, connect with it. I am extremely fortunate to stumble this joy of a series, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun that tingles my funny bone on a godly level. \r\nFirstly, DO NOT BE FOOLED by the 'romance' genre because if you start this show with expectations of it being your run the mill rom-com or even shoujo anime (because its in the title), you will be heavily disappointed. This is a full-fledged comedy, no drama, no angst, no romance,just pure CRACK. And I put this out there because I have heard of people who dislike this show because it didn't meet their so called \"expectations\". Now, this show has entirely no plot whatsoever, and this has turned many off, because the show just goes in circles and by the end of the 12 episodes nothing really \"happens\". But that is exactly why I love it. It's this nonsensical, slice of life, lighthearted nature of Gekkan that I found to be so soothing and calming, relieving the pain and rigor of every day life. Not to say that the story is boring or pointless though, oh no no no. Every episode brings a new scenario, focused on two-three of the main characters and through the events that play out, hilarity ensues. Plus points if you've watched a couple of shoujo animes, because Gekkan parodies it in a satirical nature and completely shades and deconstructs the cliches of romance. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now to the best part of the series: the characters. Looking back now I have no idea why I adore them so much. There is no tragic backstory, there is no spectacular character development, there is no complex personality. None of that at all. What you see is what you get in Gekkan, and the show even goes so far as to blatantly state the personality type of the characters. I would go so far as to say they are far from dynamic and can be summed up in a couple of words. But SOMEHOW they still appeal so much to the audience and their little antics and behavior are some times so unorthodox that you can't help but burst out in laughter. They fall into a certain character troupe, yes, but its the most unique and weird and crazy kind of troupe and you can't help but fall in love with their eccentricity. They are such an unlikely group of friends (if you can even call them friends haha). They don't all belong to a certain club, or class or anything at all. And sometimes you have to think back to recall what exactly is the dynamics of their relationship, and when the show throws these characters into certain situations you can't help but laugh your ass off. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I really really did enjoy this show a whole lot, and I burst out in actual LOLs because certain scenes just really took the cake for me. I understand not everyone will love this as much as I did, but do give it a shot because you may walk off with some really fun times :)",

            "content": "So I have been depressed, latel- my whole life and I cant seem to stop questioning the point of everything I do on a near constant basis. On top of my own internal criticisms, externally I was sent a brilliant question on another website I review things on \"Why do you write long ass reviews no one will ever read?\" You know I'm not exactly sure why. On the same day I put up a 70,000 character review of something I'll see someone get a million thumbs up for reviewing the same thing but saying \"All I hav 2 say es i luved itIn fact go ahead and copy and paste that as a review to something you luved. I would like to say it is easy to take things like this in stride and just move on to the next thing I want to talk about, but on some fundamental level it does hurt at least a little. I mean my great intellectual peers on these websites, wont recognize my utter brilliance for what it is. I don't really know what to do in this situation, but I'm really good at one thing in life and that is hating myself. So to give into my masochistic ways, why not write a few more really long reviews no one will read, before I find that rope that is just strong enough to hold my body weight again? Yeah, lets turn pain into mild inspiration here, I actually think it's interesting to hear other peoples reasons for and general philosophy on reviewing something. To illustrate my own, I have decided to review the last anime I watched and explain how I see something while reviewing it and explaining what I think the importance of reviewing something is along the way. \\n\r\nSo the last anime I watched was Monthly Girls Nozaki-Kun (MGNK) and it is a show about a girl named Chiyo Sakura who has a crush on a young Shojo manga writer. The show is loosely about her comedic attempts at romance with him and explaining what goes into making a romance manga. \\n\\n\r\nSo for the structure of this review about reviews we will be starting with what I consider the most basic forms of reviewing something and moving onto what I think are \"higher\" forms of reviewing something. Most people here and most sites like this want to review something because \"One Piece was like totally my favorite show as a kid XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD. I used to drink Capri Sun and piss my pants while watching it 10/10.\" Or they do the exact opposite \"One Piece was the show that made me realize anime was bad. I used to drink Capri Sun and piss my pants angrily while watching it. 1/10.\" Basically people want to give their bald unvarnished opinions on something without really analyzing anything, it's just the catharsis of other people knowing your joy and pain. I can understand this type of review even if I don't like it. The whole point of communication is communicating emotional and practical needs, so there is a place for this type of review and there is a purpose. Thinking of these websites as a way to find new things to watch we cant really take these reviews as critical masterpieces but as a general nebulous cloud of positivity or negativity surrounding a piece of media we can gauge a consensus around something when a lot of reviews like this reflect a general sentiment in the extreme positive or negative. If I look at a show and 75% of it's \"reviews\" are generally one sentence saying \"it sucks\" you might think you're above such trite evaluations, but you aren't. People are swayed by consensus even when they think they aren't, in fact the small mental pangs those reviews give are probably more important than any amount of lengthy criticism I or someone else can muster. So I guess in a way they do deserve those thumbs up and I deserve a thumb up my a-\\n\\n\r\nIf I was to give my own blunt one sentence review it would be:  TL;DR: All I hav 2 say es i nuanced it :^) :^( :^)\\n\\n\r\nLet's say for some reason despite knowing the above and knowing that your magnificent words and brilliant thoughts will never amount to even one declarative like or dislike and yet you still wanted to actually evaluate something because like me you have all the time in the world and no rouge haired vixens to spend it with. Well I guess I have some advice for delinquents that still wish to waste their time and their youth away writing these. \\n\r\nThe actual analysis should be the brain of your review and you should aim to have a critical take on something that is actually interesting and not just the same blunt emotional opinions about something everyone has. This is another reason why I can almost respect those one line reviews, if a person thinks something is just great than say that bluntly real quick and move on, if you think something is terrible do the same. We don't need to be told something over and over in the same way a million times, so brevity in this situation is actually welcome. The depth of your analysis depends on what it is you're aiming to do with a review and most of the rest of my review here is dedicated to exploring various depths I think you can reach. So more on that to come. The main thing you should take away from this is have something interesting to say but don't do it in a long review, you know like my long ass reviews.\\n\r\nMost writing even non-fictional writing aims to have emotional elements, that makes what you're trying to get across more palatable to the dumb masses, I mean my dear readers. I like to make the thing I feel the most emotional about either in the positive or the negative the center of gravity for a review. If the analysis is the brain, the thing you feel the most strongly about should be the pulsating beating heart of the review. The emotional framework by which the other elements fill in. MGNK didn't have a lot of elements that stood out to me in this way except... The cutest most adorable protagonist I have seen in a show ever. I mean it was love at first sight. It's like someone took Asuka and said \"I'll make an even cuter version\" and the absolute madman actually did it somehow. Her cuteness in fact breaks the show, because I find it hard to believe the boring as -redacted- guy she wanted to go out with didn't like her back and was aloof to her attempts to go out with him. In fact it's hard for me to believe most men and women wouldn't immediately see Chiyo and start formulating wedding plans and imagining a long happy life together the second they see her for the first time. I mean the guy she likes isn't the worst but one question just kept coming up in my head as I watched this... IS SHE REALLY GOING OUT WITH HIM? IS SHE REALLY GONNA MAKE ME CRY? IS SHE REALLY GOING OUT WITH HIM? IS SHE REALLY GONNA PEN MEDIOCRE MANGA WITH HIM TONIGHT? IS SHE REALLY GOING OUT WITH HIM? IF THINE EYES DONT DECIEVETH ME THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG AROUND HERE... Well this serves as an example of what I mean, you take an element you like or dislike a little bit more than the rest and you then seed the rest of the review with references to this as an ongoing joke and an easier way to make transitions. Yeah it was all just a joke. I don't really want Chiyo that much, crushes and anime are for kids. *Forced laughter, as he wipes away tears.* I'm sure that manga writer with bland looks and a puddle deep personality deserves someone as wonderful as Chiyo Sakura. You know what, it hurts too much lets just move on. \\n\\n\r\nSo you can have emotional elements to a review but you don't want it bogged down with a bunch of bizarre hit or miss humor that only a few weirdos will find funny or possibly just you. I haven't learned this lesson myself yet. I need to get down with the memes and the lingo of the kids today and try to up my social networking presence with some fly one liners. To start do people still say the word \"fly?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe point of most reviews that go beyond one sentence or a paragraph on the internet and in general is to evaluate something as a product. So back to MGNK the last anime I watched, I could at the very least say, it was a romantic comedy centered around a girl who likes a guy who makes manga. Well it had romance, it had comedy and it showed to some extent what a manga creator thinks about and does as a job. It focused on the two main characters just enough and it properly used the supporting cast as foil's to the main. So I guess just as a product doing what I think it's trying to aim for it does it pretty well and it doesn't fall into too many cliches and overused plot arcs on the way. I guess that is a success to some extent. Three out of four of things I have reviewed so far on this site don't really meet this level of \"success\" as I see it, they aimed for something and they missed the mark by quite a bit. I think this is kind of the lowest level of reviewing something professionally, just evaluating it on what it \"tried\" to do. If I was reviewing or analyzing things in this way I probably would get bored pretty fast, because 97/100 shows, games, films, etc in each genre are relatively the same and most meet or come close to the low bar of criteria they set for themselves. So there is only so much you can say about them in this way before you burn yourself out. I think you will find that most \"paid\" reviewers review things this way because it is rather easy to be charitable given this limited criteria. Well \"X\" met it's mark so go out and buy it and or view it for advertising/subscription dollars on CRUNCHY ROLL, LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION. Don't forget to like us on Facebook, Twitter, Pornhub and use my Amazon link when you make a purchase. Even the ones that have a pretense of calling their stuff an essay/video essay because the old format of selling things to people who haven't realized Disney owns every reviewer through maker studios doesn't seem as kuth anymore. In fact my house just got bought by a subsidiary of a holding company that is owned by another holding company that is owned by an advertising firm that is owned by Disney so I only have about fifty more minutes to write this review before I'm evicted and thrown out. I wont be having fun in the lukewarm southern California sun and that is assuming I spend that time finishing this review. I mean there are other things to look at on the internet that I can do some short activities with... Not too short mind you. What's the length in time of Chiyo's skirt? That came out wrong... You know what forget it, I'll just finish this review. \\n\\n\r\nYou definitely want to hide the fact that you're a marketer in a review, don't make it too transparent that you're covertly working for a company while pretending to be critical of them. Be critical of one small incidental piece of the thing in question so you can pull one over on us and pretend you're really evaluating it. For instance, I needed to get some weird stains off my wall next to where I keep my Chiyo shrine and Bioclean got those stains right out. The only problem was it contained a chemical that was toxic to puppies and now I don't have any friends. Aside from that though it was a top product I can highly recommend. Link below, to the side and up above. \\n\r\nTo get some of the more mundane product like aspects of my own review out of the way I have to say I really like the art of this show. There is an almost \"crispness\" to it compared to other show's I have seen. Everything is nicely outlined and detailed and there is a vibrant use of colors. I really didn't expect to see this much detail and visual flair in a show like this either, because most of the anime romance & comedy shows I have seen so far have terrible or just standard art. All of the character's in this look distinct and have a nice style to them that still manages to keep with the show's realistic modern setting. Well the main male lead is kind of boring looking... But I might think that for reasons not related to the art that I already mentioned. On that subject again let me just state bluntly that Chiyo's hair looks amazing. Her hair shines like a radiant sun in my clear grey skies.  I mean it's almost a more important character on it's own than a lot of the actual people are. There is an absolutely beautiful scene in this show with rain and some blue flowers and the environment contrasts radiantly with Chiyo's color scheme. I think they spent half their budget and time animating this one scene. They knew this was going to be \"it\" the one nerd's were going to remember them for and they were right. This scene deserves a short film award and possibly an Oscar for best non-verbal use of a waifu in a comedy. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting and sound were \"good.\" Yeah as I've said before I'm not the best at evaluating the audio aspects of a show. \\n\r\nA reviewer should probably know more than the average person watching something. In part because it justifies your opinion being heard over others but also because it is just good to have more knowledge and broader frame of reference in which evaluate something. I clearly know nothing about anime voice actors and yet here I am arrogantly reviewing this show as if my opinion matters in the slightest. Just call me a spaceman because I want to crash land into planet Zettai Ryouiki while Chiyo's voice actor gives me messages from ground control.\\n\\n\r\nSo the second level is evaluating something against other things of type/genre and what it says about anime as a whole. Well as a work place slice of life, it's inferior to stuff like Shirobako and New Game! that more properly represent what it's like to be in the anime and game business respectively more than MGNK manages to show us about Manga creation. I'm not sure it does a lot more than the one episode of Golden Boy where he is an Anime creator does and Golden Boy was a softcore porn comedy. As a romance it fairs slightly worse. To it's credit it manages to navigate around the obvious pitfalls and it leaves the viewer wanting slightly more by Spoiler: not having any of the characters get together at the end. But for reasons I'll explain later in more detail the main characters lacked chemistry and real romantic inclinations. It manages to be pretty funny and milk the obvious humor you expect it to for most shows of it's genre, which is not something I can say for every romantic comedy. Again I don't think any of the previously mentioned three things I reviewed before this fared as well against the rocky edges of other shows in their genres. In fact I think they compared rather poorly to most other shows in their genre or in Ergo's case that were attempting similar things thematically. \\n\r\nSo why does it matter if something isn't as good as other shows like it or shows of it's genre? Well to be blunt in a broad sense it doesn't matter. From the perspective of someone who doesn't care about anime at all, these comparisons are like farts in a heavy wind. On the other hand if you do like anime, the point of criticisms like this is to evaluate whether something is worth your time and appreciation in comparisons to works that already did things much better or worse. We cant evaluate things in a vacuum and there isn't some standard of measure to appeal to, so the best thing a critic can do to show their expertise and show why something is wrong or right is comparing it to other things like it. Now watch as I use something that isn't an anime as an example to stun and confuse the audience and then hopefully catch them off guard with a comeuppance towards a relevant point. \\n\\n\r\nThere was a movie staring Don Cheadle called Miles Ahead (2015). In this film Don was playing Mile's Davis, probably the most famous Jazz Musician ever. This was an acting part he had wanted most of his life and I could see why. He looks like him and to his credit his acting in the film was an almost immaculate recreation of the real Miles Davis. The reason I'm bringing up this film in particular in a seemingly totally unrelated review about an anime that isn't at all about Jazz music is that I was eagerly awaiting this film and in that eagerness I had some expectations about what this film would entail. You see Mile's Davis music is very complex and experimental and in the hands of a good film director editing and camera techniques can be used to abstractly represent his music while simultaneously relating it to Mile's complicated life and personality. You can use his odd time structures and improvisation to great effect in going balls out wild with your own film making techniques... Only that didn't really happen in this to my grave disappointment. The movie was filmed and edited in a pretty standard way. Certain media subjects like this come almost prepackaged with certain expectations regarding the content I will now attempt to explain why. \\n\r\nAs someone who has read and watched a lot of critics of varying level's of merit, there is one almost universal truth about media criticism and that is that one of the things that makes something a masterpiece is something commentating on it's own media or in the case of the MGNK anime something commentating on a related media. (To be fair, it was a manga to begin with.) So let's say I make a movie about making movies like 8 1/2, Ed Wood or F for Fake, well what you might do like these films did is show why the medium of film is both important and as it is the way of making a film is analogous to life itself and what these things mean in a broader sense. You can use camera techniques, editing, acting set design and special effects to bring attention to the things about film that make it a film and not reality. Most of the fiction we consider groundbreaking for a medium does something like this with it's said medium, the most important literature is generally about writing itself and how this new work aims to transcend everything about it up to this point. Even as a relatively younger medium we're starting to see a similar pattern with video games, the games that are seen as the most important are the ones that manage to take the tropes of earlier games and ideas and use them to transcend into something new while commentating on the media as a whole. The majority of people don't give two damns and a fudge about any of this, they just want the same tropey slop thrown in their face because they like when lights move on a screen like people chained up in Plato's Cave, but critics and people who have seen more than the average amount of crap most people see, tend to appreciate these aspect's of a work because it play's into that type of media they like and because it uses the media as a way of reaffirming that media's importance and by extension those critics lives. It also take's a connoisseurs eye to notice these things and it plays into a form of elitism and special understanding when you can spot the minute small differences that deem something a masterpiece or mundane. It would be hard to spot these thing's if they didn't relate to the media itself and their area of expertise. So hence a culture of criticism naturally gravitates positively towards work's pertaining to what the critics are criticizing in the first place. \\n\r\nWhile this is definitely true of things within a media like what Shirobako is to anime. I would also add this expectation to things that are related to the same media or that can be utilized in creative ways being transplanted from another media, like Miles Ahead was from music to films and what I was thinking MGNK could be for manga to anime.  Luckily for me this show...  Disappointed on this front in almost every way imaginable. \\n\r\nSo as a pretentious reviewer of very little merit, what I expect out of a show like MGNK is some moment's where the nature of manga and it's creation are used to bring attention to their own medium in a way that a more conventional manga and anime, such as the one's they're talking about creating would not. Similar to the expectation I had with Miles Ahead. I also expect this to reflect on the characters lives in some way and relate a manga's creation to a person's life and have a profound statement to make with this. MGNK manages to avoid doing this to a point that it almost seems to be intentionally trying to avoid going in a direction that might make it's use of it's own premise seem interesting. I could imagine using the format of manga as a way of making unique choices regarding editing, transitions and artistic choices with this anime, they don't really attempt anything like this. The only time they even hint at something like this is in the ending and opening credits. I can see using the manga they're writing within the story as an analogous narrative to the story being told in the anime itself and there are points in the anime where this is done to small comedic effect, but I think it could be done to say more important thing's than a one off joke or implication that certain characters might like each other. The point is all of these aspects that are basically begging to be used for something more are just wasted in this show. Chiyo and Miles clearly deserved better. \\n\\n\r\nLove is a universal subject and it's the type of subject that has an instant appeal to most audiences. When you're aiming for money, fame or electoral power the more universal and seamless you can make the product seem the more of each you will seemingly get. The problem is other people have realized this and the world is filled with silly love songs and films aiming for a universal mass market appeal. That is why ironically they have to appeal to particularity now to standout amongst the crowd of attempted universals. Why isn't this just a show about a girl who falls in love with a young guy? Because we have seen that before a lot in anime and everywhere else. Why isn't this a show about a guy who just creates manga? Because we have also seen that and also male characters don't sell merchandise. So we have these two mixed premises making manga and young people falling in love. Do these two necessarily make for a good combination? Well if you're asking me, I think it's horrible that she would like that smelly bastard, but if you mean what is my opinion of the story, well I can imagine this combination working, but I don't think it did here. The problem is the love elements felt tacked on in comparison to the information and laser focus on manga creation and despite them trying these two never feel enough like a couple to be convincing. In fact I think the secondary characters Yuu and Hori seemed more like a couple I wanted to root for.  I think part of the problem was the third element in the mix \"the comedy\" while well executed for it's own sake nerfed a lot of the moments that should have been more quiet, romantic and emotional. At least part of this shows running time should have been at least a little dedicated to making me want to see these two get together in the end, but I never really cared about that outcome one way or the other and it certainly didn't help that I thought Chiyo deserved a million times better. I mean I'm a complete loser and I've lived out more romantic scenes in my life with members of the opposite sex than what this show showed. \\n\r\nI've managed to see a few anime in my experience that are much worse and much better at romance than this. Like I said earlier I like that it avoids obvious cliches. While we're on that subject though, you know there is one cliche in particular I just have to ask about regarding anime and romance. Why do so many of them have a part right near the end where usually the female love interest runs away for absolutely no reason? Where did this terrible cliche start and why do the makers of these shows think anyone will be convinced they're actually going to go through with this and not have the couple get together? This dumb bit of plot has happened in so many romance anime I've seen so far that I instinctively fast forward through a show when this starts to happen. I think it was the absolute worst in Love Hina but that was only because everything about that show was terrible. I'm assuming that show also might be the source of a lot of bad cliches as it seems to be the route and root from which all evil comes regarding Japanese animation. If you see the DVD in stores grab it and flush it down the nearest toilet and don't stop pressing the button until either the toilet breaks or the police come. Luckily this cliche didn't happen in MGNK and I give it some extra credit for that. The problem is in the absence of obvious cliches and overused plots, MGNK doesn't really give us anything else to cling onto regarding the romance. \\n\r\nOne of the jokes I thought was funny more by implication than with execution was that a guy who writes romantic manga isn't very romantic and has a hard time seeing the forest from the trees, when it comes to romance in his own life. This was hinted at here and there in the show, but I think a lot more can be done with this comedic premise than was done here. I really like characters that are hypocritical at their core, I wanted to write a book about a vegan butcher. There wasn't a lot of humor in the show, which was kind of weird for a romantic comedy but when they did aim to be humorous I was always laughing with the show, which is something I can say in it's favor. It's humor was simplistic but effective. I just think that like the other two premises this was woefully underutilized and it actively hurt some of the romance as stated before. \\n\r\nThe manga creation elements were interesting as factoids and as a behind the scenes look at how they get created was interesting in an educational way. I genuinely don't know much about the creation of manga or even anything related like western comics or animation so I cant say how accurate it was. I think the earlier failures I mentioned with this show and it's lack of creativity in use of the subject matter here hurt the manga creation sections the most in that we mostly see the characters physically making the manga and then maybe a cut or two to what the semi-finished or finished results are. Where as they could have found more creative ways in editing and animation to better illustrate illustration. The jokes about the cliche nature of the manga may have been a bit funnier if the characters in the world of the show didn't seem just as hollow in other ways. So the manga sections didn't really add anything aside from some slight facts, but it also didn't detract much. \\n\\n\r\nAll media and art is a mirrored reflection of the people who make it and the society around them. With that in mind, I actually think reviewing a thing for it's own sake as counter intuitive as it may seem is actually the least important part of a review or a piece of criticism. As I showed with the first level of reviewing most people can evaluate rather easily if something lived up to it's own potential or not and this type of reviewing can be done by basically anyone and unless you care about the reviewers emotional responses and ability to spot minor infractions in a piece of media like they're a factory worker looking for defects on a consumer product, there isn't much gained from this type of criticism. On the second level most people who are into something enough to care what a critic has to say need to have enough knowledge to know whether their comparisons between things in a media and broader medias actually pan out, making the critic a redundant interlocutor in your own internal monologue. As in the critic is only as good as your own knowledge on the subject. So the third level encompasses the previous two, but it also starts to turn it's attention away from the particular piece of media in questions and starts to use it as a way to use a particular piece of media as a lens towards asking broader questions. Bigger questions about life, society, yourself and all that nonsense. So what's really important is what the piece of media in question can say about humanity in general and how you can use examining that to show how this reflects positively or negatively on us. Usually I think most people would stop at this, I mean what more can you milk out of something and still realistically be reviewing it while also trying to ask bigger questions with it? MGNK doesn't really say a whole lot that can easily lend itself to larger questions about life. I guess that people really want to see the same types of stories and comedic situations shown over and over again ad nauseum, because the majority of our history has been oral story telling so we are preconditioned for wanting to hear the same things over and over again. I mean at least in this case this show and manga were worth making because Chiyo needed to be birthed into existence to save me from my mundane life of boredom and sadness. In other words it's worth it because of cute girls, Miyazaki was right anime and reality are a mistake. \\n\r\nSeriously though, why did some Japanese miscreant go and create MGNK? Was it because there is a non-stop need for Manga to be penned so the rights can be bought by an animation studio, that then goes and makes a show out of it with the cheapest animation techniques, using non-union labor so that they can then sell merchandise of these characters? Probably. I would like to think an angel like Chiyo was created with only the best of artistic intentions in mind, but I have to be honest with myself for a second, she was probably made to appeal to some loser like me so I would buy her figurines and Dakimakura and believe me I will -I did. I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel here to make a point, about how there is not a point to reviewing a show like this. I'll remember Chiyo and some of the good art in this show, but aside from that in about three years time I wont remember anything else about this show. I can say the same for the majority of things it's possible to review. I like to see things as an \"argument\" in part because of my previously mentioned philosophical background and because I debated people for aeons on the internet and probably wasted more of my life doing that than I can ever care to admit. There is a symmetry between types of communication lies, stories, arguments and basic conversations and the more you get critical about them the more you realize what makes them believable and interesting is usually the same emotional appeals and buildups that slowly ramp up to an actual point. In Plato's Republic Socrates makes a point about how people from certain trades come to view the entire world through the lens of their occupation. A plumber sees life in metaphors of plumbing. A brick layer relates everything to laying bricks. If this is true for these professions then I suggest it is also true for critics. I've come to the point where I see peoples personalities in a similar vein, they're lists of likes and dislikes and packets of unrelated information to be evaluated and judged like any other declarative statement and so is the media we tie to these things. Well like most art, most people aren't that interesting or even worthy of an evaluation. If each human had a back cover synopsis I would suggest skipping to that. Instead of wasting time reading the bland filler and the cliche arcs in the middle. I said earlier art was a mirrored reflection of humanity and I was saying that in a partial sarcastic jest because while that is true, I don't assume the good things people usually say when they say something grandiose like that. Especially in the case of MGNK it reflects our own averagness back at us. Our want for the typical things in life, that we all supposedly want, laffs and romance. There is a lot of art, but only a smidgen of it in the extreme positive or negative is really worth pondering about for more than a few seconds. This is not one of those, I'm just sorry. *Clenches teeth tightly as tears roll down face in a steady stream and the wind blows against his poorly animated hair.* \\n\\n\r\nI think most fundamentally when reviewing something you have to ask what it is you as a reviewer bring to the table. The thing you're reviewing already exists, other peoples ability to evaluate it does as well. So what specifically can you bring to analyzing this that makes your opinion worth a damn in the first place? Are you particularly good at analysis? Do you know a lot about the subject? Do you have a history with it? Does it have a special place in you life in the positive or the negative? Can your analysis shed new light on a work previously thought to be totally uninteresting? Do you have some kind of writing talent or charisma that can make up for the lack of other qualities? In my case it's obviously my good looks and my humble nature, but you have to consider what you bring to something before wasting people's precious time. I think this is the way a critic is most like the artist whose work they're criticizing in the first place. It all comes down to trying to make something that will be entertaining, currently relevant and meaningfully timeless and not just something that is forgotten in a few days or possibly worse derided and criticized in turn. We hope our creations and analysis are helpful and that they help people appreciate things on a deeper level than they did before. To expect greater things and push forward a media in a way that would seem too smart for audiences of a previous generation... Who am I kidding, I cant even live up to my own advice. I have nothing interesting to say about this show. Where is that damn rope?\\n\\n\r\nReviewers are subject to their own cliches, bland argumentative arcs and a propensity towards the over dramatic in heightening their own importance. I've never been fond of the \"emperor has no clothes\" analogies myself. In part because I love empress dowager Chiyo the sixty-ninth ruler of sunrise land and this review is in fact both my oath of fealty to her name and her house and my declaration of courtly love to her and I will not have lowly rabble besmirching her honor. I also don't like it because it encapsulates all the pitfalls a bad reviewer can fall into. It's easy to fall into the extremes when reviewing something \"this is best thing ever\" and it's inverse are thing's you should shy away from as quickly as you can when you realize you want to evaluate something. People hate nuance and I'm going to rail against some of what I see as false moderacy in a minute, but when reviewing something you should aim for nuance as much as possible concerning your own emotions and peoples tendency to over rely on them when describing the appeal or lack thereof something. \"The emperor has no clothes\" line is often stated as an extremely emotional declarative statement and usually isn't warranted anyway. \\n\r\nA lot of reviewers also fall into the want to come off as universal. They're a cultivated and molded product from external criticism as much as the thing they're reviewing is. In part because a lot of reviewers are marketers in hiding and they don't want to scare away possible ad revenue and a consumer base by showing any of their \"gross\" particularities that might scare you away. Notice when you watch some famous internet reviewers how hard they try to come off as \"moderates\" politically and how contrived this stance is when you think about it for even a millisecond. How many refuse to discuss any issues that are minorly uncomfortable? You might say \"well is it their responsibility to discuss these things?\" I would say it depends on what they're reviewing. I'm not suggesting people shoehorn a political stance in like I haphazardly inserted reviewing into this review about a random anime show. If they're reviewing Biocream for instance, unless they have evidence that the people making it are dumping chemicals in a near by lake I think they can stick to the script and just regurgitate what the company told them to say. In media criticism though, I do think it's a reviewers responsibility to discuss and not shy away from topics that are politically charged when it is inherent in what they're reviewing. Anything else is cowardice and advertising. If there is anything I'm sick of in this regard it's reviewers constantly trying to find a \"middle ground\" on something whenever they do bring up a political or societal issue. There isn't two sides to the truth, faux perspectivism and pretend neutrality can only take us so far on the most important issues of the day. Luckily for me this show doesn't bring up anything of social relevance. I would be in some real hot water with the two people who end up reading this if I had to reveal my political stances on anything. Chiyo likes artistic dreamers, I think my stances would be cool with her and that is all that matters in the end.  Wow, you can say my review lacks the substance I opine for in other peoples criticisms, I'm hypocritical and moronic or you can say regarding my review \"The emperor has no clothes.\" \\n\\n\r\nWho will criticize the critics? If only there was a critic of critics, who could come and critique my criticisms in a critical way. I'm going to invent my own god, a golden calf with Chiyo's face on it called the uncriticized criticizer. This being will be the bedrock of all critiques and the source from which all good criticisms will come. Like Chiyo it will be a flawless package of arguments immaculate in it's own creation, so it will have no need for internal criticism and it will swat away your weak observations and thoughts before you even utter them.  Pray to theeee.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my bashing of it, I've come to the point where I actually enjoy criticisms and reviews of things more than the actual work itself a lot of the time. I'm sure a lot of people have had this thought, but maybe not. I'm a hermetically sealed, mint in the box NEET whose only contact with the human race is these shows and video games at this point. So I'm probably completely off base here. Which is why I want to be a super Saiyan review master, but alas I can only be Hercule in my own sad story. I guess that's why I do these reviews though, it's fun and self indulgent or something like that. Well now that I have criticized literally all of humanity and most of it's art and my fellow critics it's time to turn the critical lens inward. I critique therefore I ain't. If I could analyze myself and get over my own short comings I probably wouldn't be writing this review at six AM on a Wednesday...\\n\r\nWell I guess since I asked why someone would create this it's only fair I ask a similar question of myself. \"Why did I watch this?\" Well in all honesty I saw a picture of Chiyo, reverse image searched it faster than you have done anything in your life and I found out it was a comedy about Manga creation. I've liked some show's with a similar premise and wallah, I watched it. I don't think this show was particularly worth reviewing and really I could place any show in this shows place in this review. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it was just a painfully average experience and  if I didn't have the review about reviews conceit going on here, I doubt I would have a whole lot interesting to say about it and I may have even failed with all that additional effort. This is another way in which the critic is like an artist at the end of it all, we release what we create out in the wild and just like an artist we are only as influential and as important as our audience allow us to be. I expect a reach of two people or less and a possible gold star and veggie tendies from my mom after all this effort. \\n\\n\r\nIf only Chiyo wanted to help some loser write his reviews instead of wanting to help a respectable and successful young manga artist. I mean there is also the whole her being a fictional character thing, but I can get over her small faults. You know what, I'm gonna make my own piece of art about a reviewer who is aloof, self important and lacks self awareness. I'll inflate his self importance to a level never seen. I'll just steal Chiyo whole sale and put her in my work, yeah I'll just take her and the anime shes in and shoehorn the whole damn thing whole sale into some random piece of work I'm making that is only slightly related to what I'm talking about. I doubt anyone will notice I mean, they come to super brilliant critics like us to tell them what to think anyway so I'll just write a review justifying how awesome it is later. Yeah... I'm not talented enough to do that. So until then, I guess you can have whatever this is instead. \\n\r\nSo my review clearly lacked brevity. Was overly prone to the emotional. I didn't bring any special knowledge about the show, it's creators or anime in general. I don't bring any kind of special knowledge or charisma of any kind to the table. It wasn't funny except possibly unintentionally and I can't live up to my own standards. If I reviewed my review I would give it a score lower than is currently possible on this website and this review is a reflection of me as a reviewer... On that note, thanks for reading. The show was medium out of well cooked and my neck is about to look raw, peace out... Actually my fifty minutes is up, Disney owns that rope now.",

Guy may or may not be into her. \r\nI thought the side characters were more interesting than the main characters, but that's how it usually is. The main character can only be described as a \"normal high school girl\" while the side characters were character types I hadn't seen before. \r\nThe op is good. The song it catchy and is relevant to the anime. \r\nI have to write a longer review, but I don't haveanything to say. Bork.",

A friend of mine was watching it at the time and recommended it to me and I kind of just brushed it off. Almost a year later I came back to it and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of the show. The opening theme is upbeat as hell which was something I really wasn't expecting. The overall humour and lively characters really makes this anime one of my favourites of all time in the comedy/romance category. I'm not normally one for the whole \"senpai notice me\" shitck, but in all honestythe way this anime played it off was really refreshing. If you haven't seen this anime I highly recommend it, ticking all the right boxes for a really fun show. I eagerly look forward to season 2.",

            "content": "Hmmm... what can i say? Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun  (GSNK from now) is a quite enjoyable anime without too many expectations. It does its job right.\r\nSTORY 7: simple, direct, without any major problems. GSNK run through 12 episodes so fast that you wont notice. It goes like water... And maybe this could be a problem (a minor one though). It could seem that the story runs too fast to handle all the sub-stories that come to the screen but, i think, that its job is to take all these stories lightly, without drama.\r\nART/SOUND 6: nothing to say. They,re normal. \r\nCHARACTERS 7: there are 2main characters, 5 side characters and a few others (like 3 or 4). Anyways, all the characters lacks of that deep backround story, past and other things that could make them better... but like i said (wrote) before, the anime is not that type of super-deep drama , so they're fine as they are. No complaints at all. They are the average comedy anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 7: the humor is good, few sketch are hilarious but after a bit they begin to become repetitive and give that taste of \"already seen\". That's why i picked only a 7. They're good, but not so very good. Normal.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: GSNK is an average comedy anime. A full 7 is what it can have. No more, no less. It makes you smile, makes you laugh, makes you think (a bit), makes you cringe and its cute sometimes but... it's average. But, hey! In 12 episodes what did you expect? It does its job, and it does it well!",

This anime is on my no. 2 spot on my best anime of 2014. \r\nSTORY (9):\r\nThe story follows Chiyo Sakura who has a crush on Umetaro Nozaki, but when she tries to confess her love for him, he mistakes her as a fan and he gives her an autograph. Nozaki invites Sakura to his house to assist in his drawings and so Sakura willingly becomes Nozaki's assistant.\r\nThis anime was produced by DogaKoko who worked on anime like Myself, Yourself & 11eyes, animes that I didn't enjoy, so I wentinto this anime with caution. Surprisingly, I enjoyed this anime a lot. It had a lot of charming moments especially good character bonding moments. Not to mention hilarious moments.\\n\\n\r\nART (10):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation solid and vivid. The characters are drawn nicely.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (10):\\n\\n\r\nI love the opening song and the ending song. The opening song \"Kimi Janakya Dame Mitai\" was catchy and addictive. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (9):\\n\\n\r\nEvery character has their wonderful personality.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Chiyo is a beautiful girl with her red ribbon. Not only that, she is a nice and funny girl with a good personality. She is like Asuka but with a better attitude who always cares for people.\\n\\n\r\nUmetarou Nozaki is calm and serious. His voice actor Yuuichi Nakamura was notable for many voice acting roles like Tomoya Okazaki from Clannad.\\n\\n\r\nThe side character that I enjoyed the most was Yuu Kashima. A girl imposed as a guy. He is by far the funniest character in this anime. He reminded me so much of Hideyoshi Kinoshita from Baka & Test. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters also played their roles to their best abilities. Like Mikoto's charm and Hori's acting skills. \\n\\n\r\nI did like most of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (10):\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I was blown away by how interesting this anime is. Although it doesn't compare to Barakamon, it is breath-taking and relaxing. If you want a fun and relaxing anime, do give this one a shot.\\n\\n\r\nI also did like the way how this anime says that you should follow your passion in order to succeed. Like for example Nozaki has a passion for drawing and animation.\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 10/10. It wasn't perfect but close to perfection.",

So the story begins with Sakura confessing her love to Nozaki and what happens then is a huge laugh. What happens after that is another huge laugh. Followed by another, and another. You get it. Even though the romance is almost non-existent on this one, when it happens, it's still cute enough to make your heart warm. Part of its appeal is how you're getting to know the characters, and how unexpected and quirky they are. I wouldn't feel right revealing too much for fear of taking away any potential enjoyment becauseit would be such a waste! There is no real development of plot or character, but even so, it still manages to steal your love. The entire entourage of Nozaki are so 4D and lovable, and situations are funny. Pokes fun at mangas even though it\u2019s about a manga itself. The art fits the mood of the show so well- which just makes the already wonderful show even more wonderful. Though this isn't a serious show, it is seriously hilarious.",

            "content": "Tl;dr Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun regardless of its lack of romantic progress, is a superb lighthearted comedy.\r\nJust reading the synopsis of this series may get you discouraged to watch this or make you feel as if you've seen more than enough anime of this clich\u00e9d plot. \r\nGirl confesses to guy, guy is oblivious and gets the wrong idea, they somehow get into a one-sided relationship with a couple gags thrown here and there. We've all seen this before, haven't we, right?\r\nWell Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun really took me by surprise, even from the first episode. This show acknowledges that its plot is overused, and takes a differentapproach; comedy is the driving force of this show, instead of romance. \\n\r\nNozaki-kun takes the viewer on a roller coaster of laughs and \"awww\"'s (great character designing of Chiyo, especially her face expressions), using romance sparingly. Yes, this can frustrate viewers you prefer to see relationship progress, but the frustration melts as you laugh more and more often throughout the show. I know this because I am one of those viewers.\\n\r\nThe story outline is mediocre. Too overused, too clich\u00e9. It\u2019s how Gekkan Shoujo manipulated what they have been given to create so many hilarious scenes, coupled with priceless reactions from the characters. Nozaki-kun\u2019s story doesn\u2019t throw drama, cliffhangers, and nail-biting scenes: it gives the viewers a blissful twenty minutes of carefree comedy.\\n\r\nThe art and sound coupled together really emphasizes the characters in this show. All the characters are lovable as they are (even Maeno), but the art (especially for Chiyo) was amazing, the girls not being over sexualized, while the boys were not too flashy nor \u201csomething from a shonen-y\u201d. The OST was bright and bouncy, with nice sound effects thrown in with reactions and actions.\\n\r\nOverall, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is a series friendly to any type of anime watcher, whether it may be someone who\u2019s only watched psychological/horror, to someone who\u2019s only watched mecha/action, making the viewer laugh and have a relaxing time. \\n",

They use a lot of manga and anime references for jokes and whatnot. Definitely (in my opinion) not a starting anime or anything like that. \r\nI can't really collect my thoughts honestly, since it's 4:19 am and I have literally just finished the show, so I'll just say exactly what I had thought throughout the show.\r\nI could not stop cracking up, the jokes they made were both clever andjust plain hilarious. The characters reactions to things weren't over the top (what I mean by this is, I'm sure you've seen it as well. The type of animes where just everything is apparently mind blowing to them. Got a bar of soap? \"SUGOI DESU,\" somebody knew how to cook? \"EHehEHhehEHhehEHhehHEH?!?!?!?!?!\" etc). Literally every single episode, got me sincerely laughing at least 4 times. Right now I'm actually trying to be modest, but the actual number would be at least 6 times. Even thinking about some scenes right now is making me chuckle and laugh. \\n\\n\r\nThis is by far one of the most hilarious and light-hearted shows that you will ever watch, but at the same time, that's its declining factor.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is simply for the raw factor of enjoyment, it's light-hearted and it only stays that way. Some times during the show you will be frustrated and just down right disappointed that there's no plot development between the characters and nothing truly progresses between them. This also means of course that this show NEVER gets serious. Well, there are some scenes, that give you some hints, and you can feel a very SLIGHT and realistic feel of the characters slowly bonding together. It feels very natural to the point where you don't even notice it unless you straight out watch the first few episodes compared to the last. \\n\\n\r\nSo although this show is hilarious, although it is light-hearted, it also never gets serious and the characters never dramatically progress romantically. And there is not much of a plot, how I see it is that this show takes a very realistic view of a select number of characters. Nothing dramatic progresses and when you think about it, before the confession (you know what I'm talking about) nothing dramatic should happen between the characters. If anything, it's more unnatural for that shy guy in anime to turn all daring and shove a girl onto a bed (was watching too much ecchi that day I guess). \\n\\n\r\nSo if you want a show that is light-hearted, and you just cannot stop cracking up and laughing, please, watch this show. But at the same time, be prepared for very slight character development (to the point where you won't even notice it to the end) and absolutely no progressing plot.  This show was by far enjoyable and honestly there is no reason not to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nPS I want to explain my ratings, so, for the art, sounds, and story I gave them all an 8  because there was nothing particularly stellar about any of them.  There was no progressing plot (to be honest, the setting is very interesting and is honestly what got me hooked to the show. It's unique and creative which is why I gave it an 8 instead of a 7 but at the same time it never progresses so I simply left it at an 8), the sounds were enjoyable and fit the scenes but again, nothing spectacular, and the art depicted the characters properly but again... nothing stellar or memorable.\\n\\n\r\nWhere this show really shines is in its loveable characters and their interactions, again, you will not stop laughing. My enjoyment for shows like these are always a 10, and overall, it's an easy 9 for me.",

            "content": "Personally I loved this anime but its not for everybody. Firstly, I think that being under romance is misleading. There is not not a lot of emphasis in the characters romance and puts more emphasis in comedy and slice of life. That aside, I think the characters are amazing. Each character has quirks that are hilarious and the cast mesh well together. The soundtrack is also pretty good and amplifies each scene. The comedy is great and the voice actors really did a great job in delivery. \r\nIf you are looking for a more story driven show this is probably not gonna be your cupof tea. However, if your looking for something more comedic and fun you're probably gonna enjoy this. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is probably like the frappuccino of anime where its sweet and might not be extremely refined but its still tastes great for certain people. But, this is probably one of the best \"fraps\" of anime where the characters and music mesh so well together that you realize it doesn't need a solid story. \\n\\n\r\nSo for the elitist out there, everything doesn't have to be a specific brew, blend, or taste and just because it doesn't have what you want doesn't make it bad. Don't compare coffees with fraps and in the same sense don't compare comedy based shows with story based shows. It's silly. You may think I'm a casual but IDGAF. Have a nice day",

            "content": "P R E M I S E\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is based off of a shounen 4-panel manga that I've read for a little while, but started to drift off from. Though, that was after I watched the anime, so GNSK is one of the rare anime in which I have no idea what it's about. I've only heard that it's funny. So when I started watching this anime, I didn't know exactly what to expect. \r\nIt starts off very shoujo-like - manga/anime for young girls consisting of cheesy, ideal romance - and then I suddenly come to realize that the entire show is making funof shoujo. Within this anime are characters who help Nozaki (who I'd say is the deuteragonist) with his shoujo manga, and the hilarity ensues from there. I don't know what's considered spoilers in your book, so I won't reveal much more than that pertaining to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nS H O R T C O M I N G S\\n\r\nNo anime is perfect, but this anime doesn't stray far from it. However, story-wise, it may not appeal to some viewers, simply because each episode feels like some OVA or filler. Sure, every episode gets us and the characters to know each other better and get closer, but the plot lacks story. Though if this anime decided to make a story, straying from its source, it'd surely be inappropriate. In other words, the story is fine as it is in my opinion. Moving on, this anime does have silly romance pairings, but none of the characters really form romantic relationships to the point of madness. It's either from their thick, dense skulls, inability to read the atmosphere, misunderstandings - you name it, they troll you with it. But to me, honestly, it's fun. To others... it's probably really frustrating for them.\\n\\n\r\nP R O S\\n\r\nIf I had to name the biggest thing you can't miss that's amazing about this anime, I'd have to say it's the humor hands down. You just can't miss it. The humor is ridiculous and strong, constant and I'm serious, I've laughed out loud more than possibly any other anime I've seen thus far. Maybe it's the way the characters constantly act, their gimmicks and antics. Maybe it's the atmosphere, or the punchline (or lack of one). Maybe it's that as you get to know each character, and find them in a scenario in which love can develop... you'll just watch as they miss it so badly, you're in tears and clutching your stomach. The art is really cute and the color choices make each character stand out. I just love the OP; it' really, really catchy with its use of brass.\\n\\n\r\nC L O S U R E\\n\r\nI think some people will see this as a funny, slice-of-life, troll anime by the end of it. The author's troll game is strong. But I've grown fond of every single character, and that's not easy for me as I usually dislike at least one character in every other anime. This is memorable for its funniness and light watch; it's capable of making your day, trust me. Sometimes, when I'm feeling down and out of it, I come back to watch an episode or two.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall: 39/50 ~ 78% ~ 8/10",

It pisses you off on how ridiculously brilliant and realistic it is. Give it a try if you want a long life!! *wink, wink*\r\nThe characters are perfectly constructed.

            "content": "Nozaki Kun is likely one of the funniest anime I have ever seen!\r\nThe hilarious jokes used will definitely appeal to the large demographic!\r\nSo let\u2019s start off with the plot, we were introduced to Nozaki Kun and a girl named Sakura, Sakura has a crush on Nozaki except that Nozaki is a dense and neutral character, the type that doesn\u2019t have many friends but makes friends pretty easily because of how open he is.\r\nNozaki is a hardworking individual as well as a great shoujo manga artist that gets his ideas from imagination which leads to his manga being highly exaggerated and hilarious!\r\nHe has a group offriends where most of them got into contact with him through his manga career. Sakura for one became friends with him because he wanted her talent for painting haha!\\n\\n\r\nThe hilarious part about that is that Sakura always has overly dramatic thoughts whenever Nozaki talks about someone else that she hasn\u2019t met which makes Nozaki seem like a dramatic individual when in reality is the complete opposite.\\n\r\nFor example when Nozaki first introduced Mikorin (which is short for Mikoshiba) Sakura thought that Mikorin was Nozaki\u2019s secret girlfriend or something and when introduced, turns out to be a handsome young individual that is popular with girls.\\n\\n\r\nExcept... when Sakura gets closer to Miko, realises his hilarious major flaw of saying embarrassing stuff without realising it and afterwards hiding in a corner and sulking!! HAHA!\\n\\n\r\nAfterwards, we get introduced to more corny and corky characters with hilarious personalities and hilarious backgrounds.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy personal favourite part about the anime is mostly Nozaki\u2019s interaction with all the characters which technically is the main focus of the anime but I mean mainstream isn\u2019t bad right? :P\\n\\n\r\nHe is hilariously dense and the huge irony is that he\u2019s a shoujo manga artist that has never been in a relationship and writes everything using imagination and intuition!\\n\\n\r\nHe has a positive outlook on almost everything which makes it all the more funnier!!! Since he misinterprets feelings of certain negativity.\\n\\n\r\nHe is also very funny in the sense where he is dedicated to his manga to the point where he would go as far as to act as his characters just to research how the characters might be feeling which obviously goes wrong as always!!\\n\\n\r\nNozaki is not only dense, he is serious too! He takes everything too seriously to the point where he\u2019s funny but doesn\u2019t realise it\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also somehow developed Minorin, a male into a Tsundere character that can come as a female personality HAHAHA\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are also EXTREMELY HILARIOUS BUT I DONT WANT TO SPOIL THEM\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is extremely funny, Nozaki\u2019s character design is made similar to Saitama, the plain dumb look to show his density\\n\\n\r\nAnd the art style uses the squarish facial features approach to show the \u2018wtf m8\u2019 look\\n\\n\r\nOr the shock freeze approach to show the shocked looks, pretty common for comedy anime and still hilarious \ud83d\ude02 \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a good job of making the characters \u2018fit their look\u2019 and bring out the hilarious ness of the anime!!!!\\n\\n\r\nWatch it, you won\u2019t regret!\\n\\n\r\nEdit: Watched finish, just wanted to add on how cute Sakura\u2019s voice and all the other characters voices are, the VAs did a great job! And the anime holds true, it stayed a major troll fest all the way till the end.",

            "content": "This anime was such a joy to watch. The characters were so unique and interesting. Each one having their own unique little quirks. They felt so real like the ladies\u2019 man who has no real experience with women, the pretty boy princess? The crazy girl with the voice of an angel? Yup, totally normal characters in anime.\r\nThis is a simple slice of life, shojo, romance anime that doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. If you want something light hearted and goofy than this is the anime for you. Sometimes the best stories are the simple ones.\r\nThe story is driven by its diverse casts of characters andNozaki\u2019s job of being a professional mangaka. He doesn\u2019t need to hire assistance, he just drags his friends along to help him. \\n\\n\r\nYour first introduced to Chiyo Sakura, an ordinary high school girl trying to confess to her crush, it somehow turns into her becoming a mangaka\u2019s assistant.  From there, Chiyo is introduced to a whole cast of other characters and as the story progresses each characters own personal relationships are developed in extremely goofy ways. \\n\\n\r\nThere are three main pairings in the series, each more interesting than the last. \\n\\n\r\nI have come across many series and one of the biggest complaints I hear is that the female protagonist is really whiny and such a cry baby. I never have a problem with characters like that but I can relate to these characters. Chiyo is different, she is not an adoring fan of the guy she likes, as she has realistic expectations from him but still loves him for who he is. At the same time being like any other girl in love and getting nervous and anxious when she is with him. A totally relatable kind of girl.\\n\\n\r\nShe isn\u2019t the overly emotional type, if anything she is a calming factor in the show as a counter balance to the extreme personalities of some of these characters. \\n\\n\r\nOne really stunning aspect of this anime is the art and animation of this only 12 episode anime. It makes long running series look pathetic compared to its crisp and clean design with beautiful snapshots of the background and surrounding area. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I adore is how simple the stories are, they can make an episode simply on the best way to walk home together with a bike, or what\u2019s the best way to give a person an umbrella all for Nozaki\u2019s manga research. \\n\\n\r\nWho would have thought that a story about a guy creating manga could be so interesting :D",

            "content": "very funny. If you're tired of stereotypical animes where the girl is super shy and spends the whole show never saying anything, then this is the show for you. All of the main and supporting characters are great, and though it's a shoujo it's more about friendship and comedy than anything else. You'll really enjoy it.  \r\nThe main characters limits her romantic monologues to like zero which will be really appreciated it gives more time for jokes and getting to know the other characters. All the characters build good friendships and draw a kickass romantic manga in the process. \r\nA problem you see inmost anime is over sexualization o characters to make it the storyline interesting this anime isn't guilty of that. it's genuinely funny and thats the best thing about it.",

            "content": "Romance:\r\nThe romance in this anime is not developed in the common pace. It is more a fleshing out of the early stages of infatuation and love. Sakura Chiyo is the heroine while the \"hero\" is Nozaki Umetarou. While Nozaki sees Sakura as a friend, Sakura is more than interested in Nozaki; Sakura says that she is in love with him. The romance I was expecting was of progressing states of love. First meeting the person, then interested, falling, confessing and finally establishing a relationship. This anime plays out in between meeting and falling and sometimes (accidentally) reaching out to confessing. Sakura constantly finds herself swingingback and forth between falling and confessing as she is always neutrally and unintentially friend-zoned. The anime illustrates the internal struggle of infatuation with your SO and them not reciprocating the feelings you hide in the warm comfortable shade of friendship. This is happening in unique ways between almost all the characters in this series. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun does a good job in depicting the mismatching early stages of friendships starting to cross into love relationships. I rooted for Sakura at first as my original goal for her was to obtain her love, but as the story went on I began to respect her as she matured. Her patience with Nozaki grew while her feelings were unchanged and unwavering. The flame of her feelings was bright and flickering in the beginning but became strong yet steady (a bit more assured and content), humble yet confident. I went from rooting to applauding her growth.\\n\\n\r\nComedy:\\n\r\nThe comedy was more realistic and relatable so I had relatable feelings when the characters found themselves in embarrassing situations. I felt embarrassed at times for them. I wouldn't say that the more laughs in a series the better the comedy, no. I would say that even though I didn\u2019t laugh so much, when I did laugh it was more like when laugh about moments that went a bit wrong or weird or embarrassing. Not like a laugh when one tells a joke. My brand typically is slap stick and over the top ridiculousness (which is what I love about some animes) so I am switching to a calmer pace in the anime which I still enjoyed.\\n",

            "content": "Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun was certainly the best anime of the 2014 summer season and the surprise of the year among many other anime that had much hype, but failed to meet the expected proposal.\r\nWell, Gekkan shoujo Nozaki kun was a comedy / slice of life and speaks of a student named Chiyo Sakura that at first moment falls for Nozaki Umetarou. Clich\u00e9 is not it? But the story is not going in that direction as all we expected. Still well. Sakura asks for an autograph for Nozaki and this thinks she's a fan and then gives her an autograph.The funny thing is that Sakuradiscovers later that Nozaki was not what she really thought. He is not  much romantic. I found this cool character, it\u00b4s not all anime that creat nonstandard character.\\n\\n\r\nGekkan shoujo N.K. is a parody in relation to shoujo anime, because while the shoujo idealizes other characters (especially men), Gekkan shoujo is different because their characters from Nozaki to the Kashima has its faults and some qualities, showing that nobody is perfect. Therefore, the anime is a criticism of certain behavior patterns used in shoujo manga. Nozaki, a mangaka shoujo, is not orthodox to creat characters in his stories. This is the mood of the anime and it is intelligent.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked all the characters (this is rare!) and all they are funny and charismatic. Of course it may not have been some character development, but we must consider that the focus is funny situations that the characters are involved.\\n\\n\r\nIn technical aspects, Gekkan shoujo was very great. The script was diverse and direction focused on various bizarre situations of the characters. That Nozaki scene with Sakura in the rain was very funny. The clumsy way to Nozaki and Sakura increasingly disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was very good. There is fluidity in the movement of the characters, such as hair and facial gestures. The soundtrack is also very good with the use of creativity in opening and ending. The use and color contrast in the opening was very important and inviting the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gekkan shoujo Nozaki kun is an excellent anime and proved that often the genre comedy / slice of life can be better than some mecha and anime action. I recommend this anime for comedy, creativity and criticism that makes certain behavior patterns. The end is somewhat controversial, we do not know if Sakura Nozaki and formed a romantic couple. But I think the anime proposal was not a loving relationship but spend comedy with intelligent humor.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 10/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nEntertainment: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10",

Gotta give it that to theauthor. There are some situations,unimaginable \"well played\".I can spent my whole day flattering its Comedy factor and its aspects. Absolutely brilliant!!\\n\r\nTho the romance....Its the all times hated \"hint of romantic interest and she never made any attempts to reveal it\". . . IF you came for the romance, well f*ck you and f*ck me, i came for the romance too... *Sniff Sniff* that sour taste of disappointment...\\n\r\nNext comes the characters.Well you can describe them with 2 words ironic and Lame...really really lame..Why? Well they are good if you want to use them only for comedy(irony part),if not the comedy the chars where disgusting....I mean you can't easily relate to them or their problem...you know nothing about them...Plus more of them has no logical way of thinking or a steady personality...well that's when irony comes again and smooths things a bit.\\n\r\nThe art on the other hand is really good for a comedy.Perfect depiction of the jokes and the faces of the characters.Not to forget, cute,beautiful and pleasant in general. :)\\n\r\nThere music is very good too.Some nice OSTs , an nice fitting comedic OP song...but the ED... i think it tried to be romantic....From my point of view, it was a \"Romantic-not\" ED that had no future!\\n\r\n------------------------------------Personal opinion and weaknesses-------------------------------------\\n\r\nWell lets start about the fact that the characters got 0 background or insights and no steady personality and let me continue of explain how unnatural and fictional they are...Imagine an otaku to be more popular with girls from a tall muscular guy...Ironical huh? Well if that wasn't a comedy it would be ridiculous, but its a comedy and im not gonna stay and criticize it.Continuing with the fact that, it really gives more emphasis to comedy,have almost 0 process on the romantic factor or characters,interactions and only some small teasing.I can't deny the very good use of the characters in situations, indeed is very well made, but some times it had its moments i felt completely detached and felt really bored. . . that's what i mean, thank goodness it had some \"romance\"...Yea im referring to those small hints and sweet moments... Those helped a lot at relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end?Well its a pretty god damn good comedy with epic gags and well memed scenes!If you came for the romance f*ck your feelings and come and cry with me! T_T\\n\r\nIf you are into the comedy genre i suggest you to jump in. The ending was satisfying and i can say i laughed more than i should had with this one!!Hereby i recommend it to everyone that came here for comedy and not romance.\\n\r\nReasons to watch it:\\n\r\n-MC named Sakura and it AIN'T ANNOYING AS HELL.\\n\r\n-Top Notch comedy.Epic.Hilarious.God tier.Original.\\n",

Through a misunderstood confession, Sakura begins helping Nozaki fill out betas, eventually ending up helping Nozaki come up with story ideas for his shoujo manga, as he is a tall, unromantic deadpan. Along the way we are introduced to a cast of memorable characters that parodystandard shoujo tropes. \\n\\n\r\nMikoshiba is an attractive, red-haired delinquent character that is actually an incredibly shy otaku, affectionately called Mikorin and used as the model for Nozaki's heroine, Mamiko. Kashima, nicknamed \"The Prince\" is your standard ikemen, attracting all of the girls, the difference being that she herself is a girl as well. Many more characters parody common shoujo tropes and all of the characters support the show with their own varieties of side-splitting humor.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the most hilarious shows I've ever seen, with a cast of extremely memorable characters. The art in the show is very well-done, and often copies the art styles of common shoujo manga, with hilariously well-done facial expressions. The music is incredibly fitting to the different moods and well-done in general. I never skipped the opening while watching this show, and found it to be one of the most catchy and infectious openings I've listened to in anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is a short, sweet and hilarious anime that is definitely worth watching.",

If you like romantic comedies, this anime is absolutely perfect for you. And what's more, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun basically has two romantic comedies in one since there are two pairs of people that are constantly paired together. (Oh my this is so hard to write without going into details, but I don't want to spoil it for you if you haven't watched this yet).\r\nI do think that this anime leans more to the comedy side, with hints of romance thrown around here andthere to tease the audience. It's terrible because my heart strings have been tugged at so many times when watching this anime. Basically, throughout the whole anime, you'll be like, \"When will they get together?\", and get frustrated when they don't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this anime a lot.

I enjoyed the variety in terms of character and thought that there were many, funny and unexpected moments that made it very enjoyable to watch. The voice actors were also great and it's interesting when they have anime shows about manga or anime. I think they did that exceptionally well in this show. Overall, I think that the art was good, but the humor was definitely the highlight. It would be a good show to watch if you want to have a laugh. I would say that serious moments are actually rare, but that doesn't meanthat it doesn't blend multiple moods well. I think the summary alone got me interested in this show before I watched it.",

            "content": "The story  of Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun starts off with our adorable lead female protagonist, Chiyo trying to confess her love to this guy named Umetar\u014d Nozaki .However, while nervously trying to do so, Nozaki mistakens her for a fan and gives her his autograph.\r\nAnd you know why he would think that? Well, that\u2019s because our male protagonist Nozaki over here is secretly a shoujo manga artist.  \r\nNow since in order to get closer to Nozaki she agrees to be his assistant and help him out with his work, during which Sakura learns more about Nozaki and also begins to interact with otherindividuals that also help him or serve as inspirations for his manga characters. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s basically the plot of the show and to it doesn\u2019t sound that interesting on paper if you ask me. In fact, I started watching this anime in hopes that it will be a sweet and fluffy romantic comedy, but instead I got a crack like addictive comedy that makes me laugh till I wet my pants.  And you may ask - is that better? Well in my opinion, yeah, it is!\\n\\n\r\nEach and every character in this series is unique in their own way, even if some of them don\u2019t get as much as character development as I wanted them to get. But, hey the anime is only twelve episodes so I\u2019ll let it slide mainly because of what they lack in development they make up for it in their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of let\u2019s talk about the titular character Nozaki. Now, I hate to say this but I felt at first that he was this expressionless and boring dude. And I am guilty for assuming that based simply on his looks. However, as the series progressed the dude really does end up being spectacular and hilarious.  Also, I love how one of the running gags in the series happens to be how Nozaki is so invested in being a manga artist that he has no idea how to have a normal social life. That\u2019s quality entertainment right there!\\n\\n\r\nNow, let\u2019s move onto my two very favourite supporting characters Kashima and Hori. Now, Kashima believe it or not is a girl. I mean she is like what the host club would want Haruhi to be like. And that is a player my friends. Ah yes, Kashima over here is the prince of the school and all the girls go crazy for her. Now in life, you\u2019d be like \u2018heh?\u201d. But, since this is an anime, it sure as hell some great entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the tsundere of the anime happens to be a guy named Hori. And might I add, why the heck aren\u2019t there more male tsunderes in anime? So, yeah I know this sounds wrong but you have to admit that you love it when this guy channels in the spirit of Shizou Heiwajima and beats the crap out Kashima. She should know by now that she shouldn\u2019t piss this guy off. Like seriously just don\u2019t!\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s a shame that these two didn\u2019t get enough screen time, because their on screen presence is just phenomenal. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have Mikorin, an actual red headed flirtatious guys that despite being a complete cheeseball is really a shy and sweet guy who gets embarrassed after he uses his dumb pick up lines. He is one of Nozaki\u2019s friends and Nozaki\u2019s inspiration for his female character Mamiko. He too is one of the reasons why the show works and he and Nozaki has an awesome bromance may I add.\\n\\n\r\nLast but certainly not least we have got Sakura Chiyo. Now at first I wasn\u2019t sure whether she\u2019d be an interesting female character or not and thank god I was wrong. I am pretty sure many teenage girls can somewhat relate to her situation of being friendzoned.I know I can! Anyway, I really do adore Chiyo because she is really a beautiful, sweet, sincere, and artistic girl who happens to be shy hopeless romantic. Nozaki is a damn lucky guy that a girl like Chiyo has a thing for him. I mean come on, she is so worth cosplaying!\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the that bugged me most about this show was the fact there was no romantic development between Nozaki and Chiyo. This is clearly labelled as a romantic comedy and I was disappointed that there wasn\u2019t much romance as opposed to comedy. Now, this does not make the series bad but it really disappoints all those teenage girls and guys that wanted sappy confessions and passionate kisses. However, some like me might not even care that much about that because this show is awesomesauce none the less. \\n\\n\r\nThen again, that definitely does not mean that Nozaki and Chiyo\u2019s relationship doesn\u2019t grow. I mean they do end up being close friends but we and by we I mean Chiyo wanted some goddamn romance!\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the series really didn\u2019t feel like an ending and this is what I hate about 12 episode animes because sometimes they can\u2019t seem to wrap everything in a tiny little bow. The story was incomplete and I really hope the show will be renewed for a second season. I mean, it\u2019s gotta happen!\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the reason another thing that took away from this series was Seo, who just didn\u2019t appeal to me and I found her really loud and annoying.However, that\u2019s my personal opinion and if you love her I can\u2019t really hunt you down and take your soul. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the animation for gekkan shoujo nozaki kun was amazing done because the studio made everything look so vibrant and colourful. I mean, the character designs are very well executed, not to mention how clean and detailed it is they look.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I may the adore the show but I really want to talk about it\u2019s opening. I mean, in my opinion it\u2019s funny and awesome way to really introduce the audience to the series. All our favourite characters are present in the opening and the song is such an earworm. I mean the song is the type of thing I feel like dancing to after I come home after finishing my exams. But, I really do the dance inside my head because a three exam tends to drain my battery.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, just listening to this song makes me all energized and alive. Reason why, I even bothered doing this review! Anywho, so after carefully analyzing this anime while desperately trying not to laugh out loud like Patrick Star. I have decided to give Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun an 8 out of 10. It is definitely one of the best 2014 offered and I really desperately want a second season for this show. Like please make it happen!\\n",

            "content": "Story: 5\r\nAlthough I do understand that this anime is very much reminiscent of the randomness of Nichijou and its main aspect is focused on comedy, it's either a hit or miss for some viewers. Unfortunately for me, the show eventually fell flat towards the final episodes (I stopped at episode 10, then skipped to 12 for the ending). I guess as a viewer, I enjoy a nice anime with a plot. Now I know this isn't a valid reason to bash on GSNK, because the anime is a lighthearted comedy, but from a personal preference, I prefer plot over comedy (this is solely a personalpreference so you can disregard this piece of information). I did love the random antics each episode provided with new introduction of varied characters also, but after a while the comedy began falling flat and it got sort of repetitive. There are however sweet moments which I really cherish and thought were adorable! I really loved the ending (fluff fluff fluff fluff), it was very moving considering it\u2019s a romantic comedy. It almost brought me to tears hehe (who am I kidding, I had tears in my eyes already). I do like how the anime is almost as a parody of shoujo, something quite new and fresh. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 \\n\r\nThe production team definitely provides quality and detail in their work just by looking at the scenery, lighting, and structures. I love the colorful designs of each character.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nTo be honest, there wasn't really anything memorable from the OST, but like most OSTs, it did help paint a nice atmosphere when necessary. (I did however love a cello piece, I hope to find what it's called).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nI love the wide variety of characters the writers have provided, although at times I feel confused about their personalities. Does Hori have a love interest with Kashima? Or is it sort of a Senpai-Kouhai complex? Either way, the characters do make me feel conflicted at times. Also, they seem too predictable at times also\u2026 Mikoshiba will act in his gaudy persona only to regret it and sulk to Sakura. Kashima is almost the same as Mikoshiba (except not sulking afterwards), only to have Hori hurl some sort of object to her head. As much as I understand Nozaki being extremely dedicated to being a mangaka, I sort of feel he is overdoing it maybe a smudge bit too much\u2026 thus making him seem predictable (even Sakura feels the same way!). Seo is always up to her mischievous antics also.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nAll in all, it was a pretty lighthearted watch. I would recommend if you want a good laugh out of your day.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7",

I found the voice-drama hilarious, so I was actually expecting the show to be good.\r\nBut it was good. Actually really good.\r\nFirstly, the voice actor for Main Girl character Sakura Chiyo was one of my favourite voice-actor; Ari Ozawa (Who if you don't remember, she played for Kurumi in Gakkou Gurashi and Papi in Monmusu)and Nakahara Mai. (Who if you don't remember, she played for Nagisa in Clannad and Rena from Higurashi...... Wait, how does that work!?)\\n\\n\r\n Including her, number of great seasoned voice-actors were in the show to lighten up each character's personality and cuteness to maximum.\\n\\n\r\n The story itself was well done and art style was quite fantastic as well for it was based on a Shoujo Manga.\\n\\n\r\n I really love the story of 'Notice-Me-Senpai' and Oblivious man's story. (Except Kodaka's case. He can just go to hell.) As for that fact, Nozaki-Kun's story was 'Amazing'.\\n\\n\r\n Really recommended to anyone even if you dislike Shoujo Anime.\\n\\n\r\n Then, Until my next review......\\n\\n\r\n Sayonara~",

            "content": "My experience with anime in general so far is fairly limited, which I think is part of what made this anime's brand of meta humor especially effective for me. It plays on tropes that are common throughout all media and in doing so emphasizes the actual, hilarious, implications of certain character archetypes. \r\nIn essence, the anime takes what in other contexts might be considered one-sided characters and develops them through arcs that maintain the underlying characteristics. The most prominent of these changes is in how they interact with one another as they increasingly understand and accept their shortcomings. \r\nThe humor is uninterrupted, drawing on interestingsituations and interactions. Many of the main characters take on tropes normally associated with secondary characters, precisely because those tropes are not too well thought out, so when the anime takes them to their logical conclusions, they create interesting situations. Many of the situations, some of which were set up over the course of much of an episode, completely made sense within the contexts all of the characters. However, due to being extremely generic, situations that typically act as backdrops, the subversions were great, made sense, but unpredictable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, everything about this show is very memorable. It is hard to fault the story-line for being, at its core, pretty trope loaded, since many of those tropes were reinterpreted in ways that suited the characters. Looking back, it is impressive how well-structured it was with all the arcs, flowing smoothly. This is a unique character-driven meta comedy that will be memorable to most.",

            "content": "GENERAL - Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun  takes the comedy shoujo genre in an interesting way. A lot of trends in this genre get switched around for this shows comedy.\r\nIn the story we follow Chiyo who ends up helping our other main lead Nozaki with his manga. Most of the shows comedy comes from the different situations in which Nozaki turns real life events into manga form and turns out in a reallly comedic way. \r\nThe episodes are usually divided into 2 segments not related  to each other.  This works to its benefit since it allows each section to focus on a certain groupof characters.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - So the main characters we follow are Chiyo and Nozaki. As well as a supporting cast of  characters such as Mikoshiba, Seo, and Ken.\\n\\n\r\nEach of these characters have there own trates that help to give many forms of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - The  sound of Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun ranges form up beat music to some over dramatic soundtracks for comedic purposes. It doesn't have an amazing soundtrack however it fits the series well.\\n\\n\r\nART / ANIMATION -  This is a very interesting series since its focus is on manga and due to this we get many sectiosn taht are showing manga  images and is doen perfectly. Another way in which the art / animation adds comedy is in its change to its chibi art style at times.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - This is probably the funiest series I have seen so far. There are episodes where there is non stop comedy and 99% of it works. \\n\\n\r\nW hen it comes to any comedy anime opinions on it will be very different depending on who you ask. There are many types of comedy as such not everyone will find every type of comedy funny, However Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun covers a wide range of comedy and can appeal to a wide audience.\\n\\n\r\nSCORE - 9.0\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT - 10\\n",

Instead of making the reactions of the characters choppy to show a sense of immediate disapproval, they made the reactions build themselves to give a realistic sense of the person contemplating the stupid action or line the other characters just performed or said. The colors were very vibrant which I felt fit very well seeing as it is an anime about shojo manga. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe intro song caught me immediately. I never skipped it! The chilled groove and the perfect video to go with the sound was amazing! Outro was decent but compared to the intro, it's nothing more to go into detail about. The voice actors surprised me at first as I felt like they didn't really hold a real fit to their characters but they grew on me sanfigant To a point where I really can't imagine any voice actors replacing anyone without it losing the feel of the anime. The emotions of the characters were delivered well through the actors and it most certainly gave it very engulfing scene during plot developments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAgain, it is a story that personifies \"Notice me senpai!\" so there really is only one course of story it could take but I do thing it hit everything that needed to be done well and continued to hold a hook throughout that kept me from losing my interest. I also felt that while they were able to continue along with the main story between Chiyo and Nozaki, they were also able to create enough for the side characters to feel like they were pursuing their own story as well, which I felt was well done in the sense of creating stories in stories.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter developments were rather stiff, as every character had to follow a certain course to be used as material in the story for Nozaki to use them in his manga so it was rather one dimensional personality wise. Now after getting past the awkward character introductions, the relationship developments were where the characters really shown as every character benefited the other in the pair or constantly pushed the dull one dimensional characteristics to a slightly more enjoyable run of cliche actions and events. As low as I put this on my review, I think it is a very important part of why I enjoyed this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWrapping up, Monthly Girls' Nozaki-Kun is worth the watch if you enjoy seeing senpai ignore everything! It really did take me a little longer than I wish I could say it did, but like I said when I started this review, it really isn't something that be can watched in one sitting as it is slow and rather progression less. My final score will end up being an 8/10 because I feel they did a very strong job overall putting the anime together and keeping every part holding each other together to make it look better in the long run even without any real character backstories or plots.\\n",

            "content": "Let me first start by saying that it will be a huge mistake to watch this anime with a romance mindset. If you are expecting a lot of emphasis on the romance you will definitely be disappointed. it got a romance undertone but it is still not the focus of the show \r\nStory (8/10):\r\nThe story of this anime is that of friendship. what begins with a failed attempt for a love confession blossoms into a great friendship and help the creation of a nice little circle of friends that help each other and laugh together.\r\nThe show offer some top-notch comedy mainly because of it's collectionof oddball characters even the two main characters are oddballs and situations resulted by that gathering are fun to watch \\n\r\nTime and time again Sakura misinterpret the situation or get misunderstood and the love that she wants does not come into fruition (and resulting in some of the good comedy this show has to offer). You might think that to be sad and frustrating but you will realizes that after spending so much time with Nozaki and becoming good friends she fully understands the kind of man he is and those failures don't bother her at all and she continue to have hope that she will get her feeling across some day \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10):\\n\r\nLike i said before the show comedy is highly dependent on it's collection of oddball characters. each of the characters (with Sakura being maybe the only exception) have these quirks that don't really match with their appearance at all wich leads into some good comedy.\\n\r\nThe character interactions were a blast to watch and you can measure the characters growth by the way these interactions change from episode to episode (Sakura reactions to her failures that i mentioned earlier being the prime example)\\n\r\nThe relationships between characters do have some development but not really that heavy (but still not dismissible)\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10):\\n\r\nBackgrounds did have some nice scenes from time to time and the character designs were nice as well and they tried change it up to a more goofy art style when the time was right to help out with the comedic vipe which worked out pretty well\\n\r\nsame goes for the animations \\n\\n\r\nMusic & VA (8/10):\\n\r\nCan't really anything in detail about the music of the show, the music matched the vibe of the show and gave it the Comedy/slice of life feeling that it needed. The OP and ED were nice not amazing but not half bad either.\\n\r\nI watched the DUB for this one and let me say that they did a really good job with it. The voice acting was superb and i am pretty sure that the actors did some ad-libbing cause some of the reactions were just too perfect for the scenes :D\\n\\n\r\nEffectiveness (9/10):\\n\r\nIt might be a little exaggeration that this was one of the best comedy shows i have ever watched but seriously i enjoyed it so much. I am sure that if it had less comedy and more focus on the romance it would still be a great show but i would not have enjoyed it so much so i am happy with the way it went. It's not that i have anything against romance on the contrary some of my favorite shows are of the romance genre. it just that i felt that they did such a great job with the comedy that it would be a shame if they did it any other way\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.5/10)",

            "content": "NO SPOILERS REVIEW: No spoilers to ANY OF THE EPISODES.\r\n, if you were worried :)\r\n1 SECOND REVIEW - WATCH IT IF YOU LIKE ROM-COM-SLICE OF LIFE, THAT'S FOR SURE!\r\nthe real review : \r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is one of my favourite romance/school animes out there, it was one of the first one's I watched, and continue to re-watch as one of my favourites.\r\nStory - 7\r\nThe story overall is about a girl named Chiyo Sakura, an average highschooler who has a passion for art and her quest for her crush Umetar\u014d Nozaki, a airheaded highschool mangaka who lives alone in his apartment. Throughout the series she triesher best to help him anyway she can. Although the common \"notice me senpai\" type of series is sorta worn itself out. I find they add many fantastic characters to complement it in a way I haven't seen before. (As i'll get into in my character breakdown)\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nThe backgrounds were well done, and the opening, WOW, awesome manga-to-anime animation going on there, although nothing to REALLY write home about, it was well done and complemented each scene well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nSomething that I'll always remember from this anime is the soundtrack, the BEAUTIFUL sound arrangements in this anime, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVJ6EYOjkJ4 - this piano arrangement throughout the anime, but differently produced depending on the scene at hand, was amazing. As the music carries on it starts off faded, not at peace, kind of ignored in broad daylight sorta feel. But as it carries on it becomes more refreshing and that things get better as time goes on, as it shows throughout the anime.\\n\r\nFull OST here for anyone interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsJQ07B-LgI\\n\r\n(Also, as for the ED, it shows Chiyo almost dreaming for a better tomorrow, that she's getting closer to having her love me respected, and seen. The OP was great, introduces each character, and has Chiyo running up to Nozaki as he looks back to notice her, something she has trouble with in this anime, well done! Both songs are good too, OP more than ED, but that's just my taste in music!)\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\r\nAlthough there are a couple of cliches here, some of the original character personality traits in this anime are rememberable and add so much to whats lacking with it's \"notice me senpai\" plot. (Because, let's be honest here, Sakura wants Nozaki to notice she loves him, and this is her goal throughout the story of 12 episodes, it would be boring without some other minor subplots and other love interests, amirite?)\\n\\n\r\n(VERY MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD, *FIRST EPISODE* KIND-OF SPOILERS, NOTHING LATE)\\n\\n\r\nSakura Chiyo,\\n\r\nAlready explained Sakura Chiyo above to an extent so I'll keep it simple, she's a highschooler who loves art and wants Nozaki to see that she is interested in him in a romantic way, not a fan girl way.\\n\\n\r\nNozaki-kun,\\n\r\n as explained above is an airheard, not realizing Sakura is actually crushing on him, but thinking she is a fan of his work in the manga industry and gives her a job and puts her to work. As funny as this is, it , as explained above would get eventually boring, so that's why we have these characters to compensate!\\n\\n\r\nMikoto Mikoshiba,\\n\r\nYour typical good looking highschooler, but the only thing is, he isn't what his looks show! He loves playing Romantic-Visual Novel Games and collects figures in secret. This shows throughout the anime of his real personality that isn't shown in the highschool environment, he is a someone who sometimes struggles on the inside with social phobias, and self-looking paranoia, only saying things to look cool, as what happened when he was asked to model/act, only becoming more interested if someone were to compliment him. He is a good guy on the inside, also interested, as all three of the main side - guys in this anime are, in Nozaki's romantic interest. (They do ask him down the line about it, his reaction, or what you can call it, is hilarious) \\n\\n\r\nYuzuki Seo,\\n\r\n(Now, Seo is my favourite girl in this anime, so I'm going to try to be UNBIASED HERE!)\\n\r\nOut of my favourite subplots, maybe plots PERIOD in this anime has to be the Seo - Wakamatsu one, I won't get into it too much, but to describe Yuzuki properly, she's airheaded almost to the point of Nozaki. Probably the most straightforward, in her own fault, but adding hilarious lines to the anime I wasn't expecting! She also may come off a bit rude but always means well. She has a strong mind that is determined to do something, throughout the anime she hints on her love interest, but I won't spoil that for anyone, watch the anime!! (She can also sing like a goddess, did I care to mention that??) - no - but this is a no spoiler review, so I won't get into that :)\\n\\n\r\nHirotaka Wakamatsu,\\n\r\nHighschool basketball player, shy about his real feelings, makes up hilarious-but silly reasons to do things we all know the /real/ reason he's doing it for. But hey, it makes it funny and his innocence compliments Seo's straightforward offputtingness well! That's pretty much it for him, with no spoilers into it.\\n\\n\r\nMasayuki Hori,\\n\r\nHe may be a smaller in physical form, but his personality screams BOSS mentality! Hori is the highschool president of the drama club, getting Kashima (who I'll get into in a minute) to do whatever she can to help the club succeed, he also doesn't put up with Kashima acting silly or showing her emotions that he's too narrow-headed to see what's REALLY behind them.\\n\\n\r\nY\u016b Kashima,\\n\r\nKashima, like many characteristics, is one unique personality in this show, a clean cut, tall, skinny, good looking charmer, drama acting star, did I mention the girls at school love *HER!* yes! *She is a she! She even plays the prince role in the play because of her qualities to be manly! Throughout the story she seems to have feelings for Hori, who I mentioned earlier just dismisses the actions of her feelings for being her just acting like an idiot. She is a well though out character and something refreshing into the many subplots this show introduces.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters are great, and even though some aren't the most original, the REAL original parts are what make me love this show for what it is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nAs someone who loves Rom-Com-Slice of life shows, this show was a breath of fresh air, I re-watch the episodes monthly on Crunchyroll to get a good laugh! As stated earlier, but I'll go farther into it here, the shortcomings this show brings, are what literally 99% OF ALL SHOWS BRING! Not everythings original, but this is what's AMAZING about Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, it makes up for it with it's OVERWHELMING originality through subplots and side-characters who usually would be ignored in a rom-com (I can make a list of side-chars you wouldn't remember after watching a Rom-Com-Slice anime by the time you'd be done watching) With this anime, I know everyone as I do Nozaki and Chiyo, as I know their background and interests! All of this together makes me enjoy this anime as one of the most enjoyable anime's I've ever watched- EVER!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nAs everything I mention above comes together, what you get  with Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is what far more than you will expect from a Shoujo-Rom-Com, you will see many plots develop inside a plot that is still unfolding! I can't go too far into it because, well, spoilers, but all I can say now is,\\n\\n\r\nWATCH THIS ANIME! It's PRETTY MUCH 4 PLOTS IN ONE! All pretty original and great!\\n\\n\r\nHope this helps and ENJOY!\\n\r\n(if you want any extra info/etc about this anime, or my thoughts, message me, I LOVE talking about it!)\\n\\n\r\n-Kondo_22\\n",

            "content": "I really enjoyed this anime for the first half, and then it started to grow a bit stalet, but retained some humourous momentum. I was expecting a romantic comedy, but that's not really what I got.  What I got was a comedy of shoujo romance manga writing.\r\nStory (3/10):  Ostensibly the plot is about Sakura Chiyo, a bright and cheerful 16 year old, who has a mad crush on her tall, dark, and laconic classmate Nozaki Umetarou.  When she gets herself to confess her love to him, she hems and haws and stutters so much that he mistakes her for a fan, andthinks she is asking for his autograph -- since he has a second life as a shoujo mangaka.  When she tries to tell him she wants to be closer to him, he invites her to his home -- but his intent is to rope her into being his assistant.  And this is what all the \"romance\" in the show looks like:  some situation develops that makes Sakura hope for a specific romantic outcome as in shoujo manga, but Nozaki will inevitably turn it into something completely different, related to writing shoujo manga instead.\\n\\n\r\nIn reality there isn't really a plot at all, or even slice of life, but this anime originates with a 4-koma (panel) manga, and so it's a whole bunch of consecutive gags, some of them running.  And it does parody shoujo manga to some degree, but spends more time on a parody of the life of a shoujo mangaka, and the way it parodies shoujo manga is quite superficial, and mostly consists of swapping genders.  \\n\\n\r\nSomewhat ironically, this parody of formulaic manga is as one-dimensional as that which it parodies.\\n\\n\r\nI am rating the story very low, which might not be fair to 4-koma, but if one isn't prepared for this, as many people in the West are not because they don't often know of the manga before the anime, the expectation will be that with this particular opening, it'll become a romance.  It is, in fact, classified as a romance on MAL, and the synopsis is equally misleading -- it's not a romance.  At all.  Nothing romantic ever develops.  And one-sided, unrequited adoration that's played for gags is not romantic, it's just -- possibly -- funny.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10):  Top notch.  It's beautifully detailed, and extremely well done even in comedic moments; the anime does not simply relegate its funny moments to chibi and SD as is common, but it does a lot of visually physical comedy -- somebody embarrassed doesn't just get red in the face, but might instead roll into an accelerating ball that gets smaller and smaller until it hides in a corner.  It's brilliant.  The characters are all well distinguished and easily recognizable.  The animation is very good; fluid and smooth.  If only all anime had such good art, I'd be a very happy camper.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10): The OP and ED are peppy, the BGM is very well adapted to the show.  None of the voice actors really stand out for me (none of my favourites here either), and I find it hard to judge comedy anyway, but they all fit their characters well and don't overact in general.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4/10):  The main characters are well established as a type, but they're one trick ponies, and they don't develop.  Nozaki is completely oblivious; Sakura expects romantic moments, which will be dashed by a completely prosaic response; Mikoshiba can't properly relate to strangers, expresses some extravagant braggadocio and gets horribly embarrassed by it; Seo is rude, aggressive and oblivious but sings like an angel; Kashima is the \"prince\" of the school, flirts with other girls and admires her senpai Hori, who beats her up (I don't really know why); Wakamatsu can't stand Seo but loves the voice of the Glee Club's \"Lorelei\", which unbeknownst to him is Seo...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):  The show employs for the most part a form of manzai, traditional Japanese stand-up comedy with a straight man (tsukkomi) and a funny man (boke), where the jokes revolve around mutual misunderstandings, double-talk, and other verbal gags, and I generally enjoy what little I have seen of that translated (my Japanese is not good enough to get it in the original; it's generally too fast).  The anime was funny for most of the episodes during which new characters were introduced, but when that stopped, the humour started to feel more and more like they were flogging a dead horse.  There was also some extent of explaining the jokes; I am not dense, I got it the first time.  But there were some really hilarious bits, and I laughed out loud at times, something that's not actually common for me with anime comedies, which I usually find more painful than funny.\\n\\n\r\nThere were also are a few aspects about the characters I liked:  Sakura is not ruled by her romantic aspirations, and she doesn't degrade constantly into the manners she displayed during her confession; she actually has it pretty well together most of the time -- she manages to work with and talk with Nozaki like a normal friend/assistant, with short exceptions when she has one of those romance-inducing moments.  She's also the only one undergoing some minimal character development, because she comes to accept how Nozaki really is instead of how she wishes he were.  And while Nozaki isn't much of a friend, but uses everything and everyone as grist for his mill, he isn't the sexually harassing type either, so that's a relief.  In fact the show is blissfully free of sexual innuendo and fan service.\\n\\n\r\nCoda:  Clearly needed moar tanuki.  ;)",

            "content": "I started watching part of the first episode back in 2016 so this was an anime that was placed on-hold in my list. But why? Well because back then, I was still new to the anime industry and wasn't really interested yet in Slice of Life, Comedy genres. But I actually regret that I did that cause I missed out on the good laughs that I just had revisiting this later in 2018. Now I am really happy that I finished watching this show. \r\nIf you expected that this was a Shoujo anime because of its title, don't worry I expected that too at first.Actually, it is not even though the main character is the girl. Although there might be a few elements that makes this anime qualify as shoujo, still it is enjoyable for all genders so don't be afraid and watch this cause you'll be in for a good laugh. Starting with the story, I am pleased about the uniqueness of this series. The story is progressive and if there are some unexplained parts yet, there are flashbacks that will be shown for the audience to catch up with the plot. The main attraction of the show would be its comic relief essence. Well actually, this show has more comedy than it has romance to be honest. I can't remember how many times I laughed my arse off from the intense comedy that this show has. The art style is really beautiful and it might make you fall in love with it and it is one of the good points of this show. The soundtrack.. I really liked the opening and it shows the personalities of the characters very well during the sequence. No spoilers on it and that's a good thing unlike most opening sequences out there. The characters... you would not believe how dense the main characters are.. probably denser than osmium or any other element. But.. they have great development though so that makes up for the negative things. However, their density leads to comic relief scenes so maybe that's the point. I enjoyed this show really well and I regret that I didn't see this sooner but there's just this one thing that I have insights on. Things didn't fully worked out in the end so... will there be a season 2?",

Technically speaking, this anime IS a romantic comedy, but if you were looking for an anime that focused more heavily  on the romance aspect then you might want look other places. \r\nHow the show begins with its first scenes is rather typical of a romance series however, Sakura is attempting to confess to Nozaki-kun, however, what follows is nothing less than amusing. The story primarily follows Nozaki and Sakura as well as their circle of five friends. All of them either directly or indirectly assist Nozaki in creating his manga.\r\nI'll admit, the characters are interesting towatch and are quite memorable. They each have unique personalities that do well to add to the comedy of the series. However, none of them change by the end of all the episodes; they're all static characters. That doesn't mean it's impossible to want to root for them or think they're entertaining, but character development does not have a heavy influence here.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is great. It's so fun to listen to and fits the tone of the series perfectly. I wasn't so impressed with the ending theme, but I think that may have had more to do with me not being taken by the visuals that went along with it. The music within the show proper is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nArt was fine. It was pretty good, nothing terrible ,but it wasn't really anything astounding either. I liked the vibrant colors though.\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, though it has its shortcomings I really like this series. It will definitely end up on my favorites. I laughed a lot, the theme song was fun, and it was appealing to my eyes.",

        {
            "content": "If you asked me to describe this show briefly, I\u2019d simply say \u201cHilarious\u201d.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is a pretty simple initial setup. The basic gist of it is that Chiyo, a highschooler, has a crush on Nozaki. Through a various series of events, she ends up discovering Nozaki is actually creates a popular shoujo romance manga and ends up joining him and a few other helpers of his in creating his manga. Through this setup we meet a whole cast of colorful characters and interesting events.\r\nLet me first cover the main and most important aspect of this show. The humor. It is simply brilliant, one of thefunniest shows I\u2019ve seen in a loong time. It is incredibly smart, and switches between various types of humor flawlessly. At first I was a little offput by it\u2019s reliance on \u2018blush humor\u2019 as I like to call it, in the first episode, but it quickly brushed away any concerns I had. You know those jokes that randomly pop into your head at the randomest times and make you chuckle and get you funny looks from the people around you? Yeah, this show is loaded with those. There would be jokes where I would be chuckling after the joke was over just thinking about it again. Not only that, but the humor is fast, too. There is almost no event in the show that isn\u2019t used for a joke or gag of some kind, and each episode is loaded to the bursting point with humor, and there are plenty of parodies of common Shoujo manga and anime tropes, often displayed through the contrast between Nozaki\u2019s manga and their lives. That said, I feel the massive amountof humor hurts the show a little. \\n\\n\r\nA common flaw in comedies is that they lack substance, or fail to properly balance drama and humor. This show has literally no real drama of any kind, and the character\u2019s relationships were very under-developed due to the lack of jokeless moments that are used to develop the characters and their personalities. Though this show is hilarious, I wouldn\u2019t have minded just a little less humor in order to give the show more depth. While the final episode focused more on being heartwarming and pleasant, even then it failed to make a satisfactory commitment despite still managing to be a really enjoyable finale to the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nFor the majority these characters were handled very well, their interactions with each other are extremely enjoyable to watch, and most of the cast has really good comedic chemistry. As I mentioned earlier, a lot of these characters don\u2019t have much development due to the near-explicit focus on humor, but they are still very fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nChiyo is our main source of grounding in the show, and is for the most part the main character. A lot of the show is focused on things from her point of view, though it does switch it around a little. Her inner monologue and quick and varied display of emotions and reactions brings a lot of the humor, and she was definitely one of my favorites in the show. She was a solid character that really made you root for her.\\n\\n\r\nNozaki is one of the more distant people in the show. He gets plenty of screentime, but his character is still pretty unpredictable and it\u2019s hard to get an idea of his thought process. As the show goes on, we do get a bit more of idea of what he\u2019s like, and it is very fun to see his almost child-like way of going about things, especially considering his manly and mysterious demeanor.\\n\\n\r\nMikoshiba is a character that feels rather like a third wheel within the show. He\u2019s the only character without a true pairing or compliment to him, and isn\u2019t incredibly memorable either. He\u2019s fun to watch for certain, but feels rather undeveloped and uncharacterized especially in a show where that\u2019s already a problem.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m pairing Masayuki and Kashima in this bit because it\u2019s hard to talk about them separately. These characters are incredibly funny. This show really knows how to do proper slapstick, and Masayuki\u2019s reactions to Kashima\u2019s actions are hilarious. Their moments together are some of the funniest in the entirety of the show. Seperately, Masayuki is a good character, and like Chiyo is very solid and pretty grounding. Kashima on the other hand is a lot less well-defined, and a lot of her actions are either based around her popularity with girls, or her obsession with Masayuki.\\n\\n\r\nNow I have to mention Seo and Wakamatsu. Personally I found these characters to be my least favorite in the show out of the mains. They weren\u2019t quite as funny as the other characters, and much like Mikoshiba were rather undefined and lacking in depth. And rather strangely considering their differences, to me at least they felt a lot like a poorer version of the same contrast between Masayuki and Kashima.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with that there is the somewhat small cast of side characters, with some being a good source of humor like Maeno and Ken-san, and then there\u2019s Yukari, who was so forgettable I legitimately forgot she existed.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is about average considering today\u2019s standards. It isn\u2019t completely smooth, and there are some uses of common cheaper tactics used in animation. Even the look itself isn\u2019t very unique or special. However, it succeeded in having a pleasant look to it, as well as having some very nice looking backgrounds. The animation on the character expressions, overlays, and insane reactions all contributed beautifully to the humor, and the show likely wouldn\u2019t be near as funny without it, along with this, the Character Designs look phenomenal. Though it certainly could\u2019ve been better, I think for what it did it did it well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nOverall pretty solid, as far as sound goes. The Voice Acting was perfectly fine as far as I can tell, and the voices for most of them felt spot on. The music as well I found to be really good. Generally I don\u2019t remember the soundtrack to a show, especially Comedies considering how much the humor distracts you from the music, but I noticed this show had a really good OST that pleasantly contributed to the mood of the show, changing pace and tone to fit the varying situations. The Opening for this show is my favorite of the season, and just a great song in general. Incredibly solid and well done.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nFor all it\u2019s downsides when it comes to character development, there is one main factor when it comes to making a comedy. And that is being funny. Does this show succeed? Heck yes! The humor is incredibly well-paced, memorable, and hilarious. It also manages to cover a broad range of comedic styles, and there is never a dull moment. Even further, due to the quick yet brilliant pacing of the show, it has an incredibly high rewatchability level. This show is packed with gif-able material, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it retain a fair amount of popularity and possibly gain further seasons. Even the ending, though not being quite as satisfactory as it could\u2019ve been, still was enjoyable and went out on a pretty positive note.\\n\\n\r\n(Originally Written September 22nd, 2014)\\n\\n\r\nhttps://writtenandwriting.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is not a great tale of romance, it is not a fantastic slice of life, it isn't a harem comedy, it's not an amazing unique or  innovative series.\r\nIt IS a good series though.\r\nWhat Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun brings to the table is a solid bit of comedy in a scenario that surprisingly HASN'T been done to death. Specifically, single girl has crush on a guy, no other love interests on either side are getting in the way, and a combination of shyness on her part, and obliviousness on his part, combined with mutual miscommunications is the groundwork that the show builds on.\r\nAndwhat does it build? Slapstick, physical comedy, gags, a little cute romance here and there, a lot of laughs, all wrapped up in a tight 12 episode package that went by fast, left me wanting a little more, but overall was a satisfying and enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\n::MINOR SPOILERS::\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nReally basic, girl likes boy, boy is apparently dumb as a brick, girl tries to get closer and confess to boy, crazy miscommunications and shy half said phrases occur, girl winds up becoming boy's beta coloring assistant to his monthly girls manga. Wait what? Yup, she falls for the guy who writes a manga she really enjoys, and winds up helping him color the black fill in areas while he does the line art and story.\\n\r\nA few more characters, some involved with his work, some not, are introduced along the way, everyone gets into whacky incidents while going about daily school life, usually because they are misreading situations, or are just comically dim witted when it comes to communication or relationships. And that's about it, it's a whole lot of jokes and gags and so on based on this group and our two main characters being perfectly capable of leading a normal life except when it comes to romance or communication between those of different genders. And that winds up with a lot of actual laughing out loud going on as you watch, really, the humor is well paced, the long running gags don't have time to get stale since it's only 12 episodes, and the one off slapstick moments are spread out and paced well to keep you alternating between solid laughing and quick snorts and chuckles with some breathing time along the way.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nFairly typical for a TV Tokyo mid level budget afternoon short single season show.\\n\r\nI will say this though, the backgrounds and attention to details were above what you expect for something in the RomCom comedy genre.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nGood, the music was fitting, and while nothing stood out as particularly amazing, nothing came off as poorly done either, overall a soundtrack should be a compliment to a show, but not a focus unless it's a music based genre, and in that way I really compliment the creators for accomplishing exactly that. The SFX were pretty standard fair, nothing stood out as particularly great or bad, it was all just done in a decent way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nLets be honest, the characters are fun, even a little unique, in fact they all take a base of some trope or another, then add a twist or two to give them a little complexity, and while the characters don't really develop too much over the course of the show, in fat they all pretty much are the same from their introduction through the end, they are fun and interesting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nthumbs up here, I came in expecting a generic RomCom, I came away with a smile and got a bit more than expected. Short sweet and simple, good blend of laughs and sighs, funny and a little touching at just the right moments, and especially funny when those touching moments are immediately dashed by a misunderstanding or miscommunication that leads to one party coming out of it with the completely opposite idea about what just happened.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf you want a quick series to watch for a few laughs without being really invested in it, something to toss an episode or two on in your free time now and then, this is just right.\\n\r\nThe only downside is the ending\\n\r\n(SPOILER) (SPOILER) (SPOILER) \\n\r\nCompletely expected given the tone of the series, but the conclusion is a solid minute and a half of suspense leading not to the touching end where a confession is given and a reply of sharing comes out, no, its misheard and surprise, a giant tease as the reply is nice but on a completely different subject than what you thought. So yet again a RomCom where nothing is tied up and were left with the standard \"everything continued as it's been for who knows how long\".\\n\r\nBecause that's how anime RomComs work right? Blue balled right to the end on that main relationship, we almost never get a real \"the end\" one way or another haha.\\n",

On the other hand, if you are a diehard romance person, I don't think this is the anime for you either because it's not necessary the whole focus of the anime! And the romance doesn't run that deep to the point where one may want it to go. I personally thought it was a good balance between romance and comedy so that it appeals to anybody (not like onlymales or only females). \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of story, it's somewhat predictable, girl in love with guy but is a bit shy to admit it and the guy in this case is oblivious. Plot-wise, there isn't a whole lot here, just centers around Nozaki trying to finish his Shouju and Sakura trying to gain and woo Nozaki by helping him out. What is pretty nice about this anime though is that it isn't entirely focused on just these two characters and their love interest, you have Kashima and Hori that have interest in each other, Waka and Seo who have entirely different personalities but also have interest in eachother, and Mikoshiba who struggles to keep up with his facade and outward personality. All of these characters get dedicated screen time and don't feel like supporting characters/side characters. It's funny how Nozaki incorporates all of these characters and their relationships and personalities  into his own work which makes for some nice laughs. \\n\\n\r\nProbably my favorite scene is when Nozaki and Mikoshiba play the video game and cry over Tomoda and thus make him a story that focuses on him. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork I like, nice on the eye, colorful, nothing too outlandish, fitting for the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound: The voice acting is great and there's not really any complaints about voices not fitting the characters. Even the supporting characters have good voice actors. The OP and ED are great and catchy.\\n\\n\r\nI think whether one will like this anime or not depends if one has a open mind, doesn't expect a ton of plot, but likes to laugh easily! I would recommend this anime though, just give it a try.",

            "content": "Nozaki-kun is a show that lives and dies by it's comedy. It doesn't take itself seriously at all, and uses all of it's characters for being the butt of some kind of joke in relation to the manga that Nozaki is making. This, I feel, is a double-edged sword for the show as a whole.\r\nDon't mistake this as a romance anime, as it's more of a slice-of-life and romance is often parodied rather than taken seriously. Nozaki is a man who's writing a manga, and is helped by many of his friends who contribute to the manga. The thing I thought was clever about theNozaki-kun was that Nozaki himself would often refer to his friends and surroundings in real life to continue making his manga. He tries solving all his problems by making someone do something ridiculous; as it's clear he's fixated on nothing but his story of Suzuki and Mamiko. There are issues with this, however...\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters themselves are pretty likeable, but they sometimes feel a little one-note at times because every character has a joke that is more than likely to be played concerning them. Jokes with Nozaki will probably be something involving getting someone to do or say something he wants his characters to be like in the manga, or it will look like he's doing something for one reason, but is actually for manga reference, you get the idea. Chiyo has a crush on Nozaki, so there will be scenarios where she thinks Nozaki is doing something for her out of love, but is actually for the manga. Hori will probably beat up Kashima for doing something wrong, and so on and so forth. Having static characters isn't a bad thing mind you, but it sometimes felt like the characters were just props used for making a joke instead of actual characters, which was somewhat disappointing. This isn't too much of a downside though, since most of the characters are pretty good in their own right and I didn't dislike any of them.\\n\\n\r\nAs you continue watching more and more, the jokes often end up rather predictable, and it starts grating on you. That's the main problem I had with Nozaki-kun. As the show is completely centered around comedy, jokes that fall flat that you can see coming a mile away make it much less funny as a whole. This doesn't happen all the time though. The show does at least make efforts to make different settings and scenarios for each episode so it doesn't end up feeling too samey, and the jokes that do hit really hit. I can tell that they were making an effort with each step taken, but those times where everything was happening as expected was quite disappointing, even if the comedic timing was on point.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, I did end up laughing at many of the jokes the show threw at me, and had some downright hilarious and clever scenes, but the problem with the samey jokes and minuscule characterization did sometimes creep up on me and put a detriment on my enjoyment. Despite that, Nozaki-kun was a pretty enjoyable and hilarious show in it's own right, and I firmly believe there's room for potential for a season 2 if one was to exist.",

I found myself starting to cheer on the characters awaiting for their varying weird relationships to fall into place. It did not. I kinda was left with similar feelings of an unresolved factor as I did with My Little Monster and School Rumble.\r\nDespite that...I did enjoy this show. It mad me laugh. I did think \"why didn't I watch this much earlier\". Ireally liked Sakura. She had a \"kawaii\" about her that you may have thought at first she would be the \"dense\" character in the show but I think she was the most serious. She was friendly, more rational thinking that the other characters and while she was attracted to Nozaki...i did not feel like she interacted with him for the sake of reaching that goal \"girlfriend status\". She was genuinely a good friend. And i think the conclusion showed that, as she was okay with how things were between her and Nozaki.",

It does help to create a more diverse character set, but the show seems to both move at a snails pace, and reach a rather normalized conclusion where very little change has come to the characters and their relationships in the show. There are small hints of changes in the side-characters, but even those can be dismissed by the end of the show if you choose. It feltlike the writers of the story couldn't decide what they really wanted to push and the end leaves you wanting more in a bad way. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for some kind of movement or plot or you want romance that entertains and delves a little deeper, I wouldn't recommend it to you much. If you want some lighthearted comedy with a lot of unrequited love, then this may be for you and you might enjoy it more than I did.",

If this anime was a standalone comedy only, it would actually get a 10 from me. No complaints there. The characters are versatile and somewhat unique, the comedy is top notch, animation and sound is amazing. I loved the background track, reminds me of summer and high school and moments of peace. Over all this anime is amazong.\r\nWhat I hated was the element of romance was poorly developed. Too many cliff hangers, too many false alarms and till thevery end not one story properly concludes as far relationships go. But worst is definitely the lead couple, not only their proximity develops painfully slow, the ending made me really pissed off. It's fine for the story tellers to goof off through out the series, but I think in this one scene they should have given viewers something to feel warm and fuzzy about. Instead we have Sakura who is painfully trying to convey her feelings ripped off once again when Nozaki \"kind of responds to her feelings\" , only to realise he is still as clueless as a new born fawn and comfortably oblivious to sakura's suffering even though everyone else gets it. I am sorry but that is not a happy ending for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the series till episode 11, but the ending left me with a bad taste.",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\n[Mini Review]\r\nNozaki-kun is an anime with a solid goal, though perhaps not the right one all things considered. Every pore of the series is dripping with endearing charisma: from the beaming animation to its lovable characters that play off of one another with impeccable comedic timing and high-jinks. This makes Nozaki-kun one of the funniest series I've ever seen episode to episode, and its main vehicle to that end is the satirization of its own genre. The typical shoujo genre has been done so many times that Nozaki-kun is easily able to pick out those cliches formed over repetition and turnit into something comical, but it's not in any malicious sort of way, more like playful jabs that still fondly assure the anime's love for the very things it is making fun of. Through a constant channeling of delightful inspiration and situations throughout the show, Nozaki-kun is able to feel fresh with each and every episode, not just a one trick pony that only has one joke to tell. Of course, the comedic aspects means there isn't exactly any time for characters or really any meaningful development as far the story is concerned, but really, that's already asking for more than is fair from a series such as this. Nozaki-kun is definitely not a show you watch for any other reason than to laugh, unlike what something like Nichijou has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, you can't help but feel that Nozaki-kun is cheating itself as well as the audience with the romance between title character Nozaki and the main heroine Sakura. Granted, it's not so much an issue(because the anime never intended to go that direction, it's comedy all the way) as a missed opportunity. First of all, because it is really hard not to love the both of them, but also, if the opening's lyrics are anything to go by, there may be some sort of meta-aspect about the parodistic nature of the anime itself clashing with the real emotion of people that could have been interesting and dramatic. However, dramatic or serious is never something Nozaki-kun never strives to be, it's more concerned with making you choke on the food you're eating while watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nFulfillment of the critical potential of the show aside, that honestly is most likely me pretentiously reading into some sort of sub-text that isn't there, it's hard to criticize Nozaki-kun. Never is it anything more than just funny, but again, it doesn't need to be. All it needs is to do is cleverly and playfully jab at the nature of its own satirical existence until you love it. And take my word for it, you will love it, because if Nozaki-kun doesn't tickle your funny bone and make you laugh, nothing is likely to ever, and if that's the case, I recommended you go watch your brooding psychologically complex theory, and stop ruining the fun... you fun-ruiner. For the rest of you, consider this recommend, for the laughs...if only for the laughs.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: That relatable moment when you ask a boy out and he instead gives you his autograph.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog!

This anime had the potential to be amazing and, don't get me wrong, this is still a great anime, but it fell a little short of being amazing. \r\nThe plot of Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun is about a girl named Sakura who tries to confess her love for Nozaki. But Nozaki misinterprets her attempted confession and mistakes her for a fan and recruits her as an assistant for his work as a shoujo manga artist. While working as his assistant, Sakurameets other assistants of Nozaki as well as other friends of Nozaki at school. Misunderstandings and comedic tropes await as Sakura is still unable to get Nozaki to understand her feelings.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story is inheriently funny and it made me laugh a lot of times especially at the ways Nozaki drew inspiration and collected information for his shoujo manga. The story, however, becomes a little frustrating at times as almost everything, yes almost everything, that Nozaki does in this anime is for his manga. This leaves little room for character development, as Nozaki is so focused on his manga that he sometimes oblivious to the feelings of others, especially Sakura. Their romance develops very little as a result. Not only that, but I was also slightly disappointed by the ending also, but I won't give any details as to avoid spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this anime is excellent. It even takes its time to bring out very small details that made the scenes in the anime feel more real and more compelling. The small details also help make the main characters even more unique and different from each other. The music is the typical, catchy openings and endings that you would expect to see from a comedy anime. Nothing was too special with the music, but it does fit perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nBy far, the best part of this anime is its characters. There are seven main characters in this anime that can each be described simply. We have Nozaki, the emotionless and oblivious shoujo manga artist. Sakura, a \"normal\" girl with a crush on Nozaki. Mikoshiba, the playboy with a tsundere like attitude and is Nozaki's friend. Seo, a violent and aggressive girl with a beautiful singing voice who is Sakura's friend. Kashima, a girl who is tomboyish and attracts all the girls in the school. Hori, the president of the drama club who goes after Kashima due to her skipping practice. And Wakamatsu, a basketball player who is an old friend of Nozaki's. \\n\\n\r\nJust by the descriptions of the characters, you can already tell that this is a very unique set of characters. This anime isn't afraid to play with and swap the gender role norms that you would normally see in another school anime. Though the focus of the anime is obviously on Sakura and Nozaki, much time is given to flesh out the other five characters as well. It does a great job by showing how seven extremely different characters are joined together to work on or provide inspiration for Nozaki's manga. These seven main characters provides a great amount of entertainment and laughter. Even some of the side characters, like Ken, Yukari and Mitsuya still have some role in the story and also contribute to some funny scenes. \\n\\n\r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun is a funny and entertaining anime with plenty to offer. It is a solid anime that I thoroughly enjoyed and will look forward to another season. \\n\\n\r\n\"Enough you idiot! Shorten it to 20 words or less!\" -Saitama (One Punch Man)\\n\r\n(tl;dr) GSNK is an entertaining anime with unique characters, great animation and music. But falls a little short on plot.",

            "content": "Ah, parodies. You can find them for hit pop songs, films, and in this case, anime.  With anime, sometimes you never know when you're watching a parody unless you know how to look for one. This was the case with me.\r\nBased on the anime's summary, I thought I was watching a cute romance shoujo anime until the 2nd episode. That's when I started to notice the signs of a parody through the anime's characters. There are seven key characters in this anime: the heroine (Sakura), her crush (Nozaki), the playboy (Mikoto), the tomboy (Yuzuki), The Prince (Kashima), Hori (The Tsundere),  and Wakamatsu (TheAthlete). \\n\\n\r\nWith the exception of Sakura, these characters are more than what they appear to be and have various quirks that make their interactions with each other hilarious. There was not one episode where I wasn't laughing at them! The characters were the major strength of the anime and kept me clicking on each episode to see what happens to them next.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot, it is basically just a parody of shoujo manga disguised as a typical shoujo manga. One memorable bit involves Nozaki and Sakura attempting to share an umbrella. If you go into this anime for the romance, then you may be disappointed by the time you finish. There are small moments of actual romance, but most of it isn't meant to be serious.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other notable aspect of the anime besides its characters and \"plot\", is the artwork. The colors are eye catching and sometimes certain details make it beautiful and vivid as a watercolor painting. The most memorable thing I remember is Sakura's eyes, which were a lovely purple with little intricate details.\\n\\n\r\nI watched this anime because I wanted a feel-good series. If you want an anime that will make you chuckle or laugh out loud, then I recommend this anime.\\n\\n\\n",

I was going to quit on shoujo animes after watching Sukitte Ii na yo but Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun stands out with its simplicity and comedy.\r\nSakura Chio falls in love with Nozaki and confesses her feelings with totally wrong choice of words (*I am your fan and I want to be close to you :P*). Nozaki, unbeknownst to Chio, is author of famous shoujo manga, thinks she really is a fan ends up handing her autograph and hiring her as assistant. Chio joins Nozaki to help with his manga and finds out every character in his story is inspired by their friends atschool. The story moves along as with Chio's efforts to convey her  feelings to Nozaki and Nozaki continues to be clueless workaholic. Its almost unbelievable how he writes really romantic manga yet is totally dense about love in his real life.    \\n\\n\r\nThe best part I liked about this anime that it doesn\u2019t fall into same mold by introducing romantic rivals and unnecessary love triangles. There is very less or almost no crying and whining. Characters are simple yet have unique personality and series paces nicely with funny episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it\u2019s a recommended one time watch shoujo anime. \\n",

I was hoping to see further development in the supporting cast, but it's hard to squeeze development for individual characters into 12 episodes. Some supporting cast members got more development than others, but that's better than nothing. Also, this anime wrapped things up very nicely, which to me is rare. I haven't felt as satisfied with an ending for a while.\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nI have no complaints about the animation, but there was nothing that stood out about it, either. Could have been worse, could have beenbetter.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI loved the opening. I never bothered to skip it and just let it play in the background while I checked some other tabs because the upbeat song never failed to make me happy. The ending song was cute, but not as good as the opening. The music used throughout the anime was satisfactory, playing the right music at the right moments, etc.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime was filled with a cast of curious characters that I came to love. It provided everything from a boy who always acted cool but got embarrassed about it, to a girl who thought she was fantastic and didn't realize that her actions pissed others off, to a boy that was incredibly dense and pretty much never stopped thinking about his manga. There wasn't one character that I disliked! (Except maybe Nozaki's old editor ... but I think you were supposed to hate him, lol.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI'd watch this again for sure. I'm a sucker for both romance and comedy, and this anime is a great mashup of my two favorite things.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nGreat anime! I definitely recommend it, so if it isn't on your list be sure to add it!",

            "content": "I'll start off by saying this much: I'm an absolute sap when it comes to romance shows. Often times, when it comes to the end of a great romance anime, I've become so invested that I feel a wave of depression washing over me, and I find myself in a haze, wondering what happens to the characters next, how they go on living their lives, if it truly is a happy ever after. \r\nGekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is one of the best romance animes I've ever seen, but I have none of the feelings I usually get from a romance anime! Don't get me wrong, I'mstill sad that its over, but I can tell that I can go back and rewatch the series without the fear of being thrown into a depression again.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, there's weight to the characters and their feelings, which sit just below the surface, and you can tell that each of the characters feel something for the others too. But unlike the trappings of other romances, Its not a constant inner monologue of the protaganists mulling over their feelings, becoming increasingly anxious about their crush, and eventually bursting at the seems to tell them, only to find they liked each other all along. The emotions are obvious, but its not like the characters feel they can only ever be with their crush and nobody else.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the OP and ED are terrific, although it seems the general consensus is that you'll love it or hate it. Personally I love it. Its light, fun, catchy, and I think they both reflect the mood of the show quite well. As someone who only got back into anime in the past couple years, stumbling upon this anime in our current world of \"Anime OP Bangers\" (thanks for making that a term Gigguk), has been a breath of fresh air in the music department. The soundtrack, while not phenomenal, sets the mood. \\n\\n\r\nThe art direction, in my opinion, is fantastic. Personally, I love it when the animation jumps from beautiful and skillful to simplistic to show the mood of the characters. The animation overall is amazing, although not ground breaking or breath taking. The art sometimes triggers the humor of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can't recommend this anime enough to anyone who likes romance and slice of life shows. The humor is spot on, the characters and character development is astounding, the story is great at grabbing your attention and holding it, and the art and music are great. Even if its just something to watch between your other anime, pick this. YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS ANIME!!!!!!",

It's a romantic comedy, although it is more inclined towards comedy. Nozaki-kun a somewhat childish and serious mangaka with his assistants who are his references for his story and somehow enter the cliche of the animes and at the same time no. His touch of comedy and romance in the story and characters is perfectly balanced for each situation.",

It's an easy watch to binge and learn more about the creation of shoujo manga. Not quite a romance shoujo, but more of a school life, comedy anime. The most conflict you'll see in this show revolves around Nozaki's manga deadlines and the other characters' personal conflicts. If you're looking for something serious, I wouldn't recommend this, but if you know you're not looking for a drama and romance-filled shoujo, then this is the show for you. I would equate it to afunnier Lovely Complex, without the serious romance scenes that LoveCom has.",

I would say if your looking for a good laugh or just an anime that is short not hard to get into i would suggest this.",

            "content": "Romance is a genre across all scopes of media that is loved by some and hated by many different peopl. Many people are under the misconception that romance is something only women can enjoy and that there are many that men can't enjoy. I don't necessarily favor the genre but in the right mind set a well executed romance anime can be an extremely enjoyable show to watch. \r\n Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun(also known as Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun) is a 12 episode anime series from 2014. The anime series itself was based off the 4-Koma manga of the same name. The story follows a highschool student named Sakura Chiyo and how she has a crush on a classmate named Nozaki. Nozaki misinterprets her feelings and makes her assist him in his manga authoring escapades. Together with Chiyo trying to get closer with him they draw out stories based off their wacky schoolmates. \\n\\n\r\n Many parts of this show can be seen as generic. A major example of this would be the school setting. The school setting will unfortunately turn off many viewers as many anime fans have grown tired of this plot element being milked dry by several anime works. And this is a shame because Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun does something pretty unique despite its run of the mill plot elements. \\n\\n\r\n There isn't really pure romance in its essence which may disappoint some people but the Shoujo manga that Nozaki draws couples with the actions of the characters and that is what creates most of the comedy. A great example would be an episode where Mikoshiba and Nozaki are playing a dating sim. Dating sims don't exactly have the greatest reputation but all of the generic romantic Shoujo elements present in them move Nozaki and Mikoshiba to tears and I personally found this hilarious. \\n\\n\r\n An important thing to consider is that despite its shounen demographic this show parodies Shoujo so much. This is the main joke of the series and creates much of the humor. Many of the gags also come from Nozaki looking at every day life and then just randomly taking notes and putting the scenario into a generic Shoujo manga. I personally found it to be pretty funny when he did this.\\n\\n\r\n This is mostly an episodic anime. There isn't a massive scoping plot and there are many different sub plots present. Some of these sub plots are good but a couple of others seem kind of incomplete to me such as the sub plot of seo teaching Kashima how to sing. Most of the episodes are comedy driven and have a light hearted and funny atmosphere which is good for a romcom anime. \\n\\n\r\n When talking about the characters in this show I can say that I enjoyed most of them. Not all of them had an interesting design or personality but shined with their interactions with other characters in the cast. I would say there is a fairly large cast of characters here and they are mostly all developed pretty well. \\n\\n\r\n Nozaki can be seen as kind of boring at first and as a bit of a dunce. However his profession as this renowned manga artist and his behavior in real life due to this profession is actually quite interesting. His relationship with Chiyo is great too and shared in many comedic moments. However he misunderstands Chiyo's obvious feelings quite a bit which was pretty annoying. But I found him to be a good protagonist in the series and had some interesting attributes. \\n\\n\r\nChiyo is the heroine of this story and she isn't all that impressive. Her feelings for Nozaki are genuine though and despite him having noticeable idiosyncrasies and flaws she continues loving him which I found to be sweet.  Aside from those 2 there are also some great side characters like the narcisstic otaku mikoshiba, the tom boy actress kashima, and the uber aggressive psycho Seo. They are also coupled with Wakamatsu, a weak basketball player and Hori the drama club director. \\n\\n\r\n One of the 2 most interesting relationships in the series is between Wakamtasu and Seonand the second is between Kashima and Hori. Hori and Kashima had a very dynamic relationship that was filled with humor. Horn is always patronizing kashima for getting distracted by her fans but Kashima also respects horn to no end. Seo and Wakamtasu had an equally dynamic relationship with great humor. Seo's aggression played off wakamatsu's timid nature perfectly. \\n\\n\r\n I personally had no problems with the art and animation. The art was appealing and had great color. The voice acting and music were also very good but I felt that some of the OST was a bit overused but it's good music in general. \\n\\n\r\n So overall Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is a fun romp that parodies the Shoujo genre well in a shounen context. The comedy incorporated is effective and the cast of characters were colorful. So if you want a good comedy anime with some good romantic gags check this one out.\\n\\n",

Extremely catchy soundtrack with an OP and ED that I never actually skip cause I like so much!

            "content": "TL;DR: It's not a romcom in the traditional sense, but LOL.\r\nManga artists and animation houses have tough jobs, not just because it's extremely hard to turn out quality work that meets deadlines, but primarily because there's always five or six works in just about every genre that set such a high bar. In literature, it's like an author \"killing\" the genre (*cough*Eva*cough*), every writer in that genre since seems derivative.\r\nSo perhaps you'll forgive the author of Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun for doing a couple of things to the shojo romcom in order to stand out: gender-bending, and making the romantic elements (such as they are) subordinateto the side-splitting comedy. Whether he succeeded is, as always, an exercise for the reader, but the first 3 episodes are a good gauge of whether you'll enjoy the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIt starts out like any other romance: Teenage girl works up the courage to ask out a boy she likes. Usually, \"I've always been your fan!\" will get a guy to at least consider the girl for a date, but as it happens, this boy is a manga artist who evidently gets lots of fan letters. \\n\\n\r\nThat's how the comedy in the show rolls: each \"couple\" in the show, if you would, has a strange hang-up (and it's not the gender-bending of typical romcom characters) that prevents them from dating \"happily ever after\", but the hang-up tends to be hilarious. Aside from one character or two, the gags are almost entirely slapstick, which works well in anime. The planning, direction, and editing ensured that the setup, timing, and punch lines are delivered to maximum effect. Even the soundtrack gets in on the action here. If you had to ask me which two instruments in an orchestra sound \"funny\", well, that would be the tuba and trombone. Naturally, the tracks that play while the audience is probably laughing have these instruments playing the melody.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the excellent comedy, we get a \"how to make manga\" crash course. Not as dramatic or in-depth as Shirobako's \"how to make anime\", but good enough to get the point across.\\n\\n\r\nSince the gags are slapstick and this is animation, naturally you'll see Tom & Jerry style violence without the weapons. Don't worry, it's animated comedy, the characters are all indestructible.",

It is almost like a window into this world. Each episode is self contained, and it does not have much story progression whatsoever. It is just a let's see these great characters react to funny situations. The premise is simple however, and is easy to get behind. Now the strongest points that I wouldbring up is the characters and animation. The characters are all hilariously made. The interactions between all of these characters are fantastic. Then the animation of the show flows very well together, and there are some scenes that are gorgeous to look at. Now I would not go into this anime looking for a deep progression in a relationship. The characters don't have a lot of depth either. The anime is just a short and sweet series that does what it is going for well.",

            "content": "One of the few things I try to look for in a shoujo anime is the strong female character. By strong, I don't mean overly confident or independent. I mean, the female character has other goals in life rather than being in love with the male character and eventually marrying him. I didn't find this in Gekkan Shojo, Nozaki Kun. However, It's a very enjoyable anime. The artwork is flawless! The male character is very blunt in a hilarious way. Sakura (the female character) reactions are very funny. Not so many side characters but they're all entertaining and support the main plot in a way.I wouldn't consider it all romance rather than Comedy. The romance bit exists only in the first minute in first episode and last minute in the last episode. What I found particularly enjoyable was that the main male character is a mangaka<3 it shows you the challenges and the experience of being a male student and a mangaka at the same time. Watched it 3 times already and I never re-watch a shoujo anime! It's that enjoyable. OP Song is awesome!",

            "content": "This is definitely a shojo that leans more towards comedy than romantic. It's one of those ones like Ouran High School Host Club where it makes fun of the whole shojo genre itself and depicts the tropes in hilarious methods. \r\nThe story itself is simple, and it doesn't really lead to a huge dramatic climax that we all anticipate for. But rather, it's a series of everyday events among high schoolers that are undoubtedly interesting. Long story short, girl likes guy, guy turns out to be manga artist and recruits her to be on his manga-making team and she meets all the inspirations/friends/team members thatconstruct this manga. Meanwhile there are two other relationships that the viewers are left to ship.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, though not particularly a masterpiece or extremely beautiful -- the theme is overall very colourful and it really enhances the light, humourous and colourful nature of the show and its characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST isn't much to right home about. Nonetheless the opening is addictive and I absolutely love it. It completely grasps the entire show's feel and there's so much liveliness in it, I can't help but love the op.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. Now this is GSNK's strength. Every character is likable and leaves you questioning, \"among the people I know in my friend group, who would [insert character name] be?\" Everyone has their own personality and it's impossible to get characters mixed up. Although the show didn't take as much time as I would've liked for it to develop the supporting cast (Kashima, Hori, Seo, Waka, Ken, etc.), the scenes where we did get to see them, were done fabulously. Despite the frequencies of shojo comedic violence and oddly athletic moments, the characters are quite relatable as well and everyone has their own treasure to offer to GSNK and the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10 duh. Hilarious. Comedy gold. I can't further emphasize how often I smiled throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I rate Gekkan Shojo Nozaki-kun a 9/10, I'd preferably give it a 9.5 because it deserves higher than a 9. However I just can't give it a perfect 10. You'll find out in the last episode. In addition, the show left me wanting more as if it required a season 2 to really feel content with it. \\n\\n\r\nLONG STORY SHORT, WATCH IT.",

            "content": "Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is cute, but predictable, episodic, and static.\r\nThe art was fine as in it wasn't painful to look at. The sound was decent. I must say that the opening song is quite enjoyable. There were a few tracks that stood out, but nothing amazed me. In fact, it got quite a bit repetitive hearing certain tracks played over and over again during dramatic situations.\r\nThere's a good amount of characters introduced in the anime. The story of each is explored a little bit, but by the half-way point, the characters are figured out. No more exploration, and no more development.\r\nSimply put, there is nooverarching story. That's okay since this is a slice of life anime, but there is barely any romantic development. For an anime that starts off with a love confession, there's not much loving going on. Maybe that's the whole joke: we hope for some kind of romance, but really the anime is a baka senpai who is oblivious to our petty desires. That being said, I didn't mind the ending.\\n\\n\r\nAn interesting premise that leads nowhere combined with average everything leaves this anime with a final score of 6.",

            "content": "Likes:\r\nThe side character couples were much more interesting than Nozaki and Chiyo. Seo and Wakamatsu had this confusing relationship, with Seo being the beloved Lorelei. And Hori and Kashima were so cute. They had this love hate relationship, but I loved it so much. They kept pushing each other down and yelling, but they really did care for each other. I wanted these couples to get together more than Chiyo and Nozaki. Chiyo and Nozaki was so boring. There were episodes when they disappeared entirely.\r\nDislikes:\r\nThere was a lack of plot. The story didn't seem to follow any sort of path. There weren't dates or attemptsto confess. It was a lot of boring nothing. You could pick up the story at any episode and still get the gist. I was tired by the lack of anything.\\n\r\nThe main couple is boring. As I said, I didn't particularly care if they got together. They didn't have chemistry. And, at times, you could forget that's Chiyo like Nozaki. They barely talked. And most of it was research for the manga. While I liked their work relationship, nothing came out of it. Just boring gaga stuff.\\n\r\nThere isn't an ending per se. The couples I wanted together weren't together. I needed more. Some closure really. I wanted people to kiss and hug and just be adorable fluffy couples. That's what I watched this show for. And I have nothing to show for it? Boring.",
