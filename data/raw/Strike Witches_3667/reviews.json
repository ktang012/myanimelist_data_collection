            "content": "*A Japanese government endorsed loli-pantsu anime.*\r\nPlease don't say it is bad just because you find girls in panties horrifying. I admit it is lousy for the director to claim that girls in panties = fashion in the Strike Witches' world, but that alone is no reason to give a bad rating to an anime (if you do, I am sorry, you don't know how to rate at all). Strike Witches is MUCH deeper than one may expect to find from a fanservice-oriented series.\r\n--Updated on February 12, 2009--\r\nThe Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs has recently openly endorsed Strike Witches as an example of cultural excellence. \r\nTheworld of Strike Witches is pretty much parallel to our world up to 1939 (before World War II). At that time, mysterious beings known as Neuroi invaded Europe. Thus rather than the real WWII, this resulted in a war between Human VS Neuroi. The story revolves around a group of girls with special magical powers that allow them to equip the \"Striker Units\" to combat the Neuroi. The story proceeds nicely with these magical girls fighting Neuroi, but sadly the ending seem to be a bit \"wishy-washy\".\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation quality is great for the most part. The battle scenes, in particular, are extremely well made. In short, we see a nice blending effects from the battle animation with the regular drama scenes. All episodes seem to have highly consistent animation and of course, the DVD includes polished artwork and fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are both good although not particularly outstanding and there's a good chance you'll forget about them after a few days. However, the melody of the songs suit the theme of the anime quite nicely. In addition, the battle themes and the Japanese version of Lili Marlene (a famous German love song that was popular during World War II) all contributed nicely to the series and are valuable assets to the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe production group did a nice job at introducing the main/supporting characters and then slowly further develop them. Actually, the character introductions might explain why the story started out slowly (after all there are 11 girls to talk about). If there is one thing I find the characters disappointing it is that some of the witches' specialty were not revealed until the end (most were never mentioned).\\n\\n\r\nThough I didn't like to see girls showing off their panties the way they are done in this anime, but putting that aside, the show itself (from story to art to sound to character) is very well planned out and the fact that they include references to the real WWII is just that much more interesting to watch. (*edit* The ending was really surprising, hope you'll enjoy the show just as much as I did)",

            "content": "I don't know what it was that intrigued me about this show when I first saw it but I was very interested in seeing it after the first episode.  In the end it was a bit disappointing though because early on I thought it had the potential to be something very special.\r\nAs others have said, Strike Witches is automatically going to appeal to a certain group of people, and you probably already know who you are.  Basically SW is the battle of Britain with Loli witches riding mechanical brooms fighting mysterious aliens and carrying huge guns... without pants.  Yes I don't understandthe last part either.  If you love cute girls in their panties and LOTS of highly detailed shots of those girls in said panties, this is definitely your show!  Also judging from the amount of bath scenes there is surely to be a lot of boobs for those who watch the DVD release.\\n\\n\r\nNot that any of the above really offends me, because it doesn\u2019t.  But I hate to see the story suffer because of excessive fan service, and in Strike Witches case it does.  In a 12 episode series there is very little time to develop the characters and storyline, and SW wastes at least 2 full episodes catering to fan service.  One episode is devoted entirely to the girls walking around without their panties on and stealing each others.\\n\\n\r\nThe story which started with a lot of promise really loses steam as it winds down.  So much is left unexplained and the motives of the Neuroi are never explained.  A very significant plot hole remains unexplained in the final story arc and it just felt like a downer when you don\u2019t get a very satisfying conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nYou might think because of the above comments that I hated this show, but I really didn't.  The show does do a number of things right.  First the animation is really good.  The girls are really cute and I fell in love with all of them.  The show does manage to develop all their personalities pretty well.  There is a lot of action too, the air battles with the Neuroi are pretty fun.  The OP and EN songs are pretty good but aren\u2019t really anything special.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end the show was fun to watch but I am left feeling a bit let down.  It just didn't live up to the potential it had early on.  Some people are going to like this show a lot though.  If you\u2019re looking for some mindless fun for several hours with the bonus of pantsu then you should check this show out.\\n",

            "content": "Though Strike Witches isn't nearly as generic as the first few eps would lead you to believe, it's still nothing to get all in a tizzy about. Moe cliches and fetishism abound, you already know the audience with one glance, and if you're in that audience it's not half-bad.\r\nStrike Witches is about young girls fighting faceless enemies in an alternate WWII era. Inexplicably, they sprout animal ears and tails when they use magic and pants don't seem to exist anymore. As you can probably guess, this isn't a show heavy in plot. What makes it relatively enjoyable is that the plot (and use that wordvery loosely) is often negated in favor of servicey hijinks and yuri subtext. Well, at least the show knows it's audience.\\n\\n\r\nThis 1940s farce is headed by a gaggle of 16-year-old girls who look half that age, but somehow have boobs. The girls' personalities are relegated to such archetypes as tsundere, big-boobed klutz, brat, etc. etc. They're somewhat redeemed by being reverse-gender caricatures of famous WWII leaders. Go figure.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, though GONZO, is relatively subdued. It's aesthetically pleasing outside of the Neuroi and flows smoothly. Best of all, there's no CG glut commonly associated with anime of this studio.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is just a hair's breadth above mediocre, and the OP and ED are patchwork themes in music and lyrics. Hardly inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like cute girls showing their panties, then I don't see why you'd turn this down. But don't expect anything even remotely serious from Strike Witches. It's a 100% guilty pleasure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Strike Witches gets a 6 out of 10.",

            "content": "\u201cNever in the animated medium has a cast of so many, worn clothes so few.\u201d\r\n -Winston Churchill\r\n Strike Witches is perhaps the most elaborate method to showcase girls in their underwear that has ever been contrived; while other series make use of upward camera angles or \u2018hillarious\u2019 accidental groping to provide the viewer with their ration of sexual titillation, Gonzo decided that it was time to stop beating about the bush and start being candid. And what could be more candid than a five second close up of an adolescent girl\u2019s camel toe?\r\n Admittedly it\u2019s not exactly the most cultured form of entertainment around, andcertainly not one you\u2019ll ever find yourself recommending to your parents, co-workers, prospective sexual partners or any Federal Agents that happen to be paying you a visit. However, for those of you who only need to worry about the last item on that list, Strike Witches is the perfect anime for you!\\n\\n\r\n But you don\u2019t need your picture on the side of a Milk Carton in order to enjoy Strike Witches; if you just want to watch one of the most creative, action packed and entertaining anime series out there, then all you need to do is swallow your pride and take your first flight with the guys and girls of the 501st Joint Fighter Squadron. \\n\\n\r\n Just kidding- there aren\u2019t any guys in Strike Witches. Honestly, who on earth would want to see men flying around in their underwear? No, that would just be silly. Yup, they\u2019re all girls. All eleven of them. With each one representing every country in the world that matters- Japan, Britain, The United States of America, Germany, France, Japan, The Soviet Union, Finland, Italy, Germany and Germany. If you\u2019re feeling a little disappointed with that list, you needn\u2019t worry too much\u2014there are more German characters introduced later on in the show.\\n\\n\r\n Of course, with a main character to episode ratio of almost 1:1, you might expect a few issues with character development. And you\u2019d be right- almost half of the cast spend three quarters of the series effectively as background scenery- though the problem is alleviated to a certain degree by the fact that the whole cast has only a quarter of a personality between them.\\n\\n\r\n It sounds terrible, and it probably is- a cast made up entirely of stereotypes is certainly not an artistic statement- but at the same time it\u2019s what allows Strike Witches to work. We don\u2019t need to know about each character, because we already know everything there is to know about them- because we\u2019ve seen them a thousand times before. It sounds a bit illogical, but what\u2019s the use of applying logic to a show about a group of teenage girls flying through the air with aeroplane propellers strapped to their ankles? \\n\\n\r\n And it\u2019s not as if they\u2019re unlikable characters. Quite the opposite, in fact- among the cast of eleven, you\u2019ll end up liking at least eight of them. If nothing else, they certainly are an entertaining bunch to watch.\\n\\n\r\n Now we\u2019ve covered all the key points, let\u2019s delve a little deeper and look at the less important elements of the story, like the story itself: Post World War 2, Alien invasion, Aircraft powered by magic. Got that? Good.\\n\\n\r\n There is an overarching storyline here, but if you hadn\u2019t already realised, Strike Witches isn\u2019t exactly a work of literary genius. What does matter though are the individual episode stories, which are excellent- great fun to watch and reasonably original, which believe me is saying a lot for an ecchi anime. There\u2019s a good mix of action packed battles, low brow humour and some melodrama that makes for some lowest common denominator entertainment of the highest calibre.\\n\\n\r\n On the subject of melodrama, one unintentionally amusing aspect of the show is the use of overly dramatic orchestral music during the battle sequences. When juxtaposed to the high pitched, middle of the road J-pop of the opening sequence, it\u2019s hard not to let out a snobbish little chuckle. Talk about delusions of grandeur...\\n\\n\r\n Of course, when it comes to presentation, there are no delusions... just sweet, sweet grandeur.\\n\\n\r\n Whatever you may think of Gonzo Entertainment, of CGI visuals or of the moe aesthetic, there\u2019s no getting around the fact that Strike Witches is quality animation at its finest. Particularly the battle sequences, which were fast paced, well choreographed and smooth. It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that it was so well animated that I get a hard on just thinking about it, and not just because of those panty shots I mentioned earlier.\\n\\n\r\n The integration of CGI with traditional animation (by which I mean digital animation) has long been a burning issue for anime fans, without any clear resolution -should those responsible for it be burned at the stake, or would tarring-and-feathering them be justifiable- where you stand on the issue is entirely up to you; but even the most unreasonable of lynch mobs should be willing to consider letting Strike Witches off the hook, because it has actually made it work. That\u2019s right; no obvious shade-free surfaces or objects that look out of place- everything is well done and kept in the backdrop, where it should be when it can\u2019t be where it really ought to be (off screen).\\n\\n\r\n This review has attempted to justify the unjustifiable. It has struggled desperately to sing the praises of a show that is little more than a cacophony of the worst vices in anime- thirty year old single men, thirteen year old girls and, worst of all, three dimensional animation. Cynics will say that Strike Witches is a show that was made with only one goal; to sell to as many depressing and possibly slightly gullible single middle aged men as possible, and the fact that it\u2019s hugely entertaining is a mere co-incidence -and maybe they\u2019re right. But perhaps they can take a little comfort from the fact that it didn\u2019t quite work out.\\n\\n\r\n \u201cA single sale is a tragedy; but even a million sales won\u2019t save Gonzo from Bankruptcy\u201d\\n\r\n -Josef Stalin\\n",

If that\u2019s all it takes to make you happy, then great, because Strike Witches offers very little else.\r\nThis is a fanservice anime, so if you're expecting anything deeper than a puddle in terms of plot or people, you might as well give up now. However, that's not an excuse for a truly awful anime.\r\nThe premise is about as dumb as it sounds. We have eleven girls with magic powers and airplane propellers strapped to their legs, who are apparently the military\u2019s only hope of defeating abunch of outer space aliens.\\n\\n\r\nSounds like fun, huh?\\n\\n\r\nThe bad part is, the story doesn't really go anywhere from there. More than half of the episodes have absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Most of the show is just a bunch of girls running around doing goofy things, taking baths, and beating up the obligatory bad guy. The ending tries to scrape together a plot at the last minute, but it\u2019s so full of plot holes and unresolved stories it ends up being a mess, too. If you were waiting for a conclusion to the loose ends strewn all over the place, you\u2019re out of luck. At the end of the series, all I could say was, \u201czuh?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty paper-thin. Only about four of the eleven characters get regular screen-time, the rest of the gang is pretty much scenery. In lieu of character development we\u2019re supposed to be satisfied watching cute girls do cute things. (But really, who doesn't love watching cute girls do cute things, right?) By the end of the series, the only things you\u2019ll remember about the characters are their hair color and sexual orientation.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains (if you can even call them that) of the story are a band of aliens called the Neuroi, and they\u2019re among some of the most laughable bad guys in all of anime history. First of all, nobody knows a blessed thing about them, not even the military or the Strike Witches themselves. We never figure out who they are, what they are, where they come from, or what they\u2019re doing. The design for these extraterrestrials is baffling. Most of them look like they were lifted from some bad Cinema 4D tutorial. In one episode, we have the girls fighting an alien shaped like a giant Rubik\u2019s cube. On top of that, the enemy isn't even remotely threatening. Apparently they\u2019re so little of a threat that the Strike Witches don\u2019t even bother to go after them, they just laze around at home base until one flies overhead.\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice isn't anything you haven\u2019t seen before. If, for some reason, you haven\u2019t seen enough of girls scrabbling at each other\u2019s breasts, it might amuse you. But, while I like naked lolis as much as the next guy, the fanservice is stuck in place of a coherent story. There\u2019s literally an entire episode about panties. After a while it just feels like a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nStrike Witches is an absolutely terrible anime, and I can only hope that I have saved you from the pain of watching it. In the end, the only reason you should ever watch this is if you need an anime that will make you sit back and think, \"What the hell am I doing with my life?\"",

            "content": "Strike Witches is a fresh, entertaining anime that has been unfairly criticized by a handful of spoilsports who claim moral superiority over the rest of the internets, all the while ignoring the excellence and vibrancy of this fine series.\r\nIt's a story that has been done before, of course: mysterious aliens invade earth. They attack our cities and villages one by one, and conventional military weaponry is useless against them. Luckily, an elite band of young people have been found and given experimental weaponry that can be used against the xenos. This kind of story usually creates all kinds of angst and bawwwing, but Strike Witchesavoids this cliche since it's set in the last good war. In fact the series is full of vitality and optimism, and the heroines are a squadron of cute flying catgirls that you will surely grow to love.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style reflects the good nature and spirits of the series with a vivid palette of colors that will delight your eyes and mind. In fact, the production values in general are excellent, from the cheerful, quirky character designs to the gorgeously animated aerial battles between the witches and their alien foes. There are a few scenes of war-ravaged Europe to show the stakes of the battle, but the series in general is bright and clean. There are a few darker twists towards the end of the story, but it finishes with a positive note, even though many parts of the story are left to be wrapped up in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems, however, that a few people known to the world as moralfags have taken offense to the fact that females in this alternate version of earth have foregone the useless and unpleasant shackles of wearing pants. Why these people would bitch about such a thing is anyone's guess, but this bit of trivia doesn't hurt the entertainment value of Strike Witches in the least, and in fact only adds to its quirky charm.",

            "content": "One of the worst Animes I have ever seen.\r\nThe premise is that young girls wearing flying boots modelled off of WWII era aircraft are the only things on this alternate version of Earth that can consistently defeat the attacks of an unknown invading force hell bent on razing the planet for unknown reasons.\r\nLets get the 'good stuff' out the way. The art isn't all that bad, generic character designs and such, but the boots modelled off of WWII aircraft do look good. Also the designs of the Neuroi enemies based on prototype aircraft were also pretty good.\r\nThe sound wasn't terrible. The OP and ED weren'tvery memorable and the actual sound design didn't really have any faults.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is full of plot devices designed for fanservice. Only gender with magical powers are women, and they 'reach their magical peak' at 18 years old. The lack of trousers and skirts is put down to the girls needing to be ready at a moments notice to sortie, although in this version of Japan, it seems young girls generally just only wear underwear.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual plot is full of rehashed ideas and tired cliches borrowed from a variety of other anime. Unassuming young teenage protagonist is thrust into a world of magic and/or battles against mysterious and powerful enemy, and suprisingly has great untapped potential. Each episode revolves around some plot point for minor character development which is resolved in the end by usually overcoming a challenge to destroy a bad guy. The required forseeable plot twist near the end is also present.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is incredibly minimal for characters outside of the protagonist Yoshika, which leaves the show with a cast of one dimensional stereotypes with different body design to appeal to varying fetishes.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, its a terrible show, and only for those who need more loli fapping material.",

            "content": "Good:\r\nYoung girls with guns and no pants...Hell Yes!\r\nGood characters-All of them stood out among each other and they all mesh very well while still clashing with each other. \r\nAir combat-Well it's no Area 88 or anything like that but it's still pretty cool to watch if I do say so myself.  \r\nForced homosexuality-Though there is no lesbian action here, you can pretty much tell are either gay (Perrine especially) or are still exploring their sexuality (Yoshika), and that adds some nice humor. \r\nArchetype aces/characters somewhat nailed-They definitely nailed the whole Erich Hartmann/Gerhard Barkhorn thing pretty well. Anyone who's read \"The Blond Knight of Germany-TheStory of Erich Hartmann&quot; will know how well that was translated into Erica and Gertrud.  Saburo Sakai was very well translated into Mio Sakamoto, and Chuck Yeager's spirit of adventure seemed to be very well present in Charlotte.  The aristocratic side of Pierre Clostermann was also pretty well translated into Perrine as well. \\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\nWeak plot-Yes, I understand the whole saving humanity thing, but it took about eight episodes in a twelve episode series for the plot to really pick up and things to get really juicy. And then it just ended. Lame...\\n\r\nAnimal parts-Okay, I know lots of people like this, but I don't.  It just looks rather disturbing and not very cute to me at all. While watching Strike Witches I was able to mostly overlook it, it still got on my nerves at times. \\n\r\nNot enough done with certain characters-The biggest thing that got to me, Erica didn't play a bigger role. Come on, she was based off of the ACE OF ACES Erich Hartmann himself, the greatest fighter pilot of all time. Why didn't she get more spotlight time in air combat? Who knows, but I don't think it does the guy a lot of justice. \\n\r\nBetter archetypes could have been made-I don't understand why Minna wasn't based off of Adolf Galland and instead was based off of Wolf Dietrich Wilcke. Sure he was a high scoring during WW2 (175 kills), but if you know anything about WW2 air combat, no one ever talks about him. Lynette should have been Johnnie Johnston (highest scoring British ace of all time, 35 kills against the Luffwaffe) and not Billy Bishop, who was Canadian and not British.  While not that bad, it would have been cooler to see Sanya be based off of Alexandr Porshynkin rather then Lidiya Litvak simply because of the gender thing, but that wasn't as bad as basing Minna off of a relatively unknown ace and basing Lynette off of someone who was Canadian and not British.\\n\r\nArchetype/characters messed up a bit-Pierre Clostermann's aristocratic side was rather overdone, and Erich Hartmann's free spiritedness was also a bit overdone. Also Billy Bishop wasn't very translated well into Lynette, the real guy was a pretty daring pilot and yet she was pretty shaky and not very confident of herself.  I can't say much about characters like Francessca, Minna, Eila, Sanya, and others on how they lived up to their pilot archetypes. \\n\r\nStriker units-The whole idea of basing them off of other planes, well it just seemed like one more side note to make them stand out that kind of just failed. I don't understand why Erica's striker was painted black and gold when it was Gerhard Barkhorn who did that in WW2, Erich actually painted his black and red (read on how the Soviets feared what they called &quot;The Devil's Tulip&quot; when they saw him in the air).  Only really Charlotte's stood out as looking anything like the plane it was off of. \\n\\n\r\nOne final note that's a bit sad, all but one of the aces used as pilot archeytpes are dead. Erich Hartmann (cause of death-a cold due to a weakened immune system from another disease), Gerhard Barkhorn (cause of death-car accident), Lidiya Litvak (cause of death-KIA), Billy Bishop (cause of death-natural causes), Pierre Clostermann (cause of death-natural causes), Saburo Sakai (cause of death-natural causes), Tetsuz\u014d Iwamoto (cause of death-blood poisoning after surgery), Kaneyushi Mutoh (cause of death-KIA), Ilmari Juultainen (cause of death-natural causes), Franco Lucchini (cause of death-KIA), and Wolf Dietrich Wilcke (cause of death-KIA), those guys are all gone.  The only one that is still alive is Chuck Yeager, who as of today is 85 years old, healthy, and still alive and goes around the country to speak at various demonstrations and such. Apparently because of some fans of his on his myspace page, he may even know about Strike Witches as well.  I wonder what he thinks of all this? \\n\\n\r\nWell, I guess for history buffs like me, Strike Witches was an interesting watch. I guess it's worth watching again, though not without serious thought and caution. It's a fun series and one that isn't too serious, and I think that may be it's greatest charm. One thing's for sure, I can't wait to hear what Chuck Yeager has to say about all this.",

            "content": "Watching this series was painful, long, boring and tedious; I can hardly believe I endured until the end. This anime is just plainly too innocent, naive, happy, friendly, whatever you want to call it. The \"problems\" that are presented in the anime are all very dumb and not interesting, and the way the characters act is too childish. If you like fast-paced animes, with good action in it, you can stop reading this immediately and look elsewhere.\r\nThe story starts out with some mysterious \"Neuroi\" race that has appeared on Earth and has suddenly started attacking humans all around the world. That's about as much asyou get to understand about Neurois since, after the first episode, they appear spontaneously only to disturb some other, not-entertaining activity the witches were holding. They suddenly decide to keep developing the Neuroi story in the last two episodes of the series, but they just act as if they're getting somewhere, as if they're going to uncover and explain something new, just to leave the viewer expecting something that never happens.\\n\\n\r\nArt is alright, it's better than many other anime series, but it's nothing astonishing; you can find the same art and animation quality, even better, in many other series.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting happens to be good, and the intro song might be just a little bit catchy, but it's nothing to be surprised or &quot;touched&quot; by. Sound effects are alright as well. It has a fairly good sound, overall.\\n\\n\r\nI must admit that the characters are explained in a nice manner; you get to know a bit about everyone, enough as to understand them. However, the characters are all based on anime standards; in other words, every character in this series resembles some other character from another series. And, as stated before, they all act too childish; extremely childish. For some reason, too, female characters apparently hate wearing pants; they always hang around wearing panties and some shirt (although Perrine wears pantyhose, too).\\n\\n\r\nThis series lies in the borderline of &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;just acceptable&quot;.  I wouldn't invite anyone to see this anime, though; do so under your own risk (although it might be good to watch it at night, in order to fall asleep quickly).",

            "content": "I've heard much about Strike Witches before I first watched it.  Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised by its actual depth than what common hearsay has informed me of.  Allow me to elaborate.\r\nPicking up slowly, with the introduction of the setting and characters, it eases us in to a somewhat formulaic format.  We begin with our heroine, Yoshika Miyafuji and her initial anti-war sentiment and her joining the titular organisation.  It then segues in to the exploration of the respective members of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing with a Neuroi usually present to showcase the ability of that particular member.  Thereis a twist of course, but I leave that for you to discover on your own.  I have a particular gripe about the plot's pacing though.  It feels like the plot twist was constructed in a hurry and tacked on for the last few episodes.  All in all, not too shabby.\\n\\n\r\nThe 501st Joint Fighter Wing is an aerial unit circa WW2 and its task is to stop Neuroi who deploy in the air.  Beautiful aerial dogfights ensue with pretty explosions and very &quot;nice views&quot;.  Many seem to discredit Strike Witches solely for the fanservice and in a sense I understand, its enough to cause a fatal nosebleed.  But that isn't the only fault it has.  Rendered English countrysides look plastic when the 501st have some field exercises.  My god do they look plastic.  Otherwise, the 3D rendered art looks detailed, especially the Japanese Carrier Akagi, the 2D backgrounds look up to snuff and the lighting is justly positioned.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is not spectacular though it does a good job of providing us with good audio cues.  Few parts have audio that I feel does not go with a scene.  Sound effects too sound a bit off kilter and it feels like all the guns sound the same.  Those who watch quite a lot of anime may recognise some familiar voices too but this is where your mileage may vary.\\n\\n\r\nAt its heart, Strike Witches is the 501st's war story and in war stories, it explores the characters and their relations to each other.  Some of it feels too sudden though, such as Yoshika's sudden change of heart to enlist.  However, as the bulk of character development is on a per episode basis, we get enough of a feeling for each of the characters, showing interpersonal relationships, personalities, hopes and fears, particularly of the veterans of the conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThis was a fun and mostly light show.  In fact, if you look past the fanservice and the initial blood loss involved, its something that could be recommended to anyone interested in magical girls or aerial combat action.  However, it was more the little parallels to our history that had me appreciating Strike Witches, especially mirroring Erich Hartmann wearing Hitler's hat with Erica Hartmann's wearing someone else's &quot;pants&quot; (they have the gall to call them pants) as a result of their stupor. As far as enjoyment goes, taking an alien threat and putting it in a WW2 era setting while replacing actual ace pilots with loli magical girls with no pants sounds like a winner to me.",

            "content": "The Strike Witches series follows Yoshika Miyafuji, teenage girl who goes to school (in a skirtless uniform) and helps her mother and grandmother around their medical clinic. Her father, Dr. Miyafuji, the inventor of the Striker Unit (what you're here for, if not the butts) has been MIA for some time. Yoshika, appalled by war, ends up enlisting in the navy in order to find out about the fate of her father. Hilarity ensues as she enters the boob-and-butt-festival that is the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, a group of elite ace pilots, even though she has no combat experience whatsoever. Doesn't it sound idiotic? Guesswhat? It's actually not half bad.\\n\\n\r\nAs part of the Strike Witches fandom, I've endured many a slight against my favorite anime. Every single one has been accurate. Yes, this show is 75% fanservice and 25% inaccurate WWII history. Yes, it caters to fanboys who just want to see boobies and big guns. But does it have potential? You bet. Nearly every character has the major components of a good one. They have reasons for their behavior, they have motives, they're relatable. The writers and animators could have focused on this aspect, and Strike Witches would have been a whole lot better. Hell, they could have kept in all the butts and cameltoe if they wanted. A little character development would have made this show a great challenge to the general flat-as-a-board ecchi character group. However, they decided to appeal to a mishmash of historical buffs and drooling, mindless fanboys.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all this, I think that Strike Witches is worth watching. As a SW fan, I've learned more about WWII than I ever learned in high school. People claim the same thing of Hetalia, but somehow Hetalia manages to annoy me even more than Strike Witches does. That's beside the point. Strike Witches has a huge universe to build on, appealing animation, and is basically a big bundle of untapped potential. Until that potential is tapped, I'll keep searching for an anime with character, story, and sweet butts.",

            "content": "You've probably heard a little about Strike Witches already, I'm willing to gander.\r\nYou've probably already heard something about it being a fanservice anime if anything. And have already formulated your opinion about it from that.\r\nThe likelyhood of that opinion being that it's just a fanservice anime and is therefore not good. And while there are quite a few fanservice anime that would make you to think that way, being since there are a lot of poorly done fanservice anime, that is not the case here. Oh, but it is not the case at all. Strike Witches is in fact a fanservice anime. But it isan exceptionally well done fanservice anime. In fact, it is a perfectly done fanservice anime. And a recommendation to anyone who wants to see a fanservice anime done right.\\n\\n\r\nAnd since it's given me criteria, I think it's time for me to move on from my preface and work on into the various ratings and why I rate them so.\\n\\n\r\n1. Story.\\n\r\nI really wanted to rate this a ten, but...I don't know how to say this without spoiling it, it builds a decent amount of story and plot and could very well be worked on. But instead of delve into this properly, they focus almost purely on character development. Which is good, considering what it is, that's a good thing. But still, it only leaves for only development like it's an unfinished anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really hard to rate this, because you have to take into account heavy character development is necessary, and that it is a fanservice anime. And that it does at to a whole which I rate a ten. Because even at it's enjoyable pace and good character development and adding to a perfect whole, I can still only rate this an 8.\\n\\n\r\n2. Art\\n\r\nArt is one of the main things that makes this anime what it is. It is truly superb and a magnificent thing to watch. I don't think an anime, much less a fanservice anime could get much better than this in terms of art. It's animated well, and the character design is flawless. It doesn't make any big deviations from the traditional Japanese animation art style, in fact it only forwards the standard style, but it forwards the style so well and perfectly it's really taking it to what we expect it to be doing, remaining, but only developing and improving that style and raising the bar for it.\\n\\n\r\nSo in perhaps more simple words, you have the moe anthropomorphic art style fully realized and rendered. Beautifully used as ever. There's no question that the artwork is what makes this anime. It's not the only thing that's good about this anime of course, but it's something that helps it stand out and be the good anime that it is.\\n\\n\r\n3. Sound\\n\r\nThis anime has superb sound. The character voicing is fantastic, the sound effects are good. And after watching the show, and going back and listening to the soundtrack, realizing, what an amazing job they did on the soundtrack so much that it stands on it's own. It may not be epic, but it does what it asks to be, it's charming. And it fits the mood perfectly. And it's a great piece of musical creation that can easily be enjoyed for hours at a time without any other thing involved.\\n\\n\r\n4. Character\\n\r\nWell, considering I already mentioned character development is the biggest part of this story, it's needless to say it has good character development. I don't think you can say anything bad about the character development, it IS one of the main focuses of the show, and it does it well. They want you to get to know the characters, and the character and made to want to be get to known. They also spend a very decent amount of time on most all the characters. Doing a very good job not to neglect a single one. It's one of the very best parts of this show that keeps you coming back for each episode.\\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment\\n\r\nWell I think that's what gives this a ten. Even if it's a fanservice anime, it never stops being fun for one second. It doesn't overload you with ecchi or fanservice, and when it is that way, it provides in a very amusing fashion that most fanservice anime completely and utterly lack. If I could set a standard for what even an ecchi anime should be, Strike Witches would be on the list. And way up on that list. It's easy to even forget it's an ecchi or fanservice anime, because it's just so much pure fun.\\n\\n\r\nForget the words and associations that come to mind when you hear the words fanservice and ecchi. Because those things are not what makes this anime. What makes this anime is that it is just a ride of pure fun. Or might I say, a ride through the clear blue skies with a bunch of fun girls.\\n\\n\r\n6. Overall\\n\r\nWell, as an anime being pure fun, this results in the same thing for me as Lucky Star. I think something is pure fun overall and a ten in the scale of enjoyment, it's a ten in the scale of overall. Because isn't that what makes an anime? I say this anime is %100 Outstanding. You just really can't be this sort of anime in the area of overall charm. I think it should become a model for what it is, and become it's own sort of mini-genre. I can already feel the influence of Sky Girls and Strike Witches.\\n\\n\r\nWithout Sky Girls, we wouldn't have Strike Witches. And with the success of these, at least Strike Witches, I can see this helping to spread and eventually create a flood of panty clad women with guns and superpowers, it seems to be it's own genre already. And if it is, I can certainly say this is the Godfather of what's to come. It's really a masterful work, and I can really only, like many others, hope for being graced by a sequel or at least another anime along this lines.\\n\\n\r\n10/10. My life wouldn't have been complete without watching this anime.",

            "content": "The mere premise of Strike Witches is enough to make some cringe. It reeks of otaku pandering nonsense, and is sure to alienate just about anyone who does not take pleasure in voyeurism. Really, all this appears to be is another reason to show half-naked girls using big weapons, and in truth, that is exactly what it is. The funny thing is this show is not bad. In fact, once you get over the unspeakably absurd premise and all the shameless fan-service (or already like this sort of thing), this show is actually quite enjoyable.\r\nYoshika Miyafuji is a kind-spirited, perky 14-year old. She also happensto be able to heal others with magic. She leads a peaceful life, that is until she decides to join the fight against the Neuroi, the mysterious enemy threatening the Earth, with a little prodding from commander Mio Sakamoto. Yoshika becomes a member of the Strike Witches, young women with magical powers who are the strongest defense against the Neuroi. Yoshika's reputation precedes her, as her father is the designer of the \"Striker\" units the Witches use to fly. Together with her new comrades in the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, Yoshika is bound to have some big battles ahead of her, as well as some silly mishaps.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical-side, Strike Witches is a pretty little package. The character designs are not anything especially innovative, but they look lively, and are well proportioned (which is important considering the rampant fan-service). The backgrounds are also well detailed, everything from the vast sky to the interior of the witches outpost looks stellar. The animation is fluid overall, though it is clear most of the focus went to the spectacular air battles. The camera angles do a good job of getting maximum exposure of the girls, even in the midst of battle, which is a big plus for the ecchi fans out there. Gonzo's habit of inserting CGI into their works is present here, but it is used accordingly; it is mainly used for the Neuroi. The music is probably the least memorable thing here. It is not at all bad, and fits the series quite well, but somehow it just does not stand out much compared to what you are seeing.\\n\\n\r\nWell, the problems this show has are pretty obvious. For one, it caters to otaku, or more precisely ecchi fans, rather than casual viewers. Anyone who is not into animated teenage girls having their privates exposed while fighting a seemingly faceless adversary will likely avoid this after a single glance. Even if they did though, they will still find a plot that is lacking. Very little is explained about this world, which is in fact an alternative version of the WWII era, a fact I left out in my summery because it has very little barring on the plot (other than the characters' names). The Neuroi are given no understandable motive, not that it matters since they only serve as opponents for the witches and little more. Heck, the powers of the witches are barely even explored. Why do they sprout animal appendages when they activate their powers? To please the otaku masses is my guess. Why do witches lose their magic around the age of 20? Well, they needed some reason the military would rely on a bunch of teenage girls. This is all haphazard writing, and it shows. However, all these short comings are remedied by the fact that the show does not take itself too seriously. Most of the shows run is spent on ecchi shenanigans and visually spectacular battles against the Neuroi, and it works. This is what makes the show enjoyable despite its poor writing.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that the writing did get right was the characters. The witches are a collection of surprisingly refreshing personalities. They all have distinctive personality quirks that make them likable, from shy Lynette to free-spirited (and boob obsessed) Francesca. Even the snobbish Perrine is likable. The girls play off each other well, especially within the duos the show seems to pair them in. Whether they are kindred spirits, like the mischievous  Charlotte and Francesca, or an odd couple like disciplined Trude and laid-back Erica, the chemistry between them is delightful. This is not really masterful characterization, as characters have difficulty carrying more dramatic moments, but it cannot be said that any of the characters are unlikable (with the exception of the hard-ass general, who's whole purpose was to be unlikable).\\n\\n\r\nStrike Witches is a show that knows its viewership and aims straight for them. It does not even try to appeal to anyone outside of its demographic, and therein lies its biggest strength and weakness. Those who like this kind of thing will love this show; those who don't will avoid it like a plague. As for this reviewer, I'm on the fence, torn between the guilty pleasure that is the ecchi genre and the sensibility of better penned stories.",

            "content": "When I left my home and mom two years ago, I (along with Pikachu) venture into the deep realms of the anime territory. Alienated towards the otaku culture, I felt depressed looking for a war anime that can suit my tastes; Grave of the Fireflies was not enough for me. I entered into a forest one night. Night came and none appeared before me. I ate all my Kitkats by then. Hungry, I killed Pikachu and devoured its tender meat over a campfire. I continued journeying, but my vision blurred; everything around me turns misty and foggy. I hear the flapping of the wings andthe rustle of the trees. The forest was laughing at me. Losing hope, I fell down to the mud. Writhing in agony, I looked towards the dark night sky. I called up to the heavens, \u201cSave me, God. Save me from this despair.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\tGod said, \u201cOkie dokey, dude. Check out this anime. It\u2019s called Sora no Woto. You\u2019ll love it; it\u2019s pretty radical, man!\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\tToday, I am back at home well-fed. My mom cried when I told her Pikachu was killed by the characters from K-On!. Nevertheless, the miracle known as Sora no Woto made me ponder about the future of war animes.\\n\\n\r\n\tA few weeks ago, Professor Oak gave me Charmander along a copy of Strike Witches. He boasted, \u201cIt\u2019s uncensored. Consider it a rite of passage.\u201d He patted me on the shoulder, winking. I had never heard of Strike Witches until the professor told me so. Judging from the synopsis, it looked like a war anime. I went into the MyAnimeList database, reading the synopsis and the reviews; many people likened this work to Sora no Woto, the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs awarded this work for cultural excellence, and God told me to review works through Fox News before that. I decided to watch this work and review the work.\\n\\n\r\n\tStrike Witches is set in an alternate World War II setting, specifically the Battle of Britain. Considered one of the toughest battles in World War II history, the Battle of Britain setting has the potential to set up thought-provoking characters and themes. It can make us ponder about the effects of the appeasement effort led by Neville Chamberlain, war in different people\u2019s perspectives, shell shock, and more. Sora no Woto might actually lose to the work\u2019s possible themes; its themes are environmental, cultural, and anti-war by nature, criticizing warmongers for making the world it is today. Consider Strike Witches\u2019s setting for a minute. Wouldn\u2019t this be a fascinating show for everyone to watch?\\n\\n\r\n\tI remembered Professor Oak\u2019s winking. As I began to watch, I realized why he winked. Oh dear, I\u2019m seeing young girls\u2019 reproductive organs and underwear for no apparent reason except Freudian imaginations. The alternate history made little sense whatsoever. This did not bode well.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn this alternate historical setting, Japan worked with the Allies and stationed their troops at London. The Neurois, aka the Nazis, were unknown sentient creatures that kept blasting away Europe for no particular reason. Their aircrafts looked starkly similar to US stealth fighters. The Allies were stumped, losing all of Europe except England. How could anyone damage the aircrafts when they clearly had force fields protecting them?\\n\\n\r\n\tJapan\u2019s answer: girls with jetpacks and basic weaponry.\\n\\n\r\n\tStrike Witches\u2019s setting combined the Battle of Britain, mecha logic, and the mahou shoujo genre so weirdly it made little sense. Questionable aspects of how things worked were never answered throughout the course of this anime.\\n\\n\r\n\tAs I began to write this review, God cried out through Hannity\u2019s mouth, \u201cWhat about the characters? This show is all about the characters just like Sora no Woto is!\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\tWhat made Sora no Woto\u2019s characters so special was that they felt necessary in contributing the story and the themes. Strike Witches\u2019s characters could go into that direction, but most of the times want to, you know, go in an upper direction.\\n\\n\r\n\tTake Lynette, one of the few likable characters in the work. When she was introduced in the work, she was shown as a shy girl character; a good comparison would be a girly version of Ikari Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion. In the end of the episode, she began to open up towards Miyafuji by squishing her to death; suffocating and dying between Lynette\u2019s cleavage sounded like a nice way to die, but it was no example of good storytelling.\\n\\n\r\n\tGertrud Barkhorn and the two white-haired girls are the only characters to go completely into characterization. The episode with Barkhorn has some fantastic exposition added in; people can understand her mindset more clearly. The two white-haired girls have interesting stories as well.\\n\\n\r\n\tEveryone else feels stale. All we really know from Sakamoto Mio is that she laughs like Jack from The Shining and does whatever cos a pirate is free. Perrine is a stalker of Mio. Erica is a clumsy ace pilot. Miyafuji can heal. Francesca is Ed from Cowboy Bebop. There isn\u2019t many characteristics that make these characters involving or realistic; they are just there. Cardboard boxes make better characters than these people.\\n\\n\r\n\tLike Sora no Woto, it is somewhat episodic. Most of the plot involves the fascinating premise of \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d. A particular episode involved about underwear. Very few of them are memorable. When the show adds tension, it does not feel tense; it looks plain silly. The dramatic story and conclusion emerges at the end. Predictable and silly, the conclusion to the work does not pay off well; things get solved with a deus ex machina. There is also a cliffhanger, pointing people to watch Strike Witches 2.\\n\\n\r\n\tNo thanks, Gonzo. I might watch it someday, but it\u2019s not due to your cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\n\tI returned the set to Professor Oak and yawned. I do not think this work was the worst work I\u2019ve seen. It did not piss me off a lot; though, I ate a boiled skewed Charmander on a satay stick in the end because of how bored I was. There are things I disliked -- the fanservice, the wasted potential, the unfunny side characters. However, they don\u2019t cause me to hate this work. Instead, I just thought this work as really average; it did not offend me at all. I was just really bored.\\n\\n\r\n\tThere are definitely people who loved it; some may say it is thought-provoking, maybe even more against Sora no Woto. I don\u2019t see it that way nor do I think the endorsement by the government is needed. Say all you want, but I see it as a government-endorsed loli pantsu anime with girls on jetpacks beating up Nazis. It\u2019s no Sora no Woto, that\u2019s for sure. I suppose it can be entertaining to people -- it is possible that I have no soul. As a work of artistic and cultural achievement, now that\u2019s a great joke to laugh about.",

            "content": "Three years ago, I watched this anime and slapped it a rotten score. After all, an anime featuring pantless, gun-bopping teenage girls couldn\u2019t possibly ascribe anything of depth to the varied community of anime goers and entertainment seekers today, right? \r\nRight.\r\nThen during my second time through, I realized something unbelievable about this series. This anime isn\u2019t about half-naked chicks shooting down big, black cocks with guns. Right?\r\nRight\u2026ish.\r\nSo yes\u2026by my THIRD time through I realized: Strike Witches is an idiot savant of an anime. It is an attempted excuse for Japan\u2019s WWII guilt, and combined with incidental, radical feminism investigates a unique reality of victory forall humans and absolution of the original Axis Powers. Furthermore, rather than to be undone by fellow man, the retribution for all the anger of that era is instead unleashed upon an enigmatic alien race bent on aimless worldwide destruction.\\n\\n\r\nYour 501st Fighter Wing. All the guns, less of the garments. (9/10)\\n\r\nDespite my rather despicable claims, this simple, misdirected story eagerly rakes in a \u201cbare\u201d perspective on Japanese postwar culture more than anything other anime series I\u2019ve ever watched. Yoshika Miyafuji, our protagonist from the Fuso Nation, has after a series of misadventures found herself smack dab in the middle of an international war between humans and a hostile alien invader known as the Neuroi. Though the Neuroi\u2019s intentions and methods are unknown, Miyafuji and the 501st Joint Fighters\u2014the Strike Witches, or gun-wielding teenage girls utilizing magic-powered, leg-mounted rocket engines known as \u201cStrikers\u201d to fly\u2014dedicate their lives (and panties) to the survival of mankind.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most misunderstood things about this anime is its high degree of fanservice. Nearly every ten seconds the viewer is exposed to some sort of sexual innuendo, be it the slightest visual of pantsu or a blatant bath scene with boobs flopping about like custard. The delivery is unabashed in consistency, if not almost bewildering considering the depth of the alternate historical content. Indeed, this deceitful mask of perversion disguises a highly controversial possibility for this alternate universe as follows:\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a relative time frame to what we live, there is no evidence for existing non-Japanese Asians, Jews, or Blacks in the entire series INCLUDING doujin and movie-based media. In the series, the closest to being black might be the Italian girl, Francesca, but considering the brutal circumstances of World War II it freaks me out that neither a Jew or a Chinese exists among the ranks of survivors.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason only a small group of magical women between the ages of 12-20 seem to be effective as combatants. Men, older women, and machines seem to be rather defenseless, rendering none but Highly Effeminate Teenage Vixens (HETV) as our only hope.\\n\\n\r\nWhat are the Neuroi? The mysterious qualities of the enemy are vividly explored, but some answers aren\u2019t given. I find it fascinating that the Neuroi have chosen a spot of the world between Karlsland (Germany) and eastern Russia (Orussia) as their hive. If we consider the alignment of world powers during the war era, isn\u2019t it interesting that the brutal enemy of humanity is stationed somewhere in Central Asia? Also, isn\u2019t it just as interesting that the \u201cgood guys\u201d in this series happen to hail from Japan (Fuso), Karlsland, and Orussia? Does anyone see what I\u2019m getting at here?\\n\\n\r\nMy conclusion is that Strike Witches presents as an innocent peep show, when it ruthlessly stakes on radicalism and nationalism as the true berth of survival. The weakest races have been eliminated, and a unique gift of power to women establishes a rather unanticipated form of feminism\u2014perhaps with the intent to balance out the missing historical factors of this show.\\n\\n\r\nThis is particularly true with feminism. Throughout the series we CLEARLY see the reduced sexuality of women\u2019s legs, as nearly all women in the show do not wear pants. For the otaku this is obnoxiously fanservice; to the alternate reality, this is a normal getup. In this setting, men would have to start from this specific style of dress to find sexual arousal, and thus would be presented less opportunities to think perverse thoughts. Women, too, lose power through arousal of men, and are then more focused on careers and independence. I\u2019m sure many a fan has tried to excuse this by saying that \u201cin order to fit into the Strikers they can\u2019t wear pants\u2014blah blah\u2014requiem stop talking\u2014I\u2019ll bite you\u201d sort of argument is the most cogent.\\n\\n\r\nThe sad truth is that they\u2019re only halfway there. Feminism wins simply by the lifestyle of this series, and\u2014considering that all other types of Asians are missing\u2014it is winning much more than races or gender stereotypes by default.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have evidence for radicalism through the consistent failures of men throughout both seasons. Airplanes, battleships, and maritime weapons are all rendered useless, bereaved of all duty but to serve as cannon fodder for the elite Witch squadrons. Commanders shrug helplessly while their ships are mercilessly crushed and sunk, and whatever authority they might even have over Witches is easily bypassed.\\n\\n\r\nNext, if the Bechdel test were to be applied to this series, hardly a moment in it would fail. The entire series voids men of any appeal or authority, focusing the entire story on the Witches and their sisterhood. This is fascinating, especially considering that a tit or ass flies across the screen with all but sexual abandon. Even Yoshika\u2019s awkward tit fetish remains effeminate, keeping the perversion limited only to women without delving into yuri or shoujo ai. Also, in great relief there are absolutely no random peeping scenes involving half-naked men getting punched by tiny women into the stratosphere while shouting \u201cI AM LIKE\u2026SO SORRY.\u201d Or at least not as in the exhausting case of practically EVERY ecchi harem series known to otakukind.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, though the creator himself may not have even dreamed of this, his lewd creation defines \u201cunique\u201d in its background, plot, and style. It may have been designed to make men horny and stupid, but it could still be insightful enough for any informed viewer. For reasons such as this, I can offer a ridiculously high score.\\n\\n\r\nTwo-dimensional, but well-grown. (6/10)\\n\r\nWhile stock characters are expected for a series focused on as many pantsu shots as possible, making sure the characters actually fit together is not as such required. Strike Witches makes several attempts to go beyond that, particularly with complicated ladies like Minna, Eila, or Gertrud. I should not be spoiling this series at all in saying that our main protagonist lives up to our expectations, as her limitations and delimiters all come and go as expected. There are a few good moments for everyone, even support characters such as Shirley, Perrine, and Francesca.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, all of the girls make up for their limited personalities with well-placed anecdotes of growth. Mio, in particular, encounters a struggle that puts the entire squadron through many hardships, yet we see with her continued passion to save humanity a constant state of perseverance. When not enthused by boobs and butts, we actually start to see a little bit of depth to everyone as they fight their own personal battles, (at least moreso than the drooling we do while they fight the actual enemy.)\\n\\n\r\nMy personal favorite? Definitely Perrine. Not because she\u2019s a prissy, tsuntsun nerd that offers the best personality-to-sexual-exploitation ratio; mainly just because she is easy to figure out. In fact, each witch has some sort of spice to her that feeds the lonely wolves like me. While it is designed as an advertisement net to catch and draw my attention, it is at least nice to get a little more differential between the women than a typical 21st century harem series with the same visual appeal.\\n\\n\r\nIncidental music WIN. OP/ED fail. (8/10)\\n\r\nNeither the opening nor closing theme of either season was particularly fascinating. Though well composed and nicely sung, the openings are unfortunately the same, drab Ishida Yoko dancepop ditties that dominate such a small market with upbeat feel and trendy melody. Even though they are in the same court as Ishida, the I\u2019ve Sound girls always manage to harness a stronger or more atmospheric melody. To its own justice the series should have had its own personal opening theme. Or perhaps rather than dance music, why not something on the side of a tune from the WWII era? Either way, another pop song about \u201cDoing what I can do\u201d and \u201cloving some certain, undistinguished person\u201d is justifiable for me to skip ahead one and a half minutes as soon as possible every time.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, the real groundwork is done by a time tested artist like Seikou Nagaoka. His track \u201cWitch no Tatakai,\u201d or \u201cA Witch\u2019s Fight\u201d is a driving force for perhaps the entire series\u2019 climactic moments. Written with a very powerful bass line, we can feel the surge of excitement build up as the melody creeps in at some point seconds later. The sort of \u201cchampion melody\u201d rises out of the trumpets (or in some cases, an electric guitar) through the oscillating strings, and builds up more and more intensity when recapitulating for a second time through. This track is perfectly aligned for underdog victories, high speeds, and pretty much most highly emotional scenes on the battlefield. For something that he probably threw together in 20 minutes, the perfectly chained elements make it quite unforgettable\u2014I still could recall it several years after my first viewing of the show!\\n\\n\r\nNagaoka also empowers more endearing moments with his gentle strings in \u201cEikou no Kiroku.\u201d He draws out mystery with \u201cKunou\u201d and its Dorian harp. He demonstrates his mastery of orchestration with the grinding bass harmonies in \u201cNeuroi no Su he.\u201d Without a doubt, the musical programming for a show like this fit all too perfectly to serve as distraction from the fanservice, or at least more than the jumpy tunes that surround each episode.\\n\\n\r\nAn animation behest to bre-hests. Ha. Ha. Ha. (7/10)\\n\r\nAs a healthy male I would be criminalizing this series for giving the animation a score lower than 70 points. It is literally as though the animation studio took an extensive class on drawing vaginal protrusions and ample bosoms while studying butlery.\\n\r\nSeriously. Every few seconds, however subtle or obvious, a boob or butt is \u201cserved warm\u201d to our eyes as a feast, delivering the most intoxicating form of perversion so much so that we are left passively molested by our screens. While many other series might put this one to shame in this regard, very few can deliver with the same degree of tastefulness.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest detractor for score here is solely the key animation. Often during fight scenes the characters shapely figures would become too fluid and perhaps not-so-shapely. In fact, within the first five minutes of the series we see a rather terribly drawn view of Gertrud\u2019s patooty, as it is quite clear that somebody was too busy completing key frames to actually bother providing detail to her shape. This same mistake happens several times, showing that despite the \u201cample\u201d details, the budget wasn\u2019t exactly such. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, the action scenes were made with good intention. The weapons are drawn badass\u2014even to the extent that they can be as exciting as the\u2026yep, you guessed it\u2026perhaps the best action scene in the entire show might be the part in season one concerning Shirley and Mach 1; though not very detailed, the desired effect came through quite well. (As for the best episode, it is without debate the infamous sukebe-mushi of Season 2, episode 7.)\\n\\n\r\nUncomfortable for many at first, but the wounds will heal. (8/10)\\n\r\nAnd that is perhaps the best thing about Strike Witches, considering the great deal of socially unacceptable content unleashed over 8 hours visually. If you are a Forever Alone, this series will provide great comfort. If you want to see something controversial and can choke down the hypnotizing amount of female parts, give it a shot. OR even if you are looking for unique Feminist propaganda, this would be great material for a write up.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a married man who wants to pick up a good series to watch with the family\u2026while I would personally think how awesome you are for even trying to suggest this series, you might just want to save it for when the family goes to sleep (or if you watch in sprees, when they go to see the old folks for the weekend.)",

This series was just unbearable.\r\nIt takes place on an alternate earth in World War II-era and focuses on a government-assembled air force squad formally named \"Strike Witches.\" It may seem interesting on the surface, but what we expected was far from what we got.\r\nI am completely aware that this anime was heavy on the fan-service. But when the fan-service eclipses any traces of intended plot, the series will drag on for what feels like eternity. Every time I thought that things were about to get interesting, the creators instead slapped me with more insignificant loli ecchi. You cando fan-service right, but the creators in question exceeded the acceptable limit ten-fold. Strike Witches beat the dead horse and inconveniently used characters that could only realistically consent in third-world countries. Eventually you come to a point where you sense the disappointment radiating from your deceased ancestors and you will find yourself contemplating whether or not this life on earth is all that there is. \\n\\n\r\nThere is definitely a target-audience for this type of series, but I just want to point out that if every girl was replaced with a middle-aged man, there would be a unanimous distaste for the progression of the plot. If you've been challenged to try out a fan-service anime like I was, stay far away from this one. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I really wouldn't recommend this anime to my worst enemy. I gave it a 2 because despite everything terrible about it, there was a lot of production and effort that went into this. But still, save yourself the 5 hours.",

            "content": "Strike Witches was originally created by illustrator, Shimada Fumikane as a mixed-media project. It has since been adapted into light novels, manga, anime and video games. The first anime series was brought to us by Gonzo. You may remember them from their work on Gantz, Brave Story, Bakuretsu Tenshi, Basilisk & Zettai Boei Leviathan, just to name some of them I've reviewed. So, how does this one compare to the others? Let's delve into it and see.\r\nStory:\r\nStrike Witches is set in an alternate world where an enigmatic enemy called the Neuroi has appeared and started attacking people. Humanity's best line of defense is a groupof young girls, most of whom range in age from twelve to sixteen, with magical powers. These are the titular witches. With the background stuff out of the way, our story proper opens with fourteen year old Miyafuji getting approached by one of the few characters who isn't disturbingly young, Major Sakamoto Mio. Sakamoto wants to recruit her for the Witches but Miyafuji refuses, not wanting to use her powers for violence. Things change, because the setup is so obvious that of course they do, when Miyafuji receives a letter from her deceased father, the man who designed the \u201cbrooms\u201d that the witches use to fly through the sky. She reluctantly agrees to go with Sakamoto.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with what's wrong with the series. The biggest thing is that it wastes a lot of time on really disturbing fan-service scenes. Keep in mind, most of the major characters are twelve to sixteen years old. There are only three of eleven who are adults. And I thought Devil Hunter Yohko was bad about sexualising a young girl, which it is but at least she's not twelve nor did they have an episode about undergarment pilfering. What were they thinking? The series also doesn't fully develop its aspects that have potential. There are some interesting ideas that get brought up but never fully taken advantage of. The stuff with the girls trying to unravel the truth about the Neuroi is really interesting, but they only give you a small chunk of it. I guess showing a twelve year old in the bath was more important. Way to keep things the complete opposite of classy and to have your priorities completely ass backwards at the same time. I'm sure the multi-tasking was very hard. Maybe they're saving it for the sequel, which wouldn't be a problem if they at least gave you something compelling in the meantime as opposed to really sick fan-service involving girls who are way too young for that shit.\\n\\n\r\nTo the series' credit, it does have some legitimately good stuff too. When the focus is on the characters, rather than the characters' underage bodies, it has some really good moments. The story proper, in spite of being filler heavy, is legitimately interesting and the last couple episodes are actually really strong. I like that they start things out looking like it's just going to be a monster of the week type thing but quickly start introducing plot elements that move it beyond that, even if they don't take full advantage of their potential. The story elements for the major story had a lot of really good ideas that could have made for a really compelling work if not for all the sleaziness.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis is an area where I'll give Strike Witches credit. In spite of having almost as many major characters as they have episodes, they manage to flesh them out pretty well and there are some really good character moments and interactions. Unfortunately, the villains aren't particularly compelling. You know that there's more to them then is readily apparent and there are some interesting bits to go with it, but it's not fully realised. If only they'd had something pointless and disgusting to cut out, like fan-service scenes of barely pubescent girls. Then they might have been able to go somewhere with it. Oh wait... they did. They chose to keep the fan-service scenes instead.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of issues with the art. For one thing, most of our heroines don't wear pants or anything that covers their legs. Instead, we get shirts and panties. They fly around in the air at high velocities, how do their nethers not get really cold and uncomfortable? Now, you might say \u201cBut Ktulu, they use magic. Isn't it possible that their magic regulates their body temperature?\u201d Which might be a fair point, except that several of them actually talk about being cold during the panty pilfering episode. Because a single pair of panties was so much protection, apparently. You might shift to \u201cwell, maybe the lack of fabric helps their flying units work.\u201d Except that they show three of the girls actually covering their legs and it works out just fine for them. You might also wonder if, maybe, their machines heat up a lot and it's more comfortable. The problem is that they wear the same outfits when they're on the ground and in the air. No, these outfits are because some sick bastard wanted to see barely pubescent girls in their panties.\\n\\n\r\nThe outfits would be bad enough by themselves, but the series really pushes the sleaziness bar by showing these girls, most of whom are twelve to sixteen (I can't emphasise that fact enough), completely starkers. There's a continuing tradition in this series of unnecessary group bath scenes involving full breasts, nipples included. Did you want to see a twelve year old's breasts? You're probably replying in the negative since you're sane, but this series will show you anyway. Now, I will be fair to the series. It does have really good action sequences and the designs of the Neuroi are pretty cool. They also did a pretty decent job with the background scenery.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nHere's another area where I'll give the series quite a bit of credit. The cast does do well in their roles. Tanaka Rie and Ohashi Ayuru in particular but there aren't any bad performances by any means. The music is also nicely done. I'll give Nagaoka Seikou credit on that one.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's quite a bit of les-yay in Strike Witches. Miyafuji has a thing for Lynne. At one point she even has what is heavily implied to be a sex dream about her, and there are certainly indications that the feeling is mutual. Perrine explicitely has a crush on Major Sakamoto. Barkhorn and Hartmann seem to have a romance going. Eila and Sanya definitely have a romance going, and I will say that the stuff between the two of them is absolutely adorable and, surprisingly for this series, unsexualised. Lucchini gropes the other girls on multiple occasions, Shirley taking the brunt of it. There are also some moments where Minna and Sakamoto seem to have a thing. So, the ho-yay factor is an 8/10. Expect a lot of les-yay.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nStrike Witches could have been a good series. Possibly even really good. It has some strong story elements and characters. It does really well with action sequences and the vocal cast is solid. Unfortunately, it's held back by an absurd level of sleaziness. It wastes time that could have been spent on plot or strengthening the characters with barely pubescent girl fan-service and it makes it a really uncomfortable series to watch at times. Does that aspect make it a bad series? No, but it certainly has a severe detrimental effect on it. If you can tolerate the exploitative shit, and that's a big if, you might enjoy it. If you're an ill-supervised horny young teenager who likes girls, then this might just be for you. Seek it out, Young Lady. For me, the positive aspects and negative ones do balance pretty evenly so my rating is a 5/10. Maybe I'll look at Strike Witches 2 at some point, either because I get curious or because someone requests it, but for next week I'll look at Choujigen Game Neptune: The Animation. Please tell me it doesn't have under-aged nudity.",

            "content": "I had very high hopes when I finally made a move and started watching Strike Witches.\r\nAnd those hopes were brutally murdered.\r\nStory 2/10\r\nThe plot of this anime is ridiculously full of holes.\r\nFor example in episode one Miyafuji and Lynne fall in the ocean with their striker units on and swom without any trouble, while in episode two they actually undertake training for situations with falling into the ocean with their units on AND THEY SUCK AT IT suddenly.\r\nThere are many mysterious events going on about without much explaining at all. Like the thing that every single young girl has only underwear on her lower body parts!That's just stupid and I would've let it slide IF someone would mind at least explaining it a little bit.\\n\r\nThe story is focused on showing panties and that's the main star- girls' underwear. I know, in some quantity it's fine, but there you get ONLY THIS.\\n\r\nOh, right, and guns. some shooting for action.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is actually pretty good. I like the style, the girls are made cute, teh animation doesn't screw up. The colors are enjoyable for the eye. Just some minor details don't seem right, that's it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI actually don't remember the sound from the anime itself. That means it didn't catch my attention at all as good. The intro is simple yet catchy. Same goes for the ending. It might be too simple for all the fans out there, though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are all pretty cute girls, with some past, reasons to fight and so on. Apart from the panties-all-their-lives outfits they aren't so bad. Their reasoning seems off at many times though, the story itself is taking it's stupid toll on them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch this show without drinking alcohol or just being drunk. You won't enjoy it a bit if there's plot you're looking for. It seems as if the show was aimed at not very bright male teenagers hungry for women. It's not enjoyable to watch panty shots over and over and over all the time. It can bore the watcher quite quickly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\\n\r\nMy note is up at 4 because I like the art. The charcters are cute too and that's where the good parts end. I was very dissapointed in the show as the plot is just dumb. Perhaps the second season will bright things up for me, but as I heard from my friends, it doesn't get better...\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this show for people who want to search for plot failures, like the one I used as an example. And just for that....",

            "content": "*A Japanese government endorsed loli-pantsu anime.*\r\nPlease don't say it is bad just because you find girls in panties horrifying. I admit it is lousy for the director to claim that girls in panties = fashion in the Strike Witches' world, but that alone is no reason to give a bad rating to an anime (if you do, I am sorry, you don't know how to rate at all). Strike Witches is MUCH deeper than one may expect to find from a fanservice-oriented series.\r\n--Updated on February 12, 2009--\r\nThe Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs has recently openly endorsed Strike Witches as an example of cultural excellence. \r\nTheworld of Strike Witches is pretty much parallel to our world up to 1939 (before World War II). At that time, mysterious beings known as Neuroi invaded Europe. Thus rather than the real WWII, this resulted in a war between Human VS Neuroi. The story revolves around a group of girls with special magical powers that allow them to equip the \"Striker Units\" to combat the Neuroi. The story proceeds nicely with these magical girls fighting Neuroi, but sadly the ending seem to be a bit \"wishy-washy\".\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation quality is great for the most part. The battle scenes, in particular, are extremely well made. In short, we see a nice blending effects from the battle animation with the regular drama scenes. All episodes seem to have highly consistent animation and of course, the DVD includes polished artwork and fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are both good although not particularly outstanding and there's a good chance you'll forget about them after a few days. However, the melody of the songs suit the theme of the anime quite nicely. In addition, the battle themes and the Japanese version of Lili Marlene (a famous German love song that was popular during World War II) all contributed nicely to the series and are valuable assets to the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe production group did a nice job at introducing the main/supporting characters and then slowly further develop them. Actually, the character introductions might explain why the story started out slowly (after all there are 11 girls to talk about). If there is one thing I find the characters disappointing it is that some of the witches' specialty were not revealed until the end (most were never mentioned).\\n\\n\r\nThough I didn't like to see girls showing off their panties the way they are done in this anime, but putting that aside, the show itself (from story to art to sound to character) is very well planned out and the fact that they include references to the real WWII is just that much more interesting to watch. (*edit* The ending was really surprising, hope you'll enjoy the show just as much as I did)",

            "content": "I don't know what it was that intrigued me about this show when I first saw it but I was very interested in seeing it after the first episode.  In the end it was a bit disappointing though because early on I thought it had the potential to be something very special.\r\nAs others have said, Strike Witches is automatically going to appeal to a certain group of people, and you probably already know who you are.  Basically SW is the battle of Britain with Loli witches riding mechanical brooms fighting mysterious aliens and carrying huge guns... without pants.  Yes I don't understandthe last part either.  If you love cute girls in their panties and LOTS of highly detailed shots of those girls in said panties, this is definitely your show!  Also judging from the amount of bath scenes there is surely to be a lot of boobs for those who watch the DVD release.\\n\\n\r\nNot that any of the above really offends me, because it doesn\u2019t.  But I hate to see the story suffer because of excessive fan service, and in Strike Witches case it does.  In a 12 episode series there is very little time to develop the characters and storyline, and SW wastes at least 2 full episodes catering to fan service.  One episode is devoted entirely to the girls walking around without their panties on and stealing each others.\\n\\n\r\nThe story which started with a lot of promise really loses steam as it winds down.  So much is left unexplained and the motives of the Neuroi are never explained.  A very significant plot hole remains unexplained in the final story arc and it just felt like a downer when you don\u2019t get a very satisfying conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nYou might think because of the above comments that I hated this show, but I really didn't.  The show does do a number of things right.  First the animation is really good.  The girls are really cute and I fell in love with all of them.  The show does manage to develop all their personalities pretty well.  There is a lot of action too, the air battles with the Neuroi are pretty fun.  The OP and EN songs are pretty good but aren\u2019t really anything special.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end the show was fun to watch but I am left feeling a bit let down.  It just didn't live up to the potential it had early on.  Some people are going to like this show a lot though.  If you\u2019re looking for some mindless fun for several hours with the bonus of pantsu then you should check this show out.\\n",

            "content": "Though Strike Witches isn't nearly as generic as the first few eps would lead you to believe, it's still nothing to get all in a tizzy about. Moe cliches and fetishism abound, you already know the audience with one glance, and if you're in that audience it's not half-bad.\r\nStrike Witches is about young girls fighting faceless enemies in an alternate WWII era. Inexplicably, they sprout animal ears and tails when they use magic and pants don't seem to exist anymore. As you can probably guess, this isn't a show heavy in plot. What makes it relatively enjoyable is that the plot (and use that wordvery loosely) is often negated in favor of servicey hijinks and yuri subtext. Well, at least the show knows it's audience.\\n\\n\r\nThis 1940s farce is headed by a gaggle of 16-year-old girls who look half that age, but somehow have boobs. The girls' personalities are relegated to such archetypes as tsundere, big-boobed klutz, brat, etc. etc. They're somewhat redeemed by being reverse-gender caricatures of famous WWII leaders. Go figure.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, though GONZO, is relatively subdued. It's aesthetically pleasing outside of the Neuroi and flows smoothly. Best of all, there's no CG glut commonly associated with anime of this studio.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is just a hair's breadth above mediocre, and the OP and ED are patchwork themes in music and lyrics. Hardly inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like cute girls showing their panties, then I don't see why you'd turn this down. But don't expect anything even remotely serious from Strike Witches. It's a 100% guilty pleasure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Strike Witches gets a 6 out of 10.",

            "content": "\u201cNever in the animated medium has a cast of so many, worn clothes so few.\u201d\r\n -Winston Churchill\r\n Strike Witches is perhaps the most elaborate method to showcase girls in their underwear that has ever been contrived; while other series make use of upward camera angles or \u2018hillarious\u2019 accidental groping to provide the viewer with their ration of sexual titillation, Gonzo decided that it was time to stop beating about the bush and start being candid. And what could be more candid than a five second close up of an adolescent girl\u2019s camel toe?\r\n Admittedly it\u2019s not exactly the most cultured form of entertainment around, andcertainly not one you\u2019ll ever find yourself recommending to your parents, co-workers, prospective sexual partners or any Federal Agents that happen to be paying you a visit. However, for those of you who only need to worry about the last item on that list, Strike Witches is the perfect anime for you!\\n\\n\r\n But you don\u2019t need your picture on the side of a Milk Carton in order to enjoy Strike Witches; if you just want to watch one of the most creative, action packed and entertaining anime series out there, then all you need to do is swallow your pride and take your first flight with the guys and girls of the 501st Joint Fighter Squadron. \\n\\n\r\n Just kidding- there aren\u2019t any guys in Strike Witches. Honestly, who on earth would want to see men flying around in their underwear? No, that would just be silly. Yup, they\u2019re all girls. All eleven of them. With each one representing every country in the world that matters- Japan, Britain, The United States of America, Germany, France, Japan, The Soviet Union, Finland, Italy, Germany and Germany. If you\u2019re feeling a little disappointed with that list, you needn\u2019t worry too much\u2014there are more German characters introduced later on in the show.\\n\\n\r\n Of course, with a main character to episode ratio of almost 1:1, you might expect a few issues with character development. And you\u2019d be right- almost half of the cast spend three quarters of the series effectively as background scenery- though the problem is alleviated to a certain degree by the fact that the whole cast has only a quarter of a personality between them.\\n\\n\r\n It sounds terrible, and it probably is- a cast made up entirely of stereotypes is certainly not an artistic statement- but at the same time it\u2019s what allows Strike Witches to work. We don\u2019t need to know about each character, because we already know everything there is to know about them- because we\u2019ve seen them a thousand times before. It sounds a bit illogical, but what\u2019s the use of applying logic to a show about a group of teenage girls flying through the air with aeroplane propellers strapped to their ankles? \\n\\n\r\n And it\u2019s not as if they\u2019re unlikable characters. Quite the opposite, in fact- among the cast of eleven, you\u2019ll end up liking at least eight of them. If nothing else, they certainly are an entertaining bunch to watch.\\n\\n\r\n Now we\u2019ve covered all the key points, let\u2019s delve a little deeper and look at the less important elements of the story, like the story itself: Post World War 2, Alien invasion, Aircraft powered by magic. Got that? Good.\\n\\n\r\n There is an overarching storyline here, but if you hadn\u2019t already realised, Strike Witches isn\u2019t exactly a work of literary genius. What does matter though are the individual episode stories, which are excellent- great fun to watch and reasonably original, which believe me is saying a lot for an ecchi anime. There\u2019s a good mix of action packed battles, low brow humour and some melodrama that makes for some lowest common denominator entertainment of the highest calibre.\\n\\n\r\n On the subject of melodrama, one unintentionally amusing aspect of the show is the use of overly dramatic orchestral music during the battle sequences. When juxtaposed to the high pitched, middle of the road J-pop of the opening sequence, it\u2019s hard not to let out a snobbish little chuckle. Talk about delusions of grandeur...\\n\\n\r\n Of course, when it comes to presentation, there are no delusions... just sweet, sweet grandeur.\\n\\n\r\n Whatever you may think of Gonzo Entertainment, of CGI visuals or of the moe aesthetic, there\u2019s no getting around the fact that Strike Witches is quality animation at its finest. Particularly the battle sequences, which were fast paced, well choreographed and smooth. It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that it was so well animated that I get a hard on just thinking about it, and not just because of those panty shots I mentioned earlier.\\n\\n\r\n The integration of CGI with traditional animation (by which I mean digital animation) has long been a burning issue for anime fans, without any clear resolution -should those responsible for it be burned at the stake, or would tarring-and-feathering them be justifiable- where you stand on the issue is entirely up to you; but even the most unreasonable of lynch mobs should be willing to consider letting Strike Witches off the hook, because it has actually made it work. That\u2019s right; no obvious shade-free surfaces or objects that look out of place- everything is well done and kept in the backdrop, where it should be when it can\u2019t be where it really ought to be (off screen).\\n\\n\r\n This review has attempted to justify the unjustifiable. It has struggled desperately to sing the praises of a show that is little more than a cacophony of the worst vices in anime- thirty year old single men, thirteen year old girls and, worst of all, three dimensional animation. Cynics will say that Strike Witches is a show that was made with only one goal; to sell to as many depressing and possibly slightly gullible single middle aged men as possible, and the fact that it\u2019s hugely entertaining is a mere co-incidence -and maybe they\u2019re right. But perhaps they can take a little comfort from the fact that it didn\u2019t quite work out.\\n\\n\r\n \u201cA single sale is a tragedy; but even a million sales won\u2019t save Gonzo from Bankruptcy\u201d\\n\r\n -Josef Stalin\\n",

            "content": "Strike Witches is the story of some flying panties, a bunch of girls and a few pairs of breasts. If that\u2019s all it takes to make you happy, then great, because Strike Witches offers very little else.\r\nThis is a fanservice anime, so if you're expecting anything deeper than a puddle in terms of plot or people, you might as well give up now. However, that's not an excuse for a truly awful anime.\r\nThe premise is about as dumb as it sounds. We have eleven girls with magic powers and airplane propellers strapped to their legs, who are apparently the military\u2019s only hope of defeating abunch of outer space aliens.\\n\\n\r\nSounds like fun, huh?\\n\\n\r\nThe bad part is, the story doesn't really go anywhere from there. More than half of the episodes have absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Most of the show is just a bunch of girls running around doing goofy things, taking baths, and beating up the obligatory bad guy. The ending tries to scrape together a plot at the last minute, but it\u2019s so full of plot holes and unresolved stories it ends up being a mess, too. If you were waiting for a conclusion to the loose ends strewn all over the place, you\u2019re out of luck. At the end of the series, all I could say was, \u201czuh?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty paper-thin. Only about four of the eleven characters get regular screen-time, the rest of the gang is pretty much scenery. In lieu of character development we\u2019re supposed to be satisfied watching cute girls do cute things. (But really, who doesn't love watching cute girls do cute things, right?) By the end of the series, the only things you\u2019ll remember about the characters are their hair color and sexual orientation.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains (if you can even call them that) of the story are a band of aliens called the Neuroi, and they\u2019re among some of the most laughable bad guys in all of anime history. First of all, nobody knows a blessed thing about them, not even the military or the Strike Witches themselves. We never figure out who they are, what they are, where they come from, or what they\u2019re doing. The design for these extraterrestrials is baffling. Most of them look like they were lifted from some bad Cinema 4D tutorial. In one episode, we have the girls fighting an alien shaped like a giant Rubik\u2019s cube. On top of that, the enemy isn't even remotely threatening. Apparently they\u2019re so little of a threat that the Strike Witches don\u2019t even bother to go after them, they just laze around at home base until one flies overhead.\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice isn't anything you haven\u2019t seen before. If, for some reason, you haven\u2019t seen enough of girls scrabbling at each other\u2019s breasts, it might amuse you. But, while I like naked lolis as much as the next guy, the fanservice is stuck in place of a coherent story. There\u2019s literally an entire episode about panties. After a while it just feels like a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nStrike Witches is an absolutely terrible anime, and I can only hope that I have saved you from the pain of watching it. In the end, the only reason you should ever watch this is if you need an anime that will make you sit back and think, \"What the hell am I doing with my life?\"",

            "content": "Strike Witches is a fresh, entertaining anime that has been unfairly criticized by a handful of spoilsports who claim moral superiority over the rest of the internets, all the while ignoring the excellence and vibrancy of this fine series.\r\nIt's a story that has been done before, of course: mysterious aliens invade earth. They attack our cities and villages one by one, and conventional military weaponry is useless against them. Luckily, an elite band of young people have been found and given experimental weaponry that can be used against the xenos. This kind of story usually creates all kinds of angst and bawwwing, but Strike Witchesavoids this cliche since it's set in the last good war. In fact the series is full of vitality and optimism, and the heroines are a squadron of cute flying catgirls that you will surely grow to love.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style reflects the good nature and spirits of the series with a vivid palette of colors that will delight your eyes and mind. In fact, the production values in general are excellent, from the cheerful, quirky character designs to the gorgeously animated aerial battles between the witches and their alien foes. There are a few scenes of war-ravaged Europe to show the stakes of the battle, but the series in general is bright and clean. There are a few darker twists towards the end of the story, but it finishes with a positive note, even though many parts of the story are left to be wrapped up in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems, however, that a few people known to the world as moralfags have taken offense to the fact that females in this alternate version of earth have foregone the useless and unpleasant shackles of wearing pants. Why these people would bitch about such a thing is anyone's guess, but this bit of trivia doesn't hurt the entertainment value of Strike Witches in the least, and in fact only adds to its quirky charm.",

This is one of the best parts of the series and critics may say, the reason why the series is so popular.\r\nSound (10/10): Great sound effects and cute songs.

The art isn't all that bad, generic character designs and such, but the boots modelled off of WWII aircraft do look good. Also the designs of the Neuroi enemies based on prototype aircraft were also pretty good.\r\nThe sound wasn't terrible. The OP and ED weren'tvery memorable and the actual sound design didn't really have any faults.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is full of plot devices designed for fanservice. Only gender with magical powers are women, and they 'reach their magical peak' at 18 years old. The lack of trousers and skirts is put down to the girls needing to be ready at a moments notice to sortie, although in this version of Japan, it seems young girls generally just only wear underwear.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual plot is full of rehashed ideas and tired cliches borrowed from a variety of other anime. Unassuming young teenage protagonist is thrust into a world of magic and/or battles against mysterious and powerful enemy, and suprisingly has great untapped potential. Each episode revolves around some plot point for minor character development which is resolved in the end by usually overcoming a challenge to destroy a bad guy. The required forseeable plot twist near the end is also present.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is incredibly minimal for characters outside of the protagonist Yoshika, which leaves the show with a cast of one dimensional stereotypes with different body design to appeal to varying fetishes.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, its a terrible show, and only for those who need more loli fapping material.",

            "content": "Good:\r\nYoung girls with guns and no pants...Hell Yes!\r\nGood characters-All of them stood out among each other and they all mesh very well while still clashing with each other. \r\nAir combat-Well it's no Area 88 or anything like that but it's still pretty cool to watch if I do say so myself.  \r\nForced homosexuality-Though there is no lesbian action here, you can pretty much tell are either gay (Perrine especially) or are still exploring their sexuality (Yoshika), and that adds some nice humor. \r\nArchetype aces/characters somewhat nailed-They definitely nailed the whole Erich Hartmann/Gerhard Barkhorn thing pretty well. Anyone who's read \"The Blond Knight of Germany-TheStory of Erich Hartmann&quot; will know how well that was translated into Erica and Gertrud.  Saburo Sakai was very well translated into Mio Sakamoto, and Chuck Yeager's spirit of adventure seemed to be very well present in Charlotte.  The aristocratic side of Pierre Clostermann was also pretty well translated into Perrine as well. \\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\nWeak plot-Yes, I understand the whole saving humanity thing, but it took about eight episodes in a twelve episode series for the plot to really pick up and things to get really juicy. And then it just ended. Lame...\\n\r\nAnimal parts-Okay, I know lots of people like this, but I don't.  It just looks rather disturbing and not very cute to me at all. While watching Strike Witches I was able to mostly overlook it, it still got on my nerves at times. \\n\r\nNot enough done with certain characters-The biggest thing that got to me, Erica didn't play a bigger role. Come on, she was based off of the ACE OF ACES Erich Hartmann himself, the greatest fighter pilot of all time. Why didn't she get more spotlight time in air combat? Who knows, but I don't think it does the guy a lot of justice. \\n\r\nBetter archetypes could have been made-I don't understand why Minna wasn't based off of Adolf Galland and instead was based off of Wolf Dietrich Wilcke. Sure he was a high scoring during WW2 (175 kills), but if you know anything about WW2 air combat, no one ever talks about him. Lynette should have been Johnnie Johnston (highest scoring British ace of all time, 35 kills against the Luffwaffe) and not Billy Bishop, who was Canadian and not British.  While not that bad, it would have been cooler to see Sanya be based off of Alexandr Porshynkin rather then Lidiya Litvak simply because of the gender thing, but that wasn't as bad as basing Minna off of a relatively unknown ace and basing Lynette off of someone who was Canadian and not British.\\n\r\nArchetype/characters messed up a bit-Pierre Clostermann's aristocratic side was rather overdone, and Erich Hartmann's free spiritedness was also a bit overdone. Also Billy Bishop wasn't very translated well into Lynette, the real guy was a pretty daring pilot and yet she was pretty shaky and not very confident of herself.  I can't say much about characters like Francessca, Minna, Eila, Sanya, and others on how they lived up to their pilot archetypes. \\n\r\nStriker units-The whole idea of basing them off of other planes, well it just seemed like one more side note to make them stand out that kind of just failed. I don't understand why Erica's striker was painted black and gold when it was Gerhard Barkhorn who did that in WW2, Erich actually painted his black and red (read on how the Soviets feared what they called &quot;The Devil's Tulip&quot; when they saw him in the air).  Only really Charlotte's stood out as looking anything like the plane it was off of. \\n\\n\r\nOne final note that's a bit sad, all but one of the aces used as pilot archeytpes are dead. Erich Hartmann (cause of death-a cold due to a weakened immune system from another disease), Gerhard Barkhorn (cause of death-car accident), Lidiya Litvak (cause of death-KIA), Billy Bishop (cause of death-natural causes), Pierre Clostermann (cause of death-natural causes), Saburo Sakai (cause of death-natural causes), Tetsuz\u014d Iwamoto (cause of death-blood poisoning after surgery), Kaneyushi Mutoh (cause of death-KIA), Ilmari Juultainen (cause of death-natural causes), Franco Lucchini (cause of death-KIA), and Wolf Dietrich Wilcke (cause of death-KIA), those guys are all gone.  The only one that is still alive is Chuck Yeager, who as of today is 85 years old, healthy, and still alive and goes around the country to speak at various demonstrations and such. Apparently because of some fans of his on his myspace page, he may even know about Strike Witches as well.  I wonder what he thinks of all this? \\n\\n\r\nWell, I guess for history buffs like me, Strike Witches was an interesting watch. I guess it's worth watching again, though not without serious thought and caution. It's a fun series and one that isn't too serious, and I think that may be it's greatest charm. One thing's for sure, I can't wait to hear what Chuck Yeager has to say about all this.",

            "content": "Watching this series was painful, long, boring and tedious; I can hardly believe I endured until the end. This anime is just plainly too innocent, naive, happy, friendly, whatever you want to call it. The \"problems\" that are presented in the anime are all very dumb and not interesting, and the way the characters act is too childish. If you like fast-paced animes, with good action in it, you can stop reading this immediately and look elsewhere.\r\nThe story starts out with some mysterious \"Neuroi\" race that has appeared on Earth and has suddenly started attacking humans all around the world. That's about as much asyou get to understand about Neurois since, after the first episode, they appear spontaneously only to disturb some other, not-entertaining activity the witches were holding. They suddenly decide to keep developing the Neuroi story in the last two episodes of the series, but they just act as if they're getting somewhere, as if they're going to uncover and explain something new, just to leave the viewer expecting something that never happens.\\n\\n\r\nArt is alright, it's better than many other anime series, but it's nothing astonishing; you can find the same art and animation quality, even better, in many other series.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting happens to be good, and the intro song might be just a little bit catchy, but it's nothing to be surprised or &quot;touched&quot; by. Sound effects are alright as well. It has a fairly good sound, overall.\\n\\n\r\nI must admit that the characters are explained in a nice manner; you get to know a bit about everyone, enough as to understand them. However, the characters are all based on anime standards; in other words, every character in this series resembles some other character from another series. And, as stated before, they all act too childish; extremely childish. For some reason, too, female characters apparently hate wearing pants; they always hang around wearing panties and some shirt (although Perrine wears pantyhose, too).\\n\\n\r\nThis series lies in the borderline of &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;just acceptable&quot;.  I wouldn't invite anyone to see this anime, though; do so under your own risk (although it might be good to watch it at night, in order to fall asleep quickly).",

            "content": "I've heard much about Strike Witches before I first watched it.  Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised by its actual depth than what common hearsay has informed me of.  Allow me to elaborate.\r\nPicking up slowly, with the introduction of the setting and characters, it eases us in to a somewhat formulaic format.  We begin with our heroine, Yoshika Miyafuji and her initial anti-war sentiment and her joining the titular organisation.  It then segues in to the exploration of the respective members of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing with a Neuroi usually present to showcase the ability of that particular member.  Thereis a twist of course, but I leave that for you to discover on your own.  I have a particular gripe about the plot's pacing though.  It feels like the plot twist was constructed in a hurry and tacked on for the last few episodes.  All in all, not too shabby.\\n\\n\r\nThe 501st Joint Fighter Wing is an aerial unit circa WW2 and its task is to stop Neuroi who deploy in the air.  Beautiful aerial dogfights ensue with pretty explosions and very &quot;nice views&quot;.  Many seem to discredit Strike Witches solely for the fanservice and in a sense I understand, its enough to cause a fatal nosebleed.  But that isn't the only fault it has.  Rendered English countrysides look plastic when the 501st have some field exercises.  My god do they look plastic.  Otherwise, the 3D rendered art looks detailed, especially the Japanese Carrier Akagi, the 2D backgrounds look up to snuff and the lighting is justly positioned.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is not spectacular though it does a good job of providing us with good audio cues.  Few parts have audio that I feel does not go with a scene.  Sound effects too sound a bit off kilter and it feels like all the guns sound the same.  Those who watch quite a lot of anime may recognise some familiar voices too but this is where your mileage may vary.\\n\\n\r\nAt its heart, Strike Witches is the 501st's war story and in war stories, it explores the characters and their relations to each other.  Some of it feels too sudden though, such as Yoshika's sudden change of heart to enlist.  However, as the bulk of character development is on a per episode basis, we get enough of a feeling for each of the characters, showing interpersonal relationships, personalities, hopes and fears, particularly of the veterans of the conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThis was a fun and mostly light show.  In fact, if you look past the fanservice and the initial blood loss involved, its something that could be recommended to anyone interested in magical girls or aerial combat action.  However, it was more the little parallels to our history that had me appreciating Strike Witches, especially mirroring Erich Hartmann wearing Hitler's hat with Erica Hartmann's wearing someone else's &quot;pants&quot; (they have the gall to call them pants) as a result of their stupor. As far as enjoyment goes, taking an alien threat and putting it in a WW2 era setting while replacing actual ace pilots with loli magical girls with no pants sounds like a winner to me.",

            "content": "The Strike Witches series follows Yoshika Miyafuji, teenage girl who goes to school (in a skirtless uniform) and helps her mother and grandmother around their medical clinic. Her father, Dr. Miyafuji, the inventor of the Striker Unit (what you're here for, if not the butts) has been MIA for some time. Yoshika, appalled by war, ends up enlisting in the navy in order to find out about the fate of her father. Hilarity ensues as she enters the boob-and-butt-festival that is the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, a group of elite ace pilots, even though she has no combat experience whatsoever. Doesn't it sound idiotic? Guesswhat? It's actually not half bad.\\n\\n\r\nAs part of the Strike Witches fandom, I've endured many a slight against my favorite anime. Every single one has been accurate. Yes, this show is 75% fanservice and 25% inaccurate WWII history. Yes, it caters to fanboys who just want to see boobies and big guns. But does it have potential? You bet. Nearly every character has the major components of a good one. They have reasons for their behavior, they have motives, they're relatable. The writers and animators could have focused on this aspect, and Strike Witches would have been a whole lot better. Hell, they could have kept in all the butts and cameltoe if they wanted. A little character development would have made this show a great challenge to the general flat-as-a-board ecchi character group. However, they decided to appeal to a mishmash of historical buffs and drooling, mindless fanboys.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all this, I think that Strike Witches is worth watching. As a SW fan, I've learned more about WWII than I ever learned in high school. People claim the same thing of Hetalia, but somehow Hetalia manages to annoy me even more than Strike Witches does. That's beside the point. Strike Witches has a huge universe to build on, appealing animation, and is basically a big bundle of untapped potential. Until that potential is tapped, I'll keep searching for an anime with character, story, and sweet butts.",

            "content": "You've probably heard a little about Strike Witches already, I'm willing to gander.\r\nYou've probably already heard something about it being a fanservice anime if anything. And have already formulated your opinion about it from that.\r\nThe likelyhood of that opinion being that it's just a fanservice anime and is therefore not good. And while there are quite a few fanservice anime that would make you to think that way, being since there are a lot of poorly done fanservice anime, that is not the case here. Oh, but it is not the case at all. Strike Witches is in fact a fanservice anime. But it isan exceptionally well done fanservice anime. In fact, it is a perfectly done fanservice anime. And a recommendation to anyone who wants to see a fanservice anime done right.\\n\\n\r\nAnd since it's given me criteria, I think it's time for me to move on from my preface and work on into the various ratings and why I rate them so.\\n\\n\r\n1. Story.\\n\r\nI really wanted to rate this a ten, but...I don't know how to say this without spoiling it, it builds a decent amount of story and plot and could very well be worked on. But instead of delve into this properly, they focus almost purely on character development. Which is good, considering what it is, that's a good thing. But still, it only leaves for only development like it's an unfinished anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really hard to rate this, because you have to take into account heavy character development is necessary, and that it is a fanservice anime. And that it does at to a whole which I rate a ten. Because even at it's enjoyable pace and good character development and adding to a perfect whole, I can still only rate this an 8.\\n\\n\r\n2. Art\\n\r\nArt is one of the main things that makes this anime what it is. It is truly superb and a magnificent thing to watch. I don't think an anime, much less a fanservice anime could get much better than this in terms of art. It's animated well, and the character design is flawless. It doesn't make any big deviations from the traditional Japanese animation art style, in fact it only forwards the standard style, but it forwards the style so well and perfectly it's really taking it to what we expect it to be doing, remaining, but only developing and improving that style and raising the bar for it.\\n\\n\r\nSo in perhaps more simple words, you have the moe anthropomorphic art style fully realized and rendered. Beautifully used as ever. There's no question that the artwork is what makes this anime. It's not the only thing that's good about this anime of course, but it's something that helps it stand out and be the good anime that it is.\\n\\n\r\n3. Sound\\n\r\nThis anime has superb sound. The character voicing is fantastic, the sound effects are good. And after watching the show, and going back and listening to the soundtrack, realizing, what an amazing job they did on the soundtrack so much that it stands on it's own. It may not be epic, but it does what it asks to be, it's charming. And it fits the mood perfectly. And it's a great piece of musical creation that can easily be enjoyed for hours at a time without any other thing involved.\\n\\n\r\n4. Character\\n\r\nWell, considering I already mentioned character development is the biggest part of this story, it's needless to say it has good character development. I don't think you can say anything bad about the character development, it IS one of the main focuses of the show, and it does it well. They want you to get to know the characters, and the character and made to want to be get to known. They also spend a very decent amount of time on most all the characters. Doing a very good job not to neglect a single one. It's one of the very best parts of this show that keeps you coming back for each episode.\\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment\\n\r\nWell I think that's what gives this a ten. Even if it's a fanservice anime, it never stops being fun for one second. It doesn't overload you with ecchi or fanservice, and when it is that way, it provides in a very amusing fashion that most fanservice anime completely and utterly lack. If I could set a standard for what even an ecchi anime should be, Strike Witches would be on the list. And way up on that list. It's easy to even forget it's an ecchi or fanservice anime, because it's just so much pure fun.\\n\\n\r\nForget the words and associations that come to mind when you hear the words fanservice and ecchi. Because those things are not what makes this anime. What makes this anime is that it is just a ride of pure fun. Or might I say, a ride through the clear blue skies with a bunch of fun girls.\\n\\n\r\n6. Overall\\n\r\nWell, as an anime being pure fun, this results in the same thing for me as Lucky Star. I think something is pure fun overall and a ten in the scale of enjoyment, it's a ten in the scale of overall. Because isn't that what makes an anime? I say this anime is %100 Outstanding. You just really can't be this sort of anime in the area of overall charm. I think it should become a model for what it is, and become it's own sort of mini-genre. I can already feel the influence of Sky Girls and Strike Witches.\\n\\n\r\nWithout Sky Girls, we wouldn't have Strike Witches. And with the success of these, at least Strike Witches, I can see this helping to spread and eventually create a flood of panty clad women with guns and superpowers, it seems to be it's own genre already. And if it is, I can certainly say this is the Godfather of what's to come. It's really a masterful work, and I can really only, like many others, hope for being graced by a sequel or at least another anime along this lines.\\n\\n\r\n10/10. My life wouldn't have been complete without watching this anime.",

            "content": "The mere premise of Strike Witches is enough to make some cringe. It reeks of otaku pandering nonsense, and is sure to alienate just about anyone who does not take pleasure in voyeurism. Really, all this appears to be is another reason to show half-naked girls using big weapons, and in truth, that is exactly what it is. The funny thing is this show is not bad. In fact, once you get over the unspeakably absurd premise and all the shameless fan-service (or already like this sort of thing), this show is actually quite enjoyable.\r\nYoshika Miyafuji is a kind-spirited, perky 14-year old. She also happensto be able to heal others with magic. She leads a peaceful life, that is until she decides to join the fight against the Neuroi, the mysterious enemy threatening the Earth, with a little prodding from commander Mio Sakamoto. Yoshika becomes a member of the Strike Witches, young women with magical powers who are the strongest defense against the Neuroi. Yoshika's reputation precedes her, as her father is the designer of the \"Striker\" units the Witches use to fly. Together with her new comrades in the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, Yoshika is bound to have some big battles ahead of her, as well as some silly mishaps.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical-side, Strike Witches is a pretty little package. The character designs are not anything especially innovative, but they look lively, and are well proportioned (which is important considering the rampant fan-service). The backgrounds are also well detailed, everything from the vast sky to the interior of the witches outpost looks stellar. The animation is fluid overall, though it is clear most of the focus went to the spectacular air battles. The camera angles do a good job of getting maximum exposure of the girls, even in the midst of battle, which is a big plus for the ecchi fans out there. Gonzo's habit of inserting CGI into their works is present here, but it is used accordingly; it is mainly used for the Neuroi. The music is probably the least memorable thing here. It is not at all bad, and fits the series quite well, but somehow it just does not stand out much compared to what you are seeing.\\n\\n\r\nWell, the problems this show has are pretty obvious. For one, it caters to otaku, or more precisely ecchi fans, rather than casual viewers. Anyone who is not into animated teenage girls having their privates exposed while fighting a seemingly faceless adversary will likely avoid this after a single glance. Even if they did though, they will still find a plot that is lacking. Very little is explained about this world, which is in fact an alternative version of the WWII era, a fact I left out in my summery because it has very little barring on the plot (other than the characters' names). The Neuroi are given no understandable motive, not that it matters since they only serve as opponents for the witches and little more. Heck, the powers of the witches are barely even explored. Why do they sprout animal appendages when they activate their powers? To please the otaku masses is my guess. Why do witches lose their magic around the age of 20? Well, they needed some reason the military would rely on a bunch of teenage girls. This is all haphazard writing, and it shows. However, all these short comings are remedied by the fact that the show does not take itself too seriously. Most of the shows run is spent on ecchi shenanigans and visually spectacular battles against the Neuroi, and it works. This is what makes the show enjoyable despite its poor writing.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that the writing did get right was the characters. The witches are a collection of surprisingly refreshing personalities. They all have distinctive personality quirks that make them likable, from shy Lynette to free-spirited (and boob obsessed) Francesca. Even the snobbish Perrine is likable. The girls play off each other well, especially within the duos the show seems to pair them in. Whether they are kindred spirits, like the mischievous  Charlotte and Francesca, or an odd couple like disciplined Trude and laid-back Erica, the chemistry between them is delightful. This is not really masterful characterization, as characters have difficulty carrying more dramatic moments, but it cannot be said that any of the characters are unlikable (with the exception of the hard-ass general, who's whole purpose was to be unlikable).\\n\\n\r\nStrike Witches is a show that knows its viewership and aims straight for them. It does not even try to appeal to anyone outside of its demographic, and therein lies its biggest strength and weakness. Those who like this kind of thing will love this show; those who don't will avoid it like a plague. As for this reviewer, I'm on the fence, torn between the guilty pleasure that is the ecchi genre and the sensibility of better penned stories.",

            "content": "When I left my home and mom two years ago, I (along with Pikachu) venture into the deep realms of the anime territory. Alienated towards the otaku culture, I felt depressed looking for a war anime that can suit my tastes; Grave of the Fireflies was not enough for me. I entered into a forest one night. Night came and none appeared before me. I ate all my Kitkats by then. Hungry, I killed Pikachu and devoured its tender meat over a campfire. I continued journeying, but my vision blurred; everything around me turns misty and foggy. I hear the flapping of the wings andthe rustle of the trees. The forest was laughing at me. Losing hope, I fell down to the mud. Writhing in agony, I looked towards the dark night sky. I called up to the heavens, \u201cSave me, God. Save me from this despair.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\tGod said, \u201cOkie dokey, dude. Check out this anime. It\u2019s called Sora no Woto. You\u2019ll love it; it\u2019s pretty radical, man!\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\tToday, I am back at home well-fed. My mom cried when I told her Pikachu was killed by the characters from K-On!. Nevertheless, the miracle known as Sora no Woto made me ponder about the future of war animes.\\n\\n\r\n\tA few weeks ago, Professor Oak gave me Charmander along a copy of Strike Witches. He boasted, \u201cIt\u2019s uncensored. Consider it a rite of passage.\u201d He patted me on the shoulder, winking. I had never heard of Strike Witches until the professor told me so. Judging from the synopsis, it looked like a war anime. I went into the MyAnimeList database, reading the synopsis and the reviews; many people likened this work to Sora no Woto, the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs awarded this work for cultural excellence, and God told me to review works through Fox News before that. I decided to watch this work and review the work.\\n\\n\r\n\tStrike Witches is set in an alternate World War II setting, specifically the Battle of Britain. Considered one of the toughest battles in World War II history, the Battle of Britain setting has the potential to set up thought-provoking characters and themes. It can make us ponder about the effects of the appeasement effort led by Neville Chamberlain, war in different people\u2019s perspectives, shell shock, and more. Sora no Woto might actually lose to the work\u2019s possible themes; its themes are environmental, cultural, and anti-war by nature, criticizing warmongers for making the world it is today. Consider Strike Witches\u2019s setting for a minute. Wouldn\u2019t this be a fascinating show for everyone to watch?\\n\\n\r\n\tI remembered Professor Oak\u2019s winking. As I began to watch, I realized why he winked. Oh dear, I\u2019m seeing young girls\u2019 reproductive organs and underwear for no apparent reason except Freudian imaginations. The alternate history made little sense whatsoever. This did not bode well.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn this alternate historical setting, Japan worked with the Allies and stationed their troops at London. The Neurois, aka the Nazis, were unknown sentient creatures that kept blasting away Europe for no particular reason. Their aircrafts looked starkly similar to US stealth fighters. The Allies were stumped, losing all of Europe except England. How could anyone damage the aircrafts when they clearly had force fields protecting them?\\n\\n\r\n\tJapan\u2019s answer: girls with jetpacks and basic weaponry.\\n\\n\r\n\tStrike Witches\u2019s setting combined the Battle of Britain, mecha logic, and the mahou shoujo genre so weirdly it made little sense. Questionable aspects of how things worked were never answered throughout the course of this anime.\\n\\n\r\n\tAs I began to write this review, God cried out through Hannity\u2019s mouth, \u201cWhat about the characters? This show is all about the characters just like Sora no Woto is!\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\tWhat made Sora no Woto\u2019s characters so special was that they felt necessary in contributing the story and the themes. Strike Witches\u2019s characters could go into that direction, but most of the times want to, you know, go in an upper direction.\\n\\n\r\n\tTake Lynette, one of the few likable characters in the work. When she was introduced in the work, she was shown as a shy girl character; a good comparison would be a girly version of Ikari Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion. In the end of the episode, she began to open up towards Miyafuji by squishing her to death; suffocating and dying between Lynette\u2019s cleavage sounded like a nice way to die, but it was no example of good storytelling.\\n\\n\r\n\tGertrud Barkhorn and the two white-haired girls are the only characters to go completely into characterization. The episode with Barkhorn has some fantastic exposition added in; people can understand her mindset more clearly. The two white-haired girls have interesting stories as well.\\n\\n\r\n\tEveryone else feels stale. All we really know from Sakamoto Mio is that she laughs like Jack from The Shining and does whatever cos a pirate is free. Perrine is a stalker of Mio. Erica is a clumsy ace pilot. Miyafuji can heal. Francesca is Ed from Cowboy Bebop. There isn\u2019t many characteristics that make these characters involving or realistic; they are just there. Cardboard boxes make better characters than these people.\\n\\n\r\n\tLike Sora no Woto, it is somewhat episodic. Most of the plot involves the fascinating premise of \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d. A particular episode involved about underwear. Very few of them are memorable. When the show adds tension, it does not feel tense; it looks plain silly. The dramatic story and conclusion emerges at the end. Predictable and silly, the conclusion to the work does not pay off well; things get solved with a deus ex machina. There is also a cliffhanger, pointing people to watch Strike Witches 2.\\n\\n\r\n\tNo thanks, Gonzo. I might watch it someday, but it\u2019s not due to your cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\n\tI returned the set to Professor Oak and yawned. I do not think this work was the worst work I\u2019ve seen. It did not piss me off a lot; though, I ate a boiled skewed Charmander on a satay stick in the end because of how bored I was. There are things I disliked -- the fanservice, the wasted potential, the unfunny side characters. However, they don\u2019t cause me to hate this work. Instead, I just thought this work as really average; it did not offend me at all. I was just really bored.\\n\\n\r\n\tThere are definitely people who loved it; some may say it is thought-provoking, maybe even more against Sora no Woto. I don\u2019t see it that way nor do I think the endorsement by the government is needed. Say all you want, but I see it as a government-endorsed loli pantsu anime with girls on jetpacks beating up Nazis. It\u2019s no Sora no Woto, that\u2019s for sure. I suppose it can be entertaining to people -- it is possible that I have no soul. As a work of artistic and cultural achievement, now that\u2019s a great joke to laugh about.",

            "content": "Three years ago, I watched this anime and slapped it a rotten score. After all, an anime featuring pantless, gun-bopping teenage girls couldn\u2019t possibly ascribe anything of depth to the varied community of anime goers and entertainment seekers today, right? \r\nRight.\r\nThen during my second time through, I realized something unbelievable about this series. This anime isn\u2019t about half-naked chicks shooting down big, black cocks with guns. Right?\r\nRight\u2026ish.\r\nSo yes\u2026by my THIRD time through I realized: Strike Witches is an idiot savant of an anime. It is an attempted excuse for Japan\u2019s WWII guilt, and combined with incidental, radical feminism investigates a unique reality of victory forall humans and absolution of the original Axis Powers. Furthermore, rather than to be undone by fellow man, the retribution for all the anger of that era is instead unleashed upon an enigmatic alien race bent on aimless worldwide destruction.\\n\\n\r\nYour 501st Fighter Wing. All the guns, less of the garments. (9/10)\\n\r\nDespite my rather despicable claims, this simple, misdirected story eagerly rakes in a \u201cbare\u201d perspective on Japanese postwar culture more than anything other anime series I\u2019ve ever watched. Yoshika Miyafuji, our protagonist from the Fuso Nation, has after a series of misadventures found herself smack dab in the middle of an international war between humans and a hostile alien invader known as the Neuroi. Though the Neuroi\u2019s intentions and methods are unknown, Miyafuji and the 501st Joint Fighters\u2014the Strike Witches, or gun-wielding teenage girls utilizing magic-powered, leg-mounted rocket engines known as \u201cStrikers\u201d to fly\u2014dedicate their lives (and panties) to the survival of mankind.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most misunderstood things about this anime is its high degree of fanservice. Nearly every ten seconds the viewer is exposed to some sort of sexual innuendo, be it the slightest visual of pantsu or a blatant bath scene with boobs flopping about like custard. The delivery is unabashed in consistency, if not almost bewildering considering the depth of the alternate historical content. Indeed, this deceitful mask of perversion disguises a highly controversial possibility for this alternate universe as follows:\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a relative time frame to what we live, there is no evidence for existing non-Japanese Asians, Jews, or Blacks in the entire series INCLUDING doujin and movie-based media. In the series, the closest to being black might be the Italian girl, Francesca, but considering the brutal circumstances of World War II it freaks me out that neither a Jew or a Chinese exists among the ranks of survivors.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason only a small group of magical women between the ages of 12-20 seem to be effective as combatants. Men, older women, and machines seem to be rather defenseless, rendering none but Highly Effeminate Teenage Vixens (HETV) as our only hope.\\n\\n\r\nWhat are the Neuroi? The mysterious qualities of the enemy are vividly explored, but some answers aren\u2019t given. I find it fascinating that the Neuroi have chosen a spot of the world between Karlsland (Germany) and eastern Russia (Orussia) as their hive. If we consider the alignment of world powers during the war era, isn\u2019t it interesting that the brutal enemy of humanity is stationed somewhere in Central Asia? Also, isn\u2019t it just as interesting that the \u201cgood guys\u201d in this series happen to hail from Japan (Fuso), Karlsland, and Orussia? Does anyone see what I\u2019m getting at here?\\n\\n\r\nMy conclusion is that Strike Witches presents as an innocent peep show, when it ruthlessly stakes on radicalism and nationalism as the true berth of survival. The weakest races have been eliminated, and a unique gift of power to women establishes a rather unanticipated form of feminism\u2014perhaps with the intent to balance out the missing historical factors of this show.\\n\\n\r\nThis is particularly true with feminism. Throughout the series we CLEARLY see the reduced sexuality of women\u2019s legs, as nearly all women in the show do not wear pants. For the otaku this is obnoxiously fanservice; to the alternate reality, this is a normal getup. In this setting, men would have to start from this specific style of dress to find sexual arousal, and thus would be presented less opportunities to think perverse thoughts. Women, too, lose power through arousal of men, and are then more focused on careers and independence. I\u2019m sure many a fan has tried to excuse this by saying that \u201cin order to fit into the Strikers they can\u2019t wear pants\u2014blah blah\u2014requiem stop talking\u2014I\u2019ll bite you\u201d sort of argument is the most cogent.\\n\\n\r\nThe sad truth is that they\u2019re only halfway there. Feminism wins simply by the lifestyle of this series, and\u2014considering that all other types of Asians are missing\u2014it is winning much more than races or gender stereotypes by default.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have evidence for radicalism through the consistent failures of men throughout both seasons. Airplanes, battleships, and maritime weapons are all rendered useless, bereaved of all duty but to serve as cannon fodder for the elite Witch squadrons. Commanders shrug helplessly while their ships are mercilessly crushed and sunk, and whatever authority they might even have over Witches is easily bypassed.\\n\\n\r\nNext, if the Bechdel test were to be applied to this series, hardly a moment in it would fail. The entire series voids men of any appeal or authority, focusing the entire story on the Witches and their sisterhood. This is fascinating, especially considering that a tit or ass flies across the screen with all but sexual abandon. Even Yoshika\u2019s awkward tit fetish remains effeminate, keeping the perversion limited only to women without delving into yuri or shoujo ai. Also, in great relief there are absolutely no random peeping scenes involving half-naked men getting punched by tiny women into the stratosphere while shouting \u201cI AM LIKE\u2026SO SORRY.\u201d Or at least not as in the exhausting case of practically EVERY ecchi harem series known to otakukind.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, though the creator himself may not have even dreamed of this, his lewd creation defines \u201cunique\u201d in its background, plot, and style. It may have been designed to make men horny and stupid, but it could still be insightful enough for any informed viewer. For reasons such as this, I can offer a ridiculously high score.\\n\\n\r\nTwo-dimensional, but well-grown. (6/10)\\n\r\nWhile stock characters are expected for a series focused on as many pantsu shots as possible, making sure the characters actually fit together is not as such required. Strike Witches makes several attempts to go beyond that, particularly with complicated ladies like Minna, Eila, or Gertrud. I should not be spoiling this series at all in saying that our main protagonist lives up to our expectations, as her limitations and delimiters all come and go as expected. There are a few good moments for everyone, even support characters such as Shirley, Perrine, and Francesca.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, all of the girls make up for their limited personalities with well-placed anecdotes of growth. Mio, in particular, encounters a struggle that puts the entire squadron through many hardships, yet we see with her continued passion to save humanity a constant state of perseverance. When not enthused by boobs and butts, we actually start to see a little bit of depth to everyone as they fight their own personal battles, (at least moreso than the drooling we do while they fight the actual enemy.)\\n\\n\r\nMy personal favorite? Definitely Perrine. Not because she\u2019s a prissy, tsuntsun nerd that offers the best personality-to-sexual-exploitation ratio; mainly just because she is easy to figure out. In fact, each witch has some sort of spice to her that feeds the lonely wolves like me. While it is designed as an advertisement net to catch and draw my attention, it is at least nice to get a little more differential between the women than a typical 21st century harem series with the same visual appeal.\\n\\n\r\nIncidental music WIN. OP/ED fail. (8/10)\\n\r\nNeither the opening nor closing theme of either season was particularly fascinating. Though well composed and nicely sung, the openings are unfortunately the same, drab Ishida Yoko dancepop ditties that dominate such a small market with upbeat feel and trendy melody. Even though they are in the same court as Ishida, the I\u2019ve Sound girls always manage to harness a stronger or more atmospheric melody. To its own justice the series should have had its own personal opening theme. Or perhaps rather than dance music, why not something on the side of a tune from the WWII era? Either way, another pop song about \u201cDoing what I can do\u201d and \u201cloving some certain, undistinguished person\u201d is justifiable for me to skip ahead one and a half minutes as soon as possible every time.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, the real groundwork is done by a time tested artist like Seikou Nagaoka. His track \u201cWitch no Tatakai,\u201d or \u201cA Witch\u2019s Fight\u201d is a driving force for perhaps the entire series\u2019 climactic moments. Written with a very powerful bass line, we can feel the surge of excitement build up as the melody creeps in at some point seconds later. The sort of \u201cchampion melody\u201d rises out of the trumpets (or in some cases, an electric guitar) through the oscillating strings, and builds up more and more intensity when recapitulating for a second time through. This track is perfectly aligned for underdog victories, high speeds, and pretty much most highly emotional scenes on the battlefield. For something that he probably threw together in 20 minutes, the perfectly chained elements make it quite unforgettable\u2014I still could recall it several years after my first viewing of the show!\\n\\n\r\nNagaoka also empowers more endearing moments with his gentle strings in \u201cEikou no Kiroku.\u201d He draws out mystery with \u201cKunou\u201d and its Dorian harp. He demonstrates his mastery of orchestration with the grinding bass harmonies in \u201cNeuroi no Su he.\u201d Without a doubt, the musical programming for a show like this fit all too perfectly to serve as distraction from the fanservice, or at least more than the jumpy tunes that surround each episode.\\n\\n\r\nAn animation behest to bre-hests. Ha. Ha. Ha. (7/10)\\n\r\nAs a healthy male I would be criminalizing this series for giving the animation a score lower than 70 points. It is literally as though the animation studio took an extensive class on drawing vaginal protrusions and ample bosoms while studying butlery.\\n\r\nSeriously. Every few seconds, however subtle or obvious, a boob or butt is \u201cserved warm\u201d to our eyes as a feast, delivering the most intoxicating form of perversion so much so that we are left passively molested by our screens. While many other series might put this one to shame in this regard, very few can deliver with the same degree of tastefulness.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest detractor for score here is solely the key animation. Often during fight scenes the characters shapely figures would become too fluid and perhaps not-so-shapely. In fact, within the first five minutes of the series we see a rather terribly drawn view of Gertrud\u2019s patooty, as it is quite clear that somebody was too busy completing key frames to actually bother providing detail to her shape. This same mistake happens several times, showing that despite the \u201cample\u201d details, the budget wasn\u2019t exactly such. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, the action scenes were made with good intention. The weapons are drawn badass\u2014even to the extent that they can be as exciting as the\u2026yep, you guessed it\u2026perhaps the best action scene in the entire show might be the part in season one concerning Shirley and Mach 1; though not very detailed, the desired effect came through quite well. (As for the best episode, it is without debate the infamous sukebe-mushi of Season 2, episode 7.)\\n\\n\r\nUncomfortable for many at first, but the wounds will heal. (8/10)\\n\r\nAnd that is perhaps the best thing about Strike Witches, considering the great deal of socially unacceptable content unleashed over 8 hours visually. If you are a Forever Alone, this series will provide great comfort. If you want to see something controversial and can choke down the hypnotizing amount of female parts, give it a shot. OR even if you are looking for unique Feminist propaganda, this would be great material for a write up.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a married man who wants to pick up a good series to watch with the family\u2026while I would personally think how awesome you are for even trying to suggest this series, you might just want to save it for when the family goes to sleep (or if you watch in sprees, when they go to see the old folks for the weekend.)",

This series was just unbearable.\r\nIt takes place on an alternate earth in World War II-era and focuses on a government-assembled air force squad formally named \"Strike Witches.\" It may seem interesting on the surface, but what we expected was far from what we got.\r\nI am completely aware that this anime was heavy on the fan-service. But when the fan-service eclipses any traces of intended plot, the series will drag on for what feels like eternity. Every time I thought that things were about to get interesting, the creators instead slapped me with more insignificant loli ecchi. You cando fan-service right, but the creators in question exceeded the acceptable limit ten-fold. Strike Witches beat the dead horse and inconveniently used characters that could only realistically consent in third-world countries. Eventually you come to a point where you sense the disappointment radiating from your deceased ancestors and you will find yourself contemplating whether or not this life on earth is all that there is. \\n\\n\r\nThere is definitely a target-audience for this type of series, but I just want to point out that if every girl was replaced with a middle-aged man, there would be a unanimous distaste for the progression of the plot. If you've been challenged to try out a fan-service anime like I was, stay far away from this one. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I really wouldn't recommend this anime to my worst enemy. I gave it a 2 because despite everything terrible about it, there was a lot of production and effort that went into this. But still, save yourself the 5 hours.",

            "content": "Strike Witches was originally created by illustrator, Shimada Fumikane as a mixed-media project. It has since been adapted into light novels, manga, anime and video games. The first anime series was brought to us by Gonzo. You may remember them from their work on Gantz, Brave Story, Bakuretsu Tenshi, Basilisk & Zettai Boei Leviathan, just to name some of them I've reviewed. So, how does this one compare to the others? Let's delve into it and see.\r\nStory:\r\nStrike Witches is set in an alternate world where an enigmatic enemy called the Neuroi has appeared and started attacking people. Humanity's best line of defense is a groupof young girls, most of whom range in age from twelve to sixteen, with magical powers. These are the titular witches. With the background stuff out of the way, our story proper opens with fourteen year old Miyafuji getting approached by one of the few characters who isn't disturbingly young, Major Sakamoto Mio. Sakamoto wants to recruit her for the Witches but Miyafuji refuses, not wanting to use her powers for violence. Things change, because the setup is so obvious that of course they do, when Miyafuji receives a letter from her deceased father, the man who designed the \u201cbrooms\u201d that the witches use to fly through the sky. She reluctantly agrees to go with Sakamoto.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with what's wrong with the series. The biggest thing is that it wastes a lot of time on really disturbing fan-service scenes. Keep in mind, most of the major characters are twelve to sixteen years old. There are only three of eleven who are adults. And I thought Devil Hunter Yohko was bad about sexualising a young girl, which it is but at least she's not twelve nor did they have an episode about undergarment pilfering. What were they thinking? The series also doesn't fully develop its aspects that have potential. There are some interesting ideas that get brought up but never fully taken advantage of. The stuff with the girls trying to unravel the truth about the Neuroi is really interesting, but they only give you a small chunk of it. I guess showing a twelve year old in the bath was more important. Way to keep things the complete opposite of classy and to have your priorities completely ass backwards at the same time. I'm sure the multi-tasking was very hard. Maybe they're saving it for the sequel, which wouldn't be a problem if they at least gave you something compelling in the meantime as opposed to really sick fan-service involving girls who are way too young for that shit.\\n\\n\r\nTo the series' credit, it does have some legitimately good stuff too. When the focus is on the characters, rather than the characters' underage bodies, it has some really good moments. The story proper, in spite of being filler heavy, is legitimately interesting and the last couple episodes are actually really strong. I like that they start things out looking like it's just going to be a monster of the week type thing but quickly start introducing plot elements that move it beyond that, even if they don't take full advantage of their potential. The story elements for the major story had a lot of really good ideas that could have made for a really compelling work if not for all the sleaziness.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis is an area where I'll give Strike Witches credit. In spite of having almost as many major characters as they have episodes, they manage to flesh them out pretty well and there are some really good character moments and interactions. Unfortunately, the villains aren't particularly compelling. You know that there's more to them then is readily apparent and there are some interesting bits to go with it, but it's not fully realised. If only they'd had something pointless and disgusting to cut out, like fan-service scenes of barely pubescent girls. Then they might have been able to go somewhere with it. Oh wait... they did. They chose to keep the fan-service scenes instead.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of issues with the art. For one thing, most of our heroines don't wear pants or anything that covers their legs. Instead, we get shirts and panties. They fly around in the air at high velocities, how do their nethers not get really cold and uncomfortable? Now, you might say \u201cBut Ktulu, they use magic. Isn't it possible that their magic regulates their body temperature?\u201d Which might be a fair point, except that several of them actually talk about being cold during the panty pilfering episode. Because a single pair of panties was so much protection, apparently. You might shift to \u201cwell, maybe the lack of fabric helps their flying units work.\u201d Except that they show three of the girls actually covering their legs and it works out just fine for them. You might also wonder if, maybe, their machines heat up a lot and it's more comfortable. The problem is that they wear the same outfits when they're on the ground and in the air. No, these outfits are because some sick bastard wanted to see barely pubescent girls in their panties.\\n\\n\r\nThe outfits would be bad enough by themselves, but the series really pushes the sleaziness bar by showing these girls, most of whom are twelve to sixteen (I can't emphasise that fact enough), completely starkers. There's a continuing tradition in this series of unnecessary group bath scenes involving full breasts, nipples included. Did you want to see a twelve year old's breasts? You're probably replying in the negative since you're sane, but this series will show you anyway. Now, I will be fair to the series. It does have really good action sequences and the designs of the Neuroi are pretty cool. They also did a pretty decent job with the background scenery.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nHere's another area where I'll give the series quite a bit of credit. The cast does do well in their roles. Tanaka Rie and Ohashi Ayuru in particular but there aren't any bad performances by any means. The music is also nicely done. I'll give Nagaoka Seikou credit on that one.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's quite a bit of les-yay in Strike Witches. Miyafuji has a thing for Lynne. At one point she even has what is heavily implied to be a sex dream about her, and there are certainly indications that the feeling is mutual. Perrine explicitely has a crush on Major Sakamoto. Barkhorn and Hartmann seem to have a romance going. Eila and Sanya definitely have a romance going, and I will say that the stuff between the two of them is absolutely adorable and, surprisingly for this series, unsexualised. Lucchini gropes the other girls on multiple occasions, Shirley taking the brunt of it. There are also some moments where Minna and Sakamoto seem to have a thing. So, the ho-yay factor is an 8/10. Expect a lot of les-yay.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nStrike Witches could have been a good series. Possibly even really good. It has some strong story elements and characters. It does really well with action sequences and the vocal cast is solid. Unfortunately, it's held back by an absurd level of sleaziness. It wastes time that could have been spent on plot or strengthening the characters with barely pubescent girl fan-service and it makes it a really uncomfortable series to watch at times. Does that aspect make it a bad series? No, but it certainly has a severe detrimental effect on it. If you can tolerate the exploitative shit, and that's a big if, you might enjoy it. If you're an ill-supervised horny young teenager who likes girls, then this might just be for you. Seek it out, Young Lady. For me, the positive aspects and negative ones do balance pretty evenly so my rating is a 5/10. Maybe I'll look at Strike Witches 2 at some point, either because I get curious or because someone requests it, but for next week I'll look at Choujigen Game Neptune: The Animation. Please tell me it doesn't have under-aged nudity.",

            "content": "I had very high hopes when I finally made a move and started watching Strike Witches.\r\nAnd those hopes were brutally murdered.\r\nStory 2/10\r\nThe plot of this anime is ridiculously full of holes.\r\nFor example in episode one Miyafuji and Lynne fall in the ocean with their striker units on and swom without any trouble, while in episode two they actually undertake training for situations with falling into the ocean with their units on AND THEY SUCK AT IT suddenly.\r\nThere are many mysterious events going on about without much explaining at all. Like the thing that every single young girl has only underwear on her lower body parts!That's just stupid and I would've let it slide IF someone would mind at least explaining it a little bit.\\n\r\nThe story is focused on showing panties and that's the main star- girls' underwear. I know, in some quantity it's fine, but there you get ONLY THIS.\\n\r\nOh, right, and guns. some shooting for action.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is actually pretty good. I like the style, the girls are made cute, teh animation doesn't screw up. The colors are enjoyable for the eye. Just some minor details don't seem right, that's it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI actually don't remember the sound from the anime itself. That means it didn't catch my attention at all as good. The intro is simple yet catchy. Same goes for the ending. It might be too simple for all the fans out there, though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are all pretty cute girls, with some past, reasons to fight and so on. Apart from the panties-all-their-lives outfits they aren't so bad. Their reasoning seems off at many times though, the story itself is taking it's stupid toll on them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch this show without drinking alcohol or just being drunk. You won't enjoy it a bit if there's plot you're looking for. It seems as if the show was aimed at not very bright male teenagers hungry for women. It's not enjoyable to watch panty shots over and over and over all the time. It can bore the watcher quite quickly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\\n\r\nMy note is up at 4 because I like the art. The charcters are cute too and that's where the good parts end. I was very dissapointed in the show as the plot is just dumb. Perhaps the second season will bright things up for me, but as I heard from my friends, it doesn't get better...\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this show for people who want to search for plot failures, like the one I used as an example. And just for that....",

            "content": "(This review will be spoiler-free)\r\nStrike Witches, the first part of a multi-season franchise that takes teenage schoolgirls, strips them of pants, and straps-on some k\u0336n\u0336e\u0336e\u0336h\u0336i\u0336g\u0336h\u0336s magical leg propellers. It's a fun show that has a pretty diverse cast, some interesting fanservice choices, but albeit is a forgettable experience.\r\nThe story of Strike Witches is a definite example of \"playing it safe\".  We get a few intro episodes that do a decent job introducing the world, premise, and squad-mates of our MC, several episodes in the middle to further develop relationships and highlight some tension, and finally a \"big bad\" is introduced near the end (aswell as a poor attempt at some political backstabbing) to cement our casts values in one last big battle.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's not a bad story by any means, and can actually be quite fun at times, but it is certainly not the most memorable story I have watched.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI did have a gripe with how the show tried to convey it's atmosphere at times. It is established early on that the Strike Witches are a magical special ops team solely designed to combat the worldwide threat, but there seemed to be very little structure at all when reinforcing that military mindset.  The girls adhere to an extremely loose military protocol, and almost no penalties are administered for mistakes/in-fighting/or insubordination. Our MC does get in quite a bit of trouble near the end, but even then it feels like an underwhelming punishment. And that punishment (and its consequences) are immediately swept away by the appearance of the \"big bad\" in those final few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe show did a solid job of reminding you that the world was at war against a common enemy, but would then alleviate that tension with some awkwardly placed nudity (Group bath scenes appear frequently during \"heavier\" episodes).  This doesn't necessarily detract from the overall experience, since none of the girls (even background characters in episode 1) wear pants, but it can be a bit jarring for your average watcher.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is actually a point that really bounced around for me throughout the show.  Some episodes/scenes were incredibly well animated, with characters running, jumping, or flying at a much smoother frame rate than a show of that era would believe you to have.  Unfortunately these scenes stand to highlight how average the rest of the animation is, with an excellent shot of a character running to greet her friends followed by a rather cheap-looking shot of everyone standing around in the background while only one character moves at a time.  Keep in mind none of these excellent scenes are even used as high-points in episodes, they are usually done during in-between shots (I am not sure if that is the right phrase to use, I'm talking about scenes in-between important ones, sort of build-up shots).\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in Strike Witches suffers from the typical problem that a show like this (One with 8+ characters to flesh out) in that a lot of the supporting cast seem way more interesting than our lead.  Because our MC is a fresh faced recruit, she spends a lot of her time being barked at, or trained, while the rest of the cast is able to show off their individual personalities, relationships, and specialties.  Of course our MC is given preference over other girls when it comes to missions or important events, and while this is standard fare for a show of this type, it is still a bit tiring to see an excellent cast of characters pushed to the way side.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a fun, easy-going, ecchi (Nudity does appear in the DVD release), action-oriented ship-girl anime than Strike Witches could definitely scratch the itch you are looking for but it will be a temporary fix at best.  Be prepared to struggle to complete the show, and want to find something a bit more memorable to watch almost as soon as it is over to scratch the itch anew.",

            "content": "&ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; is a magical girl series rife with action, comedy and fanservice with a zest of yuri. Originally based on a light novel series, it first spawned an OVA in 2007 and a 13 episode anime series in 2008.\r\nThe story of &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; takes place during the 1940's on an alternate version of our earth, where magic and technology coexist and most countries have different names. Thrust into a conflict that spreads across the globe by an unknown race or entity called Neuroi, the human race is put on the defensive after the Neuroi quickly wipe out several nations. Humanity's best hope to defeatthe airborne Neuroi lies with the 'strike witches' of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, young girls with high magical powers that are able to fly when donning their striker units, propulsion devices that envelop each leg.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly one of the series' prime and most visually obvious aspects are its copious amounts of fanservice. One could judge &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; solely by its abundant fanservice, but this would be a short-sighted judgement. \\n\r\nThe level of fanservice is obvious from episode one on, as in the alternate world that &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; takes place in, women do not wear pants or skirts, they simply walk around with their panties or swimsuit bottoms showing in plain view.  Each episode is packed with blatant pantsu shots and is rife with other fanservice scenes such as glances at character's bosoms, scantily clad bed attire or bikini's while during the obligatory beach scenes. On top of that each of the witches displays animal ears and tail when activating her magical powers, most likely this was intentionally added to appeal to the fans of animal eared girls. \\n\r\nTo fully enjoy the series viewers must be willing to accept these high amounts of fanservice, so &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; might not be for all audiences. \\n\\n\r\nAt first I was reluctant, assuming the series would be mere mindless fanservice of a questionable level such as in &ldquo;Kanokon&rdquo; or &ldquo;To Love RU&rdquo;. Watching the first few episodes I was quickly proven wrong and discovered this terrific series holds much more. Though present in large amounts, the fanservice stays digestible and never becomes offensively rude or of poor taste. &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; shows how fanservice laden series should be, cute and even daring or sensual, but never without reserve and all in sufficient good taste.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the series offers other well executed elements, such as its homage and accurate references to World War II era air combat, it has flawless animation, and classic but well executed plots such as personal growth, overcoming challenges. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design for the anime series as well as artwork for the &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; light novels was done by Humikane Shimada, who was also responsible for the character designs of &ldquo;Sky Girls&rdquo;, hence associations between both series can easily be made. Next to character design similarities, both series show young girls on the front lines of an apocalyptic war where the human race must defend itself against annihilation from an inhuman entity.\\n\r\nThere are also quite a bit of differences, from more obvious ones such as the series' length, &ldquo;Sky Girls&rdquo; being animated by JC Staff while &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; is animated by Gonzo, &ldquo;Sky Girls&rdquo; with its post-modern setting has the girls use futuristic mecha while &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; used the concept of magic to have the girls fly around with propulsion units inspired on World War II era aircraft.\\n\\n\r\nWith this World War II air combat element one of the other main themes in &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; becomes apparent, all of the witches' striker units are reminiscent of existing propeller fighter planes such as the Mustang P51, Mitsubishi Zero, Messerschmitt Bf-109,... \\n\r\nThe witches themselves are based or named after famous World War II ace pilots such as Pierre Clostermann, Erich Hartmann, Chuck Yeager,... \\n\r\n&ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; is full of references and homages to combat aviation from that era, including these direct references to air planes and pilots but also showing accurate recreations of fighter plane combat manoeuvres and tactics.\\n\r\nFurthermore the series accurate and detailed depiction of historic weapons and military equipment is remarkable and helps immerse the viewer into a World War II era atmosphere. Plenty of attention to historical details was made to accurately recreate era weaponry and equipment, such as the Maschinengewehr 42 or M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile most characters may seem generic, they never come off as uninteresting. &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; features quite a large cast, there are no less than 11 witches in the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, nearly four times as much as the girls of &ldquo;Sky Girls&rdquo;, yet &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; has only half the episode count. With those time constraints it is to be expected that not all characters get the same amount of airtime or background depth, yet &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; manages to give every character its moment in the spotlights which introduces her better to the viewer or reveals more about her past background.\\n\r\nNo characters jump off-screen as being novel or unexpectedly deep, most are based on well known character formula, but because we are either shown their background story or they get enough scenes to make them familiar so that we as viewers will end up knowing all of the witches well enough to care for each of them. \\n\r\nThe writers did a terrific job, certainly so seeing the number of characters and time constraints.  While we're never told much about the pasts of Lynette, Perrine, Erica or Lucchini, their actions and interaction with the others firmly establishes their characters. We're shown scenes or sub plots about the pasts of Minna, Gertrud and Shirley, which immediately makes us feel more involved. So even though there's so many girls next to Yoshika, the leading character, throughout the episodes the viewer will become attached to each and everyone of them.\\n\\n\r\nWith an all female cast, several yuri or shoujo-ai pairings and scenes are a given. While some of the girls have strong bonds of friendship, like Lucchini and Shirley or Mio and Minna, others are hinted or plainly shown to be more than friends, which either leads to humorous scenes such as Perrine's jealous fits, Yoshika's infatuation with Lynette's bosom or to more endearing, romantic scenes like those between Sanya and Eila.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation by Gonzo is absolutely stellar in the series. Quality almost never drops and retains a high level throughout all of the episodes, with gorgeous scenes and renderings of all the cute witches with a lot of attention to detail. The many air combat action scenes are fluid, fast and well done. \\n\r\nThe 3D CGI generated Neuroi are portrayed as alien flying entities built up from black honeycomb structures which makes them not only simple but also makes them seem more realistic and acceptable compared to the Worms from &ldquo;Sky Girls&rdquo; which appeared as large animal-like things.\\n\r\nMany series should have consistent animation levels like &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo;, especially the characters are so well animated, a true feat Gonzo accomplished here when compared to their other creations.\\n\\n\r\nThe first Japanese DVD releases of &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; have shown Gonzo took it a bit further for the DVD versions, removing any censoring present in the episodes of the television broadcast, where steam, rays of light, shadows or other obstacles obscured full view of the character's bare breasts and the likes. Hence the DVD versions seems more niche oriented than the television broadcast version and as such may not appeal to the viewers who are not keen on the fanservice element of the series. Such casual viewers may be best served by watching the regular television broadcast episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic is more generic in &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo;, while the soundtrack is solid, it does not particularly excel on its own but contents itself by accompanying and supporting what is seen on screen, a job it does well. The opening track 'Watashi Ni Dekiru Koto' (the things I can do) is an upbeat song full of hope, which accentuates the theme of Yoshika's struggle to be able to achieve her goals as a witch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI do recommend &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; to everyone looking for a nice series with a good mix of action and humour, regardless of the more niche elements it has like its fanservice it will no doubt be a fun series to watch for all.",

            "content": "Strike Witches is one of those animes that are so bad that it makes you wonder if Japan holds a yearly competition to find the worst piece of work in existence. Strike Witches is 2008's would-be winner, hands-down.\r\nNow let's get down to business--major points only:\r\nTHE GOOD:\r\nMany will point you to the excessive ecchi scenes and tell you this anime is trash. This is not true.\r\nThe fact is, the single redeeming factor in this anime is the panty shots. They are drawn and animated with extreme detail and grace so that the viewer immediately knows that the creators put a considerable amount of work into them.Too bad nothing else in Strike Witches is worth noting--not even the battle sequences, for which there is maybe one or two nice, though unfortunately short, ones.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD:\\n\r\nThe story is about as predictable and idiotic as they come. It's the type of story we must bear with--to try with all of our might not to surf reddit on the side, lest we gouge our eyes out with a rusty spoon. The ludicrous gear invented by possibly the most moronic of engineers that somehow drives the existence of the Strike Witches may be enough to turn some away. Giant robots would have been better. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot? Easy: we are witches (magical girls), and we are fighting aliens and there may or may not be a twist at the very end. Please don't fall asleep.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE UGLY:\\n\r\nThe most dreadful part of this anime is the characters.\\n\\n\r\nMiyafuji, Yoshika is about as annoying as they come. She is the \"I want to protect everyone pacifist with uncommonly strong feelings\" type that seems unfortunately common in most Animes.\\n\\n\r\nStrike Witches takes it one step further and makes her out to be some kind of angel (yes, she's that flawless). Everyone else is just there to slow her down. Strike Witches pretty much becomes a show about a Japanese Loli angel going about unleashing her latent awesomeness at key moments and fixing everyone's problems with her feelings. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of Strike Witches, it is clear that Miyafuji could probably win the war by herself and achieve world peace if it wasn't for her strong feelings and her annoying comrades/higher-ups. Her personality is pure, unadulterated molasses, flawless to the core. It's acceptable to some, but many may want something more than unchanging perfection so that we might witness something grow, or watch more than a single angle for the duration of 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nToo bad the creators didn't stop at Miyafuji. They decide to inflict upon the viewers another near-angel type character: Sakamoto, Mio.\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto, Mio is seemingly the only other character that doesn't do too much to get in the way of Miyafuji's greatness. She is equipped with the most annoying laugh in the show and a personality that can only be described as strong-willed but with hidden super feelings on reserve. Sakamoto is the one who has discovered Miyafuji and wants train her and watch her \"grow\" to surpass her. She is in the end, without fault. Her personality is infused with enough sugar to make the sweet-tooth puke. While she isn't even half as annoying as Miyafuji, she still ranks as the second worst character in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAll other characters are there for comic relief, ecchi scene composition, and getting in the way of Japanese Loli Angel Miyafuji so as to drive the \"plot\". They follow typical character models, which for some viewers may become a tad tedious, but their dialogue is thankfully terse and useless anyway. They can be grouped into the the \"white loli girls\" or \"evil white higher-ups\" categories. They are ostensibly essential.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, one must have a stomach for this type of holier-than-thou type story in order to truly enjoy Strike Witches. The ecchi, while serving its purpose in pulling the Anime back into the realm of the watchable, may not be enough for some. Watch at your own risk.",

Instead of WW2, we have the war against alieny Neuroi. And who we should send to fight them? Mahou Shoujo of course. Equipped with machine guns and \u201cbrooms\u201d, magical lolis sacrifice their lives to save humanity.\r\n12 episodes = 5 episodes of fanservice, 4 episodes of feels and 3 episodes of plot. Well\u2026 as close to feels as you can get in this kind of anime. Plot isn\u2019t elaborate, but it fits the setting\u2026 which is loli magical girls with machine guns again, so\u2026 yeah.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s anime alright. It\u2019s japanese alright. What you will see here is different from western cartoons. They deal with nudity\u2026 differently. But we\u2019re adults here, right? (R+ means something kiddo) Maybe you want to watch it for fan service, enjoy it then. But if you\u2019re used to these kind of things and treat a naked body like something regular, Strike Witches is great. I really enjoyed it. Especially the comedy parts (If you can see the jokes through the bewbs). It\u2019s also about friendship, striving to be better and sometimes being sad over what\u2019s lost in the war. There\u2019s even little mystery, but that part wasn\u2019t really completed, maybe in season 2.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been 5 minutes without panty shots. Am I still watching Strike Witches?\u201d That\u2019s what you can think about halfway through. I didn\u2019t like panties thrown at my face every few seconds, but that was only in the beginning. I believe 6th episode opens the part, where fanservice is more moderate. That\u2019s where I really enjoyed it. And I hope you enjoy Strike Witches too.\\n",

            "content": "I think Shimada Humikane and company primarily wanted to do one scene: A young Japanese Navy pilot decides to take off from a burning carrier on a suicide mission, and though his commanders try to stop him and there are enemy aircraft littering the skies, somehow he manages to save the ragtag fleet and drive away the attacking enemy.\r\nThe only problem is, Shimada evidently has a thing for young girls without skirts (if memory serves, he also did the original character designs for Sky Girls, an anime about young girls without skirts flying to defeat enigmatic foes).\r\nMy primary gripe about Strike Witches is that itfeatures Japan prominently, but writes everything but the European theater out of a story about World War II. Yup, in order to avoid pissing off the Chinese and Koreans, we're just pretending they (along with Latin America, the Middle East, all of Asia aside from Russia, various Pacific islands, and Africa) simply don't exist, even though significant parts of the world were affected by the Second World War. And it's not like there's no opportunity to fight the Neuroi in the Pacific allied with the US Navy, so I believe this to be a deliberate omission. It's not nearly as bad as GATE, but reading the premise of the show regarding the Americans really made me think the writers from a country that attacked a sleeping giant and paid the price for it have a serious case of sour grapes. What's even more ridiculous about this is, the show is telling another story of that war from the Allied perspective (and in one instance makes an RAF Air Marshal into a moustache-twirling villain). In terms of setting and premise, High School Fleet was a bit more coherent and respectful.\\n\\n\r\nSo what we have here is a drama with a \"historical\" context that's laughably ridiculous, and all of the young girls do not wear skirts and call panties \"trousers\". Yes, drama-- this isn't a farcical comedy like Girls und Panzer.\\n\\n\r\nSo why does this show work? Well, remember that scene I mentioned at the beginning of this review? That's why-- the pre-flight drama was so effective, it became parodized in other series. Watching Yoshika fly when everything is stacked against her is probably the biggest reason why people watch this franchise (and it's the main reason why Brave Witches didn't fare quite as well).\\n\\n\r\nThe character of Yoshika is equal parts a girl of her time, a determined surgeon, and later, a fighter ace. While the main conflict of the show is between the squadron and a mysterious race of entities called the Neuroi, the early episodes of the show pit Yoshika against squad mates who are hostile towards her or indifferent, mainly members who have a painful past. What's really good about the series is that the characters who are the main players in the drama have stories that are in limbo, and Yoshika is just the catalyst they needed to start moving on. The remaining girls are largely comic relief, which is good because we need a balance of conflict and friendship to establish the chemistry not just with Yoshika, but also among the rest of the 501st. The voice cast is where a good deal of resources were spent, as there are veteran actresses like Kaori Nazuka, Sakura Nogawa and Rie Tanaka.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs help ensure that each member of the squadron is distinct, and the European members are just a bit stereotypical without resorting to ludicrous designs that involve ringlets. I don't know if this production is the first to employ 3D models for the \"aircraft\", but the use of light-emissive materials for the propellers and magic circles is a good touch, reinforcing the fact that the setting isn't normal reality/history.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the soundtrack was what made this show a fun one for me-- like the story premise, this show is the opposite of High School Fleet, well-arranged and balanced despite the full-synth instrumentation. One of the Strike Witches BGM themes begins with a string orchestra spicatto beat that gradually builds up to the full orchestra led by the horns and trumpets, and another (also the \"episode preview\" theme) is a catchy brass fanfare that the violins later join. A quieter but no less important theme starts with pizzicato strings and a woodwind melody/harmony, a perfect accompaniment to a lonely flight scene in the blue sky. What made the soundtrack for me is the sparing use of fully-electronic instruments, which I think they reserved for scenes heavily involving the Neuroi; the scenes that focus on the girls generally use the (synthesized) \"acoustic\" instruments.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme will probably hit you in the face, but I think that's largely because the accompaniment is entirely synthesized. The ending featuring the voice cast is all right, but nothing I really cared to listen to 10+ times.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum up, a good character show, a premise that's iffy if you care about history, good visuals, and a fantastic soundtrack.",

Its a great anime to watch just for some Enjoyment if you haven't already whored enough Ecchi, Comedy, or Action animu yet.\r\nFirst lets go over some cons.\r\nSPOILERS\r\n-I have a issue with the very last episode of the first season and how every other Strike Witches girl knew that Miyafuji was driving the last Striker unit. I know not to use logic when it comes to anime but, how? She is about 500 meters away and yet everyone knew it was her. Not counting Perrine-Sanand Mio.\\n\\n\r\n-The Cliffhanger. This has got to be the most laziest ways to include more writing to hint at another season. I mean, I guess I can understand it might have a messaging error and it was just now registering but seriously. Really?\\n\\n\r\n-Its a bit generic. At the very least a lot of these characters have probably been done to death but its kinda offsetted by a big assortment of characters\\n\r\n-The Art style is nothing exactly special.\\n\\n\r\nEND OF SPOILERS\\n\r\nAnd now the Pros.\\n\r\n-Episode 7: Need I say more?\\n\r\n-Very Likeable characters. Nearly every character has there own set of personalities. Like Lucchini is the obvious Loli, Shirley-San is the speed devil, Hartman is very lazy, and Miyafuji is the strong heart girl that will do anything to save her friends. I do have to say though a lot of these personalities seem a bit generic but at least there is a variety to it\\n\r\n-The Action: The battles with the Neuroi are just fantastic and show how teamwork can be portrayed as. It also shows how Miyafuji is evolving in her skill set\\n\r\n-The Comedy: Again, need I say anything about this?\\n\r\n-A simple yet great story. This pretty much is kinda like a Rocky story. A person who is a underdog in her class goes out to show the world what she can do and as a result it earns her recognition. It also shows some training moments almost exactly like Rocky, except its not Apollo Creed she's not facing. It also explains her feelings towards a certain Neuroi and to show that not everyone in the same grouping is bad. Its a bit simple though, nothing complex like Black Rock Shooter (TV).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9. Its a great show with likeable characters, great story, good comedy and action and its an overall great show. You won't regret watching this show. Except maybe the last episode.\\n",

            "content": "The first thing that you notice about this anime is that none of the girls wear pants.  It seems that panties = pants.  Multiple things about the story just do not make sense. The time period is 1944, but the technology does not match.  For example how they fly.  A device that go's on the legs and is powered my magic, while at the same time it acts as if it were a fighter plane from that era.  They can use magic shields, but the weapons that are used are guns from that era also.  That is probably whatthe creator was going for, so ....... yeah.  I don't want to keep ranting on so i'll stop.  To put it simply this is a total fan service anime.\\n\\n\r\nVery nice artwork.  Other than all the magical stuff, everything just give off the vibe that you really are in 1944.  The cars, train, ships, uniforms, even the base.  (can't forget the girls too)  All the little things really do make this anime that much better.  \\n\\n\r\nNot much to say about the sound.  The strikers sound like old fighter planes, guns sound like how you think they should sound, the alarm that sounds when the enemy is attacking, all of which really help set the mood.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the main focus and the biggest selling point that the anime has to offer, the characters.  All of the witches seem to be fairly young.  They can only use magic powers when they... transform?  Well not really transform, but they get car ears and a tail.  Did I mention they walk around half naked everywhere?  Anyway, non stop ecchi action.  Multiple naked scenes.  Although I said this anime is mainly about the characters not much info is given about them.  Everything is based around sex appeal.  \\n\\n\r\nFairly good anime, if you like the ecchi genre.  If not I say you should stay away because that is all the anime is about.  It is not one of a kind, but it is something different i'll give it that.  Slightly boring because all the fights are very repetitive.  In the end I kept watching because of the half naked girls, and that is probably why you will too.  (If you watch it)",

The main characters are unlikable. Yoshika is unbelievable as the hero, Mio Sakamoto though a mostly like character has a laugh that grates on your soul and then there is Perrine after a few episodes my wife who likes most everything about anime was jumping off thecouch screaming for someone to punch her in the face.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters make the show, there interactions are fun and thought out and enjoyable to watch.  Other than that it really feels forced. It seems there motto on this one was Echii pays screw the story. \\n\\n\r\nthat being said i will watch the second one and i have scoped out some figures i may buy, what can i say Echii pays.",

With the power of righteous justice, soft core lesbian kiddie porn, and just a little bit of pixie dust, the intrepid band rises to the challenge of picking off some of the worst-conceived assault craft ever devisedwhile studiously ignoring the tenuous thread of a plot in favour of some pedophically creepy and inappropriate... everything.\\n\\n\r\n\"But... the characters!\"  What characters?  There are no characters here.  There are only dull, monodimensional stereotypes such as Miss Unlikely Protagonist, Miss Leader, and multiple questionable flavours of Miss (insert nationality here).  Rarely one of these hollow effigies may seem to have a moment of character development, but as they appear to have the memory of a goldfish this never lasts from one episode to the next.\\n\\n\r\nTo enhance your enjoyment of this ambiguously criminal violation of intelligence, good taste and common decency, play a drinking game in which you take a shot of whiskey every time one of the 'characters' screams \"SAKAMOTO SAAAAAAAAAAAN!!!!!\"  Be sure to have EMT on scene ahead of time.

            "content": "First and foremost, I must say this....if you have a  deep hate for fan service, you will not like this show. Everyone else, I'd say give it a try! :) \r\nFor the first 2 or 3 episodes, the biggest question in my mind was \"where are their pants?\" I could not get over the fact that about 90% of girls wore panties, bikini bottoms, or school swimsuits under there uniform top....and that's about it.  However, the story is actually good, so you will actually end up forgetting about the unnecessarily often pantie shots. \r\nStory - 9\r\nThe story is very interesting. It puts youin the mind of Sky Girls, but was pulled off so well that you don't mind the similarities. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are your average characters. When you have an anime with a mostly all girl cast, the characteristics of the girls are always similar between all the shows. There wasn't anything special, but it was very well drawn.........ok, but I did have one little issue. I forgot this was going to be ecchi, so I was not mentally prepared for some of what I saw. It was mostly panty, a few boobs, the occasional buttock, lots of crack, and there were 2 or 3 full on nude shots of the most private are of a women's body :) But the story is so good that it's easily overlooked (for those that don't want to see). And also, unlike most fan service anime, the boobies are a reasonable size. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nI was ok with there voices, which is usually one of the things to what I am most attentive and critical, when it comes to anime. The music was good, even though I skipped the opener and ending every time, LOL!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\\n\r\nI feel like I've seen some of these characters before. Look wise, some were similar to others in other anime, but there were a few that had their own looks....but characteristically, they all remind me of characters I've seen before. It's 12 ep show, so you don't get to know the girls as much as you would like to, however :)  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nOnce one gets past all the fan service (if you aren't into that kind of thing), then this show is easy to enjoy :) I do recommend it to anyone! Unless you absolutely hate fan service, you will love this show ;D\\n\\n\r\nSo Overall, it's a 9!\\n\\n\r\n It's a really good show; you should try it! :D",

While the anime began with an interesting premise of combating an unknown force with magic and modern weaponry, any merit that has is quickly dismantled by the fact this show is an excuse to look at small girls with their pants off.  Strike Witches cannot even afford to have it's female characters wear skirts. Instead all the women wear dark black rubber panties that are several sizes too small for them. In the first episode alone there are seven unnecessary pantie shots - yes I counted. The blatant sexual nature ofthe show pummels the small amount of good that the art and premise bring to the table under the weight of all the perverts masturbating furiously to this ridiculous joke of an anime.",

It can be hard to get into, given what it is - but under the surface it's actually full of redeeming qualities.  Art style and sound design get good marks, and oddly enough, most of the characters (most, I say...) are pretty good, and though the plot is pretty predictable and has been done before, more or less, it still manages to keep itself interesting enough to make you want to see what happens to the characters next.  It's very nice to look at, in allaspects - both the backgrounds and settings, and the character designs and actual action qualify as eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nIt's upbeat and happy, by the end at least - it's like the sleaziest feel-good anime you'll find, I think, and while the massive amount of pantsu (as in, every single scene in the entire series, no exceptions) and fairly large amount of boobs popping up all over the place, could have ruined it, they struck a rare balance between these and actual content.  That's quite a feat given just how far they take the above - I recommend watching it when your family / girlfriend are not around - but I do recommend.  \\n\\n\r\nFor one of those anime I didn't expect anything from, it turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  A fine example of why people both love and hate anime, rolled into a single show.  A fine example of why I don't typically advertise my hobby openly too.",

Now conjure up all your testosteroune and imagine the best thing (ecchi wise ) ever.......... you got it, now think of this and see if its better. 8 underage lolis and 3 others that look like lolis flying around in the sky in machines called \"striker units\" one weilding 9 shot rocket launcher the others weilding other huge WWII wepons all fromdifferent parts of the world (i.e. Scotland/England, Japan, Russia, Germany, Finland, America, Italy, ect.) one for each personal preference in body type and most preferences in attiude tundere, shy, brat, lazy, uncaring, sometimes a mix of multiple, fighting alien crafts saving the world all while (prepare your mind) wearing no pants........mindf**k.\\n\r\n               The only small downside is not a flawless story because even i'll admit all the wonderful fanservice does cloud over some of the story but very little. I have whatched the seiries over and over so the story to me is very strong and clear even in the infamous episode 7 it shows the girls running around stealing each others pantsu very nice I might add but mind blowing with the extra uncensored you can get it at gogoanime .com minus the space just search up strike witches there. Anyway it shows some comedy and personality of the strike witches story wise sometimes this is forgotten amoung the panties flying this way and that. There is also some strory builders at the begining and end.\\n\r\n                               The art by gonzo is extremly good, sound qaulity was perfect, as i kinda said befor you fall in love with the character and get to know them all very well, I cant say how much I enjoy this andnow if youve read this far you will too, overall a great peice of work yummylishous (if thats a word) and absolutly the most epic thing ever.",

            "content": "I. Introduction\r\n\tStrike witches is a show that is very appealing to the general /a/ masses because it contains all the \"best\" parts of shitty animu. But before we get into that, let's talk about the characters themselves. The show dumps a metric fuck ton of characters on your lap that are just a name and a face that you're expected to recognize and love immediately. Even after watching the most part of season 1, I can't even name a single character without watching an episode over again. Each character has bland personalities that too easily fit how they look. The one with an eye patchis strong and wise, the young ones are stupid and bubbly, and the oldest and most endowed one always pokes fun at the younger ones. Enough of my banter, let's dive in.\\n\\n\r\n\tII. The \"Best\" Bits\\n\r\n\tAs I said before, the show contains all the best parts of shitty anime. First to the characters appearance. This is what would attract people to the show, and possibly keep them watching this shit. There's the entire spectrum of builds and body types for all newfags to fap over : Lolis, huge tits, and ass as far as the eye can see. During the coarse of each episode, there's more tits and shots of girls asses than a maxim magazine and they don't wear pants. But oh no, that's not all. They're also all Cat-girl Witches! I'm being entirely fucking serious. When they don their magical flying legs, they pop out a pair of cat ears and a tail and power the legs with magic. Besides the characters, the show also panders /k/ and other military / WWII buffs. The guns they use while flying (so cat-girl-witch-soldiers?) are all guns that any CoD zombies player could drool over.\\n\\n\r\n\tIII. Episode Structure\\n\r\n\tBelieve it or not, there is some structure to each episode. I never said it was good, but there is an obvious flow in each of the episodes. They generally start off with a waking up or morning scene. The girls all do remedial shit like brush their teeth, eat and clean. Fun. There are occasionally some \"plot development\" scenes and flashbacks, but nothing to really make this more than a weak, drawn out hentai made for daytime television. Then it gets to the good stuff : girls playing with each others tits. Whether they're on the beach, doing chores, or training, they play with each others sugoi tits till the cows come home. There are also frequent bathing / sauna scenes with pointless full frontal nudity and the girls talking about how one of the others is so hawt. It's not like they have shower scenes in one episode to pander the fans like some other, more respectable shows. It's almost every goddamn episode they have the girls fully bearing themselves. The circle jerk comes to a subtle end when the cookie-cutter enemies show up.  The enemies in question are the worst fucking enemies ever. They can only be described as \"black and red honeycombed shapes\". They all shoot red lasers of undefined power and have armor that is too strong for their guns, rendering them basically useless. One of them is even just a Rubik's Cube that splits into all the individual squares. Fucking original amiright? It's not until one of the characters uses some Deus Ex Macnina to kill them that they can finally destroy the damn things. Why are these enemies attacking? Well let me tell you : No reason whatsoever. They just attack something for no obviously foreseeable goal besides firing lasers around.\\n\\n\r\n\tIV. Conclusion\\n\r\n\tThis entire show has doomed itself to Inuyasha Syndrome. No matter what happens in each episode, nothing happens. No overlying story arcs to speak of here. I'd say that it's a slice of life anime, but the issue is, it's not. It's just hentai modified for the general viewing public. It gets into your pants before even touching your heartstrings, even in the most sad or happy scenes. If you ever thought of watching this show, just watch some hentai and Azumanga Dioh instead.\\n",

At the time of WWII, some fearsome UFOs appeared through the sky and destroy every city it passed and human couldnt do anything about that. Hopelessly right ? Our only hope is the Witches (loli that has some kind of super power) to drive a flying machine to save the day haha.\r\nThe Art is very good, everything is bright, colorful and beautiful (especially the pantsu). The characters are typical, the main character seems like a kind-hearted girl but very determine when it comes toimportant thing, the side characters have their own personalities, and they have their own ep to actually develop. The only problem i had with the show is that it lacks of awesome moments, it's kinda rare in these kind of show.\\n\\n\r\nBut I enjoyed Strike Witches and i believe so will you",

            "content": "I might as well as let it out there, that Strike Witches is my favorite series;  I'm not saying that season 1 is necessarily my favorite, but I haven't re-watched season 2 yet, so I'll just let season one represent the series on my favorites list for now.  Honestly, before I even get into the review I'll say something kind of contradictory.  I'm not going to sit here typing to try and convince you that this is a must watch for everyone because of amazing the story , art, music, etc are.  I believe wholeheartedly that Strike Witches is a seriesthat only people who like shows that handle 11 main/side characters being present all for a good amount of screen time well, beautiful sky scenes and lower-upper age teenage girls drawn not wearing actual pants, a story about a new Witch wanting to become stronger and help everyone she can even if it means taking reckless moves, etc.  Basically, there are many things that I believe can turn someone off from Strike Witches , although I'd definitely say it's way above average,  and I don't find it likely that the anime would convince you to like it, if you're extremely off put by something beforehand.   It's just not a show that you can talk about how well written it is, like Death Note, and Fullmetal Alchemist, how great the characters are, how stunning all the different visual types are, etc.  It's a fairly simplistic show that I don't think would change people's opinions much if they're inclined to not like it before viewing.  Anyway, I've rambled on enough now.  Time to start the review.  I won't be rating each category individually like I've been doing recently though, since it's a perfect 10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the story is fairly simplistic.  Yoshika Miyafuji is going to a normal school, until she receives a letter from her dead father handed to her from Mio Sakamoto.  Mio is attempting to recruit her into the Strike Witches since she has an amazing healing ability, but Yoshika refuses at first.  She doesn't even agree to join the Strike Witches until after being taken on a carrier ship in order to see her father's grave, and equipping a striker unit for the first time, the device the witches use to fly, and helping to fight off a neuroi during her travels with Mio.  Her journey of self growth and her meetings with all the wonderful members of the 501st joint fighter wing, the Strike Witches, start.  Unlike other stories of self growth, the main character doesn't go from being one of the weakest to one of the strongest.  Yoshika at best, moves up into a middle spot, but she still remains lower in power rankings among the unit.  She may act rashly at times, but she's also the one who encourages everyone else when they have doubts and brings about conclusions that nobody expected until they saw it.  You find out the internal struggles of most of the remaining cast, as well.  Minna, Mio, Gertrude, and most others all have something that bothers them internally during the season and it's generally about something in the past that affects them in such a way that they don't act like themselves, until Yoshika ends up breaking them out of their shell, and sometimes other people help a little too.  It's not that she's a plot device, but that's just the way she is.  Yoshika is very good at giving and or inspiring hope to/in others.  One of the bests parts of the story definitely has to be that it doesn't try to be tear jerking despite the tragic events that occurred in many of the girl's lives.  There will be some boob jokes and playful grabbing now and again too, along with other comedy, but it just makes the experience so much better.  it's world war 2 based as well, but with the unknown neuroi attacking earth and Witches rather than feuding countries.  I believe the ships are suppose to be modeled after war war 2 ships as well.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic, at least on blue-ray.  All the surroundings from the sky to the water to the ships, and everything seemed so realistic,  even though you can tell it's a drawing.  the neuroi may have weird designs, but it doesn't matter.  All the Witches have such memorable character designs, despite that they're drawn not wearing pants.  No female character in the Strike Witches universe ever wears actual pants, and tights are the closet it ever comes.  It's certainly a weird choice to make, but it actually makes their designs so much more memorable, a long with allowing the show to have an easy way to go about providing some fan service, making the striker units more noticeable, and eliminating any hindrance the pants may have made to the visual appeal while the witches are flying through the sky.  It's an art style that i'll never forget.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is similar to the story, in the fact that it may not seem special at first.  I'd say that the opening and ending theme convey one of the best messages of encouragement and working to discover your potential along side your friends out of all the theme songs that convey similar messages.  The songs are extremely memorable , if you're a fan at least and don't try to forget them.  The background music is fantastic too.  It's  not that it's the best calming music out there, the best pumping up music, or anything like that.  The music just has a unique feel to it that can only be experienced in Strike Witches show or something, like Brave Witches, which is very similar but different;  Brave Witches suffers in the art department a bit due to the sub par 3d cgi used though.  the animation is also amazingly well done in Strike Witches.  The fights are not the most action packed, but everything is so fluid and lively.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all unique in their own way too.  I already said most of my thoughts on Yoshika so I'll just leave it at that.  Unfortunately, Strike Witches is another show where I don't think describing the characters will actually convince people.  Strike Witches, Brave Witches, Armed Girl's Machiavellism, and Seven Mortal Sins, are four shows that I have this opinion about their characters, for the most part.  I wouldn't mind going into how great of a singer Minna is and describing her past, talking about Gertrude's past, the problems Mio faces, and many other characteristics and personalities.  It would just make for too long of a character section when they are 11 Strike Witches and I don't think it would convince many people because the cast would sound generic paper, despite their liveliness and colorful personalities.  It's kind of a shame, but I'd rather keep it shorter and not make my favorite cast sound generic unintentionally.  It's a cast that needs to be experienced, as long as any prior knowledge you have about the show doesn't deter you from watching it already.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the enjoyment.  Strike Witches was one of those shows that I always loved and didn't watch for a particularly good reason.  I read in a review or something that the main character grew dog ears and a tail when she fights and I wanted to try and discover the reasoning behind that.  I already started to like cat girls at the time, so the humanoid aspect pulled me in, especially since it sounded so bizarre.  My question was not answered until I read one of the manga series, Maidens in the Sky, though.  I still loved it even though my question was not answered.  I realized it was one of my top 5 favorites when i thought about it a few months later.  After another 2 or 3 months, I was thinking about what my favorite anime is, and after Noir, which was the first anime i saw, being my favorite for a while, I realized after thinking about my opinions on it after i started to re-watch it, that it doesn't hold the title of my favorite anime anymore.  as I watched more shows, Noir wasn't even in my top 10 anymore.  I decided that Strike Witches is my favorite anime after Noir lost it's place, and I just re-watched this season over a period of four days.  I enjoy watching Strike Witches so much and it definitely brings the most joy to me, overall, when I consider every aspect.  It's well deserving of being my favorite anime and I don't regret giving it that title.  I hope that many people who read this at least have a positive experience while watching the season.",

Then I let you borrow mine.\"\r\nAnd so, she got started taking her panties off. \r\n(from the episode 7 of Strike Witches)\r\nStrike Witches, is a light-hearted military based anime with some magical abilities such as healing wounds just by concentration itself; seeing distant things clearly and even its hidden inner parts with a magical eye. And, I think this is one of most ecchi fanservice-orientated anime in the Japan animation history. \r\nFor some mysterious reason, in the world of Strike Witches all young girls seem like they don'tput any skirts or pants on their bottom. Therefore, their underwears of their bottom parts, or at least their barely-covered crotches can always be seen by everyone around them so easily. This hilarious- I mean terrible habit of the world made me in a panic before I realized that they probably *have to* be without skirts or pants at all times in order to immediately mount the Striker Units on their legs whenever the alien invasion warning issued. My goodness. That perfectly makes sense because the aliens would appear possiblly in every minutes and wearing a skirt for the witches might be a problem when mounting the Striker Units. I was pretty impressed by those young fighters. Although the witch girls look young and cute, they are professional army officers after all. Showing people their underwears or barely-covered crotches doesn't make them feel embarrassment because of their high-spirited sense of mission. With this rational conclusion, I finally managed to settle myself on watching their brilliant actions in peace... until I had happend to see a nurse with no skirt! She was not a member of the witches for sure. What the heck were she doing in a hospital? What is wrong with this Strike Witches world? So, I eventually learnt that no skirts for girls is like a principle nature of this anime. Furthermore, interestingly enough, the girls seem like they have no question nor a complaint about it. \\n\\n\r\nNow, please let me review the other aspects of this anime other than just about panties. To be my good surprise, the other aspects like the battle with the enemies, and the plots of each episode were also very nice, unlike the saying of some other reviews. The battle scenes with the aliens is very loud and exciting, thrilling that is worth watching. The plots may seem typical to anime buffs but it suits the whole relaxed mood of this show. The opening/ending themes are maybe not super great but still they are pretty fine and I like its innocent, optimistic lyrics, which I listened to it almost every time I watched the show. \\n\\n\r\nI have given it a 'great' score because the show is totally very well balanced as a fanservice-orientated entertainment piece of work mainly for anime freak gentlemen. So, make sure if you are an airhead 'freak' before trying it. :)\\n",

            "content": "Welcome to an Otaku Review\r\nI personally really enjoyed this anime, I know bring on the Loli jokes of being a little girl loving perv, but this show was Just all around fun. But If you don't care about being called a loli then keep reading. (I bet half of you are AFK right now arent you)\r\nStarting with plot, I wont give a synopsis since If you scroll like for two seconds up you'll see it, but basiclly it was good.While it does kinda start of a little slow, it picks up fairly early enough.Also, the whole mechamasume thing was quite original & I liked thewhole Idea of the witches fighting in a war against some evil being, it was original for me at least which Is why I loved it.It also threw alot of twists at you that worked quite well in the second half of the series.  Though im not really sure why they have no trousers. (trousers=pants in america) But its so lol'zy I have not need to question it XD\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were great & fun (again with the loli jokes) all of the witches had their own unique personally though all very likable & memorable, Its hard to hate any of them by the time you finish this series & you'll most likly have a favourite to. Even the side characters e.g the proffesor has alot of mystery behind him, though still cool.Along with the men members of the war were cool for the brief part of the series they were in, though the ship crew members were meh, they were really just there for being there.\\n\\n\r\nArt was really nice, I now in the dvd they fix up the animation which is great, though even without it was very vibrant & I don't really know much to say other than it was pretty good & also they character designs were very likable & fit well, all which is sometimes rare. (I is a sucker for them little girls)\\n\\n\r\nSound was fine, some epic backround music & also buitiful tracks in certain scenes, also the I really liked the Op & ED themes (both on my Ipod were they belong) not the best music ever but still really nice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it comes down to my enjoyment (now im really sounding like a loli) Im not going to be nit picky however admitidly theres really nothing that I hated though one thing to note is that theres a fair share of fan service, though I found it more funny than discusting (unlike a certain servebot I know) in fact I diden't really find it to overshadow anything.(note for loli's:The DVD Version is Uncensored, half of you just came am I right?) \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it was highly enjoyable & reccomendable & I can't wait for season 2 hoping it's just as good if not Better!! That's my 1st Anime review, I hope you enjoyed. Goodbye & sionare (hur, hur, hur its funny because they both mean the same thing, am I cool now Giaz!?!?)",

            "content": "Strike Witches\r\n OH MY GOOOOOD....... This was amazing, absolutely fantastic, a whole ton of FUUUUN.\r\n Ecchi, a good plot, an amazing twist, a brilliant cast of characters, beautiful girls (seriously pretty), ecchi!! Strike Witches is an absolute fantastic anime.\r\n Strike Witches follows Miyafuji Yoshika, a girl who has incredible magical power capabilities and is thrown into a world she didn't expect to get involved in, because her wanting to protect people overcomes all her fears. The story in Strike Witches is really very good; for 80% of the anime, it's sort of slice of life based, revolving around magical girls who use Striker Units asa modern replacement for \"brooms\", hence the witches in Striker Witches. Yoshika is at the center of just about everything and in every episode, helps a girl discover something about herself or simply helps out a girl and friendships are built.\\n\\n\r\n In Strike Witches, we have a large cast of what are essentially young girls (\u2665 Lolis). Yoshika, the lead, Sakamoto, a strong and brave girl who helps Yoshika train and become a Strike Witch, Lynette, a really pretty girl who ends up being Yoshika's best friend, and in my books, a one true pair. Perrine, a stubborn and massively jealous girl; jealous because Sakamoto is focused on training Yoshika. There are other girls too, Minna the leader of Strike Witches, Sanya, a total cutie with white hair and an extra cute voice with an awesome magic power. There is also Hartmann, Shirley, a girl with large breasts and a killer body; she's also a speed freak, Lucchini, the smallest of all the girls and loves to fondle breasts whenever she gets the chance and Eila, a really smart girl who is always seen with Sanya, because of an adorable crush.\\n\\n\r\n All the girls are pretty amazing, they're all cute, and the ecchi is most definitely something to be warned about. Panty shots or hot pants or whatever.... it's most definitely in every episode and tends to be a focus too. Heck, sometimes the artists draw out a lot of detail in the pantsu shots that... well let's just say that it can be very exposing as to what is being shown. Most of the pantsu's on the girls aren't on properly either, falling half way down their waists and things of that nature, or being very small. Breasts are shown all the time when there are bathing scenes and things. It should be noted, none of the girls wear skirts or anything of the sort, it's all very much pantsu and hot pants. The point is, Strike Witches can be very ecchi at times, but don't let it put you off from the story. (Though if you like ecchi, just go ahead and watch Strike Witches, you won't be disappointed) \\n\\n\r\n Speaking of which, once 8 episodes have passed and Yoshika has made a good impression on all the girls, the story really opens up. The Neuroi, the main enemy of the show sees a huge twist that honestly, I should have seen coming a mile away, but was caught up in other things. It's because of this that I feel like the build up, the more slice of life direction for most of the show works so well. There are so many girls and all of them have a story, not all are told, but the important girls get an episode and then some, it helps build a believable world and it's easy to follow the logic involved when these girls make decisions, you really feel like you understand them. I think the Neuroi are fantastic, because of what happens. I wish this was a 2-cour series instead of 1, but thankfully there is more content available.\\n\\n\r\n Art style in Strike Witches is freaking fantastic. Beautiful colors that symbolizes that even though this world is in a war, it's no where near as bad as one would think. The colors are bright, they're vivid, they would make you happy just watching! The detail of the girls is well done, *cough* especially the ecchi shots *cough*. The animation is fantastic, having a very smooth and well maintained animation throughout all 12 episodes. The last episode is a huge job well done to the animators, the fight scene was incredible and it just flowed so well.\\n\\n\r\n Music and Sound is.... I actually think I have no idea what makes something bad in this regard. I enjoyed the OP and ED a lot. I felt like the sounds were really good, the background music meld well with the corresponding emotions and scenes. Maybe I should review this section on how memorable it is, because I don't believe it's possible for most anime studios to get this part wrong. OP and ED are most definitely good though, I liked listening to them a lot.",

            "content": "Strike Witches is a unique series in quite a few ways, whether these are good or not depends on the viewer. The story focuses on an alternate take of the world circa WWIIish when aliens called Neuroi invade the Earth. In this world, the world's only hope of survival depends on the Strike Witches, a group of women (girls really...) who utilize their magical abilities to power propeller-propulsion systems (Striker units) mounted on their feet. If you've heard of Kantai, this is the airborne equivalent of that.\r\nLike in Kantai, all the important characters are female and a large majority of the show focuses on asingle newbie, in this case the protagonist Miyafuji. In this way, it sort of feels like Sora no Woto, with a bit more Shoujo-ai. However, the later part of the series becomes strangely plot-based leading to bizarre encounters that are not quite explicated enough.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is this series and what is its target audience? It mixes a bit of action, yuri, girl-bonding, and a lot of ecchi sans the normal harem male character. Therefore, if you're into girls in borderline-H situations or girls with guns, then by all means dig in. If you're looking for a compelling character development or story, this one is iffy.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe most memorable (good or bad?) thing about this series is the character styling and design. I guess because the striker packs are mounted on their feet, the girls can't wear long skirts or pants, therefore all Witches pretty much are always just in panties or tights. This series is definitely one of the more daring ones for its time, though I might have unknowingly picked up the DVD version. You have ~14-18 year old girls that are often found topless (and even occasionally bottomless).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the general animation style, it's fairly typical in styling, though backgrounds are notably plain and occasionally blurry. There is also an abnormally high amount of CGI though it isn't too painful most of the time, probably because you're looking at something else on the screen...\\n\\n\r\nDespite the setting being in a war, like in Sora no Woto, there aren't a lot of signs of imminent battle or horrific signs of warfare. Battles are basic with many scenes just showing twirling contrails. There's occasional blood but nothing of an overly serious nature.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a LOT of girls in this series, and luckily most of them are visually distinguishable.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP is a fitting, if slightly light tune, though not my favorite melody. The ED is likewise lighthearted and likewise not a terribly good melody. The BGM is fittingly war-like with a heavy emphasis on drums.\\n\\n\r\nVAs give each character a fitting persona, despite most of them having minimal air time (11 main girls for 12 episodes...). As for FX, I'm not a terrible fan of propeller blades so I eventually got annoyed at the sound.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAs I explained in the overview, the story in Strike Witches is a bit of a flop. After Miyafuji gets recruited, the series becomes episodic as Miyafuji befriends each of the other witches and learns about their strenghs/past. After a total fan-service episode (ep 7), the series decides to get a bit more serious and you get a really rushed rising action leading to a very contrived climax.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there were a lot of interesting elements added in the last few episodes, many aspects were poorly explained, and too many other aspects completely unaddressed. I assume the second series will clarify some of these aspects.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nDespite the short introductions, I actually liked the personality given to many of the witches, as well as their interactions, which were sometimes borderline yuri and other times just comical. You get the sense that there is indeed growth and development as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, a lot of the goodwill created in the early episodes is eroded by the seemingly random antagonist introduced with barely any background near the very end of the show. Ignoring this interruption, however, the characters are well explored considering the length of the show.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nStrike Witches is definitely not for everyone, and is especially NSFW. It's a unique series that combines historic/sci-fi with loli aspects. It isn't a very good story but hey you're not going to be starving for fan service after this. This is a casual watch that will literally force certain body parts in your face. Just don't watch this expecting detailed battles with deep choreography.",

I mean, it's lolis with leg propellers, guns with infinite ammo, and a genericayy lmao enemy there for window dressing. Not every production needs to have some deep \"purpose\" or reason to exist: after all, the point is to entertain people.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Strike Witches does a great job with that. The animation (in particular facial expressions) is very smooth, the sounds of engines and the weaponry is phenomenal, and the characters are satisfying in that they all have unique personalities. There's nothing \"wrong\" with Strike Witches, and the entire thing comes together to provide a few hours of light-hearted fun.",

            "content": "In the interest of full disclosure as of now I have only endured Season 1 . At this point I feel this show is a complete loss. The show feels like it struggles with what it should be. Ecchi? Military? Magic girl? Unfortunately it dabbles with all of them yet doesn't do any of them well. I feel as though the author was new or just trying to ride the waves of similar series that sold well. The show is based on the premise that monsters presumably from another dimension are invading. The world is forced to rely on young witches who display their magicby popping out various animal ears/tail, and fly around with WWII heavy machine guns, and shoot the enemy down, with endless panty shots.\\n\\n\r\nWhere are all the pants? The girls in the show never seem to wear more then underwear and shirts. This would be fine if it was some offbeat ecchi comedy however the setup and the punchline never come. The occasional un censored breast shots come once an episode but seem completely out of place. They don't serve for some bloody nose joke nor are they necessary for the show itself. It would seem they are only there for some lonely teen to get off on.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting on this feels UN-naturally sub par. Perhaps this was a low budget that had to pick from the leftovers, however the relative tone of all the girls is so similar you cant really decipher one from another with your eyes closed. Looking at the main cast of voice actors I really feel let down. So much talent seems tossed to the wolves.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are each given motivations but none really seem true to their \"tropes\" beliefs, or personal convictions. Such wishy washy characters could normally be overlooked if the show had some redeeming quality. Strike Witches sadly, has nothing to offer except poor acting, a really loose plot, no real character development and a whole host of plot holes leaving you scratching your head wondering what you just watched.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was about on par with the times (2008 iirc) The soundtrack however was forgettable and didn't really fit the show or its theme. However the ABUSE of panty/boob shots as well as above mentioned flaws DE-railed this show for me.  Ecchi can be done in a tasteful way to add to a show or can be the prevailing theme. However this show didn't take the tasteful approach and yet it didn't really seem like it wanted to be Ecchi either.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I Give Strike witches 3/10. It remains somewhat coherent as the story progresses. As well as gives an attempt to fill in the void for certain genres. However this show I fear will be lost in the vast ocean of garbage series. Such a pity",

            "content": "Opinions on Strike Witches are quite varried.  Among those who found fault with the show, there are some common complaints (fanservice and lack of central plot, to name a few).  While the series certainly isn't perfect, it has the potential to be very enjoyable if approached with the right frame of mind.  I almost missed out on this show after reading some of the negative reviews, but I am glad that I gave it a chance.  The show already has plenty of reviews describing the art, sound, etc., so this review is structured to address some of the common complaints froma different standpoint.  If you keep these points in mind while watching, you will be less dissapointed when the show doesn't go the way you expect.\\n\\n\r\nNote: This review actually applies to both season 1 and 2, but is spoiler free.  \\n\\n\r\nFanservice.\\n\r\nThere's no denying it--Strike Witches has a lot of fanservice.  However, it is generally tasteful, and I use that term loosely, especially when compared with some of the other animes out there. Yes, there are an abundance of low camera angles, but most of these are easy to ignore.  Most episodes have a bath scene, but these are mostly about humor rather than naked women.  If you find nudity, the occasional upskirt shot, and some yuri themes morally objectionable, than Strike Witches is probably not the show for you.  However, if you can get past it, there is SO MUCH MORE to this series than fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nCentral, underlying plot.\\n\r\nThere isn't one--Strike Witches is episodic.  It is an alternative history series where a mysterious alien force attacks Earth at what would otherwise have been the outset of WWII.  That's it.  From here on the \\n\r\nshow is essentially a slice-of-life comedy.  While the lack of a plot definately makes it an outlyer for anime, this concept shouldn't seem so strange, especially to American audiences--think of it as a sitcom.\\n\\n\r\nAlien invaders are never explained or developed.\\n\r\nYou will never learn who the invaders really are or why they attacked.  I can see why this would bother a lot of folks, but remember that this is really a slice-of-life comedy.  Rather than being slice-of-everyday life, it is slice-of-teenage female pilots fighting aliens-life.  Also, this is the 1940s.  Even today, if we were attacked by aliens would we really know anything about them?  I argue that it is more realistic not to ever find out details about the aliens.  I would be more upset if a Japanese Jeff Goldblum showed up to explain everything in five minutes, with no logical explanation as to how he acquired this knowledge.  \\n\\n\r\nNow, for a caveat: towards the end of season 1 the producers will tease you by making you think there is more to the aliens than meets the eye, and that this will somehow be explained.  Even in season 2 this never happens, and it is kind of annoying.  As with a lot of anime, sometimes you just have to go with it.  Remember, there is NO DEEPER PLOT.\\n\\n\r\nLack of Character Development.\\n\r\nYes and no.  Over the course of the two seasons, every member of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing gets an episode solely devoted to somehow expanding the character, whether through backstory or through growth.  I really enjoyed this aspect of the show, but it is fair to say that, even with the dedicated episode, some of the characters never really develop and stay kind of flat.  However, let's cut the writers some slack.  In two seasons there are only 24 episodes, and there are 11 pilots.  There just isn't enough time to really develop all of them, but the ones who do receive focus are very well developed.\\n\\n\r\n\"Plot\" holes.\\n\r\nThis is anime--expect them.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this gives you another perspective on Strike Witches.  Like I said at the beginning, you must approach this series with the proper mindset.  It is episodic, it is silly, and there is no deeper plot or major plot twists.  Even when things happen that may lead you to believe otherwise, trust me, there are no plot twists (you can't twist something that isn't there to begin with).  If you keep these things in mind, it will help you to just sit back and enjoy the show.  It is very funny and exciting.\\n\\n\r\nSide note:  I strongly recommend reading up on WWII history a little bit before watching this show.  While not required for enjoyment, you will catch a lot of nuances that may otherwise go unnoticed.  You will also realize that the writers actaully put a LOT more thought into this show than just what color each girl's panties ought to be.\\n\r\nSpecific recommended topics (in order of relevance):\\n\r\n(1) WWII top aces from each country (for specific aces look at the character pages on the Strike Witches myAnimeList page)\\n\r\n(2) WWII-era fighter aircraft and weaponry from each country\\n\r\n(3) The Battle of Britain\\n\r\n(4) Imperial Japanese Navy sea vessles (specifically Akagi and Yamato)\\n",

            "content": "Strike Witches is an interesting look at history.  Now every grammar school boy and girl knows how World War II started, so I won't bore you with the details(unless you want me to).  This anime takes the start of WWII and gives it a twist.  I am not very fond of many magical girl anime but this one was well done.  The story is new and inventive.  It takes ideas put in place at the end of WWII and puts them in play to stop an invasion of unknown creatures.  As was most of the equipment used by allsides at the start of the war nothing would work against this new menace.  One scientist had an idea that was just crazy enough to work.  If I go any farther you will star screaming spoiler so I will move along.  The characters are great.  Based off real aces and pilots from the country that the witches represent.  I am a fan of old war birds but not those who flew them so I don't know much about the pilots that the girls are based off of, most of my heroes were \"ground pounders\" and were routinely strafed, bombed and rocketed by these men.  As far as the pants less state of all female characters I can only guess as to the reason but I have to agree with the explanation of \"fan service\" because there really is no other reason.  The sound was appropriate for the anime and very well done.  Art was very well done and give it a soft tone to a serous story.  Overall it is worth watching.",

            "content": "What I have noticed most from the general reaction to Strike Witches - including the reviews that have come before mine - is that this anime lacks story.  As a matter of fact, the Strike Witches themselves ARE the story, but I'll elaborate on that later.\r\nIndeed, if you're looking for an actual plot connecting the series together, you're looking in all the wrong places.  The biggest examples are that the enemy is barely explained, and the mysteries surrounding Yoshika's father are rarely brought up.  But while the plot isn't my problem, if there's one gripe I have with Strike Witches, it's theexcessive fanservice.  Who knows?  Cutting the amount we see in half alone would probably catapault this anime to a higher score.  Unfortunately there are too many times when it just seems out of place.\\n\\n\r\nThere is mild nudity which is censored by convenient beams of light when you're not watching the uncut DVD version.  Technically that's also fanservice, but there's a big difference between the occasional bath scene and completely random butt-shots.\\n\\n\r\nStrike Witches' art is fantastic, although sometimes they do use a little too much CGI.  That said, it's still enjoyable watching a competely different setting in anime for a change.  After all, much of Strike Witches is meant to be a homage to WWII dogfights.  Even the characters are based off of real aces, and their striker units are based off of real aircraft from that era.  For pant-less girls flying around shooting down aliens, the battles are surprisingly well-played out, but a lot of that leads into the next category which should be praised: the original score.\\n\\n\r\nIf I could - and I really, really would - I'd take and arrange music from the Strike Witches OST (and SW2) and create an entire Strike Witches concert.  But not to take away the music's impact on the anime, some of it (for me, anyway) really hits home - from the aforementioned battles, to the serene moments shared between the witches, and to their varying themes of love and tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nThat brings me right into my belief that Strike Witches does have a story.  Or rather, many stories.  The timid Lynette has to carry the burden of protecting her homeland.  Trude, stubborn by nature, is haunted by a Neuroi attack that left her younger sister paralyzed.  And lonely Sanya wants to find her family someday and listen to her father playing the piano again.  Our hero Yoshika often finds herself in the middle of each character's dilemma, while simultaneously trying to solve her own problems that are dotted throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, I gave Strike Witches a reasonable 8 out of 10.  But pants or not, I'm giving THE Strike Witches an 11 out of 10!",

            "content": "If you're looking for girls, fan service, a light hearted action story, and friendship. You're in the right place, if not I suggest this anime isn't for you. \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story sounded interesting as I read the synopsis. It is unique in it's own way, battling aliens with striker units. But the catch is you have to be a witch, and the most important one, no pants. You would think when fighting aliens the story would be full of sadness. Not for Strike Witches as the anime itself is a light-hearted anime story.\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nThe art was a strong point for Strike Witches. Judging when thisanime came out the animation seems to be ahead of it's time. Not really any noticeable 3-D scenes. All characters have their key differences so you know who's who. And when they have their battles you can really sit back and enjoy the fan service and girls kicking alien ass.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe sound was good at the most. Not really any special things to point out, nor are they're any bad things to point out. The one thing was the timing when the soundtracks played, it was timed nicely to fit that certain moment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThey give all the characters some background so you know what has gone on in their lives and how they are now. They're is some development here and there for the sides but for the main her development had gone up sky high throughout the series. The characters were a major plus for this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series overall, seeing the power of friendship brings me joy. Every once in awhile I need an anime like this, some comedy, love, fan service. The characters did not disappoint, they brought when they needed to, to the table when ever they were called upon. Over all the series was just plain fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: 8/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "What starts out in appearance as a show about an alternate World War II era quickly turns out to be not about the story it promises but the panties. Yes, that is right, a potentially serious story about fighting off invasion from an unknown foe is made silly by the constant panties on screen whenever possible. This show borrows heavily from the same dumpster the train of thought used in shows like Agent Aika. Whereas panties, and the occasional boobs fill the majority of the story's time making one question why is there a plot anyways, you can still manage to make out a semblenceof a story and some quasi generic characters that still caters to a broader audience. For most people however the panties will be enough of a sendoff to say goodbye to this one forever but if you can get beyond this you can actually enjoy this. I liked the designs for the flight and enemies and combat in this series enough to rate it a 7 overall but it certainly could have been far better. Despite its prolific pantsu or rather in spite of it this show comes across as funny to me, because it is not subtle at all in its blatant fanservice.",

            "content": "Well what do you know? I ended up watching this after hearing all the talk about how awesome season two was. Sure enough I was interested enough to give this a chance.\r\nDo not judge this anime by how it looks. Trust me, despite the absence of pants in the entirety of this anime, it was not made for pants fetishists and the anime should not be based on what ANYONE wears whatsoever. So ignore that crap and let's get down to the story..\r\nIt is extremely slow at first, it starts out explaining a war between humans and some sort of lifefrom called the \"Neriod\". Thenmoves on to the main character Miyafuji Yoshika who lives in the countryside. Her friend gets hurt and she attempts to heal her with magic. Of course she isn't a master at this craft and passes out from over exhaustion and wakes up back at home. Then comes in a military official Sakamoto Mio who happened to see Miyafuji's healing magic and wants to recruit her into a military fraction called the \"Strike Witches\" that fight the Neriods. She turns it down at first but eventually accepts being attracted to learn more about her father presumably died in war fighting the Neriod.\\n\\n\r\nStory: I don't expect anyone to be hooked on the first episode. You have to keep watching to let the characters sink in and for that universe to be interesting enough to keep on going. Take my word for it, it gets better as you watch on. Nothing too emotionally deep here. The main antagonist (the Neriod) seemingly has no conscious and is  just there for the witches to fight, nothing important really explained about them, although they seem to have affected the lives of many characters in this anime, being somewhat generic, works to it's advantages. Somewhat predictable, doesn't really tie up every loose end. It does stray off on the subject of Miyafuji's father, but returns at the end in a very nice plot twist.\\n\\n\r\nScore - 7, Nice story, it works very well.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The animation fantastic, the Neriods look very nice being  a sort of shiny black aircraft type beings that they are. Action is nicely presented. Being an anime with a lot of flying the sky is also done beautifully for the people that are into those types of thing. It's worth watching uncensored although they should have had a little bit more work on the with the ecchi segments of the animation.\\n\\n\r\nScore - 8, Good.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The voice acting was fantastic in this one. Featuring a few seiyuus that I've come to love. A few lines that had me laughing just for the way it was said. The voices add more to the characters and i admire that in an anime. The OD and ED, I'll be frank, are forgettable however.\\n\\n\r\nScore - 9, Awesome can't get enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - A huge part of the anime, and hardly would have been interesting had some of these characters been missing from the anime. Since it might be somewhat difficult to get through the earlier parts without knowing what characters are in store, I'll go over a few one by one to give you a basic idea.\\n\\n\r\nMiyafuji Yoshika - Not that deep of a character in my opinion. She hates to fight if she doesn't have too, stays away from guns. A pacifist basically. One would describe her as \"that new girl\" in terms of personality. She's innocent and just wants the best for everybody but not afraid to break some rules if she thinks it's wrong.\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto Mio - She is that tough superior, older sister type character, while being somewhat strict, takes Miyafuji under her wing and teachers her about being a witch. Very diligent, wakes up early to train every morning, goes out to combat even if she's in no fit condition to do so. While not being the highest of the ranks, she gives out more of a leader feel than anyone else in the series.\\n\\n\r\nClostermann Perrine - Indeed my favorite of the bunch. She might come as that spoiled 'I am better than you' type character that dislikes Miyafuji at first. As you watch on you learn that the princess has some weaknesses as well. She is pretty much in love with Sakamoto Mio stalking her, fantasizing about being with her, and worships her to the point you're hoping for a hot Yuri scene every time the two are together. She's somewhat shy around Mio however and is jealous that Miyafuji gets most of the attention and is obsessed with being Mio's favorite. \\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much it for the characters, there are much more to look forward to and that should help you get past the slow first episodes. These characters are much more interesting to watch than to read about in a review and in no way did I spoil anything worth spoiling.\\n\\n\r\nScore - 8,  a very high eight if you ask me, if it'd has done a bit better it would've been deserving of a nine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - It was a good experience for me. It does come to mind a lot that these girls are in a universe where neither proper pants or skirts exist because they're running in around in basically underwear most of the time. It never bothered me. However showing too much loses some of the appeal of showing it in the first place.  That's just my opinion though, I'm sure people are into stuff like that. The twist at the end leaves the viewer very much anticipating the second season.\\n\\n\r\nOn another note, the Witches in the anime use some type of flying device called a 'Striker Unit'. Think of it as big bulky leg attachments with little fans at the end so they can fly around. It had me wondering what sorts of accidents and decapitations having little fans strong enough to propel a person in the air at top speeds attached to the legs may cause. I wish they would've used something different, like wings or something. But I do admit those leg attachments work to some great fan service and are very imaginative in their own rights. \\n\\n\r\nI repeat, watch it uncensored or the experience will not be the same.\\n\\n\r\nScore - 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nthis was pretty awesome to say the least. I can't wait to get into the second season. I hope all of of you think to try this anime out as I did. I doubt you'll need this review to convince you.",

It's probably because of the anime otaku-base's creepy idea that \"children equal purity;\" that deep, dark desire to \"pop that unpopped cherry.\"  (Those in the outside world call it \"pedophilia,\" but hey.)That's why Mina (and otherwise \"nice hot buns\" of her ilk) are usually treated like crap by said otaku-base.  :(\\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite the negativity...  Strike Witches is pretty good for something that combines the cliches of magical-powered jailbaits, (upskirt) panty shots, weaponry and military coolness, alien fighting, and \"lonely otaku pandering\" girl-on-girl love.  (Seriously, do girls / women talk about each other's boobs in real life?)\\n\\n\r\nThanks go to the storyboarding / writing staff whose brains didn't just function along \"staring at jailbait crotches and butts all day.\"  Thanks also go to Funimation whose actresses were able to pull it off despite the material they're presented with.",

The story/plot itself is very basic, but it has a very interesting backstory/prelude along with a very interesting environment. The art and sound are pretty good. The characters are very entertaining and somewhat interesting, but character development is not a strong point in this anime, nor would you expect it to if you watchit.
