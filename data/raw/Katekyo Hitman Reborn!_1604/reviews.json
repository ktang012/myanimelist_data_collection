            "content": "Hitman Reborn was initially recommended to me by my friend. However the story looked dull and uninteresting to me, and I was also not sure if I would like it (I watch anime like Bleach, DGrayMan etc.) Thus I started off with the manga. The first thing I thought when I read the manga was \"WTH is with that stupid looking baby? The main character is also so badly drawn!\" However, after reading a few chapters, I got hooked and finished 100+ chapters in a day. I decided to give the anime a try, as I wanted to see how well the characters could bebrought to life.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe only thing that prevented me from giving a 10/10 was that the story took waaaaaaay too long to start! Sure, the first 20 episodes were amusing and had me cracked up, but there was no real storyline to it. The anime was also inferior to the manga in my opinion, as they had more fillers and also took out the guns and knives (and Tsuna's reactions to them) that would have made the whole thing even more hilarious. However after that the real action starts, which had me hooked all the way! The storyline is extremely unique, and Tsuna's irritating underwear transformation thing became less frequent, and finally disappeared altogether :D It is also way different from most shonen anime, which usually only consists of blind fighting and no development at all. In all, an amazing storyline! (After the first 20 episodes, that is, but don't skip till there, have a look at the characters!) :DD\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI would give it an 8/10, as the characters in my opinion were not very well drawn. The characters usually look fine, however weird if shown from different angles. However the animation was okay, the fighting scenes were well animated, and I especially enjoyed looking at Tsuna's weird faces whenever Reborn is up to his antics again x)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIn my opinion the OPs were the BEST! Drawing days (First OP) had me addicted the first time I listened to it. Except for OP3 (Jumping Days I think), I just didn't like it at all D: The voices for the characters in my opinion were well matched and I just loooooooove them, but Tsuna's voice is still a little weird to me (Too high I guess). The BGM, however, was AMAZING. It totally brings out the mood in whatever is happening and will have you paying attention to it in spite of the action going on! Each character's theme was also awesome, especially Hibari and Gokudera's theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIn all, the characters were what makes Reborn a kickass anime! :DDDD It is amazing how some characters who only appeared for comic reliefs could get so serious and awesome whenever they needed to! The way the characters have matured is the main factor that kept me hooked onto the series. The transitioning is so subtle, you wouldn't even notice how much they've grown until you think back and remember how they used to be (Remember whiny old Tsuna?) The different personalities that match each of the characters and the way they follow such an unlikely boss is truly cool! :DDDD\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed Reborn as a whole, except for the first 20 episodes (It's TWENTY hello) but the storyline and arcs later on made up for it, and also the character's ridiculous antics which really give the series a light feeling, yet serious when needed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're looking for a new anime to watch, try Hitman Reborn! It may seem boring at first, but persevere on! Until the main story starts, there is a good chance that you'll be hooked too :D And the storyline is amazingly unique, I've never seen any anime like it before xD \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Katekyo Hitman Reborn is an outstandingly well made anime. I definitely recommend that you watch it if comedy and action applies to your genre of choice.\nAt first glance, Katekyo Hitman Reborn may seem boring. The major flaw of the anime is that it absolutely misleads you, and it completely deceives you into either a) dropping the anime or b) thinking the anime is lame, when it isn't! \nThe first 20 episodes may mislead you to drop the anime, just like it misled me, because of its fillerlike episodes. You will most likely tell yourself \"Wow, this is really lame. What's the point of all this?\"That's what I thought, but I gave it a chance. (And I'm SO glad I did. Katekyo Hitman Reborn is now my absolute favorite anime.)\\n\\n\nThe beginning is kind of slow and different from the rest of the later episodes, because apparently KHR was initially meant to be a gag anime - it was supposed to be something funny and comedic. The anime took a different turn as you progress to episode 20 into something more serious.\\n\\n\nThe first 20 episodes is merely a /long/ introduction to the anime. It's worth watching though, because you get to be familiar with all the characters. They are all likeable! If you decide to watch Katekyo Hitman Reborn (and I hope you will!) you should decide whether you like it or not, after 25 episodes or so. It's only fair, right? All animes have their flaws; and it's flaw, in my opinion is that they don't give it a decent start. If you do not have the patience for that, then this anime may not be for you. \\n\\n\nStoryline:\\n\nKatekyo Hitman Reborn deals with the mafia. Tsuna, the *main* character, is in the next line to be the 10th boss for the Vongola Family~ (one of the many families in the mafia.) Reborn, a hitman, and also a baby (hehe), travels from Italy to Japan to tutor Tsuna to become a worthy boss for the Vongola Family.\\n\nFrom then on, Tsuna's adventures and what he experiences are endless-- but they're all interesting. Over the course of the anime, Tsuna grows and matures, and becomes really strong; fighting his enemies and getting stronger each fight he experiences. The fights he encounters are well made, and they WILL keep you at the edge of your seat. Tsuna isn't the only one fighting, though-- he also has a \"family\"-- his comrades, if you will, and the battles they encounter are endless. \\n\\n\nArt:\\n\nThe art is well made; I don't think there is much to complain about it.\\n\nIt isn't outstandingly good, nor is it horribly bad to a point where you have to shield your eyes. The characters are wonderfully drawn and are all unique in their own ways. The art progressively gets better as you further get into the anime.\\n\\n\nSound:\\n\nThe sound is absolutely AMAZING. It deserves an 11/10, as opposed to a 10/10.\\n\nI loved all of the openings, and endings-- I never once had to skip it; and that's kind of rare, considering the fact that I'm absolutely picky with my music.\\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing as well, there is a couple of them for EACH character (well, the main characters, anyways.)\\n\nThey have a soundtrack for every different scene in the anime, and it is absolutely positively pleasing to the ears. Everything about it is EPIC!\\n\\n\nCharacter:\\n\nThe characters are very well portrayed; you can't help but love all of them (well most of them anyways.) They change greatly over the course of the anime and it's worthwhile to watch them grow up.\\n\\n\nEnjoyment:\\n\nI love Katekyo Hitman Reborn! I love everything about it; it makes me laugh until I fall off my seat and look like a loser, it makes me sad as they go through their hard times, it makes me happy as they overcome their obstacles-- and so on.\\n\nI can ramble on forever about how much I love the anime, but I'm going to end now, before I end up typing a ten page paper.\\n\\n\nOverall:\\n\nKatekyo Hitman Reborn is an AMAZING anime as I mentioned a billion times (well not really, but let's pretend.) I highly suggest that you go off and watch it right now, but I can't tell you what to do. It's ultimately up to you.\\n\nEverything about it is amazing- it's storyline, (although it may seem boring at first) it's art, it's sound, it's characters-- it's everything!",

            "content": "Story - 8\r\nHitman Reborn is a pretty unique anime in my opinion. There is one major flaw in the story that prevents me from giving it a full 10. The first 20 episodes or so have no real story arc. While each episode is interesting and helps develop the characters it takes way too long for the story to truly begin. But I will say this. The story arc in this anime is top notch. Once you get to episode 20+ you will be watching the episodes one after another after another. I am anxiously biting my fingernails waiting for the next episodes to besubbed!\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Hitman Reborn is decent. The lame underwear morph on every episode for a while is what brings the grade down a bit, but Tsuna begins to look awesome about 25 episodes in, when the underwear morph becomes not so common and is replaced by something else. The other characters are also drawn very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Hitman Reborn is awesome both opening and ending songs. The japanese voices all fit the characters as well. The only reason sound isn't a 10 is because of Tsuna's voice in underwear mode. It gets so annoying during the  few long sequences.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are all unique, with a wide range of personalities all following an unlikely protagonist. Quite frankly i'm jealous of Tsuna. Hes got the perfect range of friends all with flaws that fit the characters as well as strong loyalty to him. The characters couldn't be more enjoyalble. (Save for Tsuna in underwear mode) (Lets face it Underwear mode sucks >.> Thankfully it practically disappears entirely once the true story arc starts.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately Hitman Reborn loses 2 points here because of how long it takes to get rolling. It seriously has much too long of an introduction phase. If I were to rewatch Hitman Reborn I would start around episode 15 or so. That way you can get a memory of the characters before the story starts. You wont miss practically anything and you'll be loving Hitman Reborn from the start.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall Hitman Reborn gets a 9. It truly is an awesome anime that will keep you hungering for more once it gets rolling.",

            "content": "&ldquo;WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THAT LITTLE CHIBI DUDE?&rdquo; I thought to myself when I watched the first episode of Kateikyoushi Hitman Reborn! aka Katekyo Hitman Reborn. What was with the really silly protagonist? Why was he such a wimp and loser? And what was with his weird &ldquo;transformation?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s so bloody revolting and crazy. I thought that the anime was on crack&hellip; Seven months later, I took the advice of a friend and decided to give this anime a second chance. \r\nAfter the second episode and a bit of my own research for random other information and media of the series, I fell inlove. I also was VERY addicted. I became current with the series in four days; I even endured a rough night and watched 20episodes in one sitting. Anyways, arhem. Let me go into further detail of how my fanaticism for this series began.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, well, I actually thought the first few episodes were rather ridiculous, still. I kept on watching them, though. I mean, who can turn down a Mafia-based anime, anyway? Episodes, nevertheless, turned out to be so incredibly ridiculous that I just had to watch more and more because of the hilarity and comedy I found within the first twenty episodes. To my surprise, I really could not give up on any of the &ldquo;Filler&rdquo; episodes or beginning episodes because I was already hooked on the craziness of the series. And although the beginning got way too episodic and &ldquo;lame&rdquo; (e.g. like Bleach, D. Gray-Man, and Naruto), I did not give up hope for the series to improve and for the story to develop. The beginning helped create a very fine atmosphere and background for the lifestyles of the protagonists. Once the plot began to reach its first &ldquo;arc,&rdquo; or main story, I was amazed by the sudden turn of events. It was a very pleasant surprise to find the main characters undertaking actions to carrying out a rather &ldquo;dangerous task.&rdquo; After the arc finishes, there are a couple &ldquo;Filler&rdquo; episodes but, they do not entirely intend to act as such because they do develop towards the next arc. The second arc is full of great action and thrill. As of right now, it is still underway. And, as I write this review, I am very anxious to watch more! \\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Wanted to revise this a bit... since I've watched 42more episodes... my impressions of the anime have slightly changed... I'm still a die-hard fan of the series, I have to say... the storyline has indeed slowed down after the second arc, and well... Filler episodes became a bit more trivial and useless... Regardless, it's been on track again to a third arc for the last few episodes. And yet the annoying thing is that, as some people have said, there's always a flashback to what's happened so far... Like from in Bleach. And so, the plot has slowed down tremendously... The characters are still very original and entertaining to observe in developments, though... All other aspects are still very true, though. :P So be sure to keep with this series for it's uniqueness in many other aspects and well general theme. :P\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason why I love this series is obviously because of the character development and portrayal. The characters are all just so amazing and cool in their own special ways. Each character possesses a unique and different personality from every other character. From the first impressions of each character, I was rather disgusted. But upon learning more about each character in time, I grew to love each and every character because they each had a special charm or trait that seemed very personal and almost real. I felt very connected to several characters. Furthermore, the character development was not slow at all. Okay, there were a couple cases where the character flash-backs got a bit tedious to watch, but there were sufficient amounts of information to obtain in the meanwhile, so I was not too frustrated with them. Then, information given about the characters were developed into the story in a rather formal and thorough manner which I felt was effective for letting me know about each character. As for a few characters, I have felt (and sometimes still feel) a bit irked by them and their funky and somewhat &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; irritating personalities. However, as the story has progressed, I want to say that the characters have grown on me. And now, I appreciate the existence of every one of the characters, and hope to watch (and read) more about them all.\\n\\n\r\nWhat also helped me get more into the anime was the animation. Initially, I found it a bit funky, but I watched more and began to realize it was actually pretty impressive. The graphics have been, for the most part, to my standards at least, above par. Everything was quite thoroughly illustrated and never too flashy, abrupt, and messed up. Action scenes were detailed and well scripted and screened. The art styles were well designed, too. I found that the characters and settings did not lack too many details from the original artwork. \\n\\n\r\nNow as for the music&hellip; I loved all the sounds! &lt;3\\n\r\nAs in, I have listened to the soundtracks and opening and ending theme songs of the series so many times that I think it may be too excessive. I don&rsquo;t recall too much insert music, but that does not take away from the series since the other sound effects and background music have suited well for all the situations and scenarios of the anime. Sometimes, the music gets a bit wacky, but those are obviously for the funny situations that are in the anime. For the fight scenes, there is more than reasonable usage for action music. Thrills and suspense are well built into scenarios due to the special styles of background music used. Special other sounds are also very appropriated &ldquo;placed&rdquo; throughout the series. From the countless times I&rsquo;ve listened to each and every theme song used, I still cannot get enough of the fabulousness of each song. I enjoyed the opening theme songs so much that I had to watch them all for every episode that I watched in the last four days. Now, yes as much of a waste of time that might have been, I could not get enough of it. The &ldquo;shot&rdquo; selections used during the theme songs were neither that great nor that terrible, but I found that they worked fine. And, as long as the songs are good and the shots used are not that revealing nor weird, I could deal with it.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, I found that the animation company that produces this series was able to pull through every episode very well. I did not feel like they wasted much of my watching time at all because everything seemed at least 25% relevant to the story if not also sparked my interest in watching more. Really, I felt that the plot has moved at a very steady pace that still stirs anxiety and curiosity because of major cliffhangers. I cannot get enough of this series. This is one amazing manga series that has been adapted into an anime that has lead me to enjoy the story in a very wonderful and exciting way. For a load of laughter, adventure, and action, be sure to give this anime a try.",

            "content": "In the last ten years, there has been a significant decline in the style of shonen action anime. I went from growing up with gritty titles like Bio-Booster Armour Guyver and Fist of the North Star, to over-marketed fan service like Bleach and Soul Eater. I'll put the \"old anime guy\" rant aside for sake of this review, which is a show that isn't too different from the aformentioned titles.\r\n Katekyo Hitman Reborn is not a very good anime. It isn't, but it's also not the worst I've ever seen. This anime had potential to be moderately decent, but suffers from most of the sameproblems that hindered Bleach into a tailspin. I wanted to wait until I reached the future story arc before I wrote my review for this show, as this was apparently the money storyline. Admittedly, I wanted to see just what this was about. Now that I'm about halfway through KHR, I have just what I need to write a proper review for this. I'll break it into the good and bad of Katekyo Hitman Reborn.\\n\\n\r\n[THE BAD]\\n\r\nTHE ACTION: While it's not as bad as Bleach, the fighting is just as obnoxious and probably sillier. Battles used to mean something in action shows, now they have dissolved into the method of following in Dragonball Z's footsteps: forget about subtext and just make your fight as loud as possible. It's bad enough that the skills these characters use look completely ridiculous, even by shonen standards, but they could've been utilized on a level that wasn't brain-numblingly stupid. I'll fix some of the stupidest ones right now.\\n\r\n1. Bianchi's Poison Cooking: Would it have been that hard to just have her vex someone's coffee with arsnic instead of producing plates of food out of thin air and shoving it in someones' face? It's hard for me to take this even remotely serious when you model a fighting style I've seen in Looney Tunes.\\n\r\n2. Get Rid of the Boxes: Really? Amano was so out of ideas, he had to rip a bit from a 13 year-old kid's show that already spawned a generation of Pocket Monster knockoffs? This gimmick was incorporated to increase it's female fanbase, because it's cute when Hibari summons a spiky hedgehog. That's fair game in my book; you need to increase your demographic, fine. But what's infuriating is the fact that every cast member that fights already has an established fighting style. Adding this only makes the fights more overbooked and complicated than they already are. It's such a cheap plug for a card game, I was expecting a starter deck to pop out of my C drive.\\n\r\n3. XanXus' Jet Handguns: Ben 10 is calling, and Heatblast wants his powers back.\\n\\n\r\nTHE COMEDY: Comic relief doesn't work when every single character has a satirical shtick. By trying to make every character funny, the jokes don't bounce off anyone, and you just have method actors reading catchphrases. \\n\r\n \"Gotta....stay...calm\"\\n\r\n\"ROMEOOOOO!!!\"\\n\r\n\"TO THE EXTREME!!\"\\n\r\n\"I'll bite you to death\"\\n\r\n\"I'm the Tenth's right hand man\"\\n\r\n\"Ku fufu\"\\n\r\n\"I have to deliver these noodles\"\\n\r\n This is overkill. These jokes are repeated anytime one of these acts are on the screen, and they are long past being fresh. Actually, to call them jokes would be insinuating that they were at some point funny. Without a balanced set of personalities (a catalyst, the butt of the joke, an instigator, and a straight man), humor doesn't work. Since there's no set up or punchline, the characters just scream at each other all day, and it's grating. How many times does Gokudera need to double over in agony after seeing Bianchi? Dr. Shamal wasn't funny back when he was Master Roshi. And Ipin's forehaed bomb is about as amusing as a root canal. The only character that truly makes me laugh is Haru Miura. More on her later.\\n\\n\r\nTHE PLOT PACING: The story(s) are slighty better than I would expect, but nothing above moderate. In fact, the plot could be a lot better if everything wasn't so drawn out and uninteresting. I won't harp on the endless amounts of filler (it's become almost a necessary evil in anime today), but rather the parts where things are supposed to be happening, but it prolongs simple development to the point where it grinds to a halt. Not a spoiler, during the Millefiore raid, Gokudera actually wants to STOP THE ATTACK so Yamamoto can talk about the Arcabaleno. Top it off with the fact that everything seems like it's kept a secret from the audience when it's just another new character reveal. Byankuan (I think I butchered that name) is supposed to be the main antagonist, but they have not given me a reason to hate him. It's becoming a pet peeve of mine when bad guys now just sit in chairs and LOOK evil instead of doing villainous deeds. They told me he runs a very powerful Family that can crush the Vongolas in 23 seconds, but has failed to alluminate on that, instead telling me how animals kept in boxes can turn the tide in a battle. On a side note, I think the Black Spell and White Spell guys look too much like Soul Reapers and Arrancars for my taste. It's just another stark reminder as to how little thought gets put into these franchises when four sets of cast members in two different shows dress exactly alike. Pitiful.\\n\\n\r\n[THE GOOD]\\n\r\n TSUNAYOSHI SAWADA: I never thought this would happen, and it took awhile, but Tsuna is actually a pretty acceptable main character. He's no Gon Freeces in Hunter X Hunter, but in today's age of shonen leads being just completely intolerable jackasses and ignorant A-holes, Tsuna is a significant upgrade from Ichigo Kurosaki and Ryoma Echizen in Prince of Tennis. Yes, he's whiny, whimpy, and seemingly \"no-good\", but the real lighting-in-a-bottle of a character like this is watching them grow up before your eyes. it's what I loved about Gohan, though the saiyan's road is far more memorable and cohesive, Tsuna's metamorphosis into an independent pillar of valor is a something I can take away as a mild success from this. He's incredibly down to earth as well. All he wants is to win the affections of Kyoko, yet his own fantasies about marrying her and impressing her are so low-barred, it's like his brain is actually telling him he can't do it. I find that a little refreshing. To grade him on a letter scale, I'd give him a C average.\\n\\n\r\n THE GIRLS: I always get the impression that shonen authors don't like to write female characters, what with the way they all follow the familiar pattern of being completely bitchy, nagging, hostile shrews like Bulma, and good ladies in shonen like Rukia get shelved and taken out of the show for episodes on end. The female cast of Hitman Reborn has been one of the reasons I made it as far as I have. While this mainly pretains to Kyoko and Haru (Lal Mirch and Chrome aren't presented enough at the point I'm at. Especially poor Chrome, she's the worst treated character in the whole franchise), I really like Tsuna's mother and even Bianchi has moments when she plays the big sister to the others. But man, Haru Miura has become one of my favorite supporting characters ever. Her off-beat wackiness, unpredictable sense of style, and unbridled enthusiasum picks me up everytime I got the urge to drop this show and became the heart and soul of KHR for me. her cheery theme music is like a Phoenix Down being dropped on my head after one of those silly box battles. The only other character to breathe this much life into something that didn't seem that good at first was Hime in Princess Resurrection last year, and that's now one of the best titles I'm currently reading. The ladies in KHR are always a healthy break away from the stupidity of the fighting and hackneyed dialouge, and are the best girls going in shonen for me today.\\n\\n\r\nNOSTALGIA: While the humor fails and a good chunk of potential character development gets lost in the mundane battles, KHR has a certain feel about it that hearkens back to the classic days of shonen action series. The characters, while paper thin for the most part, are seemingly vibrant and full of life, like Yu Yu Hakusho or Power Stone. The setting and envoirnment isn't always dark and gritty like in Naruto or Bleach, and stays lighthearted enough to be a tongue-in-cheek action show, even if it is a little bit long. The intensity of the plot kind of picks up when a villian shows up, even if they lose steam halfway through the arc. If this show had come out in 1998, heck, even 2002, I would've fallen in love with it because it retains a glimmer of the spirit that most shonen titles lack nowadays, and that all I ask from this genre. Not Shippuuden.\\n\\n\r\nIN CLOSING: This was long winded review, and I apologize. I can only hope the readers understand my frustration with thinking out a meticulous review for a show that's almost down the middle, it's not a \"bad\" 5. This was a mixed bag for me. There's a lot I really hate about this show that I can relate to other shonen title mentioned in this review and probably rant about for another eight paragraphs, and while the bad outweighs the good, it comes down to quality of the good over quantity of the bad, and those elements have kept me watching KHR for over 100+ episodes, and is a testament to doing just enough right to keep me entertained. I can't say the same for Bleach and Naruto, which I'll never finish.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 4\\n\r\nART: 7\\n\r\nSOUND: 6\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 3\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 5\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE: 5 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nPROS: Solid voice acting, most Hibari scenes, music is catchy\\n\r\nCONS: Cast is way too big, terrible fights, lackluster gags, 5 minute recaps every episode",

            "content": "Katekyo Hitman Reborn, commonly referred to simply as Hitman Reborn, is the comedic story of Sawada Tsunayoshi (Tsuna) and his training in fulfilling his duty as the 10th generation leader of the famous Vongola Mafia Family.  Though this is a story about mafia families and such, by no means is it all dead serious as you expect mafia-themed plots to be (i.e. Gungrave).  Quite the contrary, this is a comedy anime and is a very hilarious show.  \r\nTsuna is trained by Reborn, a very well-known hitman throughout the mafia world, but the catch here is that Tsuna is your everyday klutz whohas no good qualities about him, hence his nickname, &quot;No good Tsuna,&quot; and also not to mention, he wants nothing to do with the mafia.  While he meets many new friends throughout his journey who eventually join ranks with him to become his &quot;mafia family,&quot; there are of course people who want to see him dead so they can take his place.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, while very unique as you don\\'t see too many mafia-based anime shows out there, definitely had more potential than what the final product has showed us so far.  The big reason that I state this is that there is a bunch of episodes, while not fillers, can be seen as stand-alone comedic episodes that don\\'t really have too much of a plot line to them.  The episodes that do have a plot, while they are extremely interesting, are unfortunately, go by rather quickly.  However, don\\'t let that be the reason to stop you from checking this out.  \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of Hitman Reborn isn\\'t all that bad, but isn\\'t anything special or spectacular.  Sometimes the animation just seems kind of plain, and many times during a few scenes you\\'ll undoubtedly notice how bland it is, but its bearable.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also on the same degree as the artwork, nothing special, but not disappointing.  \\n\\n\r\nI believe what separates Hitman Reborn and makes it special from other shows is its characters.  They creators have done an excellent job in creating fresh, very unique and hilarious characters that will have you laughing at their antics in every episode (especially Lambo, who is just too cute).  The biggest, and probably the most surprising thing about the characters is how some of them are literally, baby-sized characters.  Reborn himself is no bigger than Tsuna\\'s head and while this fact may make you stray away from this anime, let me advise that it only helps in the comedy department, because the creators were able to use this aspect so creatively well.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\\'re looking for a hilarious anime with very unique characters and some interesting fighting, look no further than Hitman Reborn.  This anime contains its fair shares of battles, action and romance to go along with the many laughs you\\'ll inevitably have.",

            "content": "Reborn is a generic shonen people may tell you it\u2019s more than that but   really it isn't the story is pretty interesting for a shonen a mafia story sounds cool right? Sadly we have a terrible protagonist which whines a lot characters like shinji and kamille do this a lot as well but their reasons are justified in their series. As they do have actually mental issues tsuna does not show this yes you can say it\u2019s a fucking shonen but hunter x hunter had a psychologically distraught protagonist as well.\r\n  Tsuna is a generic high school teenager which has the hotsfor some girl and doesn't have the balls to do anything about it standard  shonen clich\u00e9\u2019s.  The art is fairly mediocre as well the action scenes look alright for a shonen but everything else looks so bland and generic   especially the character designs. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very forgettable as well nothing really stands out except for the openings  they are  pretty great l think l like all the reborn openings which is really rare  the last one is my least favourite though. \\n\\n\\n\r\n The characters god fucking damn it the characters l  think  l already talked about tsuna enough he is a standard generic shonen protagonist  which wants to protect his friends  also he dosen't want to become a Mafioso even if it runs in his family's tree his character is just so infuriating the other main characters are fairly forgettable as well  only character l really remember fondly was hibari because he didn't give a shit about anything that happened   none of the characters get a huge amount of significant development for a 200 and something episode  series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere is also quite a lot of filler in reborn especially in the future arc with the girls cooking food and going on strike and it  all feels quite pointless   for a shonen to have  it was probably there to save  money because l don\u2019t remember  the filler scenes going for as long as they did  in the manga.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile l do have a lot of complaints with the story and the characters l did enjoy myself with the show it was a fun cheesy shonen just   don\u2019t bother with the manga it gets even worse especially with the manga ending which l won\u2019t spoil.\\n\r\nOverall Hitman reborn is a fun generic shonen it does hold a special place in my heart though because it was one of the first shows l ever watched when l first got in to anime.\\n",

Watching till 20 I was ready to quit a few times, but i read some good reviews so i kept watching. If you cant stand them at all, DONT skip em! Just be patient. These episodes are to introduce some of the characters, and of course make you laugh a lot! \r\nThe only drawback of this anime (personal opinion) is it's art. Sometimes characters' and backgrounds' art aren't good at all, since the detail is too low. \r\n\"So why should i watch it then?\" youmay ask, the answer is simple: Just give it a try and you will understand why I'm giving it a big 9/10 no matter the drawbacks mntioned above!",

            "content": "KHR is like any other long shounen series; For someone relatively new to anime, it can be very fun and addicting. If you are too familiar with the tropes used in this genre, it can become a real chore and way too predicable.\r\nStory: The plot progresses in the usual shounen way: The weak and optimistic protagonist trains, and starts fighting enemies who seem much stronger than him, and once he defeats them they often become his allies. The first 20 episodes were fillers, but since I found them funny I didn\u2019t really mind. The battles drag out a bit sometimes, but they are welldone in general and there\u2019s enough suspense to keep the viewer interested. The biggest problem however is the filler episodes; they were initially funny, but the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again and it becomes annoying fast. Even without talking about the recaps, some episodes were just completely unnecessary, like before each battle they have at least one episode where the characters just encourage each other and talk about the upcoming battle. \\n\\n\r\n Characters: The cast seems pretty diverse, but all the characters can fit in an archetype in some way or other. They gain maturity and confidence during the battles, but it seems to revert once the battle is over, and they are back to repeating the same catchphrases again and again. Many of the jokes are based on character antics, but after 200 eps, it becomes really predicable and repetitive. Another thing that really bothers me is the female characters; even though some of them are strong, their strength is nothing compared to the male characters, they hardly participate in battles, often can\u2019t do anything without help from the males (Chrome, cough* cough*). And while it is important to have a female character who can\u2019t fight but serves as moral support, having two of them is way too much especially when one is portrayed as very annoying and immature. Many of the characters who don\u2019t fight are very uninteresting; Despite tagging along for 200+ episodes and getting a lot of screentime, they don\u2019t get character development at all. Hibari Kyouya was especially poorly written; he is some lone wolf who practically wins every battle in 1 min without effort or remarkable injuries, and he doesn\u2019t have character growth at all. In other words, he can be easily qualified as a \u2018Gary stu\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nArt:  While the character designs are interesting, the art is very inconsistent. It improves through the series, but was never really detailed and every once in a while it is still possible to see poorly drawn frames without pausing the video. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The osts were decent, but they get kinda annoying after being repeated 98343981 times, especially when you can easily predict when they will be played. Most of the openings and endings however were pretty good and original. The seiyus\u2019 voices fit the characters well, but some of them may annoy you, like Haru and Lambo\u2019s. \\n",

            "content": "Katekyoshi Hitman Reborn! is an excellent example of how intriguing shounen manga can be with the right mixture of comedy, action, suspense and the flawless integration of the mafia and fantasy themes. The main protagonist Tsuna, at first glance, seems to have a defeatist attitude and comes off as pathetic, failing about everything, his studies, sports and even romance. Then our reluctant hero meets a mysterious infant hitman called Reborn who is recuited to be Tsuna's tutor because Tsuna is the 10th boss of the Vongola Family, a powerful and influential mafia family to much to Tsuna's dismay!\r\nStory:\r\nThe Story is one of the best Ihave come across in a while with the plot initially having large amounts of comedy and stupidity but goes on to include much darker themes later on. The anime starts of slowly introducing each character and establishing the bonds between them. It then goes on to have one the best concepts and plot I have come across. The plot was fairly consistent with the action and comedy sequences that keep the audience entertained and with just the right amount suspense, leaving the audience eager for the next episode.  There are well thought out powers and weaponry that Tsuna and his guardians use to face challenges and save the day proving that though the mafia may be considered criminal syndicates but the Vongola are different.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is excellent and the hero looks extremely cool while defeating villains. The equipment and weapons, pets, clothing and characters are well planned, well drawn and unique. I especially loved the Vongola Coat of Arms and Tsuna drawn in Hyper Dying Will Mode. Unlike most shounen manga, The character's clothing changes which is a fact that I love! Even the irritating underwear scene had him don a different pair each time...Though he does have the tyipcal shounen hero's orange color scheme, a popular trend with shonen manga.  (I refer to Naurto and Goku's clothing and Ichigo's hair)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe openings and the endings were quite good. I failed to notice any character specific battle music which is a change from normal anime which has music for each character. Tthe music is subtle and suitable to the situation and does not overwhelm the senses and distract. Tsuna's seiyu does an excellent job and Tsuna's voice in HDWM is slightly more mature than normal.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are well developed and realistic and the hero forms a buffer between egos that may otherwise clash, a valuble leadership skill. Tsuna dislikes vilence but once provoked is a deadly force top be reckoned with. Gokudera with his Zeal, Yamamoto and his calm and laid back nature, Ryohei and his Passionate, Kyoya with his Aflooness, Lambo and  his Cowardice and Mukuro and his claim to have a personal agenda is understood and is held together by Tsuna who forms the \"glue\" that holds his guardians together.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nNegative points:\\n\r\nI have enjoyed every episode. Though there were things that annoyed me. \\n\r\n1. Tha actual plot starts after 20 episodes. \\n\r\n2.The lead is irritating for the first 20 episodes with his dying will underwear scenes! I must say it was extremely funny but watching the same sequence for over 20 episodes makes you annoyed at Tsuna! I do not understand the point of it. Tsuna goes on to nbecoming super cool later on. \\n\r\n3. The Recap and Omake sections take up too much of the episodes time not to mention recap episodes!!\\n\r\nDespite this, the story arcs are well connected and the balance between action and comedy well maintained. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI strongly recommend this series to shounen fans!! I give this series a 9/10 and inspite of the drawbacks, it was excellent and entertaining. The plot, characters and art are strong points!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When i first came across KHR, it was a toss up against Gintama.  I watched the first episode of KHR and was put off by Tsuna's underwear mode thing, thinking it was completely ridiculous and stupid.  So then i chose to watch Gintama instead, however, i'm SO glad that i did come back to KHR eventually, or else i would have missed out on such an AMAZING anime.  After episode 20 or so, i found myself completely hooked, i probably even loved the underwear mode by then.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nOnce the real storyline kicks off, KHR turns into something amazing and unique.At first glance, the mafia based story put together with superhuman babies may seem a disaster but the plot eventually becomes something far from that and everything just seems to fit into place.  The only reason why i would not give it a full 10/10 is because (as mentioned before) it takes a long time for the real storyline to kick in, but if you pull through the first 20 episodes, you'll definitely find yourself addicted and watching episode after episode.  On top of that, KHR has considerably less fillers than other shounen anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nThe anime begins with bad character art, but as it goes on, the way the characters are drawn do get better.  The action scenes were well done to begin with IMO, and they also get even better further into the anime :]. I particularly liked the clothing style of some characters *cough* Gokudera *cough*, scenery wasn't bad although i didn't pay much attention to that, but at least houses looked like houses and trees looked like trees. x]\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nI loved nearly all the OP and ED themes, they fit the anime really well and got me addicted to Cherryblossom and Masami Mitsuoka's voice.  The character's voices fit perfectly and were very unique, although Haru's voice tended to be quite annoying at times with her \"dangerous desu!\" thing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\r\nI loved all the characters by the time they were all introduced, they all have unique personalities and the amount of support and loyalty they give the protagonist is almost heartwarming.  Each character has something unique to them which stands out from the rest of the people Tsuna knows, whether it be a saying or a style, there isn't any two characters who are similar really (unless you count fringe characters...)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nBy the time i reached episode 40 or so, i found myself watching it non stop, struggling to slow down so i don't catch up so fast.  It became one of my top favourite anime by that point, i usually don't judge anime before i finish them/catch up, but this one became an exception by miles.  Once you reach the real storyline you'll be completely hooked wanting to know what happens next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nDespite it's flaws at the beginning (taking too long to start, fairly bad animation etc), for me, KHR makes up for it all with its awesome storyline and unique characterisation whilst keeping typical shounen elements for it to be categorised in this area.  I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for a long running shounen anime without having to sift through 50+ episodes to reach the real plot.  KHR is definitely an addictive anime worth watching, you'll find yourself waiting for the new episodes to be subbed before you know it. :]\\n",

            "content": "Now this anime is one i don't think i will ever understand the fascination with. I have reached ep 65 so its not a complete review, but how many eps should it take for an anime to get good? Considering how  popular this show is, i think its time to balance it out with a negative review.\r\nOk, its pretty well established in the anime community that the first 19 eps or so are garbage.\r\nBut they are not garbage because they have no story and a basically filler episodes. They are garbage because some of the characters are so annoying they want to make youpull your eyes out. The cow and egg baby are horrid and the main character, tsuna, his japanese voice acting is more annoying then shinjis dub voice from evangelion. These eps are so bad they make naruto filler eps 136-220 look good!  :(\\n\\n\r\nOk, now thats out the way, to the real review.\\n\\n\r\nMost people are like watch from ep 20 where the first story arc is. However that too is a let down with boring, short and badly constructed fights. Its also just bog standard shonen fare that you have seen a million times before in high school fighting shows. Then after this short arc...more horrible filler.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the second arc is ALOT BETTER, and i would recommend just watching as much of the beginning as you can cope with, and then jumping to ep 34. \\n\\n\r\nThe fights are alot better, story picks up and becomes a more solid shonen fighting show.\\n\\n\r\nHowever it still in no way matches the hype. In NO WAY, can this show even come close to Naruto, One Piece, Dragon ball or even Bleach.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights so far are no where near as good as the above shows. Storyline wise its ok, better then bleach and dragonball but no match for naruto and especially  one piece.\\n\\n\r\nHowever its lack of emotion, character development and drama seals its fate. Because the start is so bad i feel nothing for any of the characters and the main character kills the show dead. He has to be the worst main character ever. \\n\\n\r\nEven Bleach has better character building and emotion then this and Bleach sucks in that area. \\n\\n\r\nI know there are alot of people who hate the Naruto anime, and thats fine. But if any of those ppl like Reborn then i honestly think they are not using any logic. Naruto CRUSHES Reborn with ease. Narutos fights, story, characters and especially emotional scenes  destroy the first 65 eps of Reborn.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to compare Reborn to the king of the shonen fighting animes, One Piece, is like comparing The Empire Strikes Back  with Attack of the Clones.\\n\\n\r\nI know its possible that Reborn goes super after the Varia arc but how many eps can an anime stay mediocre?\\n\\n\r\n Even Bleach got good from ep 15, Naruto was good from ep 1 and went thunderous after ep 19. Naruto Shippuuden is wasting some of the potential the show had but is still fabulous. Dragonball was great from the off, Dragonball z started with one awesome fight and One Pieces first season is still prob the 2nd or 3rd best one piece season with amazing character development.\\n\\n\r\nFor reborn to start off with filler is crazy and even the varia arc is not up to par. \\n\\n\r\nReborn might have been the 5th legendary long running shonen fighting anime, but alas it was not to be.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Okay, I feel like this review is going short and sweet but straight to the point. I decided to pick this up since my friend was going on about this like he does with One Piece. So I decided to give it a shot. The first 20 episodes are a real killer, since that's were a lot of people are like \"okay... what is this? Can we get to some sort of story/action already?!\" It has its little humor here and there to keep a little smile on your face.\r\nHowever, for me at least, I did not get interested in until the future arc. That'spractically more than halfway through the series. There were a FEW decent fights here and there before than but nothing too captivating. I guess what really had me was that they consistently dragged some parts out. It's noticeable in every arc and because of that, I had to put this series on hold and start a new series just so I could have my \"anime fill\" for the day. Sure there are plenty of anime that does this, but Hitman was really bad with this.\\n\\n\r\nThis show loves to put fillers within the arc and loves to have recap episodes and tries to play it off like it's really part of the story (though it's not as bad as Naruto). So occasionally, I would say something similar to this, \"Really, that was an episode? C'mon it should be better than this.\" Of course other anime do similar things, but with Hitman just really irked me the most. You will know which episodes will be recaps and you can skip them if you so choose to. For me, I have to watch every single episode, special, ova, movie and etc of a series.\\n\\n\r\nSo as my first review comes to an end, let me just answer a few more things: \\n\\n\r\nIs this one of the best anime series that I have watched to date? - definitely not\\n\r\nIs this worth a re-watch? - only less than a handful of episodes so basically no\\n\r\nWould I recommend this to people looking for a new series? - nope\\n\r\nWould I recommend this to people looking to kill some time? - maybe\\n\r\nCould you take a pass on this anime? - yeah, you are not really missing anything\\n\\n\r\nHowever if you are interested in Hitman Reborn, I would have to say that, stick with the manga, the anime definitely does not do this series justice unfortunately. Though a few OP/ED's were pretty decent :-)\\n\\n\r\nNot trying to bash the series out there for those out there who likes/loves it, but I'm just obviously voicing my opinion on how I felt about this series. It's definitely not the best nor the worst anime I have watched. I'm just sort of disappointed that my friend hyped it up as much as he does with One Piece, so I probably was expecting too much from this. Hmm... what do you know, my review wasn't all that short lol.",

            "content": "Ciaossu.\r\nToday we will be taking a look at Hitman Reborn, which was not quite as popular as some other shounen jump titles and it was sort of forgotten a while after it ended. \r\nThis is a spoiler free review.\r\n*Story*\r\nThe story centers around Sawada Tsunayoshi, an unpopular Japanese junior high-schooler who's one day forced by an Italian baby and his shape shifting pet chameleon (I don't know, just roll with it), to train and become the next head of a certain Mafia called the 'Vongola family'. \r\nFirst off, you wouldn't expect a shonen anime (which is mainly aimed at kids) to contain a subject matter suchas Mafias, would you? And that's why the term 'Mafia' in this series is very loosely connected to the real world definition of it. Are they involved in pedaling drugs? Prostitution? Wait, do they even break the law? For what purpose do they organize exactly? The answer to the last question is not very satisfying, as you can imagine. They're just presented as organizations with strong people in them that fight other such groups. It seems to me, this term is used mainly to sound exotic for a Japanese audience. So from the get go, this makes the story feel almost aimless, besides Tsuna becoming a 'Boss' of a Maifa with no clear purpose, aside from fighting other Mafias. I don't think the author thought this idea entirely through.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first 20 episodes the story sets out to introduce the characters through episodic comedy with little to no action in them. In this sense, it's different from the usual battle shonen and it might turn some people off immediately. Bleach (a series I'm not too fond of) also used its first 20 or so episodes for a similar goal, but did it through monster of the week with plenty of action. So I guess I should applaud Reborn for being different and taking certain risks. Even though, I'd personally prefer action, honestly.\\n\\n\r\nAfter its introduction episodes, Reborn goes on a route that's within the boundaries of the shonen tradition and starts its actual story through various arcs. The first arc was a pretty small scale battle against some street gang and it didn't last very long, but it did manage to spark my interest in what's to come. The second arc was a battle against another branch within the same family, which was a decent arc, but it lasted longer than it needed to. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in this series becomes especially slow in the third arc that's actually a saga which ended up taking most of the duration of the show and contained fillers within that saga. Granted there weren't that many fillers, but some weren't even action oriented and actually contained more episodic comedy. Meaning, the introduction episodes come back to haunt us later in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself, is pretty basic shonen stuff, but despite having no clear end goal it did manage to throw in twists along the way that kept me interested. It wasn't mind blowing or anything, but it did use its own plot elements and the side stories it threw in surprisingly well. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the end of this big saga is also the end of the series and it left things open. Though I haven't read the manga, I've heard that nobody liked where it ended and that the upcoming arc was pretty bad anyways. So I guess it might as well have ended there.\\n\\n\r\n*Characters*\\n\\n\r\nTsuna, the main character has a good heart, but is basically a spineless individual who's in need to become stronger. This also demonstrates how the author wanted to do something different from the usual shonen. You see, in most long running shonen we already get a character who's fully developed to what is necessary for a shonen protagonist. They're strong willed, positive and never run away from a fight (Goku, Luffy, Naruto, etc').. So all that's left for them to develop, is their physical strength, not their personality. In this case however, the protagonist needs to strengthen his personality, adapt to the Mafia life style and become skilled in battle. This is excellent, and it also distracts you from the fact that the story doesn't have much of a goal beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the main character, the rest of the cast don't develop and are your basic two dimensional shonen characters with very silly quirks\u2026. But! They are also very likable and their chemistry together is quite good. The thing that seems to be consistent among them is that they all take their personality quirk or hobby to an extreme. For example, Gokudera will protect Tsuna to the death if necessary, Hibari will discipline his school mates by any means , Yamamoto will always be the positive moral booster no matter what, etc, etc. This might sound cheap but this is exactly what makes them so well defined and fun to watch interact.\\n\r\nEven a lot of the villains have somewhat interesting quirks and personalities as well..\\n\\n\r\nAfter the introduction episodes though the amount of comedy in the series drops significantly until there's almost none at all and there was very little use for the characters' quirks from a point on. The tone of the show changes completely in the big saga and it obviously didn't know how to balance it out. This shift in tone becomes especially noticeable when the episodic comedy fillers come back later in the series in the middle of the saga, reminding you of what the show used to be like.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing about the rest of the cast, despite being very quirky (and having interesting and funny quirks, not half assed ones) none of them seemed to get a proper backstory, with one exception being the fans favorite, Gokudera (admittedly, he's also my favorite). Don't get me wrong they all have some sort of background, but none of them get an entire episode flashback of a tragic backstory dedicated to them, if I recall (you may correct me if I'm wrong here, it's been a few years since I've watched it), which is strange since nobody in the cast seems to be more important than someone else as far the story is concerned.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, much like in Bleach, the amount of characters start to pile up from a point on and it feels like there were way too many for the show to handle. This is problematic, but I don't think it was handled that badly, all things considered.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all the characters are kinda like characters out of a Saturday morning cartoon (which is what Reborn is, in Japan, heh heh) and I don't mean that as an insult, it's actually interesting to have such silly characters in a semi serious story. It's too bad their lighthearted nature wasn't fully and consistently present and that most lack any kind of depth.\\n\\n\r\n*Art*\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs demonstrate that this is a female mangaka more than anything else. Every male character looks like a super model. The designs style is somewhat original though, since I immediately recognized it on a cover of a completely different anime (Psycho-Pass). So I guess it's not that bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation though is pretty simplistic and despite being an action anime there isn't all that much action to look forward to either. There are decent battles in it, sure, but not that many. And most of them aren't that great. You can even go back more than 20 years and find better battles in both DBZ and Yu Yu Hakusho, to be perfectly honest (both in quantity and quality).\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention, In the last quarter of the series, the fighting's style changes into\u2026 something else that I can't reveal, because spoilers\u2026 But it will depend entirely on your preference whether you like that change or not.\\n\\n\r\n*Sound*\\n\\n\r\nI don't know Japanese, but I think the voice acting is quite good with a bunch of distinct and funny voices that fit quite perfectly with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are pretty basic though and the soundtrack is ok, I guess, but it isn't the most memorable one, despite being used throughout 200 episodes. Some of the tracks sound a little like Rocky knock offs as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are mostly pop songs and boy bands. Granted, some are decent, but others take Engrish to levels that make it sound completely retarded. So this might be distracting and/or hilarious, assuming you speak English. \\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment*\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy it for its characters, but I was watching it while it was airing, so the terribly slow pacing really got to me at points. Especially since there were a lot of (canon) episodes where almost nothing happened. \\n\\n\r\n*Overall* 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nHeck, maybe this score is a little generous considering how much I trashed it, mainly since I still kinda liked it somehow. \\n\r\nIf there's one thing you should know about Reborn is that it's definitely not soulless. There are certainly much better shonen out there, but there's also much worse, in my humble opinion. And I'm sure the author really was trying her best.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

            "content": "My first impression of Hitman Reborn is that it is a very annoying anime. There are 3 little kid characters in the anime that have voices that are so high pitched and irritating. Imagine hearing those sounds on your noise cancellation earphones. But i was soon to be proven wrong.\r\nStory\r\nThe story progresses quite slowly in the beginning 10-15 episodes. The first part of the series shows the relationship between Reborn and the protaganist, Tsuna. And it also gives an idea on the training that Tsuna will go through later in the series. These are mainly repetitive and give us a feeling of lame fillers. However,i must urge you to bear with the first few episodes and continue on. Because later on in the series (when Tsuna and pals begin their training), will the real story begin. The real story includes boss fights and show how bonds later in the arc are formed, and make for me a very interesting watch. Later on will be a few more filler episodes, then towards the next arc - which has yet to complete its airing - but promises to not disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nMany of the characters in the series are 'babies' or kids, so the art tends toward chibi styled characters. For the rest of the characters, the art is quite simple but very likable. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNothing much to be said in this section, but the first op was nothing to rave about. But the second and third op were much better, and so were the ending songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe series follow through the experiences of the main protagonist. And it shows how he grows from a friendless useless boy to one with a 'family' and a will to protect them. Later in the series, the irritating kids i referred to in the beginning prove themselves useful and become likable characters. Tsuna (main character) is developed very well in this series, but i must express my disappointment that other characters are not developed that well yet. Especially Hibari and Yamamoto. However, this may be due to the series not having been completed, and we may see more of their development in the future.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAside from being slightly annoyed in the beginning of the episode, i feel that the main arcs of the story were very enjoyable. I do not encourage forwarding of episodes, or skipping episodes, but for the bulk of the first few episodes you may choose to do so.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI liked this anime quite a lot. It is not my favorite anime out there, but I most certainly did not regret picking up this series.",

            "content": "Never judge a book by its cover. The first time I watched this anime, I only saw about three or so minutes of the first episode before I gave up on it. Yes, the reason was partly to do with the animation of Reborn, I was like o_0 before deciding not to watch it... After a period of time, I decided to give it a try again after one of my friends watched it and recommended it. The 180+ episodes was daunting as I settled down to actually watch anime and see why it was so popular. \r\nNineteen episodes later I was wondering why Iwas still watching it, the main character was a total let down, Tsuna's wimpy personality really turned me off. I really considered dropping it again, but then the next episode came on, and finally something interesting happens. It was all uphill from there and I /loved/ it. \\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10) - Be warned, if you're looking for an anime with actual mafia fighting and stuff in it, this probably isn't what you want. This anime is more humour/friendship/a tad bit fantastical. There's not much gang/mafia/crimminal related activities going on, and if so it's sort of more light-hearted. You wouldn't take it seriously. \\n\\n\r\n I won't bore you with a summary, there's already one which sufficiently describes the main gist of it without spoiling the anime. Like a lot of animes which have been going on for a while (eg. Bleach, Naruto), the plot is slow-moving. The fight scenes are long and drawn out, and sometimes I find myself skipping ahead only to find I haven't missed that much after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is so-and-so. There are some arcs I like, and some, well, not so much. Thankfully, unlike Bleach and Naruto, KHR doesn't have as many filler arcs, and on the occasion, there's usually one or two fillers in between arcs before the story dives right into the plotline again. What shocked me the most, however is that the two filler arcs are my favourite out of the whole thing! They were enjoyable and interesting, unlike most fillers and I didn't even know they were fillers until I looked up some episode information. They were /that/ good. Plus, it was interesting seeing the first Vongola family.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) - Is well drawn, the guys are gorgeous (especially Tsuna in Dying Will mode *drool* and Giotto) There's not much I can critique about the art really, I've seen better definitely, but it is good enough to satisfy me. One thing which takes a while to get used to is Reborn however due to the style, but you get used to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10) - I didn't really like the voice actor for Tsuna... especially when he started to whine, it really grated on my nerves. But all in all, once I got used to that everything else was fine. The soundtrack is pretty awesome and I love the current opening theme \"Listen to the Stereo\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10) - KHR has a large, very unique cast. Each character has his/her own back story and I really liked the character development of all the characters, most specifically Tsuna. Wimpy personality aside, he is a very instersting character and he grows and matures a lot as the story progresses. Tsuna may be a wimp, but he has a kind heart and would do anything to protect his friends. It is really interesting to watch how he changes the characters around him change as they interact with him and he doesn't even realise it! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10) - The only two reasons this isn't getting a 10 is because I hate the pace of the show, it's too drawn out and you get bored of it. The episode recaps are annoying as well, they take about five whole minutes to recap what happened previously. That's about a fifth of the episode gone already! Grr\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10) - I give it a 'very good'. Definitely worth watching if you enjoy shounen animes and have the time to. At currently 200 episodes, it is a little daunting to start, but once you start getting into it you hardly notice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy,\\n\r\n-animeangel105",

            "content": "I have mixed feelings reviewing this show. On the one hand it is hands down one of my absolute favorites. On the other hand it really isn't what I would call amazing. Initially when I first started watching it, I was bored half to death and dropped it after two or so episodes. I got back into it after encountering a few reviews praising it, so I decided to give it another shot. After making it past the first grueling 20 episodes, the plot went into high gear and sucked me in like a kid discovering candy for the first time. For many yearsI praised it as my favorite anime, and while I still love it, I can't fairly give it a score higher than 8.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is very intriguing and very unique which is why I give it so much credit. The problem with katekyo hitman reborn, or KHR for short, is the execution. Up until the third major arc, there weren't many things that I could complain about. The ending to the third arc is where my problem with this series begins. The whole ending sequence, leading up to the fourth arc but that isn't covered in the anime, is nothing short of a deus ex machina. It really rubbed me the wrong way and while I still harbor lots of love for this series I couldn't forgive it. The plot is clever at some points, although the later plot holes counteract the good parts about it. \\n\\n\r\nNot regarding the story but the show's pacing, there were times when the pacing was rocky, some parts seeming too short and others entirely too long (i.e the first 20 episodes) some arcs being comprised entirely of fillers(more towards halfway through the series and it seems very oddly placed and very easy to identify even without prior knowledge from the manga) and while I know this is because of the anime catching up to the manga it really doesn't excuse it for the bad quality pacing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting was great all around, the voices very distinctive and easy to identify. They all showed their character's quirks very well and I can't really think of a single person who didn't stand out when they were on screen.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art starts off lackluster, not very good but not very bad, and in some parts absolutely terrible, but the gradual increase of quality is very evident as the show goes on. By the end of the series I thought it to be some of the cleanest art I had seen in a while. The only gripe I have with it is that many of the female characters look way too similar to each other.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is the category in which KHR shines. The characters are lovable, fun, and more importantly, well done. Even the villains have a certain quality to them that made it impossible for me to hate them. This can also cause a problem because I could never truly feel hatred towards the villains. Despite not getting too much information on a lot of the characters, you still feel like you know them well and hardly any of their actions come as a surprise. There is one major flaw in the characterizations. The way women are portrayed, although not all of them, makes them seem pretty useless. While I didn't have any problem with this at first since I mostly focused on the guys anyway, it became really apparent later on in the series. I know for all intensive purposes that they were never the focus of the story but I would have preferred it if they didn't have the girls around whatsoever instead of having them there as liabilities. Chrome is the prime example, whom somehow manages to get herself in dangerous situations and always has to be saved. For this reason I can't give this category a higher score.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed this show, having watched it at least three times in a few years time which is almost unheard of from me. It was always fun to watch it back then and it still is, even if I don't take it as seriously as I once did.\\n\\n\r\nKHR is one of those few rare series that can capture your heart despite all of its imperfections. It isn't a show to be taken too seriously, even if it has its serious moments it doesn't feel as threatening and dangerous as shows with a much darker mood, but it doesn't detract anything from the enjoyment. If anything I would say it is a series to be watched for the sheer fun of it and not for the plot. If you're looking for a show with action, comedy, crazy characters, and something that's just all around fun, then this is something you should definitely watch. Otherwise you might not enjoy this much. It's best to watch this anime without thinking too deeply into it or you may find yourself raging a bit at the ending.\\n",

            "content": "(very minor spoilers involving ep. 74+)\r\nReborn is a series that starts out with filler. Absurb, badly written, yet sometimes decently funny. That's right, the series STARTS with filler. The filler is used to make the characters seem developed, creative, and awesome by the first, SIX EPISODE story arc. Then, there is more filler. This filler is largely just there to keep the comedic stuff of the first season going. It fills the niche NORMAL filler does, in the sense that it's kinda cool to see characters we just saw in a serious conflict, have fun with random hilarity. \r\nThen the first REAL arc starts, onethat actually is a huge chunk of episodes. The character development and portrayal is still bang-on. But the story is horribly weak and filled with holes. Giant, pot-holes that like on a highway almost DARE you to slow down at risk of falling into them. And that's where the series kinda fails. If you think, even for a minute about the plot, your brain will melt. It's not a bad plot, there are worse *cough*naruto*cough* but it's just.... cliche despite the mobster theme and just kinda meehhhh.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we get MORE FILLER. But at this point, if you have made it this far, your brain will have melted, and you slog through it soaking up granules of entertainment with your mind wiped tendrills. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then finally, we get to where I am now. Essentially, like taking the characters from filler, to a standard shounen fight arc; we have taken the characters, and thrown them into a standard &quot;Shounen+&quot; anime. For a quick definition, I consider shows like D.Gray man, FMA, and Soul Eater, &quot;Shounen+&quot; Basically, I mean it's still shouneny fights and all that, but the tone, storyline(kinda), and characters are those you see in what anime fans would call &quot;Real Anime.&quot; And, so far, it seems really interesting. It's almost like 73 episodes were just leading up to the real series. It's a 10 year time skip, but over half the cast are from pre-time skip, which is actually a very unique dynamic. \\n\\n\r\nI won't really discuss the characters, but they are all actually fairly well written and developed. It IS a shounen though, so don't expect FMA or Trigun level personal trauma or anything. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, the series is about taking Shounen Characters who exist in a filler comedic world, and inserting standard fight-manga plot devices at them at random intervals, followed by shoving them into a show which seems like something out of Shakugan no Shana or a *good* My-hime or something. \\n\\n\r\nSo, would I recommend it? (Warning: The below may not be anywhere near a proper review in subject matter, tone, or writing in general)\\n\\n\\n\r\nABSOLUTELY NOT\\n\\n\\n\r\n73 episodes to get to something awesome?! Go watch Soul Eater if you havn't it's like the greatest thing ever, and it doesn't have creepy babies which you are forced to love. Reborn is a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE curse. You hate it, and hate it, but then you watch a bit more, and then you watch more in the hopes that something will happen. You don't know why, but you do. Stay away, keep your time and energy for better series, hobbies, raising your social links, hell, even h-games i don't care. Just don't make the same mistake I have unless you really don't mind all the issues I said, and you just LOVE super deformed super babies and shounen fight characters.",

            "content": "Just recently I finished watching the 'Katekyo Hitman Reborn' anime. This is an Anime that has the reputation for being a late bloomer, and I certainly agree with this notion.\r\nWhen I started watching the show the episodes were funny at first, but it got  repetitive pretty fast after the main characters were introduced. The story and the character development slows down and the episodes are the same thing over and over again. (could be filler though)\r\nI even dropped the anime for a while. But I kept reading stories about how it gets better in later episodes, and it did!\r\nStory: 8\r\nI can understand that someonewould drop this anime if he or she would only watch the first 20-something episodes. The story has a really slow start. But slowly it will get better as the story progresses further. It even gets pretty awesome after a while, but sometimes the references and the comparison too the First Vongola boss an his group were a bit too overwhelming for me. \\n\r\nThe ending was also disappointing and unsatisfying. I guess the show was canceled or something.\\n\r\nI would have given the story a 9 if it wasn't for these minor irritations and the weak ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nI'm really not the one to notice small changes in the animation details, so don't expect me to be to critical about the art.\\n\r\nI would say 'Katekyo Hitman Reborn' has an average looking animation for an 200+ anime. There were no real high or low points, the show was pretty consistent with its animation. I give it a 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe voice actors and the SFX were on point. There were no real moments in the show for the voice actors to shine, but they remained consistent throughout. The SFX did his job of providing extra impact to what was happening in the show. \\n\r\nThe overall sound quality is what you would expect from a TV show, good, and nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nI loved the design and personalities of most of the characters. \\n\r\nI already explained that the references too the first Vongola where a bit overwhelming. This is especially the case with the character design of Vongola I, and his guardians. I get that the main protagonist could look similar too his predecessor, because of family ties. But it bothered me that everyone of the Vongola X guardians look similar to their predecessors. \\n\r\nBut besides this minor irritation, the characters were awesome. I especially liked the characters, Yamamoto Takeshi and Fran/Flan from the Future Varia. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show greatly when it got serious. But because it took a while, the start was very poor. At first the jokes were fun. But when you have seen a joke multiple times, it isn't that funny anymore. Later on in the show, it creates better moments for itself to use some comical relief. The seriousness causes a better mixture between the humor and the action, with some hilarious moments as result.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nBecause the later episodes are still more fresh for me than the beginning ones, I originally wanted to give this show a 9. But I most not forget the things I didn't like. Things like the slow story development in the beginning and the sloppy ending brings down my \"original\" overall rating. I soon came to the conclusion to give this show a 7. It had the potential to be very good if hadn't such a slow start. And it could have been a great one if they had wrapped up the show with a more proper ending.",

            "content": "Hitman Reborn was initially recommended to me by my friend. However the story looked dull and uninteresting to me, and I was also not sure if I would like it (I watch anime like Bleach, DGrayMan etc.) Thus I started off with the manga. The first thing I thought when I read the manga was \"WTH is with that stupid looking baby? The main character is also so badly drawn!\" However, after reading a few chapters, I got hooked and finished 100+ chapters in a day. I decided to give the anime a try, as I wanted to see how well the characters could bebrought to life.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe only thing that prevented me from giving a 10/10 was that the story took waaaaaaay too long to start! Sure, the first 20 episodes were amusing and had me cracked up, but there was no real storyline to it. The anime was also inferior to the manga in my opinion, as they had more fillers and also took out the guns and knives (and Tsuna's reactions to them) that would have made the whole thing even more hilarious. However after that the real action starts, which had me hooked all the way! The storyline is extremely unique, and Tsuna's irritating underwear transformation thing became less frequent, and finally disappeared altogether :D It is also way different from most shonen anime, which usually only consists of blind fighting and no development at all. In all, an amazing storyline! (After the first 20 episodes, that is, but don't skip till there, have a look at the characters!) :DD\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI would give it an 8/10, as the characters in my opinion were not very well drawn. The characters usually look fine, however weird if shown from different angles. However the animation was okay, the fighting scenes were well animated, and I especially enjoyed looking at Tsuna's weird faces whenever Reborn is up to his antics again x)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIn my opinion the OPs were the BEST! Drawing days (First OP) had me addicted the first time I listened to it. Except for OP3 (Jumping Days I think), I just didn't like it at all D: The voices for the characters in my opinion were well matched and I just loooooooove them, but Tsuna's voice is still a little weird to me (Too high I guess). The BGM, however, was AMAZING. It totally brings out the mood in whatever is happening and will have you paying attention to it in spite of the action going on! Each character's theme was also awesome, especially Hibari and Gokudera's theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIn all, the characters were what makes Reborn a kickass anime! :DDDD It is amazing how some characters who only appeared for comic reliefs could get so serious and awesome whenever they needed to! The way the characters have matured is the main factor that kept me hooked onto the series. The transitioning is so subtle, you wouldn't even notice how much they've grown until you think back and remember how they used to be (Remember whiny old Tsuna?) The different personalities that match each of the characters and the way they follow such an unlikely boss is truly cool! :DDDD\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed Reborn as a whole, except for the first 20 episodes (It's TWENTY hello) but the storyline and arcs later on made up for it, and also the character's ridiculous antics which really give the series a light feeling, yet serious when needed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're looking for a new anime to watch, try Hitman Reborn! It may seem boring at first, but persevere on! Until the main story starts, there is a good chance that you'll be hooked too :D And the storyline is amazingly unique, I've never seen any anime like it before xD \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Katekyo Hitman Reborn is an outstandingly well made anime. I definitely recommend that you watch it if comedy and action applies to your genre of choice.\nAt first glance, Katekyo Hitman Reborn may seem boring. The major flaw of the anime is that it absolutely misleads you, and it completely deceives you into either a) dropping the anime or b) thinking the anime is lame, when it isn't! \nThe first 20 episodes may mislead you to drop the anime, just like it misled me, because of its fillerlike episodes. You will most likely tell yourself \"Wow, this is really lame. What's the point of all this?\"That's what I thought, but I gave it a chance. (And I'm SO glad I did. Katekyo Hitman Reborn is now my absolute favorite anime.)\\n\\n\nThe beginning is kind of slow and different from the rest of the later episodes, because apparently KHR was initially meant to be a gag anime - it was supposed to be something funny and comedic. The anime took a different turn as you progress to episode 20 into something more serious.\\n\\n\nThe first 20 episodes is merely a /long/ introduction to the anime. It's worth watching though, because you get to be familiar with all the characters. They are all likeable! If you decide to watch Katekyo Hitman Reborn (and I hope you will!) you should decide whether you like it or not, after 25 episodes or so. It's only fair, right? All animes have their flaws; and it's flaw, in my opinion is that they don't give it a decent start. If you do not have the patience for that, then this anime may not be for you. \\n\\n\nStoryline:\\n\nKatekyo Hitman Reborn deals with the mafia. Tsuna, the *main* character, is in the next line to be the 10th boss for the Vongola Family~ (one of the many families in the mafia.) Reborn, a hitman, and also a baby (hehe), travels from Italy to Japan to tutor Tsuna to become a worthy boss for the Vongola Family.\\n\nFrom then on, Tsuna's adventures and what he experiences are endless-- but they're all interesting. Over the course of the anime, Tsuna grows and matures, and becomes really strong; fighting his enemies and getting stronger each fight he experiences. The fights he encounters are well made, and they WILL keep you at the edge of your seat. Tsuna isn't the only one fighting, though-- he also has a \"family\"-- his comrades, if you will, and the battles they encounter are endless. \\n\\n\nArt:\\n\nThe art is well made; I don't think there is much to complain about it.\\n\nIt isn't outstandingly good, nor is it horribly bad to a point where you have to shield your eyes. The characters are wonderfully drawn and are all unique in their own ways. The art progressively gets better as you further get into the anime.\\n\\n\nSound:\\n\nThe sound is absolutely AMAZING. It deserves an 11/10, as opposed to a 10/10.\\n\nI loved all of the openings, and endings-- I never once had to skip it; and that's kind of rare, considering the fact that I'm absolutely picky with my music.\\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing as well, there is a couple of them for EACH character (well, the main characters, anyways.)\\n\nThey have a soundtrack for every different scene in the anime, and it is absolutely positively pleasing to the ears. Everything about it is EPIC!\\n\\n\nCharacter:\\n\nThe characters are very well portrayed; you can't help but love all of them (well most of them anyways.) They change greatly over the course of the anime and it's worthwhile to watch them grow up.\\n\\n\nEnjoyment:\\n\nI love Katekyo Hitman Reborn! I love everything about it; it makes me laugh until I fall off my seat and look like a loser, it makes me sad as they go through their hard times, it makes me happy as they overcome their obstacles-- and so on.\\n\nI can ramble on forever about how much I love the anime, but I'm going to end now, before I end up typing a ten page paper.\\n\\n\nOverall:\\n\nKatekyo Hitman Reborn is an AMAZING anime as I mentioned a billion times (well not really, but let's pretend.) I highly suggest that you go off and watch it right now, but I can't tell you what to do. It's ultimately up to you.\\n\nEverything about it is amazing- it's storyline, (although it may seem boring at first) it's art, it's sound, it's characters-- it's everything!",

            "content": "Story - 8\r\nHitman Reborn is a pretty unique anime in my opinion. There is one major flaw in the story that prevents me from giving it a full 10. The first 20 episodes or so have no real story arc. While each episode is interesting and helps develop the characters it takes way too long for the story to truly begin. But I will say this. The story arc in this anime is top notch. Once you get to episode 20+ you will be watching the episodes one after another after another. I am anxiously biting my fingernails waiting for the next episodes to besubbed!\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Hitman Reborn is decent. The lame underwear morph on every episode for a while is what brings the grade down a bit, but Tsuna begins to look awesome about 25 episodes in, when the underwear morph becomes not so common and is replaced by something else. The other characters are also drawn very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Hitman Reborn is awesome both opening and ending songs. The japanese voices all fit the characters as well. The only reason sound isn't a 10 is because of Tsuna's voice in underwear mode. It gets so annoying during the  few long sequences.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are all unique, with a wide range of personalities all following an unlikely protagonist. Quite frankly i'm jealous of Tsuna. Hes got the perfect range of friends all with flaws that fit the characters as well as strong loyalty to him. The characters couldn't be more enjoyalble. (Save for Tsuna in underwear mode) (Lets face it Underwear mode sucks >.> Thankfully it practically disappears entirely once the true story arc starts.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately Hitman Reborn loses 2 points here because of how long it takes to get rolling. It seriously has much too long of an introduction phase. If I were to rewatch Hitman Reborn I would start around episode 15 or so. That way you can get a memory of the characters before the story starts. You wont miss practically anything and you'll be loving Hitman Reborn from the start.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall Hitman Reborn gets a 9. It truly is an awesome anime that will keep you hungering for more once it gets rolling.",

            "content": "&ldquo;WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THAT LITTLE CHIBI DUDE?&rdquo; I thought to myself when I watched the first episode of Kateikyoushi Hitman Reborn! aka Katekyo Hitman Reborn. What was with the really silly protagonist? Why was he such a wimp and loser? And what was with his weird &ldquo;transformation?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s so bloody revolting and crazy. I thought that the anime was on crack&hellip; Seven months later, I took the advice of a friend and decided to give this anime a second chance. \r\nAfter the second episode and a bit of my own research for random other information and media of the series, I fell inlove. I also was VERY addicted. I became current with the series in four days; I even endured a rough night and watched 20episodes in one sitting. Anyways, arhem. Let me go into further detail of how my fanaticism for this series began.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, well, I actually thought the first few episodes were rather ridiculous, still. I kept on watching them, though. I mean, who can turn down a Mafia-based anime, anyway? Episodes, nevertheless, turned out to be so incredibly ridiculous that I just had to watch more and more because of the hilarity and comedy I found within the first twenty episodes. To my surprise, I really could not give up on any of the &ldquo;Filler&rdquo; episodes or beginning episodes because I was already hooked on the craziness of the series. And although the beginning got way too episodic and &ldquo;lame&rdquo; (e.g. like Bleach, D. Gray-Man, and Naruto), I did not give up hope for the series to improve and for the story to develop. The beginning helped create a very fine atmosphere and background for the lifestyles of the protagonists. Once the plot began to reach its first &ldquo;arc,&rdquo; or main story, I was amazed by the sudden turn of events. It was a very pleasant surprise to find the main characters undertaking actions to carrying out a rather &ldquo;dangerous task.&rdquo; After the arc finishes, there are a couple &ldquo;Filler&rdquo; episodes but, they do not entirely intend to act as such because they do develop towards the next arc. The second arc is full of great action and thrill. As of right now, it is still underway. And, as I write this review, I am very anxious to watch more! \\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Wanted to revise this a bit... since I've watched 42more episodes... my impressions of the anime have slightly changed... I'm still a die-hard fan of the series, I have to say... the storyline has indeed slowed down after the second arc, and well... Filler episodes became a bit more trivial and useless... Regardless, it's been on track again to a third arc for the last few episodes. And yet the annoying thing is that, as some people have said, there's always a flashback to what's happened so far... Like from in Bleach. And so, the plot has slowed down tremendously... The characters are still very original and entertaining to observe in developments, though... All other aspects are still very true, though. :P So be sure to keep with this series for it's uniqueness in many other aspects and well general theme. :P\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason why I love this series is obviously because of the character development and portrayal. The characters are all just so amazing and cool in their own special ways. Each character possesses a unique and different personality from every other character. From the first impressions of each character, I was rather disgusted. But upon learning more about each character in time, I grew to love each and every character because they each had a special charm or trait that seemed very personal and almost real. I felt very connected to several characters. Furthermore, the character development was not slow at all. Okay, there were a couple cases where the character flash-backs got a bit tedious to watch, but there were sufficient amounts of information to obtain in the meanwhile, so I was not too frustrated with them. Then, information given about the characters were developed into the story in a rather formal and thorough manner which I felt was effective for letting me know about each character. As for a few characters, I have felt (and sometimes still feel) a bit irked by them and their funky and somewhat &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; irritating personalities. However, as the story has progressed, I want to say that the characters have grown on me. And now, I appreciate the existence of every one of the characters, and hope to watch (and read) more about them all.\\n\\n\r\nWhat also helped me get more into the anime was the animation. Initially, I found it a bit funky, but I watched more and began to realize it was actually pretty impressive. The graphics have been, for the most part, to my standards at least, above par. Everything was quite thoroughly illustrated and never too flashy, abrupt, and messed up. Action scenes were detailed and well scripted and screened. The art styles were well designed, too. I found that the characters and settings did not lack too many details from the original artwork. \\n\\n\r\nNow as for the music&hellip; I loved all the sounds! &lt;3\\n\r\nAs in, I have listened to the soundtracks and opening and ending theme songs of the series so many times that I think it may be too excessive. I don&rsquo;t recall too much insert music, but that does not take away from the series since the other sound effects and background music have suited well for all the situations and scenarios of the anime. Sometimes, the music gets a bit wacky, but those are obviously for the funny situations that are in the anime. For the fight scenes, there is more than reasonable usage for action music. Thrills and suspense are well built into scenarios due to the special styles of background music used. Special other sounds are also very appropriated &ldquo;placed&rdquo; throughout the series. From the countless times I&rsquo;ve listened to each and every theme song used, I still cannot get enough of the fabulousness of each song. I enjoyed the opening theme songs so much that I had to watch them all for every episode that I watched in the last four days. Now, yes as much of a waste of time that might have been, I could not get enough of it. The &ldquo;shot&rdquo; selections used during the theme songs were neither that great nor that terrible, but I found that they worked fine. And, as long as the songs are good and the shots used are not that revealing nor weird, I could deal with it.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, I found that the animation company that produces this series was able to pull through every episode very well. I did not feel like they wasted much of my watching time at all because everything seemed at least 25% relevant to the story if not also sparked my interest in watching more. Really, I felt that the plot has moved at a very steady pace that still stirs anxiety and curiosity because of major cliffhangers. I cannot get enough of this series. This is one amazing manga series that has been adapted into an anime that has lead me to enjoy the story in a very wonderful and exciting way. For a load of laughter, adventure, and action, be sure to give this anime a try.",

            "content": "In the last ten years, there has been a significant decline in the style of shonen action anime. I went from growing up with gritty titles like Bio-Booster Armour Guyver and Fist of the North Star, to over-marketed fan service like Bleach and Soul Eater. I'll put the \"old anime guy\" rant aside for sake of this review, which is a show that isn't too different from the aformentioned titles.\r\n Katekyo Hitman Reborn is not a very good anime. It isn't, but it's also not the worst I've ever seen. This anime had potential to be moderately decent, but suffers from most of the sameproblems that hindered Bleach into a tailspin. I wanted to wait until I reached the future story arc before I wrote my review for this show, as this was apparently the money storyline. Admittedly, I wanted to see just what this was about. Now that I'm about halfway through KHR, I have just what I need to write a proper review for this. I'll break it into the good and bad of Katekyo Hitman Reborn.\\n\\n\r\n[THE BAD]\\n\r\nTHE ACTION: While it's not as bad as Bleach, the fighting is just as obnoxious and probably sillier. Battles used to mean something in action shows, now they have dissolved into the method of following in Dragonball Z's footsteps: forget about subtext and just make your fight as loud as possible. It's bad enough that the skills these characters use look completely ridiculous, even by shonen standards, but they could've been utilized on a level that wasn't brain-numblingly stupid. I'll fix some of the stupidest ones right now.\\n\r\n1. Bianchi's Poison Cooking: Would it have been that hard to just have her vex someone's coffee with arsnic instead of producing plates of food out of thin air and shoving it in someones' face? It's hard for me to take this even remotely serious when you model a fighting style I've seen in Looney Tunes.\\n\r\n2. Get Rid of the Boxes: Really? Amano was so out of ideas, he had to rip a bit from a 13 year-old kid's show that already spawned a generation of Pocket Monster knockoffs? This gimmick was incorporated to increase it's female fanbase, because it's cute when Hibari summons a spiky hedgehog. That's fair game in my book; you need to increase your demographic, fine. But what's infuriating is the fact that every cast member that fights already has an established fighting style. Adding this only makes the fights more overbooked and complicated than they already are. It's such a cheap plug for a card game, I was expecting a starter deck to pop out of my C drive.\\n\r\n3. XanXus' Jet Handguns: Ben 10 is calling, and Heatblast wants his powers back.\\n\\n\r\nTHE COMEDY: Comic relief doesn't work when every single character has a satirical shtick. By trying to make every character funny, the jokes don't bounce off anyone, and you just have method actors reading catchphrases. \\n\r\n \"Gotta....stay...calm\"\\n\r\n\"ROMEOOOOO!!!\"\\n\r\n\"TO THE EXTREME!!\"\\n\r\n\"I'll bite you to death\"\\n\r\n\"I'm the Tenth's right hand man\"\\n\r\n\"Ku fufu\"\\n\r\n\"I have to deliver these noodles\"\\n\r\n This is overkill. These jokes are repeated anytime one of these acts are on the screen, and they are long past being fresh. Actually, to call them jokes would be insinuating that they were at some point funny. Without a balanced set of personalities (a catalyst, the butt of the joke, an instigator, and a straight man), humor doesn't work. Since there's no set up or punchline, the characters just scream at each other all day, and it's grating. How many times does Gokudera need to double over in agony after seeing Bianchi? Dr. Shamal wasn't funny back when he was Master Roshi. And Ipin's forehaed bomb is about as amusing as a root canal. The only character that truly makes me laugh is Haru Miura. More on her later.\\n\\n\r\nTHE PLOT PACING: The story(s) are slighty better than I would expect, but nothing above moderate. In fact, the plot could be a lot better if everything wasn't so drawn out and uninteresting. I won't harp on the endless amounts of filler (it's become almost a necessary evil in anime today), but rather the parts where things are supposed to be happening, but it prolongs simple development to the point where it grinds to a halt. Not a spoiler, during the Millefiore raid, Gokudera actually wants to STOP THE ATTACK so Yamamoto can talk about the Arcabaleno. Top it off with the fact that everything seems like it's kept a secret from the audience when it's just another new character reveal. Byankuan (I think I butchered that name) is supposed to be the main antagonist, but they have not given me a reason to hate him. It's becoming a pet peeve of mine when bad guys now just sit in chairs and LOOK evil instead of doing villainous deeds. They told me he runs a very powerful Family that can crush the Vongolas in 23 seconds, but has failed to alluminate on that, instead telling me how animals kept in boxes can turn the tide in a battle. On a side note, I think the Black Spell and White Spell guys look too much like Soul Reapers and Arrancars for my taste. It's just another stark reminder as to how little thought gets put into these franchises when four sets of cast members in two different shows dress exactly alike. Pitiful.\\n\\n\r\n[THE GOOD]\\n\r\n TSUNAYOSHI SAWADA: I never thought this would happen, and it took awhile, but Tsuna is actually a pretty acceptable main character. He's no Gon Freeces in Hunter X Hunter, but in today's age of shonen leads being just completely intolerable jackasses and ignorant A-holes, Tsuna is a significant upgrade from Ichigo Kurosaki and Ryoma Echizen in Prince of Tennis. Yes, he's whiny, whimpy, and seemingly \"no-good\", but the real lighting-in-a-bottle of a character like this is watching them grow up before your eyes. it's what I loved about Gohan, though the saiyan's road is far more memorable and cohesive, Tsuna's metamorphosis into an independent pillar of valor is a something I can take away as a mild success from this. He's incredibly down to earth as well. All he wants is to win the affections of Kyoko, yet his own fantasies about marrying her and impressing her are so low-barred, it's like his brain is actually telling him he can't do it. I find that a little refreshing. To grade him on a letter scale, I'd give him a C average.\\n\\n\r\n THE GIRLS: I always get the impression that shonen authors don't like to write female characters, what with the way they all follow the familiar pattern of being completely bitchy, nagging, hostile shrews like Bulma, and good ladies in shonen like Rukia get shelved and taken out of the show for episodes on end. The female cast of Hitman Reborn has been one of the reasons I made it as far as I have. While this mainly pretains to Kyoko and Haru (Lal Mirch and Chrome aren't presented enough at the point I'm at. Especially poor Chrome, she's the worst treated character in the whole franchise), I really like Tsuna's mother and even Bianchi has moments when she plays the big sister to the others. But man, Haru Miura has become one of my favorite supporting characters ever. Her off-beat wackiness, unpredictable sense of style, and unbridled enthusiasum picks me up everytime I got the urge to drop this show and became the heart and soul of KHR for me. her cheery theme music is like a Phoenix Down being dropped on my head after one of those silly box battles. The only other character to breathe this much life into something that didn't seem that good at first was Hime in Princess Resurrection last year, and that's now one of the best titles I'm currently reading. The ladies in KHR are always a healthy break away from the stupidity of the fighting and hackneyed dialouge, and are the best girls going in shonen for me today.\\n\\n\r\nNOSTALGIA: While the humor fails and a good chunk of potential character development gets lost in the mundane battles, KHR has a certain feel about it that hearkens back to the classic days of shonen action series. The characters, while paper thin for the most part, are seemingly vibrant and full of life, like Yu Yu Hakusho or Power Stone. The setting and envoirnment isn't always dark and gritty like in Naruto or Bleach, and stays lighthearted enough to be a tongue-in-cheek action show, even if it is a little bit long. The intensity of the plot kind of picks up when a villian shows up, even if they lose steam halfway through the arc. If this show had come out in 1998, heck, even 2002, I would've fallen in love with it because it retains a glimmer of the spirit that most shonen titles lack nowadays, and that all I ask from this genre. Not Shippuuden.\\n\\n\r\nIN CLOSING: This was long winded review, and I apologize. I can only hope the readers understand my frustration with thinking out a meticulous review for a show that's almost down the middle, it's not a \"bad\" 5. This was a mixed bag for me. There's a lot I really hate about this show that I can relate to other shonen title mentioned in this review and probably rant about for another eight paragraphs, and while the bad outweighs the good, it comes down to quality of the good over quantity of the bad, and those elements have kept me watching KHR for over 100+ episodes, and is a testament to doing just enough right to keep me entertained. I can't say the same for Bleach and Naruto, which I'll never finish.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 4\\n\r\nART: 7\\n\r\nSOUND: 6\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 3\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 5\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE: 5 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nPROS: Solid voice acting, most Hibari scenes, music is catchy\\n\r\nCONS: Cast is way too big, terrible fights, lackluster gags, 5 minute recaps every episode",

            "content": "Katekyo Hitman Reborn, commonly referred to simply as Hitman Reborn, is the comedic story of Sawada Tsunayoshi (Tsuna) and his training in fulfilling his duty as the 10th generation leader of the famous Vongola Mafia Family.  Though this is a story about mafia families and such, by no means is it all dead serious as you expect mafia-themed plots to be (i.e. Gungrave).  Quite the contrary, this is a comedy anime and is a very hilarious show.  \r\nTsuna is trained by Reborn, a very well-known hitman throughout the mafia world, but the catch here is that Tsuna is your everyday klutz whohas no good qualities about him, hence his nickname, &quot;No good Tsuna,&quot; and also not to mention, he wants nothing to do with the mafia.  While he meets many new friends throughout his journey who eventually join ranks with him to become his &quot;mafia family,&quot; there are of course people who want to see him dead so they can take his place.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, while very unique as you don\\'t see too many mafia-based anime shows out there, definitely had more potential than what the final product has showed us so far.  The big reason that I state this is that there is a bunch of episodes, while not fillers, can be seen as stand-alone comedic episodes that don\\'t really have too much of a plot line to them.  The episodes that do have a plot, while they are extremely interesting, are unfortunately, go by rather quickly.  However, don\\'t let that be the reason to stop you from checking this out.  \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of Hitman Reborn isn\\'t all that bad, but isn\\'t anything special or spectacular.  Sometimes the animation just seems kind of plain, and many times during a few scenes you\\'ll undoubtedly notice how bland it is, but its bearable.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also on the same degree as the artwork, nothing special, but not disappointing.  \\n\\n\r\nI believe what separates Hitman Reborn and makes it special from other shows is its characters.  They creators have done an excellent job in creating fresh, very unique and hilarious characters that will have you laughing at their antics in every episode (especially Lambo, who is just too cute).  The biggest, and probably the most surprising thing about the characters is how some of them are literally, baby-sized characters.  Reborn himself is no bigger than Tsuna\\'s head and while this fact may make you stray away from this anime, let me advise that it only helps in the comedy department, because the creators were able to use this aspect so creatively well.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\\'re looking for a hilarious anime with very unique characters and some interesting fighting, look no further than Hitman Reborn.  This anime contains its fair shares of battles, action and romance to go along with the many laughs you\\'ll inevitably have.",

The art is fairly mediocre as well the action scenes look alright for a shonen but everything else looks so bland and generic   especially the character designs. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very forgettable as well nothing really stands out except for the openings  they are  pretty great l think l like all the reborn openings which is really rare  the last one is my least favourite though. \\n\\n\\n\r\n The characters god fucking damn it the characters l  think  l already talked about tsuna enough he is a standard generic shonen protagonist  which wants to protect his friends  also he dosen't want to become a Mafioso even if it runs in his family's tree his character is just so infuriating the other main characters are fairly forgettable as well  only character l really remember fondly was hibari because he didn't give a shit about anything that happened   none of the characters get a huge amount of significant development for a 200 and something episode  series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere is also quite a lot of filler in reborn especially in the future arc with the girls cooking food and going on strike and it  all feels quite pointless   for a shonen to have  it was probably there to save  money because l don\u2019t remember  the filler scenes going for as long as they did  in the manga.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile l do have a lot of complaints with the story and the characters l did enjoy myself with the show it was a fun cheesy shonen just   don\u2019t bother with the manga it gets even worse especially with the manga ending which l won\u2019t spoil.\\n\r\nOverall Hitman reborn is a fun generic shonen it does hold a special place in my heart though because it was one of the first shows l ever watched when l first got in to anime.\\n",

Watching till 20 I was ready to quit a few times, but i read some good reviews so i kept watching. If you cant stand them at all, DONT skip em! Just be patient. These episodes are to introduce some of the characters, and of course make you laugh a lot! \r\nThe only drawback of this anime (personal opinion) is it's art. Sometimes characters' and backgrounds' art aren't good at all, since the detail is too low. \r\n\"So why should i watch it then?\" youmay ask, the answer is simple: Just give it a try and you will understand why I'm giving it a big 9/10 no matter the drawbacks mntioned above!",

            "content": "KHR is like any other long shounen series; For someone relatively new to anime, it can be very fun and addicting. If you are too familiar with the tropes used in this genre, it can become a real chore and way too predicable.\r\nStory: The plot progresses in the usual shounen way: The weak and optimistic protagonist trains, and starts fighting enemies who seem much stronger than him, and once he defeats them they often become his allies. The first 20 episodes were fillers, but since I found them funny I didn\u2019t really mind. The battles drag out a bit sometimes, but they are welldone in general and there\u2019s enough suspense to keep the viewer interested. The biggest problem however is the filler episodes; they were initially funny, but the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again and it becomes annoying fast. Even without talking about the recaps, some episodes were just completely unnecessary, like before each battle they have at least one episode where the characters just encourage each other and talk about the upcoming battle. \\n\\n\r\n Characters: The cast seems pretty diverse, but all the characters can fit in an archetype in some way or other. They gain maturity and confidence during the battles, but it seems to revert once the battle is over, and they are back to repeating the same catchphrases again and again. Many of the jokes are based on character antics, but after 200 eps, it becomes really predicable and repetitive. Another thing that really bothers me is the female characters; even though some of them are strong, their strength is nothing compared to the male characters, they hardly participate in battles, often can\u2019t do anything without help from the males (Chrome, cough* cough*). And while it is important to have a female character who can\u2019t fight but serves as moral support, having two of them is way too much especially when one is portrayed as very annoying and immature. Many of the characters who don\u2019t fight are very uninteresting; Despite tagging along for 200+ episodes and getting a lot of screentime, they don\u2019t get character development at all. Hibari Kyouya was especially poorly written; he is some lone wolf who practically wins every battle in 1 min without effort or remarkable injuries, and he doesn\u2019t have character growth at all. In other words, he can be easily qualified as a \u2018Gary stu\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nArt:  While the character designs are interesting, the art is very inconsistent. It improves through the series, but was never really detailed and every once in a while it is still possible to see poorly drawn frames without pausing the video. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The osts were decent, but they get kinda annoying after being repeated 98343981 times, especially when you can easily predict when they will be played. Most of the openings and endings however were pretty good and original. The seiyus\u2019 voices fit the characters well, but some of them may annoy you, like Haru and Lambo\u2019s. \\n",

            "content": "Katekyoshi Hitman Reborn! is an excellent example of how intriguing shounen manga can be with the right mixture of comedy, action, suspense and the flawless integration of the mafia and fantasy themes. The main protagonist Tsuna, at first glance, seems to have a defeatist attitude and comes off as pathetic, failing about everything, his studies, sports and even romance. Then our reluctant hero meets a mysterious infant hitman called Reborn who is recuited to be Tsuna's tutor because Tsuna is the 10th boss of the Vongola Family, a powerful and influential mafia family to much to Tsuna's dismay!\r\nStory:\r\nThe Story is one of the best Ihave come across in a while with the plot initially having large amounts of comedy and stupidity but goes on to include much darker themes later on. The anime starts of slowly introducing each character and establishing the bonds between them. It then goes on to have one the best concepts and plot I have come across. The plot was fairly consistent with the action and comedy sequences that keep the audience entertained and with just the right amount suspense, leaving the audience eager for the next episode.  There are well thought out powers and weaponry that Tsuna and his guardians use to face challenges and save the day proving that though the mafia may be considered criminal syndicates but the Vongola are different.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is excellent and the hero looks extremely cool while defeating villains. The equipment and weapons, pets, clothing and characters are well planned, well drawn and unique. I especially loved the Vongola Coat of Arms and Tsuna drawn in Hyper Dying Will Mode. Unlike most shounen manga, The character's clothing changes which is a fact that I love! Even the irritating underwear scene had him don a different pair each time...Though he does have the tyipcal shounen hero's orange color scheme, a popular trend with shonen manga.  (I refer to Naurto and Goku's clothing and Ichigo's hair)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe openings and the endings were quite good. I failed to notice any character specific battle music which is a change from normal anime which has music for each character. Tthe music is subtle and suitable to the situation and does not overwhelm the senses and distract. Tsuna's seiyu does an excellent job and Tsuna's voice in HDWM is slightly more mature than normal.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are well developed and realistic and the hero forms a buffer between egos that may otherwise clash, a valuble leadership skill. Tsuna dislikes vilence but once provoked is a deadly force top be reckoned with. Gokudera with his Zeal, Yamamoto and his calm and laid back nature, Ryohei and his Passionate, Kyoya with his Aflooness, Lambo and  his Cowardice and Mukuro and his claim to have a personal agenda is understood and is held together by Tsuna who forms the \"glue\" that holds his guardians together.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nNegative points:\\n\r\nI have enjoyed every episode. Though there were things that annoyed me. \\n\r\n1. Tha actual plot starts after 20 episodes. \\n\r\n2.The lead is irritating for the first 20 episodes with his dying will underwear scenes! I must say it was extremely funny but watching the same sequence for over 20 episodes makes you annoyed at Tsuna! I do not understand the point of it. Tsuna goes on to nbecoming super cool later on. \\n\r\n3. The Recap and Omake sections take up too much of the episodes time not to mention recap episodes!!\\n\r\nDespite this, the story arcs are well connected and the balance between action and comedy well maintained. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI strongly recommend this series to shounen fans!! I give this series a 9/10 and inspite of the drawbacks, it was excellent and entertaining. The plot, characters and art are strong points!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When i first came across KHR, it was a toss up against Gintama.  I watched the first episode of KHR and was put off by Tsuna's underwear mode thing, thinking it was completely ridiculous and stupid.  So then i chose to watch Gintama instead, however, i'm SO glad that i did come back to KHR eventually, or else i would have missed out on such an AMAZING anime.  After episode 20 or so, i found myself completely hooked, i probably even loved the underwear mode by then.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nOnce the real storyline kicks off, KHR turns into something amazing and unique.At first glance, the mafia based story put together with superhuman babies may seem a disaster but the plot eventually becomes something far from that and everything just seems to fit into place.  The only reason why i would not give it a full 10/10 is because (as mentioned before) it takes a long time for the real storyline to kick in, but if you pull through the first 20 episodes, you'll definitely find yourself addicted and watching episode after episode.  On top of that, KHR has considerably less fillers than other shounen anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nThe anime begins with bad character art, but as it goes on, the way the characters are drawn do get better.  The action scenes were well done to begin with IMO, and they also get even better further into the anime :]. I particularly liked the clothing style of some characters *cough* Gokudera *cough*, scenery wasn't bad although i didn't pay much attention to that, but at least houses looked like houses and trees looked like trees. x]\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nI loved nearly all the OP and ED themes, they fit the anime really well and got me addicted to Cherryblossom and Masami Mitsuoka's voice.  The character's voices fit perfectly and were very unique, although Haru's voice tended to be quite annoying at times with her \"dangerous desu!\" thing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\r\nI loved all the characters by the time they were all introduced, they all have unique personalities and the amount of support and loyalty they give the protagonist is almost heartwarming.  Each character has something unique to them which stands out from the rest of the people Tsuna knows, whether it be a saying or a style, there isn't any two characters who are similar really (unless you count fringe characters...)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nBy the time i reached episode 40 or so, i found myself watching it non stop, struggling to slow down so i don't catch up so fast.  It became one of my top favourite anime by that point, i usually don't judge anime before i finish them/catch up, but this one became an exception by miles.  Once you reach the real storyline you'll be completely hooked wanting to know what happens next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nDespite it's flaws at the beginning (taking too long to start, fairly bad animation etc), for me, KHR makes up for it all with its awesome storyline and unique characterisation whilst keeping typical shounen elements for it to be categorised in this area.  I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for a long running shounen anime without having to sift through 50+ episodes to reach the real plot.  KHR is definitely an addictive anime worth watching, you'll find yourself waiting for the new episodes to be subbed before you know it. :]\\n",

            "content": "Now this anime is one i don't think i will ever understand the fascination with. I have reached ep 65 so its not a complete review, but how many eps should it take for an anime to get good? Considering how  popular this show is, i think its time to balance it out with a negative review.\r\nOk, its pretty well established in the anime community that the first 19 eps or so are garbage.\r\nBut they are not garbage because they have no story and a basically filler episodes. They are garbage because some of the characters are so annoying they want to make youpull your eyes out. The cow and egg baby are horrid and the main character, tsuna, his japanese voice acting is more annoying then shinjis dub voice from evangelion. These eps are so bad they make naruto filler eps 136-220 look good!  :(\\n\\n\r\nOk, now thats out the way, to the real review.\\n\\n\r\nMost people are like watch from ep 20 where the first story arc is. However that too is a let down with boring, short and badly constructed fights. Its also just bog standard shonen fare that you have seen a million times before in high school fighting shows. Then after this short arc...more horrible filler.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the second arc is ALOT BETTER, and i would recommend just watching as much of the beginning as you can cope with, and then jumping to ep 34. \\n\\n\r\nThe fights are alot better, story picks up and becomes a more solid shonen fighting show.\\n\\n\r\nHowever it still in no way matches the hype. In NO WAY, can this show even come close to Naruto, One Piece, Dragon ball or even Bleach.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights so far are no where near as good as the above shows. Storyline wise its ok, better then bleach and dragonball but no match for naruto and especially  one piece.\\n\\n\r\nHowever its lack of emotion, character development and drama seals its fate. Because the start is so bad i feel nothing for any of the characters and the main character kills the show dead. He has to be the worst main character ever. \\n\\n\r\nEven Bleach has better character building and emotion then this and Bleach sucks in that area. \\n\\n\r\nI know there are alot of people who hate the Naruto anime, and thats fine. But if any of those ppl like Reborn then i honestly think they are not using any logic. Naruto CRUSHES Reborn with ease. Narutos fights, story, characters and especially emotional scenes  destroy the first 65 eps of Reborn.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to compare Reborn to the king of the shonen fighting animes, One Piece, is like comparing The Empire Strikes Back  with Attack of the Clones.\\n\\n\r\nI know its possible that Reborn goes super after the Varia arc but how many eps can an anime stay mediocre?\\n\\n\r\n Even Bleach got good from ep 15, Naruto was good from ep 1 and went thunderous after ep 19. Naruto Shippuuden is wasting some of the potential the show had but is still fabulous. Dragonball was great from the off, Dragonball z started with one awesome fight and One Pieces first season is still prob the 2nd or 3rd best one piece season with amazing character development.\\n\\n\r\nFor reborn to start off with filler is crazy and even the varia arc is not up to par. \\n\\n\r\nReborn might have been the 5th legendary long running shonen fighting anime, but alas it was not to be.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Okay, I feel like this review is going short and sweet but straight to the point. I decided to pick this up since my friend was going on about this like he does with One Piece. So I decided to give it a shot. The first 20 episodes are a real killer, since that's were a lot of people are like \"okay... what is this? Can we get to some sort of story/action already?!\" It has its little humor here and there to keep a little smile on your face.\r\nHowever, for me at least, I did not get interested in until the future arc. That'spractically more than halfway through the series. There were a FEW decent fights here and there before than but nothing too captivating. I guess what really had me was that they consistently dragged some parts out. It's noticeable in every arc and because of that, I had to put this series on hold and start a new series just so I could have my \"anime fill\" for the day. Sure there are plenty of anime that does this, but Hitman was really bad with this.\\n\\n\r\nThis show loves to put fillers within the arc and loves to have recap episodes and tries to play it off like it's really part of the story (though it's not as bad as Naruto). So occasionally, I would say something similar to this, \"Really, that was an episode? C'mon it should be better than this.\" Of course other anime do similar things, but with Hitman just really irked me the most. You will know which episodes will be recaps and you can skip them if you so choose to. For me, I have to watch every single episode, special, ova, movie and etc of a series.\\n\\n\r\nSo as my first review comes to an end, let me just answer a few more things: \\n\\n\r\nIs this one of the best anime series that I have watched to date? - definitely not\\n\r\nIs this worth a re-watch? - only less than a handful of episodes so basically no\\n\r\nWould I recommend this to people looking for a new series? - nope\\n\r\nWould I recommend this to people looking to kill some time? - maybe\\n\r\nCould you take a pass on this anime? - yeah, you are not really missing anything\\n\\n\r\nHowever if you are interested in Hitman Reborn, I would have to say that, stick with the manga, the anime definitely does not do this series justice unfortunately. Though a few OP/ED's were pretty decent :-)\\n\\n\r\nNot trying to bash the series out there for those out there who likes/loves it, but I'm just obviously voicing my opinion on how I felt about this series. It's definitely not the best nor the worst anime I have watched. I'm just sort of disappointed that my friend hyped it up as much as he does with One Piece, so I probably was expecting too much from this. Hmm... what do you know, my review wasn't all that short lol.",

            "content": "Ciaossu.\r\nToday we will be taking a look at Hitman Reborn, which was not quite as popular as some other shounen jump titles and it was sort of forgotten a while after it ended. \r\nThis is a spoiler free review.\r\n*Story*\r\nThe story centers around Sawada Tsunayoshi, an unpopular Japanese junior high-schooler who's one day forced by an Italian baby and his shape shifting pet chameleon (I don't know, just roll with it), to train and become the next head of a certain Mafia called the 'Vongola family'. \r\nFirst off, you wouldn't expect a shonen anime (which is mainly aimed at kids) to contain a subject matter suchas Mafias, would you? And that's why the term 'Mafia' in this series is very loosely connected to the real world definition of it. Are they involved in pedaling drugs? Prostitution? Wait, do they even break the law? For what purpose do they organize exactly? The answer to the last question is not very satisfying, as you can imagine. They're just presented as organizations with strong people in them that fight other such groups. It seems to me, this term is used mainly to sound exotic for a Japanese audience. So from the get go, this makes the story feel almost aimless, besides Tsuna becoming a 'Boss' of a Maifa with no clear purpose, aside from fighting other Mafias. I don't think the author thought this idea entirely through.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first 20 episodes the story sets out to introduce the characters through episodic comedy with little to no action in them. In this sense, it's different from the usual battle shonen and it might turn some people off immediately. Bleach (a series I'm not too fond of) also used its first 20 or so episodes for a similar goal, but did it through monster of the week with plenty of action. So I guess I should applaud Reborn for being different and taking certain risks. Even though, I'd personally prefer action, honestly.\\n\\n\r\nAfter its introduction episodes, Reborn goes on a route that's within the boundaries of the shonen tradition and starts its actual story through various arcs. The first arc was a pretty small scale battle against some street gang and it didn't last very long, but it did manage to spark my interest in what's to come. The second arc was a battle against another branch within the same family, which was a decent arc, but it lasted longer than it needed to. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in this series becomes especially slow in the third arc that's actually a saga which ended up taking most of the duration of the show and contained fillers within that saga. Granted there weren't that many fillers, but some weren't even action oriented and actually contained more episodic comedy. Meaning, the introduction episodes come back to haunt us later in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself, is pretty basic shonen stuff, but despite having no clear end goal it did manage to throw in twists along the way that kept me interested. It wasn't mind blowing or anything, but it did use its own plot elements and the side stories it threw in surprisingly well. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the end of this big saga is also the end of the series and it left things open. Though I haven't read the manga, I've heard that nobody liked where it ended and that the upcoming arc was pretty bad anyways. So I guess it might as well have ended there.\\n\\n\r\n*Characters*\\n\\n\r\nTsuna, the main character has a good heart, but is basically a spineless individual who's in need to become stronger. This also demonstrates how the author wanted to do something different from the usual shonen. You see, in most long running shonen we already get a character who's fully developed to what is necessary for a shonen protagonist. They're strong willed, positive and never run away from a fight (Goku, Luffy, Naruto, etc').. So all that's left for them to develop, is their physical strength, not their personality. In this case however, the protagonist needs to strengthen his personality, adapt to the Mafia life style and become skilled in battle. This is excellent, and it also distracts you from the fact that the story doesn't have much of a goal beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the main character, the rest of the cast don't develop and are your basic two dimensional shonen characters with very silly quirks\u2026. But! They are also very likable and their chemistry together is quite good. The thing that seems to be consistent among them is that they all take their personality quirk or hobby to an extreme. For example, Gokudera will protect Tsuna to the death if necessary, Hibari will discipline his school mates by any means , Yamamoto will always be the positive moral booster no matter what, etc, etc. This might sound cheap but this is exactly what makes them so well defined and fun to watch interact.\\n\r\nEven a lot of the villains have somewhat interesting quirks and personalities as well..\\n\\n\r\nAfter the introduction episodes though the amount of comedy in the series drops significantly until there's almost none at all and there was very little use for the characters' quirks from a point on. The tone of the show changes completely in the big saga and it obviously didn't know how to balance it out. This shift in tone becomes especially noticeable when the episodic comedy fillers come back later in the series in the middle of the saga, reminding you of what the show used to be like.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing about the rest of the cast, despite being very quirky (and having interesting and funny quirks, not half assed ones) none of them seemed to get a proper backstory, with one exception being the fans favorite, Gokudera (admittedly, he's also my favorite). Don't get me wrong they all have some sort of background, but none of them get an entire episode flashback of a tragic backstory dedicated to them, if I recall (you may correct me if I'm wrong here, it's been a few years since I've watched it), which is strange since nobody in the cast seems to be more important than someone else as far the story is concerned.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, much like in Bleach, the amount of characters start to pile up from a point on and it feels like there were way too many for the show to handle. This is problematic, but I don't think it was handled that badly, all things considered.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all the characters are kinda like characters out of a Saturday morning cartoon (which is what Reborn is, in Japan, heh heh) and I don't mean that as an insult, it's actually interesting to have such silly characters in a semi serious story. It's too bad their lighthearted nature wasn't fully and consistently present and that most lack any kind of depth.\\n\\n\r\n*Art*\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs demonstrate that this is a female mangaka more than anything else. Every male character looks like a super model. The designs style is somewhat original though, since I immediately recognized it on a cover of a completely different anime (Psycho-Pass). So I guess it's not that bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation though is pretty simplistic and despite being an action anime there isn't all that much action to look forward to either. There are decent battles in it, sure, but not that many. And most of them aren't that great. You can even go back more than 20 years and find better battles in both DBZ and Yu Yu Hakusho, to be perfectly honest (both in quantity and quality).\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention, In the last quarter of the series, the fighting's style changes into\u2026 something else that I can't reveal, because spoilers\u2026 But it will depend entirely on your preference whether you like that change or not.\\n\\n\r\n*Sound*\\n\\n\r\nI don't know Japanese, but I think the voice acting is quite good with a bunch of distinct and funny voices that fit quite perfectly with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are pretty basic though and the soundtrack is ok, I guess, but it isn't the most memorable one, despite being used throughout 200 episodes. Some of the tracks sound a little like Rocky knock offs as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are mostly pop songs and boy bands. Granted, some are decent, but others take Engrish to levels that make it sound completely retarded. So this might be distracting and/or hilarious, assuming you speak English. \\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment*\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy it for its characters, but I was watching it while it was airing, so the terribly slow pacing really got to me at points. Especially since there were a lot of (canon) episodes where almost nothing happened. \\n\\n\r\n*Overall* 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nHeck, maybe this score is a little generous considering how much I trashed it, mainly since I still kinda liked it somehow. \\n\r\nIf there's one thing you should know about Reborn is that it's definitely not soulless. There are certainly much better shonen out there, but there's also much worse, in my humble opinion. And I'm sure the author really was trying her best.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

            "content": "My first impression of Hitman Reborn is that it is a very annoying anime. There are 3 little kid characters in the anime that have voices that are so high pitched and irritating. Imagine hearing those sounds on your noise cancellation earphones. But i was soon to be proven wrong.\r\nStory\r\nThe story progresses quite slowly in the beginning 10-15 episodes. The first part of the series shows the relationship between Reborn and the protaganist, Tsuna. And it also gives an idea on the training that Tsuna will go through later in the series. These are mainly repetitive and give us a feeling of lame fillers. However,i must urge you to bear with the first few episodes and continue on. Because later on in the series (when Tsuna and pals begin their training), will the real story begin. The real story includes boss fights and show how bonds later in the arc are formed, and make for me a very interesting watch. Later on will be a few more filler episodes, then towards the next arc - which has yet to complete its airing - but promises to not disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nMany of the characters in the series are 'babies' or kids, so the art tends toward chibi styled characters. For the rest of the characters, the art is quite simple but very likable. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNothing much to be said in this section, but the first op was nothing to rave about. But the second and third op were much better, and so were the ending songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe series follow through the experiences of the main protagonist. And it shows how he grows from a friendless useless boy to one with a 'family' and a will to protect them. Later in the series, the irritating kids i referred to in the beginning prove themselves useful and become likable characters. Tsuna (main character) is developed very well in this series, but i must express my disappointment that other characters are not developed that well yet. Especially Hibari and Yamamoto. However, this may be due to the series not having been completed, and we may see more of their development in the future.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAside from being slightly annoyed in the beginning of the episode, i feel that the main arcs of the story were very enjoyable. I do not encourage forwarding of episodes, or skipping episodes, but for the bulk of the first few episodes you may choose to do so.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI liked this anime quite a lot. It is not my favorite anime out there, but I most certainly did not regret picking up this series.",

            "content": "Never judge a book by its cover. The first time I watched this anime, I only saw about three or so minutes of the first episode before I gave up on it. Yes, the reason was partly to do with the animation of Reborn, I was like o_0 before deciding not to watch it... After a period of time, I decided to give it a try again after one of my friends watched it and recommended it. The 180+ episodes was daunting as I settled down to actually watch anime and see why it was so popular. \r\nNineteen episodes later I was wondering why Iwas still watching it, the main character was a total let down, Tsuna's wimpy personality really turned me off. I really considered dropping it again, but then the next episode came on, and finally something interesting happens. It was all uphill from there and I /loved/ it. \\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10) - Be warned, if you're looking for an anime with actual mafia fighting and stuff in it, this probably isn't what you want. This anime is more humour/friendship/a tad bit fantastical. There's not much gang/mafia/crimminal related activities going on, and if so it's sort of more light-hearted. You wouldn't take it seriously. \\n\\n\r\n I won't bore you with a summary, there's already one which sufficiently describes the main gist of it without spoiling the anime. Like a lot of animes which have been going on for a while (eg. Bleach, Naruto), the plot is slow-moving. The fight scenes are long and drawn out, and sometimes I find myself skipping ahead only to find I haven't missed that much after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is so-and-so. There are some arcs I like, and some, well, not so much. Thankfully, unlike Bleach and Naruto, KHR doesn't have as many filler arcs, and on the occasion, there's usually one or two fillers in between arcs before the story dives right into the plotline again. What shocked me the most, however is that the two filler arcs are my favourite out of the whole thing! They were enjoyable and interesting, unlike most fillers and I didn't even know they were fillers until I looked up some episode information. They were /that/ good. Plus, it was interesting seeing the first Vongola family.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) - Is well drawn, the guys are gorgeous (especially Tsuna in Dying Will mode *drool* and Giotto) There's not much I can critique about the art really, I've seen better definitely, but it is good enough to satisfy me. One thing which takes a while to get used to is Reborn however due to the style, but you get used to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10) - I didn't really like the voice actor for Tsuna... especially when he started to whine, it really grated on my nerves. But all in all, once I got used to that everything else was fine. The soundtrack is pretty awesome and I love the current opening theme \"Listen to the Stereo\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10) - KHR has a large, very unique cast. Each character has his/her own back story and I really liked the character development of all the characters, most specifically Tsuna. Wimpy personality aside, he is a very instersting character and he grows and matures a lot as the story progresses. Tsuna may be a wimp, but he has a kind heart and would do anything to protect his friends. It is really interesting to watch how he changes the characters around him change as they interact with him and he doesn't even realise it! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10) - The only two reasons this isn't getting a 10 is because I hate the pace of the show, it's too drawn out and you get bored of it. The episode recaps are annoying as well, they take about five whole minutes to recap what happened previously. That's about a fifth of the episode gone already! Grr\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10) - I give it a 'very good'. Definitely worth watching if you enjoy shounen animes and have the time to. At currently 200 episodes, it is a little daunting to start, but once you start getting into it you hardly notice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy,\\n\r\n-animeangel105",

            "content": "I have mixed feelings reviewing this show. On the one hand it is hands down one of my absolute favorites. On the other hand it really isn't what I would call amazing. Initially when I first started watching it, I was bored half to death and dropped it after two or so episodes. I got back into it after encountering a few reviews praising it, so I decided to give it another shot. After making it past the first grueling 20 episodes, the plot went into high gear and sucked me in like a kid discovering candy for the first time. For many yearsI praised it as my favorite anime, and while I still love it, I can't fairly give it a score higher than 8.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is very intriguing and very unique which is why I give it so much credit. The problem with katekyo hitman reborn, or KHR for short, is the execution. Up until the third major arc, there weren't many things that I could complain about. The ending to the third arc is where my problem with this series begins. The whole ending sequence, leading up to the fourth arc but that isn't covered in the anime, is nothing short of a deus ex machina. It really rubbed me the wrong way and while I still harbor lots of love for this series I couldn't forgive it. The plot is clever at some points, although the later plot holes counteract the good parts about it. \\n\\n\r\nNot regarding the story but the show's pacing, there were times when the pacing was rocky, some parts seeming too short and others entirely too long (i.e the first 20 episodes) some arcs being comprised entirely of fillers(more towards halfway through the series and it seems very oddly placed and very easy to identify even without prior knowledge from the manga) and while I know this is because of the anime catching up to the manga it really doesn't excuse it for the bad quality pacing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting was great all around, the voices very distinctive and easy to identify. They all showed their character's quirks very well and I can't really think of a single person who didn't stand out when they were on screen.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art starts off lackluster, not very good but not very bad, and in some parts absolutely terrible, but the gradual increase of quality is very evident as the show goes on. By the end of the series I thought it to be some of the cleanest art I had seen in a while. The only gripe I have with it is that many of the female characters look way too similar to each other.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is the category in which KHR shines. The characters are lovable, fun, and more importantly, well done. Even the villains have a certain quality to them that made it impossible for me to hate them. This can also cause a problem because I could never truly feel hatred towards the villains. Despite not getting too much information on a lot of the characters, you still feel like you know them well and hardly any of their actions come as a surprise. There is one major flaw in the characterizations. The way women are portrayed, although not all of them, makes them seem pretty useless. While I didn't have any problem with this at first since I mostly focused on the guys anyway, it became really apparent later on in the series. I know for all intensive purposes that they were never the focus of the story but I would have preferred it if they didn't have the girls around whatsoever instead of having them there as liabilities. Chrome is the prime example, whom somehow manages to get herself in dangerous situations and always has to be saved. For this reason I can't give this category a higher score.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed this show, having watched it at least three times in a few years time which is almost unheard of from me. It was always fun to watch it back then and it still is, even if I don't take it as seriously as I once did.\\n\\n\r\nKHR is one of those few rare series that can capture your heart despite all of its imperfections. It isn't a show to be taken too seriously, even if it has its serious moments it doesn't feel as threatening and dangerous as shows with a much darker mood, but it doesn't detract anything from the enjoyment. If anything I would say it is a series to be watched for the sheer fun of it and not for the plot. If you're looking for a show with action, comedy, crazy characters, and something that's just all around fun, then this is something you should definitely watch. Otherwise you might not enjoy this much. It's best to watch this anime without thinking too deeply into it or you may find yourself raging a bit at the ending.\\n",

            "content": "(very minor spoilers involving ep. 74+)\r\nReborn is a series that starts out with filler. Absurb, badly written, yet sometimes decently funny. That's right, the series STARTS with filler. The filler is used to make the characters seem developed, creative, and awesome by the first, SIX EPISODE story arc. Then, there is more filler. This filler is largely just there to keep the comedic stuff of the first season going. It fills the niche NORMAL filler does, in the sense that it's kinda cool to see characters we just saw in a serious conflict, have fun with random hilarity. \r\nThen the first REAL arc starts, onethat actually is a huge chunk of episodes. The character development and portrayal is still bang-on. But the story is horribly weak and filled with holes. Giant, pot-holes that like on a highway almost DARE you to slow down at risk of falling into them. And that's where the series kinda fails. If you think, even for a minute about the plot, your brain will melt. It's not a bad plot, there are worse *cough*naruto*cough* but it's just.... cliche despite the mobster theme and just kinda meehhhh.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we get MORE FILLER. But at this point, if you have made it this far, your brain will have melted, and you slog through it soaking up granules of entertainment with your mind wiped tendrills. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then finally, we get to where I am now. Essentially, like taking the characters from filler, to a standard shounen fight arc; we have taken the characters, and thrown them into a standard &quot;Shounen+&quot; anime. For a quick definition, I consider shows like D.Gray man, FMA, and Soul Eater, &quot;Shounen+&quot; Basically, I mean it's still shouneny fights and all that, but the tone, storyline(kinda), and characters are those you see in what anime fans would call &quot;Real Anime.&quot; And, so far, it seems really interesting. It's almost like 73 episodes were just leading up to the real series. It's a 10 year time skip, but over half the cast are from pre-time skip, which is actually a very unique dynamic. \\n\\n\r\nI won't really discuss the characters, but they are all actually fairly well written and developed. It IS a shounen though, so don't expect FMA or Trigun level personal trauma or anything. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, the series is about taking Shounen Characters who exist in a filler comedic world, and inserting standard fight-manga plot devices at them at random intervals, followed by shoving them into a show which seems like something out of Shakugan no Shana or a *good* My-hime or something. \\n\\n\r\nSo, would I recommend it? (Warning: The below may not be anywhere near a proper review in subject matter, tone, or writing in general)\\n\\n\\n\r\nABSOLUTELY NOT\\n\\n\\n\r\n73 episodes to get to something awesome?! Go watch Soul Eater if you havn't it's like the greatest thing ever, and it doesn't have creepy babies which you are forced to love. Reborn is a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE curse. You hate it, and hate it, but then you watch a bit more, and then you watch more in the hopes that something will happen. You don't know why, but you do. Stay away, keep your time and energy for better series, hobbies, raising your social links, hell, even h-games i don't care. Just don't make the same mistake I have unless you really don't mind all the issues I said, and you just LOVE super deformed super babies and shounen fight characters.",

            "content": "Just recently I finished watching the 'Katekyo Hitman Reborn' anime. This is an Anime that has the reputation for being a late bloomer, and I certainly agree with this notion.\r\nWhen I started watching the show the episodes were funny at first, but it got  repetitive pretty fast after the main characters were introduced. The story and the character development slows down and the episodes are the same thing over and over again. (could be filler though)\r\nI even dropped the anime for a while. But I kept reading stories about how it gets better in later episodes, and it did!\r\nStory: 8\r\nI can understand that someonewould drop this anime if he or she would only watch the first 20-something episodes. The story has a really slow start. But slowly it will get better as the story progresses further. It even gets pretty awesome after a while, but sometimes the references and the comparison too the First Vongola boss an his group were a bit too overwhelming for me. \\n\r\nThe ending was also disappointing and unsatisfying. I guess the show was canceled or something.\\n\r\nI would have given the story a 9 if it wasn't for these minor irritations and the weak ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nI'm really not the one to notice small changes in the animation details, so don't expect me to be to critical about the art.\\n\r\nI would say 'Katekyo Hitman Reborn' has an average looking animation for an 200+ anime. There were no real high or low points, the show was pretty consistent with its animation. I give it a 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe voice actors and the SFX were on point. There were no real moments in the show for the voice actors to shine, but they remained consistent throughout. The SFX did his job of providing extra impact to what was happening in the show. \\n\r\nThe overall sound quality is what you would expect from a TV show, good, and nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nI loved the design and personalities of most of the characters. \\n\r\nI already explained that the references too the first Vongola where a bit overwhelming. This is especially the case with the character design of Vongola I, and his guardians. I get that the main protagonist could look similar too his predecessor, because of family ties. But it bothered me that everyone of the Vongola X guardians look similar to their predecessors. \\n\r\nBut besides this minor irritation, the characters were awesome. I especially liked the characters, Yamamoto Takeshi and Fran/Flan from the Future Varia. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show greatly when it got serious. But because it took a while, the start was very poor. At first the jokes were fun. But when you have seen a joke multiple times, it isn't that funny anymore. Later on in the show, it creates better moments for itself to use some comical relief. The seriousness causes a better mixture between the humor and the action, with some hilarious moments as result.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nBecause the later episodes are still more fresh for me than the beginning ones, I originally wanted to give this show a 9. But I most not forget the things I didn't like. Things like the slow story development in the beginning and the sloppy ending brings down my \"original\" overall rating. I soon came to the conclusion to give this show a 7. It had the potential to be very good if hadn't such a slow start. And it could have been a great one if they had wrapped up the show with a more proper ending.",

            "content": "At first, I thought Katekyo Hitman Reborn would be just like Naruto or Bleach.  It looked like some cliche', shonen anime and the scene where the main character appeared in nothing but boxers disgusted.  Soon after though, I learned that the first 19 episodes were only for character development, so I skipped them.  Skipping these episodes completely changed my outlook on the show.  Immediately, the show gained an interesting plot and it all got better from there.\r\nStory:  For the story, this show gets a 9.  Though sometimes boring, it usually keeps strong interest.  Every episode ends in asuspenseful ending as well, which keeps you watching. :3 If you like cool weapons, mafia, and really bad ass characters, this show is for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The art is pretty good, and it's definitely bearable (unlike some animes I've seen).  All the characters are unique, and the guys don't look too girly. P=\\n\\n\r\nSound:  I LOVE the music in this anime.  The theme song/ending song is always fantastic, and each character has a really cool theme song as well.  There are good noises in appropriate places.  If something is supposed to seem creepy, it will give off a scary/creepy feeling.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  The characters are also something I love.  Everyone develops well, and they are all unique.  You'll connect with everybody, and really grow to love them just like the show.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Basically, I really enjoyed this show.  Even though there are fillers...doesn't every show have those?  \\n\\n\r\nOverall:  Overall, this show is highly enjoyable!  If you want something different, yet still shonen, check this anime out~",

            "content": "Rarely are you fortunate enough to find an anime that truly brings you into their world and keeps you on edge throughout a 200+ episode series; Katekyo Hitman Reborn seemed to do the trick for me. \r\nThe story revolves around a loser of a middle schooler, Tsuna, who is bad at everything and has little friends. One day, a baby home tutor suddenly shows up at his door and informs him that he is a candidate for the boss of the strongest mafia that exists: The Vongola. That is where the fun begins, as Tsuna begins to learn new moves to commence in battle andforms precious bonds with new friends that eventually end up playing a huge part in his mafia. There are many arcs throughout the series, and as the series progresses, Tsuna and his friends battle stronger and stronger enemies that become allies later on. KHR contains many mysteries that end up unraveling in a way you would never expect; this includes the reason Tsuna\u2019s home tutor is a baby, what happened to the first Vongola mafia boss, and much more to fill your heart\u2019s content. \\n\\n\r\nThe storyline was well thought out, with a very unique plot that sets it apart from your average action anime. I was kept guessing the whole time, and found myself thinking about the show first thing when I woke up. The action scenes were amazing as well; the characters always pull out new tricks that you would never expect. In addition, Katekyo Hitman Reborn portrays a fascinating cast of characters that are both original as well as lovable and really start to grow on you as the series progresses. I found myself crying in certain parts seeing how much the characters have grown, which is a rare occurrence for me. Each person has their own little perks that make you love them more. Comedy also plays a huge part in the anime, and there are some hilarious filler episodes that really calm me down after a high tension fight scene. The comedic scenes are really what make KHR such a memorable anime in the end, which is also what makes the fillers much more enjoyable than the ones in Bleach and Naruto. \\n\\n\r\nIt was hard to find critiques for the show, as KHR is one of my all-time favorites. I did find the show to lack some seriousness, as deceased characters always come back to life, box animals in arc 3 seem very childish etc. This would probably help the show target a wider range of audiences if improved, typically those 16 and older. The first 20 episodes also lack plot, but keep persevering as the show has some pleasant surprises in store later in the story. All in all, KHR is definitely an anime you should try out if you\u2019re into a good action/supernatural/comedy/shounen! \\n",

            "content": "Now here's a shounen with class.\r\nKatekyo Hitman Reborn! is the adaption of Akira Amano's popular manga series of the same name that ran from 2004 to 2012 for a total of eight years. The anime ended prematurely, and it's unknown whether or not it will continue. However it ended in a good spot as a big arc had been just resolved. So if you're worried about it ending on a cliffhanger, you have nothing to worry about.\r\nAnyway, the story. The story starts out with Tsunayoshi Sawada finding out he is to be the 10th boss of the Vongola Mafia, or as they call mafias inthe anime, \"families\", so the Vongola Family. He is also to be tutored by the Vongola hitman Reborn (Hence the title) so he can become a proper mafia boss. Of course, \"Loser Tsuna\" doesn't want to be one as he's just a middle school student with no interest in the mafia. The premise doesn't sound too interesting, and really the story never is as serious as it sounds, even during its most serious arc that starts in the 70's. You figure this out right away when you first start the show. Speaking of starting...\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main issues people have with the show is the first 20 or so episodes. This follows a Daily Life arc, involving characters doing funny and stupid things. You even have a character training by dodging baseballs being shot out of a tank on school grounds. While this sounds good, people will just want to get on with the plot, instead of just the show being very episodic. Many of these episodes are not to be skipped however as they introduce some characters that become much more important later on, and you miss various developments.\\n\\n\r\nThis will be an uphill battle for most, but believe me when I say things get much better after you get past these episodes. Things soon start becoming a little more serious, and you really start getting more and more plot and character development. Not to mention they step up with the animation and soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack at the beginning of the series doesn't have really any special tracks. They fit the mood well during the daily life arc, but you'll be left wanting more. Fortunately the series during the arcs that come after the first one have far more interesting tracks, and it helps the show become more engaging. The soundtrack will fit each mood perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and artwork isn't that great either at the beginning, but Artland eventually steps things up more come halfway through the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow back to the story, during its first \"serious\" arc, the Varia arc, it follows some of the typical stuff you find in shounen (Ex: Tournament style fights, various special moves being revealed, opponents going \"Impossible! There's no way this can be!\"), but where the show starts to shine is the characters. You learn what they've gone through, what they're willing to sacrifice just for their friends' safety and a tomorrow where they can laugh all they want without a care in the world, among other things. While this sounds like all the various shounen you've probably watched in the past, it ends up doing more than most, especially with the relationships of the characters. I have not seen many shows do what this show has done with the relationships of the main characters, and it actually ends up caring a lot about them. It develops all of them, and continues to do so the entire time. You really get just how real and strong their relationship is, and what they'll do to maintain it.\\n\\n\r\nOne big problem I have with the story is the issue of time travel. Come halfway through the show, the show has an arc that uses time travel. It ends up unfortunately greatly testing the established theories of this, and even throws parallel universes in there. For this reason, I cannot justify giving the story a higher score, it just ends up being that messy in this area, and brings down what was already established in the previous episodes. Another reason why I can't justify giving it a higher score, the pacing. While the show past episode 20 has all around good pacing, the arc involving time travel is where the series met the same fate as many other long-running shounens, it caught up to the manga, and as a result they had to do something to allow the manga to get farther. Instead of going for filler episodes, Artland decided to just stretch episodes out far longer, and this results in some of the slowest pacing I've ever seen in a shounen for quite a while.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of filler, eventually they decide to put in filler episodes, and while this sounds bad, it actually was for the better. The show involves two short filler arcs that were actually written by Akira Amano herself, and something rather surprising about them is they actually ADD to the story and characters, and CANNOT be skipped. They actually are filler episodes that are truly worth watching. Even after the arcs are done, the show continues to reference them.\\n\\n\r\nI can only hope more series try to do what Katekyo Hitman Reborn! did when it comes to the characters, and filler episodes. It manages to succeed where others failed.\\n\\n\r\nThis is truly a shounen that manages to stand out from the others.",

I love the manga; even though it took a sharp dive in quality partway through, I can still say it's worth reading.  Another JUMP classic, Fist of the North Star, had the same issue and I think it's one of the greatest manga ever.  So why am I giving the anime of Reborn such a low score?  Simply put, it's a bad adaptation.  While I haven't watched the entire series,I'm sure most folks will agree with me that 104 episodes of a show is more than enough for one to form an accurate judgement.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, I felt like the plot of Reborn was, for the most part, poorly adapted.  While I feel like the decision to move some of the Daily Life arc's more inconsequential portions around to act as fillers later on in between the Kokuyo and Varia arcs (as well as during the Varia arc) was an excellent idea, many of the adaptations of the plots in those chapters was, well, poor.  Some jokes were stretched out and turned into something dumber (like the whole Stickypaper Theory thing), or removed entirely because the folks handling the adaptation felt they would be too risque for the audience they were targeting. One of my favorite chapters from the DL arc was one where Kyoko and Tsuna play Russian Roulette.  Due to its content, it was left out entirely.  (Truly unfortunate, since part of the DL arc's strengths lie in its occasionally morbid humor sensibilities.)  \\n\\n\r\nWhen the anime got to the serious bits, it watered them down heavily to stretch them out.  I know this is a standard practice for long-running mega-hit shounen manga adaptations, but there's no way those latter bits of the Varia arc should feel so slow, especially when the adaptation of the Kokuyo arc is, for the most part, fantastic.  The pacing is magnificent; I never felt like it was dragging it's feet like the later arcs do.  \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the staff eventually begins engaging in one of the most awful shounen manga adaptation tropes: the beginning-of-episode recap.  I understand that these shows live and die on being able to maintain a fanbase, and part of that comes from being able to pull in new viewers.  That makes these recaps in longer-running shows something of a necessary evil.  However, these recaps can easily be much more concise; the only reason for their length is to help pad out each episode to help ensure the series doesn't catch up too far to the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst practice use, however,  is putting the tail-end of the episode AFTER the ED in some episodes, which I think is just plain dickish.  The only reason for that is to ensure viewers watch the ED (which is advertising some song that the studio and producers earn money for advertising) and the commercials.  While adaptations like this are, essentially, commercials themselves for merchandise related to the series brand (such as the manga), part of that merchandise are the DVD sales of the series itself, and that's doubly true for fujoshi-focused series like this.  As such, placing the conclusion of the episode after the ED only serves to frustrate its core audience, as they may skip that last little sliver by accident.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I felt the anime improved upon is placing the chapter where a particularly plot-important character first appears much later than it occurs in the manga.  I actually had no idea he had appeared about 124 chapters earlier when Amano reintroduced him.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to toning down the darker bits, that move was fairly irritating.  The fights lacked a lot of the intensity they had in the manga due to the decision to stop having characters bleed after the Kokuyo arc.  In addition, Artland's decision to make all the weapons look unrealistic was fairly stupid, but I can tolerate it for the most part. I can buy having Leone turning into a pistol or a rifle for Reborn to shoot, but the whole \"Dying Will energy leaving the bullets and flying into Tsuna\" thing was idiotic.  Why didn't they just remove bullets leaving the guns and replace it with the energy beams?  And while I can tolerate replacing missing teeth with pocketwatches (it makes sense in context; I'd rather not spoil anything), it removes a lot of tension from those scenes.\\n\\n\r\nMost importantly, they removed Yamamoto's introduction.  While I won't spoil anything, it's probably the most moving character introduction in the DL arc, and Artland cut it out entirely because they felt it was too dark.  Now, Yamamoto just looks like a moron that suddenly begins tagging along with Tsuna and Gokudera because he's intrigued by what he believes to be their mafia role-play game.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to other character alterations, Tsuna's quite a bit less of a jerk early on than he was in the anime, and is mother is much less mean to Tsuna.  Considering Tsuna's behavior ealry on, her attitude makes since, and it later softens as Tsuna (despite what Akira Amano may say in the manga's God-forsaken non-ending) grows as a person.  In the anime, this is removed entirely, as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe art actually looks pretty damn good; and, in the DL arc, it's a great improvement.   The animation, however, is not.  It's very jerky and still.  Amano's artwork in the manga is far, far more animated than the anime itself is thanks to some of her wonderful panel layouts.  Many of the actions scenes look absolutely sluggish in comparison to the manga.  Artland could've attempted to fake movement by making the artwork more dynamic (which is arguably the backbone of Japanese animation) but they couldn't even be bothered to do that.  Instead, every fight looks terribly bland and overly clean, with the characters being drawn exactly on-model, virtually without injury, and rarely moving.\\n\\n\r\nI'm a bit baffled on what to say for the soundtrack for the show.  I should note that I'm not referring to the OPs or EDs, as I generally skip those.  There were about two fantastic tracks in the shows catalog: Standing Friends and Tsuna Awakens.  However, the anime greatly overuses them to the point where they lose almost all meaning.  The other tracks are fairly mediocre, and, as such, don't deserve much criticism at all, positive or negative.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I can't recommend this anime.  I hate that I wasted so much of my time waiting for the anime to start adapting the manga right, and it never did. To this day, there are fans in Japan (http://otakuusamagazine.com/LatestNews/News1/Japanese-Fans-Want-These-Anime-to-Get-Sequels-8399.aspx) hoping to eventually see the remaining two arcs (one a step-down in quality from the one before; the other a nose-dive) adapted.  I can only assume the reason for wanting more of Artland's adaptation is simply so that its obsessive fanbase can hear the characters speak even more, which, honestly speaking, is probably why any of them followed the anime in the first place.  It does have fairly solid voice casting, and that is probably the cornerstone of the anime's success.  There were about five different \"Rebocons\"; concerts where the voice casts would act on-stage like the characters from the show that they portray and sing songs.  I can't say I've heard of other VA-centric series like DiaLovers, for example, courting followings like that.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, read the manga instead.  It's far superior in nearly every way.  The only conceivable way the anime is better is if one is a massive seiyuu fanatic.\\n\\n",

            "content": "REEEEBOORN!! Super hax for 20 seconds!!! Impossiburu! The! Strongest! In! The! World!!! But at all other times he's a useless cry-baby that's attractive to the most popular women! Why! I don't know! \r\nKatekyo Hitman REBORN! is an episodic anime about a useless kid named Tsuna (it's not his full name) who gets a home tutor named Reborn. Reborn is a baby. A baby who is the most intelligent, best, and deadliest hitman in the (Italian) Mafia who went to Japan to find a new Mafia boss, Vongola X. He went to Japan to find a new (11 y. o.) Italian mafia boss. Makes sense? Thisis only the beginning. Every couple of episodes a new character is introduced; all of them better than Tsuna. Because he's a tuna. And tuna is not very successful in life, though it may have more success as a dish. Tsuna has a crush for the most popular girl in his school, and she seems to like him as well, especially after he shows his super hax his home tutor has learnt him. Well, how original is THAT? \\n\\n\r\nThe everyday life of Tsuna & co. is doing implausible things while the MC breaks his clothes every couple of minutes for deathperation mode. He seems to have an infinite supply of clothes. And the amount of people that ends up living at his place is ridiculous; but don't worry, momma doesn't care (I wonder if Tsuna's family is rich?). Your reaction to what I have written here will be: 1) Sounds kiinda interesting, or 2) This will be quite boring.\\n\r\nThe correct answer is 2.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yeah, Katekyo Hitman REBORN! is very boring and should definitely not be ranked that high.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. Now you may just drop this series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n...Or that's what the first 20 episodes make you think. Do not worry, for after that lame and long introduction finally an interesting arc appears (though it has a length of only 5 eps). Tsuna is still a weakling, but, it becomes a bit more interesting due to what happens. This show is made out of battle arcs, and in between them there always are episodes to relieve the tension, which is not bad. It seems to become the typical shonen, in which you get the usual \"become 20x stronger in 3 days\", and \"beat the strongest, most experienced people even though you have started fighting a couple of weeks ago\". Oh well, it's quite fun because there are times at which you think: \"I'm sure he's going to win\", but then you get a surprise; he does NOT win. Sometimes. Sometimes.  \\n\\n\r\n\tThe second arc is quite well done, since it is much more entertaining than the first, despite the before mentioned typical shonen elements. In this arc the powers that everyone has are explained quite convincingly (at least there IS a reason why it works like that). The villains that appear have their reasons to do what they do; it's not that they are doing mad stuff on a whim. \\n\\n\r\n\tAnd after that arc you may prepare to cry... because we get around 40 episodes in which nothing notorious happens, after which the longest battle arc starts (I think that the rest belongs to this arc). One thing that I personally did not like at all was that the screen-time of the people who don't go to battle is ridiculously big. This typically consists of 30% of the episode in which we see a screen (our TV or PC screen) in which people are looking at another screen in which they see their friends doing something (sometimes); or something about the daily worries of a house maid. A lot of doing nothing, in short. I think it would have been a bit more enjoyable if this time was reduced by, say 20%. MOAR ACTION!! Special mention: episode 132, with an astounding 40% of story and rest filler!\\n\r\n\tThat aside, villains have good reasons to fight; in this arc I even thought that it would be plausible to act like that, given their circumstances.\\n\r\n\tIn this arc we get to see new mysteries that are really interesting and well transmitted; again the superpowers and their origin are explained quite convincingly, adding to the overall enjoyment. This arc is where I found the first obvious plot holes and incongruencies. I think it is best to not touch this subject further since it would make everyone who hasn't seen it hate me. Besides, spoilers aren't allowed anyways.\\n\r\n\tThough the fact that our gang of kids wins against people with way more experience than them is still going rampant in this arc, it is done in a way that is much more believable than in previous arc (though this is not obvious at first).\\n\\n\r\nAll these events, powerups and fights culminate in the final 15 episodes, where asspulls are rampant and battles are very intense. The author didn\u2019t even try to hide the cliffhangers since there were more here than in all of the other episodes combined. Now, this doesn\u2019t mean that it is something bad; it\u2019s almost the opposite, since the battles are highly entertaining and keep you on the edge of your seat.\\n\r\nFinally, the conclusion. It is very rare in series to have a satisfying conclusion, as nearly all shows end in episodes that are like \u201cOur fight has just begun!\u201d, or every character is shown as if they still have some unknown objective. This kind of conclusion leaves me (I don\u2019t know if this is true for everyone) an unsatisfying feeling, as I will never get to know if there really was something else. Katekyo Hitman Reborn!, however, is different. The conclusion is neatly wrapped up and no loose ends are left, making the conclusion, however clich\u00e9 it might be, very good.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, that's the end of the story part; let's delve into the characterization.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, Tsuna. Loser Tsuna is a failure in absolutely everything, which apparently makes him a normal kid (for real?). He does nothing well until he meets our favorite baby, Reborn. That meeting is a turning point in his life, after which he all of a sudden gets a heap of very very loyal friends and gets two girls who love him. He's a kid everyone has high expectations of and he's supposed to become Vongola X because his latent abilities. Will those expectations be met by our protagonist? \\n\r\n\tOur main character undergoes some character development, but it is not something spectacular, since his beliefs don't change during the anime. His way of acting does change a bit, though. And since there was no real mystery surrounding him, there is not much more that can be said.\\n\\n\r\nHis gang is made out of a few incredible people that decide to join our protagonist because... Tsuna is fun? Anyway, these people are not failures in life, since there is the rebel tsundere genius Gokudera (a hitman), the baseball pro Yamamoto (he's dumb), the apathic and mysterious and invincible Hibari (a madman), the EXTREME boxer Ryohei (noisy man), the illusionist C.D. (who doesn't do much but moan) and I can't say more since that would be huge spoilers. The fleshing out of these characters is done quite well, though some characters are more interesting than others. \\n\r\n\tGokudera deserves special mention, mainly due to the mystery surrounding him: Where does he come from? Why is his personality like that? All these questions are answered later on, adding to the overall satisfaction of the show. But all these characters are interesting in their own way, and though character development is not much of a thing here, the fleshing out of them is done well.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting female cast is made up by about 4 persons; of which one is the mother of Tsunayoshi. She is your typical nice and young house wife, and nothing else. Then there are two girls, called Haru and Kyoko, who have their unique quirks (Haru, at least); these go to different schools and are best friends. Furthermore there is a young woman called Bianchi, who is a charming woman that throws food at other people.\\n\r\n\tI see one major problem with these characters, though. They are portrayed stereotypically as housewives. This means that the only thing they do is house chores, cooking, and doing very dangerous and totally useless stuff (\"Let's run straight into the open arms of the enemy :D\"). The sole purpose of the weird things they do is making the male characters, though mostly Tsuna, worried. It is no real problem in itself, but in my opinion it was waay overdone in this show; they have no deep purpose, they only serve as \"mental support\". My only reaction to this was annoyance.\\n\\n\r\nAnother notorious character is Reborn. Reborn is a baby that belongs to the Shichibukai Arcobaleno, which is composed of the 7 strongest babies of the world (this probably means that they are stronger than every other person, not amongst only babies). Since Arcobaleno means rainbow, and the rainbow supposedly had 7 colors, it's very fitting, is it not? These babies all have fancy nicknames which actually are their real names, and they all look equally ridiculous. They all have an air of superiority that's kind of annoying, but anyway that makes it funny at times, so it isn't bad.\\n\r\n\tThere's other babies, like Lambo, the one, the best, he whom everyone will love because he rules. He has that oh-so-catchy phrase: HOLD IT BACK!!! Another one is I-Pin (this name...) a chinese fart kenpo hitman, who turns out to be a girl and has constant wars with Lambo.\\n\\n\r\n\tAs for the sound, I think the music is quite fitting; epic battle music is reserved for epic moments, and calming music is used for mundane moments. Nevertheless, some tracks are overused, which may result in irritation. Some of the openings have a nice ring to them, which is quite an achievement, in my opinion, since I usually find openings not worth listening to. The voice actors are good as always; but I personally liked the voices of Tsuna and Haru, just because Tsuna's isn't your typical MC voice and Haru's voice is done in a, let's say, unique way.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe animation quality is not bad, but your widescreen is useless for watching this, since it's done for 4:3 screens. Well, not quite, since at episode 102 it is adapted to widescreens. The battle scenes are well done and transmit all the information you need to see what's going on. Another plus point is that the faces are not all the same, which is not the case for many other anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe last section is enjoyment. As you might have noticed, my enjoyment varied a lot during the watching of KHR, since there are many ups and downs in this show. The downs were the episodes focused on the jokes, which would get boring after being reused throughout the entire series (though there were some very funny moments) or the ones in which nothing happened. The most enjoyable parts were mostly the battles, though some of them were not that well done. And as I mentioned before, I really liked the conclusion; and the combination of all I have written gave me my final score: 7.\\n\\n\r\nSo now the final judgement; the question everyone will want to see answered: do I recommend this? Yes\u2026 and no. You see, there are many people who are totally not prepared to wait 20-40 episodes to see things become more entertaining. These people should definitely not watch this show. For those who may want to wait that long, you also need to like shonen anime, because this IS a shonen, in the end. If you can meet both requirements, I would say: give it a shot! (pun intended).\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, and I appreciate any feedback.\\n",

            "content": "Worst piece of sh!t I've seen in a long time. First off, I've seen this up to the end of the Future arc and to be damned honest its probably one of the worst decision Jump's ever made about serializing a manga. It was decent and readable when the author thought of just making a simple comedy, it was actually pretty interesting when the author created some interesting fighting styles to counter the ongoing struggles with antagonists but what really pushed me over the edge was the fact that the characters was blatantly uninteresting. \r\nThe love interests of the main protagonists spend at least 20episodes just spending time cooking in the kitchen and for that matter we don't need the director to cut back to the girls talking about stuff like doing their best or wishing them luck in the middle of a battle no less.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the author did not think very well ahead in his manga because it was simply one big shonen manga cliche after another. The simple fact that the supporting casts were better and far more fascinating PEOPLE than the main character shows concerns of how this should have been cancelled long ago. I don't want to spoil but a simple wiki search could explain how the manga even fails at giving good continuity because Ring technology was developed in the future so having it being used by new antagonists in the past shows how rotten the story has become. \\n\\n\r\nHowever the actual art and sound of the anime was top notched but whatever enjoyment I had been flushed down the toilet due to bad characterization and very poor pacing similar to Dragon Ball Z the anime.",

            "content": "This is my first time reviewing and also one of the first anime that I truly enjoyed so far so I decided that it certainly deserves a review! First off, even though I haven't completed this yet, I'm already aware of alot of details (because of my bad habit of reading spoilers) and I think that it's really a shame that it's already ended. Anyway, I almost gave up on this anime because of the dragginess at the start, but once I got to the main plot I was pulled in slowly and got addicted.\r\nStory:\r\nLike many others, I'm going to agree that the first fewepisodes did not have much action going on (like action-action) and was just full of comic relief. It's fine, though it set my impression on this anime and I thought it was going to be like this forever so I almost gave up on this until my friends told me that it would get better. Anyway, the story only comes in later and I like how it slowly gets better and better with every coming episode because it draws me in quite well. Also, the idea of a mafia is unknown to me and I think that the story is pretty interesting and uncommon.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI'm not going to lie, the first few episodes the characters didn't look very good, and the art at first turned me off abit, but I was glad because after that as the story progressed the art got better too. The battle scenes lasted long enough, not too long and not too short. Character designs were also quite cool, especially for the main characters but I'm not going to reveal anything so you'll have to slowly watch for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound! The background music fits with every scene, especially the comic relief! I've never actually gotten any goosebumps from animes before, but this is the first time I've gotten it and it's when they fight. The soundtracks in the background somehow makes the character super cool and stuff and it makes me kind of awe-struck by the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nMy favourite part. The characters are just so special in their own individual ways, and there flaws are also balanced with their characters, so it doesn't seem like they're too perfect. The protagonist has an unexpected personality that I don't usually see alot because protagonists are usually cool and all that, but this protagonist gets better as time passes. You can see the characters developing as well, and sometimes if I were to look back I'd go \"wow, they've really been through alot!\" because that's exactly the kind of feeling it gives me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed it thoroughly, especially at the later parts! The comedy relief helps alot, especially when in serious situations! I personally love comedy myself, and the comedy has scored alot of points with me. This anime also knows when to be serious and when not to be, which also makes it more enjoyable. The fillers are also not very shallow and boring like the ones I see in some other animes and in fact I like them alot. I think through the fillers I get to see the characters' different sides (cute ones especially).\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI'd say I really love this anime! And I'm going to watch it slowly so that I will get to end later. I'm really glad to have persevered and if you're planning to watch this, please persevere like me and don't give up! Because as it goes on it gets better and better :D",

            "content": "I get the feeling there are little to non critical reviews for KHR, so I'm gonna give it a try (and yes, I AM biased and a bad writer)\r\nKateikyoushi Hitman Reborn! starts as an gag series with flat humor, after 20 episodes is shifts to a shounen-fight. With that change the overall comedy elements get lessen, but they are still present.\r\nThe comedy in KHR is mostly aimed at children and does not have any deeper elements to it, expect for some absurd showings of their running-gags edging to satire. As said, the comedy is mainly made out of simple character traits and resulting running gagsor punch lines.\\n\r\nEach and every character in this show gets their own trademark line or trait. Something like dere-archetypes just a bit more overdrawn and without any good explanation for that behavior, but we'll later have a look at the characters.\\n\r\nReturning punchlines and the sometimes high pitched voices we have in KHR are things that often have a pretty good affect on children, because it sticks in their heads and sounds friendly and funny to them.\\n\r\nIn addition to that the story has some comical elements to it. Mostly the exaggerated situations the protagonist Tsuna has to face or the exaggerated way he has to face simple situations. Getting shot and regretting not having lived to the fullest, thus getting \u201cDeathperated\u201d and doing the stuff he would regret otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nWhat most people really appreciate about this anime is the action that starts after like 20 episodes. Similar to the humor, the action has no proper build up. An essential element of a Shounenbattle would be an exciting and diverse training that makes the character overcome an obstacle and lets them grow as a character.\\n\r\nKHR has a good amount of training arcs, which are presented in a different way than an usual show would do. The style of those arcs presented just like the gag stroyline in the beginning. A baby teasing the protagonist with a ridiculous task or some other burden they have to face to overcome their weakness. Thus we get to see a mix of action-battles and comedy for each trainings arc. Sadly we don't really get to see any real struggle, the characters just get a new ability or are suddenly just stronger than before. So the most important thing for a good written and growing character is missing and we get to watch the same cast without any changes for 203 episodes, just the battle-system grows.\\n\r\nThe actual action was not too bad. We have some average animations and a cool battle-system. On the other hand we have the story, which forces itself in every single fight. Because of that every fight comes down to an one versus one, even though 10 people could interfere. The tactical deepness also gets other thrown, either it is just told as an simple creep-power show-off or they overcome everything with sheer plot armor. \\n\\n\r\nLets have a look at the characters.\\n\r\nAll of them are presented as simple minded beings only showing us their one character trait used for comedic purposes. The main character Tsuna is a crybaby and after 200 episodes he still is. The only character development we get is his Deathperationmode. He gets super badass taking on every burden, every enemy, every fight, but this sudden change just makes the character absurd and every obstacle he overcomes gets boring to watch.\\n\r\nEven thought there are some attempts to make the characters look deep or really cool or whatever, it only scraps on the surface concluding in an even lesser state of an actual character, for example: \\n\r\nThe girls in the anime eventually, after 150 episodes, start to question what exactly the reason is the protagonists even have to fight. Every protagonist is outrageous when they think about the fact they would harm those cute little girls with the truth! But leaving them without explanation in a completely deracinate environment, literally hiding in a secret base after they were warped into a different environment and being attacked by some flying maniacs, is okay?! The jokes here is, the girls change their minds because they see how hard everyone fails without their unconfined help (in the kitchen... they literally only cook and stoppage for one day to get their answer). At least they're still informed about the situation.\\n\r\nAnd that is about as deep as it gets. Maybe every now and then a good idea comes up to strengthen the writing of the character, but that's just too little and it simply does not affect the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, it is just not engaging, we have a bunch of memeing characters and memeing action. The story we experience is not told, it is forced upon Tsuna. Reborn just tells us that he has to do something, otherwise the whole family will be in trouble. Crybaby Tsuna cries about how he doesn't even want the responsibility and gets forced into a training-arcs. If it wasn't for the bad storytelling the story would actually has it's points. But it's told in such an unrelatable fashion, due to the fact that we only get to experience the fights and the training. The whole story we get is in long exposition scenes where every character present interrupts the story with a running gag.\\n\\n\r\nI've already covered the art in the review for the action, it's just average. Some ED/OPs look nice, some scenes look good, but it is the same old long running shounen that has 90% reused animations. Trust me on that percentage.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST was average too imo. I liked some tracks and like 3 OP/EDs. The main action theme was the most memorable from it, just like any other shounen it pumps you up for the unbelievable counterattack from the protagonists after avoiding a pinch or when they show off a new or awesome ability.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it felt dragging and boring, even the hyped up moments were lame, because the whole series lacked a good writing and build-up. KHR only relies on running-gags and simple creep power exchanges without any character deepness or development. Because of that, everything that it does right, falls flat.\\n\r\nI hope I could help people with this review or people who disagree with me are able to see my points. IDC If you still enjoy this show, I just wanted to make a review that's now just praising this anime.",

            "content": "The first time I heard of this anime was when I was searching through the Weekly Shonen Jump by playing J-Stars, and then I found Tsuna and Reborn, and then it all began. I\u2019ll tell you right here and right now, this is the best I have ever seen. Don\u2019t get me started, I can go ahead myself when I want to.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nLet me say that it has such a slow start, but then, after 20 episodes, I went like \u201cOh my god, what is this brilliant piece of work?\u201d. I went out of my mind. However, the slow start stopped me from giving ita 10, but it is still a brilliant masterpiece. The story is, you know, all about Tsuna becoming a mafia boss, but he doesn\u2019t want to, so meet Katekyo Hitman, Reborn! Although it all seems a bit predictable, the presentation of the story was absolutely perfect.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nIt looks like something 10 years old, but it is. That\u2019s what I like about it. The art is very good. Well drawn and well animated. The looks of each character look different from the manga, but they look so good in the anime. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say it looks better, but it looks like a great piece of art, I am easily blown away. Artland has their name say it no better. The art is absolutely magnificent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nOkay, so my opinion on Tsuna in the beginning was not so good, and same with Lambo. However, all the other characters were really good. So meet Tsuna, also called No-Good Tsuna, and meet Reborn, Tsuna\u2019s home tutor, and his guardians, some of them are friends, some are rivals. The way the presented these characters was great, they did very well on the character development, and they did the characters really well, as well as showing the character\u2019s true selves in the end.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack starts off plain and simple, which fits the way it started, but when they switched to the awesome Shonen it is, the soundtrack becomes nothing but brilliance. To be honest, the plain and simple ones were good, too. The openings and endings are really good, and I think the this anime has a really good OST. It matches the whole anime and everything in it, too. An absolutely perfect anime with an absolutely perfect soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed it a lot! This anime had so many things that I could not comprehend, and I think it exceeded my every expectation! I wanted a really good shonen anime that will stay memorable forever and one that exceeds every expectation of mine, which means a shonen anime that will turn out to be an amazing one that will stay as the best forever, and Katekyo Hitman Reborn! gave me what I always wanted.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, sure, overall, is obviously, 10/10. If I had to go overboard, I would say 11/10, because this anime is absolutely beautiful. The most amazing anime I\u2019ve ever seen, and like I said, it exceeded my every expectation. I would even watch every episode day and night, anytime, because this anime is the best anime ever.",

I didn't really like it, I guess because during the first 20 or so episodes they just introduced characters and had it more on the comedy there. But then after that the first arc and villian comes. and it starts to get more of a drama, and comedy theme. it also gives you a little bit of a comedy site of the mafia and hitman. aka stinky martial arts, posion cooking, and clarinets as weapons. it also brings mind wonders and scientific stuff like Box weapons, rings, flames, ten year bazoka, and timetravel. it also shows friendship and getting stronger during battles. I would recommend watching it till the end. im glad I continued to watch it. it shows a different twist style of the mafia.",

            "content": "So i wanted to watch KHR for a long time but something was stoping me and one day when i was sick and had nothing to do i decided to give it a go, and my only wish is that i could have done this earlier as KHR is one of the best and unique shonens out there!\r\nAs im writing this review im listening to the KHR ost called Tsunas awakening. The soundtracks and openings of this show is a huge reason that people wanted to watch Katekyo Hitman Rebon. The soundtracks are beyond amazing and works so well with the actuall story and moment.The openings and ending are one of the most consistent of an anime up til date. \\n\\n\r\nDiffrent people tend to argue over the art style of KHR, as for my self it did not bother me so much. If you can get over the first few episodes then the art style will only get better and better, nothing that should bother you'r enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very unique. It's about a boy who has been a loser his whole life and suddenly one day a 5 year old (adorable) hitman called reborn barges in and tells him that he is choosen as the 10th boss of the mafia family: Vongola. The vongola are the strongest mafia in the world and all of this seems like a joke at the start but will get really serious. I love this story so much cause the whole mafia concept is new and exciting and you get to see Tsun(the protagonist) go through alot during the story. He does not want anything to do with the mafia but have to get stronger in the end to protect his friends from diffrent threats. \\n\\n\r\nSome characters tend to get annoying like the baby lambo and some time the main girls kyoko and haru, but mostly it alright. The main guardians go through alot of character development which is really good and enjoyeble. But the most intresting character is still Tsuna who goes trough alot of change and development. He's not you'r typical protagonist who is strong already and wants to get stronger. He is actually really weak but gets much stronger as the serie progresses.\\n\\n\r\n203 episodes of pure awesommness! It has it's flaws but it definetely one of the best shows out there. The only real problem i have with it is that the show was cancelld and ended before the manga, and the manga also ended before he could become the boss which is really annoying. The producers stated that it was not as popular as they wanted it to be which was not true. But we can all hope for a continuation! (:",

I watched this the beginning of this year, but I never got the guts to submit a review, he he. ;')\r\nHere we have Sawada Tsunayoshi, a middle school student, who by not much luck, is nicknamed 'Loser Tsuna' by all his classmates, assumed to be a failure due to the fact that he's not good at anything. Now, all that may change when he meets the obscure, mafia hitman, Reborn!\r\nWARNING: THE FIRST 20 EPISODES WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO DROP THE SHOW, BUT DON'T, JUSTDON'T.\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThere have been many Mafia animes, and still some are coming up, but what I liked about Reborn! was that it puts its own twist on things. The first 20 episodes are basically like 'daily life' episodes and may make you want to drop it, but don't. I promise you you'll regret it. I dropped it after the first 13 episodes until my brother told me \"Don't drop it, it'll get so good after so don't drop it.\" And I'm glad I continued to watch it. After the first 20 episodes you'll get an action-packed, adventured filled, expedition, I promise you.\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nBecause this is a slightly old shounen, it wasn't in HD when it aired, and the art style was past decent but it wasn't fantastic if you understand what I'm getting at. It does later on get way better quality, so I wouldn't worry very much about the art.\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nAside from the story line, this is where Reborn! DOMINATES. The openings and endings are some of my all time favorite songs. You will not be disappointed at all with the soundtrack. The sounds with the fights and the voices are all very good quality too.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe character development here, in my opinion, was fantastic! But i can't say how without giving out spoilers so, I'm sorry. Just take my word for it.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nIt's a really funny series to watch, I fell off my bed once to how much I laughed and I cried when I got to the end of this series. Not because of the ending itself simply because you get so attached to the characters, you just love them. I wanted more, but I never got it. *tear*\\n\r\n(I feel like overall and enjoyment are like the same fricking thing, but whatever ;') )\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nOverall, Katekyo Hitman Reborn! was a rollercoaster of an anime that I will never forget. Just give it a shot. Its 203 episodes worth watching. Don't overlook it if you ever come across it. When I got the average of my scores, it was a 9, but I added the extra point because I just loved this serious too much to not call it a masterpiece.",

My English is bad as hell, don't mind it.\r\nStory: 10\r\nIf you've watched the first episode of Katekyo Hitman Reborn!, you're certainly thinking \"What the hell.\" Well, you're not alone. At first glance, the plot may sound ridiculous. The first 20 episodes don't have anything to do with the rest of the story, it may get boring at first and you don't want to watch it because it's just farcical since it doesn't have anything to do with the\"real\" mafia (don't get it wrong, the episodes are funny, though). But if you keep up and watch the episodes, you may think this is the best plot ever. You won't find another storyline like this outside.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nWell, I really like the art. The animations are smooth & conclusive, the fighting scenes as well and the characters are well done, too. Sometimes, I really think the characters look f*cking (Pardon my French) badass and accordingly they really look like Bishounen. I hear fangirl-screams in my head. Duh.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI really think the openings and endings are well done. Some of them stuck in my brain for about two weeks and won't vanish. The OSTs & sound-effects fit every situation and the seiyuus did a very good job. I have to say, it's nothing outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nYou won't find many different, outstanding and unique personalities like in Katekyo Hitman Reborn. They mature in every episode. But the character I admire the most has to be Tsuna. He's just hopeless, so he really stands out of all shounen-heroes I know since now. But still, he has real friends who accept him just the way he is. I think he's the character who matures the most out of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment / Overall: 10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series. I was sad when it ended because I got really addicted to this anime and I hadn't anything to watch anymore since then. If you should ever start watching this anime, don't let yourself be fooled! The first twenty episodes may look ridiculous but since it's only twenty, it's not the end of the world. ;D\\n\r\nI'd recommend this anime to everyone who likes shounen with a lot of comedy and an unique background story.",

            "content": "I absolutely LOVE Reborn!!!\r\nHowever at first, I can't say how many times i've started to watch this anime but dropped it during the first episode. I came across Hitman Reborn when i was surfing around Crunchyroll and saw a picture of Tsuna in Hyper mode. I thought he looked awesome and decided to try it, but after a few minutes of the first episode I quickly closed the page. It was childish and absolutely boring (and even though i'm a girl i'm not fond of chibis, rather i like more action or sports anime).\r\nI knew i wasn't giving the anime a chance and i shouldwatch more of it before giving it up completely; even so it was on the bottom of my priority list. About two to three week ago, i finally decided to retry it, one because school would start and it would be annoying to start watching such a long anime when i have to focus on school work.\\n\\n\r\nI will say the first few episode (to about little less than episode 20) were totally nonsense to me. For those episode i would speed watch through them, but the certain episodes caught my attention because of the humor. However, i was a little put off when Reborn shot Tsuna with Dying will bullets and his crazy transformation when hit with them. However, after the plot became more interesting (and even more as the story progresses), I could watch the episodes endlessly until my parents started yelling at me for \"wasting my time.\" The plot is intense (even though it is sometimes lightened by a lot of good humor), and the fights are my favorite parts!\\n\\n\r\nI soon came to love Tsuna even if he is timid and almost lame he always made me laugh when he started to scream for the littlest of things. Later i also grew to love all the characters (well with the exception a few) and Tsuna, Gokudera, and Hibari all made it to my top three favorite anime characters!!!\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing about Reborn that drew me too it was its art. Some people will say it still has a lot to go compared with some other anime, but this is probably on of my favorite anime and manga art out there. Although i know a few people who think the faces are weird, i'm oddly drawn to them and i love their side profiles! The art almost reminded me of Eyeshield 21, but after more thought i concluded that they have their differences, though i preferred Reborn's.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was really good, however i didn't extremely like a few opening and endings (not that it really matters, i skip those but i then to watch through the openings i like). Like naruto Reborn has a set of sounds for certain parts. For example, Hibari usually has his own theme when he appears, and usually towards the climax of a conflict a addicting theme would play that would make my skin crawl with anticipation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i absolutely LOVE Reborn! I enjoyed every episode (after the first few) and sometimes for episodes i really like, i would rewatch it may times! Even though i've just recently caught up to the most recent episodes i've already rewatching all the major fights a few more time than i can count, and i can definitely say i'm planning on rewatching it!!! If you're struggling on watching this, DO NOT DO WHAT I DID AND STOP ON THE FIRST EPISODE!!! YOU'LL TOTALLY REGRET IT!! It's super addicting and the plot is unique and top class, also it moves at a steady pace and doesn't jump around and confuse the watcher. I can say that i'm almost regretful that the anime hasn't finished because it's so difficult waiting for the next episode!!! (I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!!!!) Though i can't even THINK of this anime ending without me almost crying because there won't be anymore! (NOOOOOO!!! I'LL WAIT EVERY WEEK!! SOOO PLEASE CONTINUE FOREVER AND EVER AND EVERRRR!!!!)",

Then, beginning of the month may, I watched the first episode and was really suprised. I started to watch all episodes 'til yesterday and now Im waiting for the next one. So, as you can think, it is really an amazing anime and I couldnt stop watching.\r\nOn the one hand it is really funny and stupid (like Tsuna in his underwear), but on the other hand it is thrilling and full of action. It is admirable how this young people can fightand their will to do something.\\n\r\nSometimes there might be scenes you dont like, but well, it is always like this. For e.g. me, I don't like the love in animes and mangas, just like here. It really annoys me, but I think it is funny too.\\n\\n\r\nBut therefore I even like the scenes with the gloomy Hibari and animals. :D\\n\r\nThe characters, the music and storyline do all fit together .... depending on all points maybe thats the reason why now, after not even one month, it is my favorite anime next to Prince of Tennis.\\n\r\nI think, if you really love to laugh, especially about silly things, like a boy in his underwear going through the city, young boys fighting against stronger ones and giving their best and a mafia family which grows together, then you should watch Kateky\u014d Hitman Reborn!",

            "content": "Katekyo Hitman Reborn is a comedy/shounen/ action anime, told from the view of a male, middle-school student named Tsunayoshi Sawada. The series is almost, if not completely told from his point of view, (I fail to remember any time it wasn't.) and did fit moderately well together. It wasn't completely consistent, as there were some random, filler episodes popping up every now and then mainly for comedic purposes, but it didn't stray too far from the original plot and for the most part amusing, so nothing I would harp about. I have to say, what made this series one of the most interesting was itsoriginality. An infant (emphasis on infant) named Reborn, who is supposedly the most famous hitman on the planet (the anime failed to elaborate more on Reborn's past, unfortunately, but again, nothing I would harp about) suddenly shows up to Tsunayoshi's house, tells the boy he was there to tutor him (and quite the arduous task, as the child legitimately failed at everything.) and throws him into a hell of training, later revealing that this meek, pathetic child was to become a mafia boss. It is not an OVERLY complex story. It does get a bit complicated, especially involving the family matters (mafia family, mind you) but not exactly rocket science. Far from it, actually. Really, most people shouldn't have a problem whereas understanding the plot is concerned. Pacing was, in terms of plot advancement, VERY slow in the beginning, which is probably what kept the anime from getting the recognition it deserved. However, as things got on (third, fourth arc or so) there were little or no problems. Another thing I liked was that it can quite unpredictable at times. Predictable sometimes, but many times unpredictable. There are crazy plot twists that absolutely no one could anticipate (unless they had read the manga), which is very good, especially in Shounen anime, which tend to be repetitive and predictable. These plot twists were rather exciting for me. The show portrayed comedy pretty well. I laughed a good many times through the show, and found most of it very amusing, but there were some that seemed, put very bluntly, awkward. And in some cases, even slightly annoying. Of course, the anime wouldn't have been nearly as good as it was without this humor, so I'll take the good as well as the bad. The ending was... somewhat satisfying. Not abrupt at all, but there were a few mysteries that the anime never solved, and ended in a scenario that left you wondering what would have happened if the series continues, but it wasn't too bad. These mysteries were solved in the manga, so if it is ever animated (something I doubt, after such a period of time, unfortunately) there would be no problems. :D The ending wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. That's really all I can say about it. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that sets this apart from typical shounen was... it wasn't your typical shounen. There WERE friendship themes, undeniably. However, instead of win win win for the sake of your comrades, as many shounen are, in Katekyo Hitman Reborn, there ARE losses. For the most part, not losses losses, but they actually sacrificed for each other instead of powering up insanely at the thought of their friends. Granted, it did happen, but never did it seem forced or typical. It was actually touching to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Katekyo Hitman Reborn was standard, if not slightly higher. Nothing spectacular, but it did its job and didn't bring the series down. For me, it was memorable. I have never seen this particular style in any series before, and, though there is nothing remarkable, I quite liked it. I VERY much like how the characters look, easy to distinguish and... well, the characters look cute walking around town but seriously epic in a battle. They all have their own serious expressions and their normal, ones, unique to their personalities, which gave the story a good mood. The animation however, was very, very good. No complaints. They were smooth, dramatic (sometimes a bit too \\n\r\ndramatic, but makes things a bit more exciting for some people) and just plain fun to watch, especially the battles. You get a clear idea of what's going on, which is one of the key points to truly being able to enjoy such scenes. The quality of the art DID get better throughout the series. Not drastically better, but the change is noticeable. I noticed next to nothing as far as the animation department goes, but it was already good so I have no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nSound was very good. The anime had great soundtracks and background music, which did their job for the scenario nicely. It's not AMAZINGLY great, but great nonetheless. I LOVED the openings for the most part, especially the second and third. Actually, there were rather few that I DIDN'T like. Either way, the openings were great. The endings, however, were very... skippable. Not bad, but not attention catching. Not very memorable at all. The seiyuus did their job VERY well. For the most part, the characters in Katekyo Hitman Reborn were.... eccentric. There were so many scenes that required drastic emotion and gusto to pull off, yet their did their jobs so plainly well. It just seemed natural and was very fitting for the anime. I have absolutely no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that made this series so amazingly lovable, were its lovable characters. There ARE  good number of characters for the show, but every single one was memorable. Each and every character served a kind of purpose or role, no one unnecessary. They were all so different, and fun to watch. The way they interacted was just so realistic. The characters were consistent, and showed significant development throughout the series. Appearances and voices fit them very well. They were well-rounded, each with their own set of weaknesses and strengths. I really did fall in love with all of them, and even the enemies were just so memorable. They all reacted to their situations as their personalities would have. As far as the characters go, I had no problems at all.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this VERY much. It is a personal favorite and I remember I dearly, even considering rewatchng all 203 episodes. I laughed, cried, grinned like a fool... it could be rather touching at times. And, I have to admit, I was disheartened when I finished. After I read the manga (which you will be driven to do after you're done) I was even more disheartened, as there were many things that happened in the manga that SHOULD be animated. But alas, low chance after so many years. Put very simply, I ADORED this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved it. I LOVE it. The only thing that kept me from giving this a 10, was the random filler and awkward beginning. Thing is, with this series, you have to be patient. Though the first 30 or so episodes show little plot development, you really shouldn't skip it. Even without the plot development, there IS character development, there IS bonding between the characters, and unless you tough out the first 30, you most likely won't be able to grasp how deep their bonds are, what their interactions symbolize later on in the series. It also gives you more time with them by the time it's over, and probably enjoy it even more. So, I wouldn't recommend skipping the first bit, no matter how irritating it can get. (Tsuna's boxer transformation DO cease eventually. I did find this first arc amusing, but these transformations were undeniably irritating.) I would recommend this to any shounen, comedy lover, and even any shounen, so long as they can tough out the first bit because it does get INCREDIBLY good later on, and you'll be happy you didn't miss anything by the time the series is over. I would NOT recommend watching this after the manga, because the anime will seem hellishly slow. \\n\\n\r\nSo, this is a very good anime. I hope you found this review helpful and, if you decide to try the anime, find it to your liking.",

Along the way Tsuna gains friends but for Reborn he thinks of them as Tsuna's subordinates in the mob. They encounter fights with other mob families as well as internal feuds in the family. Reborn is the one responsible for shaping Tsuna to be a powerful man when it comes to fighting using specialized bullets that makeTsuna invincible.    \\n\\n\r\nThe first 15 episodes are not one of the finest moments in anime history. Starting viewers need to have some patience since the first few episodes focus on character meetings and small developments and this is done using comedy. The comedy presented here is so forced and just completely unfunny. There are a few moments where you will giggle but its not enough to be a complete comedic episode. But once you get to the main story arcs, it gets really good. The story and fighting scenes are amazing. You will be mesmerized by the logic of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe every character has their own quirks and my favorites include Haru Miura,Hibari Kyoya, Gokudera Hayato and I-Pin. There are also a lot of theme songs from the series that will make you hum like crazy. These includes Michishirube (1st ED), Famiglia (15th ED) and Canvas (16th ED). Animation is crisp and clear and I replay some of the greatest episodes I've seen (Ep 182- Silent Storm is a good one).\\n\\n\r\nI recommend that you should watch this. Its 203 episodes long. I know you wouldn't fully enjoy the beginning but once you get to the serious stuff, it will drive you wild and crazy!",

Reborn claims to be the world\u2019s greatest Hitman and has come to Tsuna in order to train him to become the next leader of the mafia group called the \u201cVongola.\u201d Tsuna thinks the whole thing sounds extremely dangerous, but as much as he tries to escape his fate as mafia boss, Reborn forces him into it. Reborn has strange bullets called \u201cDying Will\u201d bullets that cause Tsuna\u2019s clothes to fly off (except his underwear conveniently) and give him incredible strength to accomplish whatever goal he needed to do when Reborn shot him.\\n\\n\r\nWith Reborn leading him along, Tsuna slowly begins to become more popular and even starts getting friends like the intelligent delinquent Gokudera Hayato, the baseball obsessed Yamamoto Takeshi, and the little annoying bovine broccoli Lambo. All Tsuna wants to do is not fail at life, get together with his crush Sasagawa Kyoko, and live a normal life, but that doesn\u2019t happen.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, Tsuna, along with the 6 Vongola guardians that Reborn and him eventually assemble, are forced into conflict after conflict. Their bonds grow (well most of them do) over the course of the anime and they gain incredible powers.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s enough of a summary without trying to spoil anything, so I\u2019ll give my opinion on the plot now. As someone who\u2019s not really a fan of slapstick comedy, I did have to push myself a bit to get through the Daily Life Arc early on. In a way that is bad and good, they split up the arc into three segments with real plot/action in between. It's nice that it's split up, but at the same time it does take away the from somewhat from the flow of the plots it separates. The Daily Life Arc is mainly just there to introduce characters, have a little development, and then it\u2019s just filler comedy for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nHowever once that\u2019s over, the story really picks up and become much more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style undergoes a big change around 60-70 episodes in due to the fact that the manga did so as well. The main change is just how much better all of the characters look. Still, in the beginning, the art is pretty unimpressive. Like many long-running shows (like Naruto and One Piece), the first few episodes are very lazy when it comes to detail in backgrounds. A lot of fight scenes could have been done better, and even later in the anime, they sometimes choose to focus on side characters talking rather than showing the action. But the action scenes, when fully shown, are awesome with the final few episodes of the show having some of the best animated action scenes I've ever seen. The character designs are where the art really shines as they are not only interesting, but unique among the other characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in this show is awesome. Tsuna\u2019s VA, Kokubun Yukari, and Sasagawa Ryouhei\u2019s VA, Kiuchi Hidenobu, especially have to go through such huge changes throughout the show and they pull them off perfectly. Tsuna has several different modes and has different voices for each one (and by that I also mean wimpy Tsuna and much less wimpy Tsuna as well). Still there are a few problems. Lambo is almost always annoying (he\u2019s voiced by the same person as Naruto, Takeuchi Junko) and Tsuna starts out sounding very annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is another area where I\u2019m very conflicted. As much as I love the songs used during the serious scenes (especially \u201cTsuna Awakens\u201d and \u201cTrinisette\u201d), the music used in the beginning and during comedic scenes later on is very basic and really does not add much to the at-times-ridiculous comedy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show managed to take characters who all seemed fairly boring and comedic and managed to create one of my favorite character casts ever (though I still find Lambo annoying). Sawada Tsunayoshi has one the best developments ever from a wimpy, pathetic, hopeless mess into a less wimpy Vongola Boss with many friends. And really, all Tsuna cares about are protecting his friends no matter what it takes in order to make sure that they are all still together at the end of the day.\\n\\n\r\nAs for his guardians (I won\u2019t mention them all due to spoilers) they are also exceptional and development alongside Tsuna. His self-proclaimed right hand man and first friend, Gokudera Hayato uses dynamite to fight. Gokudera came all the way from Italy to meet Tsuna, and is quickly impressed by him. Yamamoto Takeshi takes the whole mafia thing as a joke and becomes friends with Tsuna. Still, when Yamamoto gets serious, he gets really serious (whether it\u2019s about baseball or fighting for his friends). Sasagawa Ryouhei is the loud older brother of Tsuna\u2019s crush (Kyoko). He took up boxing after he promised Kyoko to never get into fights with other guys again. Hibari Kyoya is a strong boy and the leader of the Disciplinary Committee who keeps to himself and loves nothing more than Namimori Middle School. He only respects Reborn and never considers himself part of the group with everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Reborn, there is a lot of mystery surrounding him. He\u2019s a baby with incredible strength, knowledge, and fame as a mafia Hitman. He tutors Tsuna in everything from schoolwork to fighting to making friends. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent as well with Dino, I-Pin, Haru, Bianchi, and everyone else that is drawn to Tsuna and his family.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI was really wavering back and forth between 8 and 9 for this category until the very end. Despite it\u2019s slow start and bad fillers arcs, Katekyo Hitman Reborn is a really interesting and enjoyable anime. It has plenty of great plot twists and there are several characters who seem unimportant at first but end up being necessary later on. If you like similar shounen/action/nakama shows like Fairy Tail, One Piece, and Naruto, then I recommend watching Katekyo Hitman Reborn! The show really got interesting for me around Episode 75 so if you can make it that far, then I think you\u2019ll really enjoy it.",

            "content": "Katekyo Hitman Reborn was a very hard anime for me to get into for several reasons.  First, when I saw how many episodes were in the show, I was already a little anxious of what was to come.  I have a hard time watching series longer than 60-80 episodes.  Not only that but since it is a subbed only show, and for the longest time I despised subs, and still prefer dubs, I found it very hard to watch at times.  I will do my best to review this show unbiased though.\r\nTsunayoshi Sawada is pathetic in every sense of the word.He fails in everything he does, whether it be sports or school work, or anything else, he simply fails.  He has no natural ability whatsoever.  Or so he and everyone else thought until all of a sudden an unnatural baby called Reborn shows up in his life and becomes his tutor, completely flipping his life upside down, revealing that he is to be successor to a large mafia family known as the Vongola.\\n\\n\r\nThat is the premise of the show.  And lets face it, how many times has this premise been used?  \\n\\n\r\nKatekyo Hitman Reborn is plagued with the downfall of most modern anime which is three things.  An unspeakable amount of filler, going so far as the last season.  Minuscule character development, as well as having an overabundant cast.  And plotholes as far as the eye can see.  To explain myself without getting into the later arcs of the show, lets just use Reborn's Deathperation shot to explain this.  The theory behind the deathperation shot is that if you are shot with it you will be killed, but will come back to life with the desperation to commit yourself to the thing you regretted when you died as if your life is on the line.  But on several occassions throughout the show, they have moments where Tsuna obviously does not want to and has no reason to regret not doing something that he comes back to do..if this is not a plothole I don't know what is.  And for those who HAVE seen the entire show....that is NOT in any way how time travel works!!!  It would have taken one episode, ONE episode to fix things and no one would have been in danger, But this show has its head so far up its own anus at times....*sigh*  And I'm not even a scifi junkie or anything like that.  I just hate it when they try to use something scientific or unoriginal in an anime and don't even think it out properly.\\n\\n\r\nWith over half the episodes being filler, I could definitely forgive this show if it had some good humor.  And i can see how some people could find...a rare gem of humor here and there throughout.  I personally though found myself not laughing at any of the overused jokes in this series.  The entire series is comprised of one trick ponies and has no qualms with beating a dead horse.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story as I said is so full of plotholes its not even funny, but not only that, they feel it necessary to have a fourth of every episode dedicated to telling you what happened before.  And not in a classy manner, but in a way that entire clips from up to ten previous episodes  are incorperated into the intro, also having entire episode dedicated to showing you the most boring parts of previous fights or 'important' scenes to tell you what's going on.  The anime is NOT that hard to follow!!  Not only that but the pacing is so eratic that its rediculous!!  It doesn't have pacing is all i can say.  Having up to 12 episodes for 4 hours, and then having a single episode tak up 12 days.  Having episodes where you feel like its days on end then telling you this all happened in one day.  Having the people relax for 6 days when they should be training then training for like 8 when their time limit was 10 days, but hey!  What ultra villain would keep track of time?!  In a nutshell here is the entire story.  Tsuna and friends train with a tutor or two for dozens of episodes and this is only after all the filler, then a bunch of fights with overpowered enimies that make their training seem futile, but in the end the power of freindship saves the day, making all of the previous episodes completely null.  Rinse.  Repeat.  In all honesty this series could have been formatted down to 64-72 episodes and it really would have been a show worth watching!!\\n\\n\r\nI find it hard to believe it myself that i was able to sit through the 203 episods of this show.  But I know why I was able to.  I have a weakness for friendship related stories.  And some of the combat, though predictable was a lot fo fun to watch.  The art itself isn't very glamourous, but it does what it sets out to do.As such the music is only slightly above average on rare occassions.  But when those occassions come it usually got me pretty pumped up.  \\n\\n\r\nSo the final verdict is...watch it if you are curious and have time but I would never suggest this show to anyone who had a mentality over that of a 12 year old.`Unless they were obsessed with other overhyped shows like Bleach and Naruto  (I did enjoy some of Bleach and am still reading the manga and enjoyed the Naruto manga so don't get me wrong).  Enjoy the show if you decide to give it a chance, and just ignore most of the filler is the only advice I can give you.  Btw...there is no straight man.",

            "content": "Katekyo Hitman Reborn, is the very definition of \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\".\r\nThe series was originally supposed to be a gag comedy, but it got changed to more of a battle shounen archetype, transitioning around episode 20-30.  \r\nWhile the first 20 episodes had a few laughs it wasn't that interesting HOWEVER! By no means does that mean you should skip these 20 episodes. \r\nThe job of these episodes is to set up the scenario and make you comfortable with all the characters.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story starts off very shallow, but later on, it actually gets quite interesting and takes on a couple morelayers. This is especially true with the last arc that was adapted with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nSince Katekyo Hitman Reborn, is a little bit of an older show, the art style can feel a little lackluster in the beginning, but it at least get's up to a point i would still consider good, so don't let that put you off.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nReborn doesn't have that much going for it, in the aspect of sound. It does have a few good openings/endings and also a couple of good soundtracks including \"Tsuna awakens\", but overall nothing really stands out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters each have their own little quirks, which you will most likely grow to like over the span of the anime. But what's most interesting is how the characters match up with the attributes of their rings (it'll make sense if you watch it) \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 \\n\r\nTo be honest, if the 20 first episodes were done in the same style as the rest of the anime, enjoyment may have been put at a solid 9, but the start was a little too slow for that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall it's a well made shounen, however if you're very impatient i don't think this anime will be up your alley, as you have to sit through 20 episodes of lighthearted comedy, before it gets to the serious part. However if you don't mind the lighthearted comedy, you like battle shounen, and you're looking for something to keep you occupied for a while, this anime will definetly suit your taste.",

            "content": "At first I was reluctant watching this knowing the theme is about mafia and seeing the number of episodes it's quite a lot, 203.. (well I'm not really following anime with hundreds of episodes, as it is tiring to catch up). but thanks to a strong persuasion from a good friend of mine, I ended up watching it. Honestly, Katekyo Hitman Reborn! (or I'll write later as KHR) exceeds my expectation. There are many things to love from this show. \r\nStory 9/10\r\nIt has strong idea, good, flowing storyline about mafia. Despite its seemingly serious theme, KHR managed to address it in fun and lighthearted way.Even though KHR may stray from the original mafia culture, I can feel the strong bonds they usually have in mafia families. \\n\\n\r\nIt introduces new concept of power - the dying will flames. The dying will flames are somewhat like the 5 elements, just this is related to the sky. It has exciting battle scenes and powers, fast paced and guaranteed not making you bored. To add in, there are episode recaps after arcs so you won't forget what was happening before. Each of the battles are relevant to the progress of the story as well as the development of the characters. The story progresses to be darker and more serious, but still maintains its humor and jokes we love so much from this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThe art (character design, background, animation) here is improving. At the beginning of the series it may look quite simple and flat, however it progresses as the story goes. It gets better and more amazing, especially the Choice battle!! The animation for the last few battles is so fluid for its year I love it so much! \\n\\n\r\nThe character design, while typical shonen, is memorable and unique, differ from each character to the extent you can spot who is it even from the shadow / silhouette.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe OSTs are remarkable, it feels Western in relation to the mafia theme yet still maintains Japanese feel. There are memorable theme songs too (the epic Tsuna Awakes and those piano tunes every time Hibari enters..) adding more plus points to this show. The opening & ending songs are nice to listen and if you notice, also have fitting lyrics to its respective arc.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nThere are a lot of lovable characters with a great range of personalities that make you remember them. I applaud the remarkable seiyuus who portray their characters really well. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development here is one of the best among anime in my opinion. The initially dame-dame-no-dame (literally hopeless) main character Tsunayoshi later progresses and grows into a reliable leader along with his famiglia (mafia family) members. Not only they receive power-ups to their unique abilities, their characters mature and it feels like growing up with them. \\n\\n\r\nThe bond and friendship between the characters is so strong with trust. I realize this is why there are so many pairings & ships in KHR fandom. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10 \\n\r\nWarning!!! KHR is highly addictive with cuts at the right moments & sometimes gritting cliffhangers at the end of the episodes. I advice you to get your hand on all of the episodes before you watch because YOU JUST CAN'T STOP. \\n\\n\r\nOne bad thing about this anime is... they didn't make the whole manga into anime. I wish someday they will make the continuation of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like action and comedy, along with superpowers and inclusion of slice of life and friendship, then this anime is for you. It is quite light show, fun, although progressing to be darker towards the end, yet still maintaining its comedic and heartwarming scenes.",

With your enemies that you learn to be against revealing that they are trying to help and their past ties with other characters (sorry for being so vague but it is hard not to spoil anything here) being surprising and keeping me happy. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall i think this anime had great potential but was completely ruined by one thing, repetition. It is as if the producers just couldn't think of anything so they would repeat the same kind of scenes 10 times over! (this part may contain mild spoilers) I mean really, they are not strong enough to do something so then boom! There are these half rings they get, yay they are stronger now, but oh no! Even more powerful enemies and boom! They need to fight to get the other half of the rings and wallah they are powerful enough now, but wait look even stronger enemies! Now they can use the rings to summon animals, good they can defeat them now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOHWAIT even STRONGER enemies, its ok because now the ring evolved and is even BETTER, they can beat the enemies now!!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall the incredible repetition of this anime destroyed it for me, it had so much potential to be a great watch but it just couldn't keep up.\\n\r\n6/10",

Like almost everyone else, I thought to myself, \"wtf is this baby doin' here?!\" and then I kept watching and waiting for something good to happen in the story because sooner or later, the animators would get a hint that simply changing Tsuna's underwear every episode wasn't going to cut it anymore.\r\nRight now, I'mat the edge of my seat everytime I'm watching it!!  I love the characters and storyline.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this anime to anyone :D",

            "content": "This series was initially shown to me by a friend.  While the first episode was quite...interesting, I soon became hooked to this series.  \r\nStory: I think that the plot line was very unique. Compared to other series, Katekyo Hitman Reborn takes a nicer outlook on the mafia, and glances over the darker portions of it.  While this may be both good/bad, the different outlook helped to build an interesting plot centered around the main character.  \r\nThe anime took a long time to start up (I enjoy anime like Darker than Black), but once the action started it had me hooked.I personally do not enjoy watching gag/comedy series, and as such the daily life arc was rather boring.  Even so, I would rate the overall plot a 10/10 because of how the plot escalates and twists as the series moves on.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Compared to the manga, the anime's art is much neater and nicely drawn.  Although there are few moments (Gowadera) that the art is a little...off, the art was very nicely done.  As the series progressed, the art level improved, and by the end of this series it was great.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtracks and OPs are great.  The soundtracks were able to bring out the mood of the scenes very well, and the character songs are also very fitting.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in this series are simply amazing.  Every character has a unique personality, one that fit both the gag portion and the action portion very well.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Aside from the first few episodes, I loved the series.  The plot and the arcs were nicely crafted, ones that could hold a viewer's attention for long periods of time.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall I rate this series a 10/10.",

            "content": "Hitman Reborn! A show that is loved by many, and despised by those who dropped the series too early. A shonen that stood out amongst its competitors in a time where shonen anime was at its peak with popular shonens like Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece at the height of their popularity and other titles such as Eyeshield 21 were getting a lot of attention from fans. Hitman Reborn is definitely a must watch shonen, and I'll explain why.\r\nStory - 7\r\nProbably the biggest criticism many people have for this anime is that the series starts extremely slow. Just like Yu Yu Hakusho which came outbefore Hitman Reborn, this series was originally meant to be a gag slice of life manga with supernatural elements, and of course the anime adapted the entirety of that arc which is formally known as \"The Daily Life Arc\". Jokes fall flat, episodes are extremely repetitive with the same jokes being used every episode. Characters are unlikable, and the only character with redeeming qualities was reborn. I had a hard time watching the beginning. In fact, I originally dropped this series after 14 episodes. I just really hated the series as it did not progress the story at all aside from introducing key characters and background information. However, when this anime picks up and becomes a fully fledged battle shonen, it's a joy to watch. Episodes are filled with tension, Tsuna stopped being a whiny b****, and the \"family\" finally had their time to shine and showed what they were capable of. Fight scenes are great, and seeing Tsuna in his Deathperation mode never failed to give me goosebumps. The latter half of the series is fantastic. Although the beginning is extremely slow, I felt that it was worth watching after the series begins to gain some momentum. But it still drags the story down which could've been an amazing battle shonen from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\\n\r\nOne of the better animated long running shonens out there. Artland does a fantastic job where TOEI and Studio Pierrot would fail in their adaptions, and that is the consistency of their animation. The animation is never choppy or jarring, and the fight scenes are fluid and easy to follow while also being extremely exciting and filled with adrenaline. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the beginning of the series is forgettable, but as the series progresses on, the music just keeps on improving. Whenever something amazing happens, and the music begins to play, I get extremely excited. My personal favorite is \"Tsuna Awakens\". Quite possibly one of the most intense character themes i have ever listened to. The music is also consistent with the premise of the series. It doesn't go full on italian inspired with their music, however you can sense that the music was somewhat influenced by European music, especially with their heavy reliance on brass instruments for their compositions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning of the series, Tsuna WAS without a doubt the most annoying shonen protagonist I have ever watched. His constant complaining and his cowardly nature is extremely unlikable. Although his reactions to things that are occurring in the series are how majority of us would react to them, which could be seen as a positive attribute to his character creation, however I find it annoying. A lot of his actions seems selfish, especially when it seemed like he cared about his own wellbeing more than his friends, although the series would keep on suggesting the fact that he was selfless and brave, but he showed no signs of that early on. However, after a certain arc (I will not say because of spoilers), Tsuna has grown to become a fantastic character. What's great about him is that he has no ambitions, and yet he still has the drive to become strong. Tsuna's transformation from an annoying f*** to a badass is interesting to watch, and makes him one of the best shonen protagonist JUMP has to offer. Side characters such as Gokudera and Yamamoto were treated as jokes in the beginning of the series, but we developed as the series went on. Kyoko is the most boring character out of everyone because her only purpose is to be a love interest to Tsuna, which is extremely infuriating because she has the potential to become a great character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\\n\r\nAside from the beginning of the series, the anime was enjoyable. It was great, and a joy to watch. It was like having a full meal course with the WORST appetizer possible, but the main course and the desert was fantastic, so much so that I completely forgot what I had as an appetizer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to Shonen Jump's lineup, this series is usually forgotten and overshadowed by the Big 3, Hunter X Hunter, Yu Yu Hakusho, Saint Seiya, Death Note, Shaman King, etc. However I think this is one of the best anime adaptions of Shonen Jump's lineup. If you are a fan of Shonen Anime, then this is a must watch.",

            "content": "I've been dying to make a review for this show since like forever! Didn't want to write one in the middle of the series so I waited until I'm done and DAMN that took a lot of time!\r\nI'll start with negatives since they are just too glaring for my eyes. Also this review will be spoiler full!\r\n1) Who in the right mind starts series with filler? I wouldn't mind if it had some point but it didn't! It was a replay of same jokes and scenarios all over! The whole character introduction should take maximum 10 episodes and even that is too much! If Ididn't hear that actual story starts at around episode 20, I would've dumped it long time ago!\\n\\n\r\n2) Jokes are too repetitive what makes them boring! Some weren't funny to begin with... Come on Gokudera, get yourself together and stop getting sick every time you see Bianci! Besides glasses don't change her that much -_-\\n\\n\r\n3) WTF with all those Pokemons?! Box weapons totally ruined action in the series. For the first 100 episodes it all was about skills and techniques and now it became \"My Pokemon is better than yours!\" \\n\r\nThere are only few characters left that still rely on their physical strength, most of them rely on box powers what makes the users look pathetic especially when they start to run away after their box got crashed! I mean seriously, how are you supposed to take those villains seriously?! I really miss Gokudera's bombs, it feels like he has totally forgotten about them =/\\n\r\nWhat was the point of learning to use them till now?\\n\\n\r\n4) The whole future arc was a disaster after disaster. For one, who in the right mind replaces future characters with old cast in an instant? What's the point? And why Lambo of all people had to be replaced right from the start?! Ok, we were given the reason to it but still! Hibari and Ryouhei got replaced only towards the end!\\n\\n\r\n5) It's not really a minus but I'm still confused as to why they just couldn't kill Byakuran back in the past? \\n\\n\r\n6) It always bothered me how everyone were so easily able to control their boxes and knew what powers they had without training. There was this conflict at the start of the arc but the more series progressed the more it got forgotten. I still don't get how Ryohei learned to make copies of himself...\\n\\n\r\n7) For series about mafia there is a huge lack of deaths, especially on good side. I don't remember anyone dying at all! Actually no, lying. Two characters died towards the end but since everyone went back to the past and can change everything, it doesn't count.\\n\\n\r\n8) Characters! I didn't meet anyone dumber and more 2 dimensional than them! Especially during first 70 episodes!\\n\\n\r\nIt took almost 50 episodes for Yamamoto to realize that it is not a game and actual war! Just how dumb do you have to be?! There are bombs and rockets flying your way and you think its a game?!\\n\\n\r\nRyohei is the biggest idiot out there! When he said that he can't destroy huge rock with bare fists my jaw dropped. I was sure that he would storm it without thinking... I guess that's the point of the series where he started to get some kind of personality and it is already 50 episodes into the series! It took another 100 to finally get some kind of 3 dimensional personality.\\n\\n\r\nHibari... I like quiet and cool characters like Saito from Hakuouki or Kanda from D.Gray Man but this guy takes it to new level! How on earth he became the most popular character of the series is beyond me! He has 0 personality what so ever! The only things on his mind are fighting and his school with which he seems to be in love. 203 episodes passed and I still have no idea why he loves it so much as well as why in the world he is as strong as some professional mafiosi especially at the start of the series. \\n\r\nKanda and Saito at least had some ideals, they had some interests and emotions despite being cold, Hibari has none! What I mentioned above are literally the only things he ever mentions and shows any interest in. Mukuro is probably the only living being in whom Hibari has some kind of interest as well as in Reborn.\\n\\n\r\nLambo... JUST SHUT UP! The most annoying character ever! Why is he among main cast? I don't mind his future self, especially 20 years old one which is damn cool but his baby self should be shut somewhere! I understand that he will become super cool in the future but making him a guardian at this stage is just stupid! Besides where is his real family? Did they just abandon him?!\\n\\n\r\nTsuna why the hell can't you stay in your super form all the time? Whenever he has no flames he becomes a pathetic loser who is scared of a single fly when in the past he kicked some major asses. Whenever he turns into his battle self it feels like if it is a totally different character, their believes, actions, thoughts and speech don't match at all! Pills should change his power level, not his whole character! Beside why is he the only one taking pills?\\n\r\nSuper intuition my ass! Most of the situations where logical! Let's take the moment when G swoped with Gokudera... He seems different? HE IS DIFFERENT! All of his actions were off and no one except Tsuna noticed that! \\n\\n\r\nGokudera... I have weird emotions bout the guy. Most of the time he is such an idiot despite being a genius. I still have no idea why he so blindly follows Tsuna when the guy didn't do anything worthy at the start of the series. No matter how pathetic Tsuna is he still admires him like an idiot and there was never a reason given for that. At first he got excited just to serve Vongola but you would expect a mafiosi to make a fuss about a weak boss at least once!\\n\\n\r\nI also have no idea how Mukuro the enemy could become one of the guardians. At first Vongola kicks everyones' asses, gets angry with them and then 5 mins later welcome them with open arms. Just WTF?! Even Naruto didn't take it to such extremes!\\n\\n\r\n9) I always believed that Naruto and Bleach were sexist but even two combined won't compare to THIS! And it doesn't help that the author is woman! Author, don't you have any self respect?!\\n\r\nAlmost every female character in the series could be described in just this one sentence: \"BACK TO THE KITCHEN WOMAN!\"\\n\r\nThat's literally where they spent most of their time...\\n\r\nWon't bother with Haru and Kyoko.\\n\\n\r\nI-pin, the only real strong female character is completly unapriciated by the author... I-pin got only like 2 small fights! All the rest time she is playing or babysitting Lambo! Why was she introduced at all when she plays no real purpose?! \\n\r\nAnd why didn't she get a ring?! She is ranked as 3rd very potential hitman and she owns Lambo at every age! \\n\r\n25 year old Lambo is cool and all, but he appeared only ones. It also takes 20 years for Lambo to become cool while I-pin is a high class fighter in just 10!\\n\\n\r\nChrome... Mukuro's vessel, nothing more. She is totally useless and barely can do anything. Whenever she manages to make at least one useful illusion, she instantly faints!\\n\\n\r\nYuni, not a fighter again... at least she could heal though even then she didn't do much. Ryohei's kangaroo was of more help -_-\\n\r\nAt least her sacrifice served a purpose.\\n\\n\r\nLal, was very excited to finally see a female that kicks asses but boy was it for long? After one major fight, she gets hospitalized and spends there the last 100 episodes -_-\\n\\n\r\nEnemy side is the same.\\n\\n\r\nFEW! I think that's all I wanted to say...\\n\r\nPositives? Truthfully there aren't any, standard shounen that is aimed for kids. However, since I finished series I guess it did have something good. Arcoboleno were interesting, first 100 episodes of action were entertaining...\\n\r\nAll I can say for sure is that this show is OVER RATED! It doesn't deserve the rating and praise it gets. I can't see anyone older than 12 to enjoy it...\\n\\n\r\nSound and animation are good though.\\n\\n\r\nOver all I can only give it 5. Despite so many negatives it still had something to keep my attention so average mark is right for it. Not higher, 6 is the maximum I could give it.\\n",

The first 20 episodes have a purpose: to introduce all of the characters and give the viewer a clear understanding of everyone's different situations...plus, they're absolutely hilarious!  And then, when actual arcs start, the story is amazing!  And it still manages to slip in some humor, even admist all of the drama.  The characters are great and unique, and the artwork is very well done (in my opinion).  I really enjoy this series, and it's a great, fresh idea for an anime.  I woulddefinetly recommend it!",

            "content": "Well,, first of all this is my first review so I'm concerned I won't be cable of doing it perfectly.. But I'm going to give it everything I have.. Osu!\r\nI started watching reborn after reading few reviews from here and so I have started watching with a note I read in one of the reviews saying that I shouldn\u2019t judge the anime from the first 20 episode and so I did and I\u2019m really glad I did . It only took me 1 week and a half to watch the hole episodes that have been aired without realizing the time and now it\u2019s on myfavorite animes in my list =p ..\\n\\n\r\nThe story is unique and funny there won\u2019t be any episode without you laughing \u201cof course there are serious episodes; p \u201c. It\u2019s about a boy who is called a loser by everyone living with his mom and 1 day a home tutor Reborn comes to his house and tells him that his is the tenth boss of the vongola mafial family ... everything I written in the page =p . well the people who likes animes like Naruto ,one piece.. I think they will like this series too \u2018cause they have the same concept about protecting your friends and helping people who ask you for your help and the comedy \u2026etc, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the stories are the same! Katekyo Hitman Reborn has its own magic spell as well as the others and you well know the differences when you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters & The Drawing ... Well many people judge the anime from the way Tsuna looks like, his hair and well .. the drawing generally ,but by watching a good amount of episodes, you'll  like the drawing and the first look is definitely different from watching about 100 episodes =) .. And when you watch it you will like most of the characters even the evil ones .Most of them have a comedic side where you will laugh non-stopping. I would say that the characters are a main reason for the success of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds are awesome I think that every character has a voice which is made especially for him. I wouldn\u2019t imagine any character having another voice. And for the OP & the ED , they are all great .. you will love them all and the effects are even greater.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was anything that has annoyed me in KHR it would be the long arcs I wouldn\u2019t imagine that I would see an arc that has more than 100 episodes... but that doesn\u2019t mean they are all boring or something .. it just makes me wonder and say \u201cWHEN IS THIS GONNA END!!! \u201cAnd the story walks incredibly slow ..  and sometimes the funny moment happen in a wrong timing \u2026 but the anime is really great and these points doesn\u2019t affect how amazing this anime is I would recommend anyone who likes the shounen animes to watch it \u2018cause it has everything needed like comedy , action , shounen and supernatural \u2026 etc\\n",

            "content": "Hello all!!!!\r\nI have to pretty much agree with everyone who wrote a review on this anime. I never really do this BUT i MUST! the reason why i say this is because like the warnings of the other reviewers BE PATIENT. the first 20 episodes did kind of drag and made me loose interest. I previously attempted to watch this series three times and i stopped at episode 3-4. But once episode 20 hits BOY OH BOY ARE YOU IN FOR A RIDE! I completed this series in 7 days because iT WAS THAT GOOD. I'm sure there are others out there who are likemyself and just get so absorbed that you do absolutely nothing but watch anime. WELL THIS IS IT.\\n\\n\r\nThe story line is awesome! I mean come on guys, mafia+weapons+funny characters=awesomeness!\\n\r\nIt was so intriguing I never experienced this kind of anime in a long time. I feel like the last time i felt hooked was one piece and history strongest disciple kenichi! I loved how the main characters demonstrates true friendship bonds for one another regardless of their age. For instance there is a cow thats pretty much five years old and he is some how related to the mafia! It's hilarious i tell you!\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great! I enjoyed it because the style gave the characters life and it was really \"chill\" art. When i say chill i mean the drawings were easy to look at and i feel that the simplest drawings can produce great meaning and emphasis on its subject. To clearify, one of the main characters name is Reborn and he's this little baby looking guy. But the way the drawings are it gave him SO MUCH character and he is quite the funny one! I also enjoyed how when the anime had it's serious moments the drawings kinda got darker and edgier so it gave it that serious feeling more than the typical \"chill\" moments. \\n\\n\r\nSound-music is awesome espeically the openings! The characters voices suits each of them well and there really not annoying. At first i was like OH MAN WHAT IS THIS BABY?! BUT you adapt and learn to lvoe them!\\n\\n\r\nI just feel like i'll be repeating myself over and over again. All i'm saying to you die heart anime fans that loves humor, have it's serious moments, and love main characters that are willing to die for one another because of their bonds of friendship. Then please i beg of you, watch this anime. It was well worth my seven days!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\na fan.",

To be frank, the anime starts of not that great, the first 20ish episodes are fairly boring and the characters are plainly weirdos. At about 20, the anime becomes one of the biggest masterpieces plot, action and music wise. Honestly, the content is way better and the small amount of fillers present are actually soooo entertaining unlike naruto for example, which get monotonous like 20 per fight at least. The musics, I am shocked that they are not inthe top 10, for me the tsuna awakens is probably the best music ever battle wise. I can agree that some other animes have excellent slightly better music in itself however reborn did the best job so far of fitting the music into the anime, it starts and stops when it needs to, its just perfectly pin point adjusted to make it perfect. So:\\n\\n\r\nPlot: \\n\r\n1-20: Kinda boring\\n\r\n20-203: I adored it, was just sooooooo good couldn't stop watching, whether it's Tsuna or the others\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\n10/10 and it is a pity i cannot grade it higher\\n\\n\r\nAction:\\n\r\n10/10 so fitting thanks to the good animations and the perfect music which enhances it",

            "content": "After watching reborn, i can now say that I'm never watching it in full again. The storyline is, in my opinion...horrible. I gave it a 6. Now i know that giving it a six means it couldn't have been that bad, and it wasn't. It's not the greatest plot, but the characters make it so much better. I have, and will keep recommending this anime to people because it's a stupid but easy plot. One of the main things that keep people from watching it is that it's SO SLOW PACED. I watched the first episode....then i went to episode 23. Sure, i was inthe middle of a battle, but it barely felt like i was missing anything. \\n\r\nThe art sucked at the beginning.....and it didn't get much better. Compared to the manga, the art was like a kindergarten drawing. I give it a four, and I'm being nice.\\n\r\nI don't like being mean so I'm glad I'm done with the bad parts now. The sound was actually pretty good! Looking at the art, you would never expect the sound to be as good as it was. It's a 7 for me. Well done. :)\\n\r\nThe characters. Heh, this will be fun. Tsuna (the main character)was/ is an annoying character. I've never hated a main character as much as I hate him. Every time he talked, I wanted to stop watching. And as if to make matters worse, They put the most annoying, frustrating, infuriating character to ever step foot into a series: LAMBO. If i could, i would've killed him. I WISH I could kill him. And then you have other annoying characters like: Reborn, Haru, Kyoko, Tsuna's Mom, Skull, the Cervello, Ipin, Dr. Shamal, Bianchi, Levi, M.M....THE LIST GOES ON FOREVER. Although i hate a good portion of the characters, I still gave it a 7. It takes skill to make a charcter completely different from another. To have so many characters and still be able to  give them distinguishing personalities earns my respect. Also, not all the characters are retarded! Most of the guardians of the rings, Varia, and Arcobalenos aren't annoying!?\\n\r\nEnjoyment is the highest rated out of all of them. It got an 8. Why? After the incredibly slow pace, dumb plot, annoying characters,lame repeating catchphrases,and random bootleg Pokemon battles, you end up realizing that your actually liking this show in all it's stupidity. I sometimes find myself going back to an episode or a certain fight in that episode. This show never disappoints in the area of enjoyment.\\n\r\nOverall, im glad that i have seen this anime. I feel like it was a very important part in my life. It's rated as a 6 for me, but at the same time, that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it.\\n",

But, after continuous \u2018suggestions\u2019 from my friends, I decided to watch katekyo hitman reborn again and oh boy, I never regret watching a single episode!\r\n(The first 20+ episodes were design to make you drop the anime. But, If you manage to endure the 20+ episodes, congratulations! The real fun starts there!)\r\nUnlike typical shonen animes out there, katekyo hitman reborn has no sudden power up from beingemotional or whatnot, or the typical \u2018always win\u2019 protagonist. However, what keeps the show interesting is the coolness portrayed by the characters in this anime. Another reason why this anime is interesting is the character development. The characters are developed in a realistic time frame. A fine example would be the main protagonist. As you watch the anime, you will realize that he developed greatly, from someone who is reluctant to do anything to someone who would do anything to protect his friends. But there are flaws in the character development though, especially some of the female characters in the show as in the entire series, they show little or no character development at all.  \\n\r\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a shonen anime to enjoy with cool characters and no huge boobs or whatnot that bounces out of nowhere, katekyo hitman reborn is for you!\\n\r\nRating:\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 (You will definitely love the OP and ED)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n",

So, with that out of the way, I shall start reviewing with the latest anime I have finished watching: Katekyoushi Hitman Reborn.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThere is a difference between a bad story, and simply inefficient storytelling. While Reborn! manages to veer out of the former, it doesn't exactly evade the latter. The first twenty episodes are setup for the rest of the series; an incredibly long setup, which isn't exactly helped by the fact thatthe episodes lack any real tension. At first, I thought it was a shonen parody instead of a real shonen, and this made me drop it-- twice, before I convinced myself to give it a last chance. Most people would probably drop it within the first ten episodes precisely because of this issue.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, after those episodes, the anime begins to take on a pleasantly darker undertone, and with them brings character development by droves. Tsuna, the main character, had been a bit of a whiner up to this point; however, by the end of the second arc, he's gained a little more confidence in himself, and has developed a stronger bond with his 'Family' than he had in the first twenty episodes. This development continues with the latter arcs, and in short, what at first for me had been lacking was what turned me into an addict for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you're a fan of comedy, the entire series is chockful of hilarious moments, the first arc being included prominently in that regard. So, don't skip the first arc if you like laughing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nBefore you yell at me for giving this part the lowest score, just hear out what I have to say. While I like the character arc and am fully capable of appreciating everyone's good looks, the younger characters tend to look too big-eyed for my taste (Tsuna, Haru, Kyoko). While Tsuna has regained my favour, I can't say the same about the girls. That aside, the animation isn't bad, and in general the anime's art tends to be okay.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nOkay...I'll get this out into the air firsthand: I'm not especially fond of jazz or western. That doesn't mean I dislike them, either; however, the tracks must be interesting enough to make me listen to them in their entirety--and this is where the first part of Reborn shines through. Each and every jazz/western theme is varied and interesting enough to make me notice it; and they fit the characters to a T. From Lambo's trouble-making to Reborn's out-of-the-blue appearances, the first part of the series covers each and every scene in a theme suitable for it. With all that being said, however, the music adapts to the darker undertones that the later arcs bring up. \\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, while the voices weren't \"tailor-made\" for the characters, I felt that each voice suited the character, even though the difference between normal Tsuna and the *other* Tsuna was a bit startling. If you had to ask my favorite voice within the characters, however, it would have to be that of Reborn's. (So cute!)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\n...where should I even start? This is easily my most favorite part of the series. With characters like the easily cowered Tsuna, the relaxed and easygoing Yamamoto as well the very 'EXTREME' 'Onii-san', it seemed at first like that would be all we would see of the characters. But was I wrong--not only does Tsuna develop with each story arc, but so does the other ten-or-so main characters along with him. If I compared any character in the final arc with how they were when the anime first started, not only are they more confident in themselves, but they show a maturity that isn't obvious unless you look back.\\n\\n\r\n...however, I did have reservations about one character, Haru Miura. While she isn't a bad character or even an undeveloped one, something about her made me want her out of the scene before she even began to speak. In short, she annoyed me. To the very fullest. And that is the reason why I didn't give this section the full score. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nWell, considering I practically ate the entire thing by one week, I would say that I enjoyed it very much. A word of caution, however; if you feel that you're becoming a little dependent on it, take a break. Watch something else. Because after I watched the final episode, I fell into a sort of slump. So. To summarize. Yes, I enjoyed it very much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nReborn! is by no means a masterpiece. A great anime, yes, but it has yet a way to go before it reaches the ranks of Fullmetal Alchemist or One Piece. Here's to hoping it gets a tenth season, however; the manga is only a few arcs ahead now, so maybe it will restart. (And then, maybe I can watch it.) But that's only to hoping. Cheerios!",

            "content": "I must say, Hitman reborn is one of the series out there which is less recognised by many people up till now, although if compared to Bleach and Naruto, i'd say KHR is a much better series, even the fillers which KHR shows is more interesting.\r\nThe story of KHR is surprisingly normal, With a ''got to get stronger'' attitude to the serie, KHR shows a normal storyline, similar to that of kenichi, Naruto, arguably on the other hand, people say that the series shows a more detailed at the same time mysterious storyline, which is seemingly true especially with the mixup of the 10-yr-bazuka.\r\nThe strongpoint of the series is its Character design and Developments throughout the series, there is the Wimpy main character Tsuna, which throughout the serie, develops into a much stronger person. theres the other 'guardians' of the vongola family which shows great courage throughout, not to mension the two characterw which recieved ''best character awards'' of 2007 i believe, Hibari kyoya and Rokuro Mukuro, They are both awsome which makes people stay tuned to the serie.\\n\\n\r\nNot to say much about the art other than its pretty above average, being a less-action more talking type of anime, its to be expected. Another great point of the series is its Soundtracks, 2 of my favourate soundtracks ever is from KHR, Standing Friends and Tsuna's Awaken, they are both awsome. The soundtracks all sync in ''nicely'' with the anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnding words, i give a big -I LOVE IT- to all the people thinking whether they should watch KHR or not, dont hesitate just watch it, Overall 9/10 -BANZAI!!!\\n\\n\r\nGreat series to stay tuned to dont miss out :)",

            "content": "This anime is really good... Oh you want me to elaborate huh. The reason I say is is good because of the characters, story and my overall enjoyment with the series. \r\n1. The Story: The story is great with many twist and turn which will make you think they won't be able to beat this guy or escape this place. The story do have a slow start but honestly those fillers are funny. But it doesn't stay that way. When about the 13th episode rolled around I was ready to drop the anime but if you stay strong (and trust me you will want tostay strong) the story line gets deeper with every episode. \\n\\n\r\n2. The Art: The art is ok, it doesn't do anything great or horrible it's just art. So there is not much to say about art.\\n\\n\r\n3. The Music: The music is good and I like how the soundtrack for each character really really fit how they are as a person. I really like the openings and the ending but some can get dull at times.\\n\\n\r\n4. The Characters: Oh the character are really really unique and so lovable that is why I stated to watch the 20 first episodes you won't regret it after watching the full series. And character development oh let's talk about that. The person who really gets the most character development is Yamamoto because he starts out very carefree about everything then in later episodes he get more and more serious but still maintaining that carefree act and I like it. And that's just one of them because once you watch the series you will see what these characters are like and that is another reason why you should watch the first 20 episode because of character devlopment. And that is a major reason I like the show.\\n\\n\r\n5. Overall: I overall really like this anime if you couldn't tell. If you didn't watch it go now and watch it.",

            "content": "Will Tsuna find a way to concur school life? will his tutor stop shooting him in order to transform? Only one way to find out...\r\nREAD THE MANGA!\r\nOr watch the show, which ever floats your boat.\r\nWhat I have given you is a brief synopsis of the show. There is a lot in 203 episodes but if most of you guys are still watching One Piece, then this should be a walk in the park. \r\nA Brief Review: Starts of slow, ends strong, characters are a blast to watch, sound is awesome, pretty, and cool, art is alright from what I can tell (I'm not to pickyabout the art style of a show), a good watch for anyone who can commit.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9)\\n\r\nThe story is like I said before follow Tsuna in is life as he tries to become the next mafia boss and has reborn tutoring him. It does start off slow and I want to rate it a 10 but, I know some people might be turned away from it because of it. Over the course of the first arc of the seires its a bit sloe following Tsuna's daily life with his friends but afterwards, it gets serious. And let me just say, there are no plot holes when this show ends (well, maybe one). When it ended everything was complete and satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7)\\n\r\nI don't have much to say about this. I'm not an art guy so I don't know much about how good or bad it looks. From what I can tell it was good. It knows when it needs to be serious, action paced, comedic, or calm. I know someone will say otherwise and I don't know much about it, but I did enjoy the art. It's a 7 for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9)\\n\r\nAmazing. Just amazing. Whenever one of the characters stepped out they got there own theme and every time I enjoyed it. Speaking of the characters, their voices match them perfectly. I never thought once that one voice was off or shouldn't belong to one of them. Although they all sound good they are not all unique. Some of the voices I thought blend together. If it wasn't for their distinct personalities I couldn't tell them apart. But i'll get to that more in characters. For now i'll finish off sound with the OP's and ED's. They are fine for the most part. My personal favorite out of the OP's was the first one. It matched the light-hearted nature of the show. The best ED of the show was hands down is STAND UP. Again it matched the light-hearted nature of the show and felt good when it got serious. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10)\\n\r\nI'll only talk about the four characters that you will see if  you watch the show.\\n\\n\r\nTsunayoshi Sawada. (nickname loser tsuna) \\n\r\nTsuna is a failure at most things. He is slow (in the figuring out class questions sense), a cluts, not good at sports, he whines a lot, and he is not what one would call boss material. But, over the course of the show, he grows as a character and drops his  whiny nature. He learns to make the tough decisions a boss should make.\\n\\n\r\nReborn\\n\r\nReborn is a baby with a yellow pacifier around his neck. Shrouded in mystery, Reborn  teaches Tsuna to care for his friends and helps him with his daily life although Tsuna may not see as that. Reborn also has a pet chameleon named Leon. Leon can shape-shift in to anything a gun, a shield, or even costumes for reborn.\\n\\n\r\nGokudera Hayato \\n\r\nGokudera is one of Tsuna's best friend and (self-proclaimed) right hand man. He uses bombs as a weapon and has a bad boy thing going on. He will do anything for his boss. Like a good little puppy. He also tries to show his worth to his boss by proving himself whenever he can, even if he fails miserably afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nYamamoto Takeshi\\n\r\nYamamoto is the star athlete at Nami Middle and one of Tsuna's best friends. Yamamoto is extremly talented and a quick learn to anything he is serious about. He also thinks that Tsuna and Reborn like to play mafia and plays along from time to time. \\n\\n\r\nThere many more characters for this show and they are a likable and each get their own episodes and arcs accordingly. These characters will make you want more of them with each episode you watch. It's a 10 from me. I love the characters and they are the best part of the show next to the action.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall 10)\\n\r\nThis show is good. It may be slow in the beginning, but it lets us get to know the characters and their motivations for wanting to be around Tsuna. It's fun, suspenseful, action packed, funny, and good binge watching material for anyone who's willing to commit to it. All in All 10 out of 10. Good for shonen, comedy, and action fans. \\n\\n",

The plot and setting have great potential, average sound and art design, and is fairly enjoyable, but the characters make this anime fall so flat it may as well be 2D. There is no character growth, and behave inconsistently for no reason. \r\nI end up skipping large portions main arc episodes, as it is stuffed with filler, despite also having filler episodes! I don't mind filler in general, but these characters are so transparent that it becomes incredibly dull. \r\nApparently this review is not yet long enough because of some arbitrary character requirement. I know most people on the internet tend to notspend a huge amount of time reading something after the few opening portions of a review. Usually they get the jist of what that review's overall attitude is, then off to the next to see what people overall think... so I feel this limit, and making me type this useless paragraph is a bit counter intuitive.",

            "content": "I\u2019m not going to lie to you. This anime has its problems BUT its good points completely make up for them. The main reason I found this anime compelling in the first place is that it starts of very lightly, not slowly but lightly. The first 20 episodes or so are pure comedy nonsense which also gives you an idea of most of the characters beforehand. After that, again very lightly, it transcends into a more battle oriented plot but again it\u2019s not heavy enough to weigh you down. As the time passes the comedy becomes more \u2018inside-joke\u2019 oriented and the problems of the realmafia start to seem more realistic. The greatest point about this anime is that it becomes better with time. The battles, the emotional issues but also the comedic side of the characters\u2019 situation, have developed greatly. If you like comedy, fighting, cool gadgets, epic music and both pretty girls and dashing boys. Then you should take a look at this splendid piece of art. Granted visually it lacks, since the manga is beautifully drawn, but again everything else is up to par with the best of them.",

            "content": "I wasn't exactly big on anime when I started Katekyo Hitman Reborn. It was introduced to me by my cousin and she went on and on about the story. I thought it sounded pretty cool so I decided to give it a shot. While I have to admit I found the first twenty or so episodes rather...random. Normally, I would get weirded out by Tsuna running around in his underwear, but I did find Reborn's antics amusing so I decided to stick with the anime. \r\nWhen it got past the twenties however, Reborn became...wow. Just wow. Intense plot, epic battles. The story keeps you guessingthe whole way. You get surprises, shocks and awesome fights along the way. There are certain times when the plot starts to get a little dull, but something immediately picks it back up again which keeps you watching more. Then there's also the little shorts that sometimes come up at the end of each episode, often being one and half minutes or so of humor that's good to enjoy after a very intense episode. \\n\\n\r\nI don't really have anything to say about the story. I think it's really unique. I'd like to give examples, but I would like to avoid spoilers so I'm going to keep quiet. I just think that this plot is like something I've never seen before, or would be something I would think of. There would be times when the plot thickens and it's then that you would just keep going on to the next episode, eager to find out what's going to happen next. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character, I think they were well developed, better in some of the anime I've watched. You see how they first meet and how their bonds grow, as well as how they became stronger by helping each other. It's gives the story a more realistic feel, not like a random person pops out of nowhere and you immediately work well with them. I also personally enjoyed the inner turmoil featured in the story. Tsuna's important decisions were rather intense and you sympathize and understand what he's going through. \\n\\n\r\nFor the music and sound, I have to admit, Reborn has some of the best audio I've heard in anime. I enjoyed the sound effects, especially during battles and comedy moments. High and low pitches really affect the ambience of the scene and I think Reborn synced their sound with the animation and scene very well. The music and soundtrack is also great. I find most of the openings and endings incredibly catchy. The soundtrack contributes to the mood and how the character is feeling. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed Reborn. Don't give up if you find the first twenty episodes or so dull, stick to it and you won't regret it!",

The plot takes a while to get going, and the first season, besides a few key plot points in the beginning and the end, could almost be skipped.\r\nHowever, once you get past the initial season (especially since the first season seemed to consist entirely of filler episodes), things pick up quite a bit, and by the end, you'll have fallen in love with the characters. I was wary of starting it at first, since the first few episodes just seemed like nonsense, but I absolutely love it.

            "content": "- Spoiler Free-\r\nKatekyo Hitman Reborn! is an awesome shounen and one of favorite animes. I am someone who loves shounens and KHR is my second favorite to only hunter x hunter 2011. rather than writing long blocks of text for story, art, sound, etc i will give you quick pros and cons for each.\r\nStory- KHR starts off as a slapstick style comedy for the first 20 episodes and then turns into an awesome shounen (although 27-33 are also comedy daily life). this is the main problem which draws people away from this anime. The first 20 episodes deceives people into to thinking that KHR isa comedy, but its not. While it was funny at times its definitely not great. After the daily life episodes is when the story gets good. Theres no need for me to write a synopsis but its a loser middle schooler (tsuna) find out he is the 10th boss of the strongest mafia family. He goes on his adventures with his chosen guardians in order to protect his friends and the Vongola family. Lots of twists and great fights.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Animation at beginning its rather weak, but gets better as the series progresses. Overall its okay\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\n+ The sound is amazing. Almost every opening and ending are great and the character voices are all awesome. Not much else to say here, but the sound is on point\\n\r\n- some voices may be annoying to some (but very few, and they are not mcs)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n+ there is  a lot of variety in the characters so i sure you are ought to find one you like\\n\r\n+ they all change to a great degree and its cool to see how former enemies become great allies\\n\r\n- Tsuna still kinda a loser at the end only gets strong by taking pills/getting shot. Don't get me wrong Tsuna theres a lot of change is Tsuna's character but most of that is in strength and when he is dying will mode (when he gets shot by dying will bullet or takes pills, you will know what i mean after seeing first episode). that fact that he can only fight in dying will mode and has to take pills to achieve is my main gripe with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n+ a lot of fun to watch. I love this anime. I'm not a big fan of comedy in anime but this show adds in a good mix of humor with shounen. Its a blast and you should be watching it right now\\n\r\n- first 20 eps little slow and not shounen. Still funny though\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Katekyo Hitman Reborn! will go down as one of favorites animes of all time! Its epic and a great shounen that gets overlooked because of its first 20 episodes. You have to watch right now! you wont regret it.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I have to say that the representation of mafia isn't really accurate in the anime however. Still, the story really does get interesting as the Varia arc starts. The fighting and action is great. The character designs are favorable but there is weak character development. (It's often the whole thing about *fighting to protect friends and showing flashbacks of times they had which never happened in the anime* ) TBH, the series has become somewhat mundane forme lately, and my favorite arc remains to be the Varia arc. I often watch it now just to see in what direction the storyline is going and to see the action commence.",

            "content": "I first decided to watch Katekyo Hitman Reborn! after I learned about its mafia theme. I've heard many people claim that it was a \"must-watch\" or an \"astounding experience\" for them which is why I decided to give it a watch. I must say that, after completing the show, it was indeed an amazing anime, which still fills me with nostalgia when I recall it. On with the review.\r\nSTORY: The story really improves as the anime progresses, which makes it an enjoyable watch. However, it takes some time for the story to START, which I found kinda frustrating. The first 15-20 episodes are devoted tointroducing the characters, and while it included a few laughs, I didn't enjoy the introduction arc overall. That being said, it shouldn't be skipped. The story itself progresses rather slowly, but is still quite enjoyable. There are a few filler arcs which were actually really good and shouldn't be skipped (although the recaps and Slice of Life episodes should).\\n\\n\r\nART: The art begins rather poorly, but improves as the anime progresses, much like the story. Il'll admit that it was nice to see my favourite characters well drawn, as opposed to blurry or stange-looking, although they still looked rather odd at times. Same for the action/fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: I loved the soundtrack, which truly gave a mafia-like feel and really helped to increase the enthusiam (or feels) of the various scenes in the anime. The character themes were also really nice, and reflected their attitudes well.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Many of the characters in this anime are absolutely fantastic, and some of which are still my favorite. There was only one that I really didn't like, but that person still had some awesome moments, which helped to cover up my dislike (a little). One character which took my some time to get used to was Reborn, but eventually, he became my favorite character and made me laugh aloud when he took out his rage on poor Tsuna. Anyway, the characters really mature and change as the anime progresses, especially toward the end, although their main ideas and principles remain somewhat the same, which I really appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: My like for the anime rose more and more as the story moved forward, and reached extraordinary heights towards the end. The story is packed with plot-twists, comedy and epic moments which makes it really hard to stop watching the anime until the end. However, there are a few Slice of Life episodes which are relatively boring and should be skipped, although watching them didn't ruin the overall impression of the anime I had.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: An anime packed with thrilling action, an amazing (albeit slow) story, an excellent roster of characters and a magnificent soundtrack makes KHR! definitely an anime which deserves to be watched and marvelled over.\\n\\n\r\nSide-note: After completing the anime, you can read the manga, which continues the story a little further and answers a few questions which may have left you confused in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCiao!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Basically, Katekyo Hitman Reborn is one of the best animes I've ever seen and it has the most original storyline in my opinion. I've rewatched the anime over 6 times from the first episode right on to the final 203 and I just can't help to feel like watching it again! \r\nIt's not everyday you see an anime starting off with a little baby mafioso coming to the doorsteps with an adorable shapeshifting chameleon or a mafia that compiles members from the age 13 (5?!) to 16 and uses rings and box weapons than just guys in black carrying guns in fancy shiny black cars.I enjoyed KHR more than I enjoyed other animes that have gone over a hundred episodes (Naruto, Bleach etc...). \\n\\n\r\nNow, let's cut down the parts bit by bit aye?\\n\\n\r\nStory;\\n\r\nI've seen many comments, reviews and discussions about KHR and basically, everyone is talking about the downfall of KHR which was the first 20 episodes. Yeah, I actually dropped the anime after watching 2 episodes but I couldn't help to feel that there was something much more afterwards so I persevered and continued watching and I found the 20 episodes HILARIOUS! It's hard not to laugh when a little baby assasin dressed up in a cow suit come jumping around with pink grenades and stuffs in a bazooka, rocket launcher and tons of candies in his afro. (Lambo FTW!) After 20 episodes, the story begins loosening the comedy and the actual seriousness begins. From here, I asure you, you won't be able to stop watching. The transitioning from a simple comedy to a serious action is still filled with a few funny scenes but you can see the development and it will hook you up.\\n\r\n9/10 for me!\\n\\n\r\nArt;\\n\r\nYeah..yeah... For most art-obsessed anime viewers, KHR may not have the best art and the characters may look weird at some angle or so but I don't think this is a problem to keep you from watching it. During the Future Arc and all, I actually find the characters all quite decent and after rewatching it a few times, KHR has quite the number of hot guys from looks to personality. The action scenes are very nicely done and I find it 8/10 in my taste.\\n\\n\r\nSound;\\n\r\nDon't let me BEGIN with the soundtrack...it is EPIC! I love all of the opening songs and the character songs! The second opening really got the feel of the Varia Arc and it also shows the great development of the characters since the arc houses the time where most of the characters go through a change in ability. I have nothing to complain about here so it's an all 10/10!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter;\\n\r\nThis is probably the main strong point of the entire anime. The characters are all amazing in their own way! Let's see...Tsuna first started out as a whiny no-good kid whose fate is turned and twisted to become a big mafia boss only at the age of 14. I guess, Tsuna's development is the main thing in KHR and I absolutely love how he journeys through the story and when I reached episode 203, I realised on how Tsuna had changed so much but still has the same normal aura around him. This doesn't change with the other characters. They went through a lot but they still had their own orginal personality strong and his gives out a concrete character. They changed, heck yeah, but they're still who they were right in the beginning; Hibari being the bloodthirsty kinky character I love so much, Lambo being as annoying as ever, Yamamoto being as easy-going he could be and Ryohei going all to the extreme!!! x'DD I love all of the characters...except for a few but I've got nothing to hate about them... 10/10 to the EXTREMEE!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment;\\n\r\ndo I NEED to elaborate on this? Well, I can't give it a 10/10 since there were flaws but I can live with them. I enjoyed it enough to rewatch it fully for 6 times and I'm still up for another round! What more can I say about this? \\n\\n\r\nOverall;\\n\r\na total MASTERPIECE. I'm currently catching up on the manga which is just twice as awesome with the new arc and all. =3\\n\\n\r\nNOW GO AND WATCH KATEKYO HITMAN REBORN! The storyline is epic and the characters are to die for! (Hibari =",

            "content": "Holy fuck I just realized I'm considering legitimately re-watching this for the third time.\r\nI know the scores I gave it above probably sound like that of a fanboy who is highly biased, but please, let me prove you wrong.\r\nStory: 10\r\nI adore the story. I am weak to mafia related things, so that was a plus right off the bat. The first twenty episodes weren't too much of a bother, it was generic comedy and such. Nothing special, and the dying will boxer thing was weird. But trust me, the story picks up. And it only gets better and better until you gush over it andfall in love with this absolute masterpiece. It takes twists and turns and all the characters have their own story and represent what they're supposed to as does Tsuna. There is only like two filler recap episodes, but I STRONGLY advise watching all the episodes (apart from recap) in your first run through the stories.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI personally loved the art at the end, but early on it wasn't the greatest. It did get significantly better. And I mean a LOT better.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nA little off topic, but I have a playlist I listen to of songs I like. Five of the eight (I think eight or nine) of the opening songs from KHR are on it. I never once skipped the openings, and the graphics that went along with them were absolutely fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nLike I said above, each character has their own backstory and own battles that pertain to them as a character as opposed to everyone versus everyone. While that may be a turnoff, they are executed very well, I would say nearly perfectly since I've never seen anything to the level that KHR accomplished. The characters all metamorphosize into characters that you will become attached to, each and every one of them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 11\\n\r\nIt's very rare to find an anime that doesn't just get a ten, but raises the bar for everything else. I absolutely adore this series, it is so great. I don't know why but I keep coming back to it, now for a third time. It's the only anime I've ever re-watched and probably ever will. I hate to re-watch and re-read things, so it says a lot that I am re-watching this. It was simply that great. From the character development to the battles, everything was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nOf course I probably sound like a biased fanboy now lol. But really, if you watch all 203 episodes, I guarantee you will feel the same way. There is so much to love about this series and so little to dislike. The only real thing I dislike is that it had to end. However the manga does go on, so I'm reading that now.",

            "content": "My first reactions to this anime were quite standard. \"What's with the baby? Why does he rip his clothes off everytime?\" and of course \"whoa, there's a different pair of boxers every time his clothes rip.\" I watched it without reading the manga first, so I cannot give you a comparison of the two. Nevertheless, the characters caught my eye, and after getting a few episodes in I was basically hooked.\r\nStory: 10, easily.\r\nIt was unique enough to keep me interested the entire way through, and it has a quick pace to it, which I found quite refreshing. As others have mentioned, the first few episodescan be a bit of a drag as the characters are introduced one by one and we settle down into the main action, which essentially progresses through multiple arcs. What really got me was the later half of the series, as all the characters have progressed and been revealed, giving them a lot more depth. It was much better than finding out everything there is to know about a character right at the beginning of the series and not having anywhere to go from there (bleach would be a good example of that)\\n\\n\r\nIf you're tired of slow shounens or ecchie's with little or no story holding them together, I'd definitely recommend this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Only an 8, for me.\\n\r\nWatching it in decent quality, 480 or 720p for me, I picked up on a lot of drawing errors than when I initially watched it by streaming. Up close, or from a direct view, the characters look fine, and actually quite good. But when drawn from a different angle, or in the background, they seem slightly misshaped and distorted, especially during the beginning of the anime. Later on into the series the drawing picks up, especially the character design, and they look absolutely fabulous, which is the only reason I gave this an 8 instead of a 7 or six for the initial mediocre art. \\n\\n\r\nIgnoring the characters though, the art was great. Not perfect, but definitely above average. The color palette was picked nicely and suited the overall feel of the anime extremely well. Graphics exist to serve the aesthetics, and the overall aesthetics were definitely above average for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: A nice large 9.\\n\r\n  I'm going to break this into a few sections for clarification...\\n\r\n    The opening and closing music in almost all the episodes were great, making this one of two animes I've watching which didn't make me want to skip the beginning songs, the second being Fairy Tail. There were never any songs that didn't feel like they fit with the anime's theme, they weren't completely memorable, but definitely good to listen to.\\n\r\n    The background music was perfect, in every sense. A light almost funky feel for most of the non-serious stuff, and a deeper, but not \"dramatic,\" music for fighting scenes and drama sections. Again, it fit the aesthetics of the anime quite well, and helped contribute to the structure and mood without being too in the way.\\n\r\n   The character voicing was the only average part for me. Most characters were voiced well, however Lambo and Haru pained my ears to no end, especially the prior. None of them had especially remarkable or notable voices, you wouldn't be able to pick them out if you heard them by themselves, but you would definitely know who's talking if you knew it was from this anime only. Again though, Lambo having an annoying voice was the biggest downside on that one for me, especially since he is a major character\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThe characters were all unique, and each had recognizable attitudes and interests that set them apart from each other, in fact, quite a bit of the anime is based on the attitude difference of each character, something you notice from the beginning, and lasts until the very end. Each character was easy to remember, visually different, and had a great overall design to go with them, from their clothes to their weapons and attitudes.\\n\r\nI should note here that the only thing stopping this from being a 10 is the annoyance of Lambo. As a character I found him very irritating, not just with his voice, but his actions and attitude as well. I do understand that he was meant to be seen as annoying, and is pointed out as such in many, many scenes, but that still means he is an annoying main character, and if you're not too fond of kids, will likely push your tolerance a tad as well. Especially considering the frequency with which Lambo is a part of the anime, being a main character in a very large fraction of the episodes at least once.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10~!\\n\r\nDespite a few flaws, the anime was extremely enjoyable and refreshing. It kept me hooked all the way through, and had that little gleam of \"promise,\" even in the slow episodes that can be quite boring and easy to drop out on. It's definitely a growing anime, the more you watch the better it becomes, and the final arc will have you on the edge of your seat until you're too tired to stay conscious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is one of my favourite animes to date, not the best anime by any means, but it's definitely up there with other great shows. Watching between the lines was also quite rewarding, as you pick up little extra details, like Tsuna wearing a different pair of underwear every time his clothes rip. It's not that important, but hey, the small things still count.\\n\\n\r\nSide note: it wasn't the focus of the anime, but it did seem to be slightly sexist, whether on accident or on purpose. Virtually every non-fighting female character is weak, extremely dependant and emotional, saying lines like \"It's our job to clean and cook good meals for them, so they can fight at their best!\" Even the female characters that do fight enjoy cleaning and cooking when they get the chance, and seem weaker in general compared to the male characters. Mind, it's not something that will detract from the anime, and it usually slides by without being noticed.\\n",

The first 26 episodes intoduce the characters(there are a lot) then from about episode 20-26 builds the plot for the next arc but trust me when I say this the first 26 episodes are good but then afterwards it gets so much better. The character development is good to and I feel like there not too crazy with backstorys and I personally fell in love with almost all the characters. The art is good it\u2019s not super modern but it\u2019s like most artyou\u2019d find in the early 2000s and it doesn\u2019t ruin the show at all. In turns of music the osts, openings and endings are awesome. I really loved this anime and I recommend for anyone who really likes finishing anime it\u2019s long but it\u2019s good and the fillers are actually really fun to watch(for the first time) the fights are also really good. I hope review helped and please get past episode 26\\n\\n",

One Piece was average until Arlong Parc... this one is even WORST than average until the Rokudo arc at episode 19-20-21... then it goes back to average for a bit, and eventually kick off...at the time of writing I am at 60/200... and there are crazy stuff like you see in all other amazing shounen... could even be compared to dragonball in some aspect... and I have no doubt it will get even better and crazier.\\n\\n\r\nArt is pretty good considering the first half is 4x3 before HD.. there are some very catchy and amazing music track for the fights after ep.20... I had my doubts for a while... it was tedious... but so worth it!\\n\\n\r\nSo for anyone looking for a great long anime with a ridiculous character progression potential, this is a really great pick! I can't wait to see where this all goes!\\n\\n\r\nI am sorry for my english my first language is french.\\n\r\nHave a nice day!",

            "content": "To start off, this is a review (my 1st) based entirely on the anime, as I have not read the manga. Throughout the course of anime history, there have been many anime's that have peeked my interest and then others who have disappointed me entirely. I am thankful to say that this particular anime is the former.\r\nThe narrative was seamlessly constructed so that I never got bored, in the beginning it took a more comedic approach to the shounen genre, focusing mainly on observation comedy and gags. However, once the first arc had properly started, I was enthralled in the world of the supernatural mafia.Unlike recent mafioso series such as Arcana Famiglia, the main character is weak and the story follows his progress to become stronger, this not only builds up tension and anticipation, it also offers great fight scenes between himself and the enemy. Furthermore, this anime is made all the better by the protagonists entourage who supply the story with whimsical entertainment and refreshing but still captivating morsels of slice-of-life/comedy gold. I also noticed that as each arc was aired the plot just seemed to improve triumphantly.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of this show is very good, for a show that aired in the year of 2006. It is very vibrant and brings a refreshing look to all episode. However, there were some still scans thrown in every so often, but most of the animation was fluid and the art was quintessential to the show's shounen ambiance. Th character design was memorable for each character as they all, had their own individual style and didn't fall into the generic look that some anime's suffer from. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound or 'audio aesthetics' complimented each scene perfectly, although some were played repeatedly and then some were forgettable. On the contrary, the openings of each of the arc seemed to fit retrospectively with its place in the story, adding a further layer to the series greatly received plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs and development were integrated perfectly into the program, each individual becomes a likable person for different reasons. As soon as I started watching this anime, I immediately thought that it was to insane, for example a chibi carrying a gecko that could transform into a gun. It reminded me of Soul Eater, on the basis that each character had a different yet equally intriguing story that had me captivated from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor, was beyond comprehension. It brought twists and turns; character development; action packed fights; unique powers and budding romance (but only a tiny bit). It kept me captivated so much that my dreams were effected.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would rank this in my Top 10 (with no particular order). It is an essential for a shounen lover or an 'animaniac' in general. Thank-you for reading and I hope you found this helpful.",

            "content": "Katekyo Hitman Reborn is one of the most poorly crafted shounen anime out there. Its main problem is pursuing more than 100 episodes.\r\nStory - 3 - Tsuna is going to be a Mafia boss. Reborn is his tutor and he is going to turn Tsuna from a total wimp into an honorable god among thugs. Unfortunately, Tsuna is adorably pathetic and his love interest is too beautiful for him to tell her his true feelings.\r\nThankfully, Reborn is able to have Tsuna ask Kyoko out on his first day as tutor. Things were very promising.\r\nIn my opinion, the first arc of the show is actually thebest. It does not focus seriously on fighting, but the small action scenes mixed into a largely comedic anime was really fun. We also had characters like Doctor Shaharl, who was an incredibly clever character and of all of these 200 and something episodes, he only appears in about 3 or 4. Bianca (the girl with the poison cooking) was pretty cool too, but she is pretty much retconned after the first arc.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, after the first 20 or so episodes, we have a small combat arc. It was pretty cool and I felt like it was cohesive with the episodes beforehand. There were still some flaws to this and it did not feel like this shounen action style was rewarding enough.\\n\\n\r\nThen, somehow, the fans fell deathly in love with this action and instead of getting a unique shoujo-shounen show with occasional action, it became a shounen action series.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the only thing good that happened in the resulting arc was that interesting characters were introduced and they clashed well (personality-wise) with the main characters. But, this new arc took much longer than it should have (when compared with the previous action arc) and we feel nothing but coldness and impossible increases in and overcomings of danger.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Tsuna loses his berserk mode, which had made him into a fun character before. The progression of the plot makes it impossible for this characteristic theme to be brought back into the show.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, we were promised that we would get to the meat of the story where we would finally understand what the Famiglia was supposed to become and how Tsuna would have to develop into a real mafia boss. The only problem is that the whole arc is pure action with no substance, just some good strategy scenes, and characters we are not really able to care about.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad guy's motives are unexplained for so long that it is very hard to keep watching until the end when things finally get explained.\\n\\n\r\nThe odd part________________\\n\\n\r\nReborn had a lot of ruined charm. I think that if you were to watch the first 26 episodes and then maybe watch the Inheritance Succession Arc, you would have the best possible time with this show. If you choose to watch more episodes, you definitely will get absorbed into the show and if you actually think about it, a lot of the episodes are purely awful. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 5 - Stale, stale, stale, stale. The main character's power manifests purely in fire and it does not manage to look impressive at any time despite the interesting concepts.\\n\\n\r\nThe multiple colors of flame look kind of nice, but there is a severe lack of animations at most times and a lot of off-screen action that makes battles annoying to follow.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are pretty interesting, but they get stale since the characters are not fun enough to keep their design feeling characteristic of their interesting traits.\\n\\n\r\nThe first four openings (maybe the 7th, too) look pretty good and some of the endings are really well done, but they do not improve the score by much.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5 - The show's soundtrack is boring, boring, boring, boring. Listen to Dragon Ball Z American soundtrack. Despite it sounding so controversially peaceful and off-hand, you will like it more than this soundtrack. Reborn has about three songs play a huge amount and they will grate on you. The Rocky Balboa style theme was never good and they abused the hell out of it. Then, I think that there is another similar sounding song. Then, there is one of those stupid, slow jingles that are supposed to be used for uneasiness, coldness or mystery. None of the other music is interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending themes to this anime are really engaging. It made me feel like each arc was getting better because of the interesting music. Ending 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 were easily among some of the best endings I know. The other endings are still really good (except 13) in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe first, second, third and seventh opening are pretty great (3rd is best), but they rest are bland.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4 - Reborn remains too mysterious, Tsuna is static for extremely long periods of time.\\n\\n\r\nThe terrible thing about most of the remaining characters, they have extremely one-dimensional personality quirks (which seemed to begin to flesh out in the first arc and a small bit in the second) in which they have fake, pikachu-esque speech patterns. Tsuna is defined by how he gains and uses his new powers, but he never becomes a cool character, he just calms down and becomes less anxious and occasionally tries to keep his team in order. Yamamoto develops into a samurai, but that is all that he is. The rest of the group just becomes a tiny bit more powerful (until the boxes make them even stronger) and the secondary characters just become nurses, in essence.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said in the story section, many of the cool characters in the beginning were dropped and the less interesting characters were the ones who became central. As others have mentioned - all of the girl characters are really weak. We are even met with this girl in the future who seems to have a lot of hidden power and teaches Tsuna and the team how to survive in the future (that survival part was the only good thing about the future arc), but only falls flat on her face and stays home at the base after her initial role is finished.\\n\\n\r\nHaru and Kyoko are actually decent characters, despite being as true to the role of domestic housewife as humanly possible in a shounen (even despite an apocalypse setting). So, the big fault there is that they are relegated to slowing the plot down rather than being in important roles and moving things forward. Lambo gets only a slight bit of valuable development and his adult form was a nice, somewhat complex character, but Lambo generally feels like he is avoided at all costs, almost as much as Chrome (Miss Useless).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3 - I enjoyed the openings and especially the endings. I hated the action scenes. I longed for the neat characters to improve in a more remarkable way. Some of the one-dimensional characters work, but this show is just filled with disappointment and I feel like I was brainwashed into spending huge amounts of time being obsessed with a terrible show. I just really, really wanted these characters to be better than they were. It is all quite sad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3 - This is an anime which you probably should never watch past the first season, even if you do not enjoy that season very much. Of course, those who have time to kill should go straight ahead and kill it, even though it will be painful to do so.",

There are plenty of episodes involving serious fights, while others are of the characters everyday lives! With each episode, the battles intensify and the opponents grow stronger. There is a very wide variety of characters, each having a very distinct personality that will catch your attention! The plot is flawless and the story really makes you think about what is happening! Nonetheless, in the end,all of your questions will be answered, and if your smart enough, you may be able to even put the pieces of the puzzle together on your own! Although this anime was aired in 2006 so the artwork may look a tad bit old, the artist did a splendid job on character design and background landscape! I will never forget this anime because of the character's seemingly endless entertainment and the extremely well thought out plot!",

            "content": "I'd actually seen my fair share of shounen before picking up Katekyo Hitman Reborn, so I wasn't quite expecting anything more than the typical friendship speeches here and there (isn't that what shounen is all about?). I started off with the first 15 episodes taking it rather easy and not really getting bored with the fillers. I can't quite remember why I didn't find them annoying like I probably would have under regular circumstances, but it does get so much better later on.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nThe story, to be honest, is pretty much the same old predictable shounen formula. Some completely normal kid suddenly gets powersto save the world, etc. and kicks bad guy ass. Then goes off to train again for some big battle, and ends up winning the big epic battle before moving on to some next arc. Except, the way it was presented was quite unique, which is the reason why I've given the story a good score.\\n\\n\r\nThe filler episodes though, that's probably the only thing I'd complain about that brings the score down. There were way too many of them between the Varia arc and Future arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the beginning is actually mediocre. Episode three (or was it another?) was actually the one episode which I wanted to skip so badly (ever seen Gowadera? Go google it). It was just drawn completely awkwardly, making me wonder why I was still watching it, since I judge most anime firstly on how well the art is done. Even so, I put up with this. Good decision. Art improvement can be clearly seen if you compared the first episode with the last one. The art improves quite a fair bit as the episodes go by.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, you can't really fail much with sound. The endings and openings weren't too bad although sometimes there was that one monotonous singer. The voice acting was quite okay except for Underwear Tsuna's voice. Not much to comment about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I have mixed feelings for this aspect, since there are some characters that are nicely portrayed and some that aren't. So, I'm going to start on the positive side.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, it starts off with a wimpy failure-at-life kid, Tsuna. I honestly felt that he was completely useless and couldn't do anything. Although later, they develop his character quite a fair bit and he changes quite a bit. In one of the episodes, Kyoko quotes, \"His face looked like a bullet train.\" (Sounds kind of iffy, lol). I personally enjoyed seeing how nicely his character was developed and how much he matured, so I'd give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe guardians were also quite nicely portrayed, gave certain characters the flashbacks and background stories they needed.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that brings the score down though, is Kyoko and Haru (In the beginning, at the very least). The typical side character that's just there to cheer on the main character and is completely, and utterly useless, and insists on helping in something completely out of their field. Yeap, Kyoko and Haru (mostly Haru) fit that description perfectly in the beginning. They annoyed me so much, I almost felt like skipping the whole scene when they appeared. When they went into the future and all sorts of drama was happening, of course, Kyoko and Haru not being told much of the situation, they started snooping around. The boycott however, was the last straw on a camel's back. I felt like murdering someone. When Tsuna finally decided to tell them everything that happened, I guess my rage died off quite a bit and I calmed down a little. Can't really describe it much, just didn't feel as raged.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was quite interesting to watch. After hurdling the slow introduction, I started catching up to the latest episode in about a week (the series was 4 episodes from finishing). Keeps you glued to your seat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI guess some would see it as another typical shounen, but I think that the storyline is quite unique and will probably keep you watching. Has it's comedic moments, serious moments, and action-packed moments. Overall, KHR is a great anime, in my opinion. I'd definitely recommend it as long as you don't mind anime with over 200 episodes.",

Katekyo hitman reborn definitely has one of the most unique story's I've seen and what really makes it great is it's progression. It starts out slow and more simple comedy  focused then before you know it, it becomes a complex serious story that you definitely don't see coming. It's not a deep emotionally scaring storey but it is sure to keep anybody who loves shounen entertained. \r\nArt: the art isn't groundbreaking but it isn't badeither so it is just good. \\n\r\nSound: the sound out pretty good especially the starting themes. I couldn't get the last starting theme song out of my head for an entire month. \\n\r\nCharacters: this anime has great characters in it with some good development, especially the main characters of the stores. The few problems is that some characters are very forgettable and some seemingly awesome characters only appear very briefly and them are completely forgotten afterwards. \\n\r\nOverall: all things considered I really loved this anime and hate the fact that it ended while the manga continued. It has an interesting story, good characters and great fights and I recommend it for anybody who loves shounen. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ciaossu! I know I'm late and I don't know if I'm doing this right, but I just wanted to try to review one of my favorite anime, Katekyo Hitman Reborn! To be honest at first, I had dropped the anime on the first twenty episodes or so. I probably didn't like the way Tsuna's voice sounded or the art. I don't know the reason why I dropped it in the first place. Maybe I was young teenager, who was about thirteen years old that time, and didn't really know much about anime? I'm still a teenager, but with a different perspective now.\r\nOkay, so on tothe review!\\n\\n\r\nStory (8)\\n\r\nThe story was unique... in a good way. It didn't particularly drag me in at first, but hey, I loved it later. Now, I'm part of the fandom. (insert Mukuro's \"kufufufu\" phrase) A wimpy kid, who is called Dame-Tsuna (you're not Dame, Tsuna!) most of the time, becomes a boss, with the help of a demon baby, called Reborn. You wouldn't want to piss of Reborn if you were his student. The anime had way too much fillers; took a long time to get to the \"real plot\". The \"real plot\", hn, now that's what I'm talking about! The anime gets more bad ass, I swear!~\\n\\n\r\nArt (6)\\n\r\nThe art looked fine. Haha, this is lame, since I really don't know how to judge art. I don't know what to say.\\n\r\nSo anyway!\\n\\n\r\nSound (7)\\n\r\nI like the character songs... Does that count? I went back to listen to the OPs and EDs, but I didn't pay attention since I usually skip the OPs and EDs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8)\\n\r\nOut of all the anime I've seen, I think the development of the characters is great! I mean, take Tsuna, for example. At first, he was just a wimpy, dame kid, who got bullied a lot. But then, BOOM! He becomes a hot-shot boss. How can girls (and guys) not like him? I mean, hello?! Besides Tsuna, the other characters were likeable as well. Especially Hibari, Takeshi, and Gokudera! Ryohei and Bianchi were okay as well. The girls, no offense, not so much. Stop being so air-headed all the time!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10)\\n\r\nWow. Not many anime make me laugh as much as this one. I loved the comedy the author, Amano Akiro, threw in. I especially liked the part on how Gokudera teaches Tsuna how to swim. Like omg. Not to spoil or anything, but that's just a filler. After getting to the \"real plot\", I was hooked and I couldn't wait to watch another episode to see what happened next!\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9)\\n\r\nThis is one of my favorite anime. Though it had a lot of fillers, took a long time for the \"real plot\" to start, it was... EXTREME! I loved every bit of it. And now, I still go on fanfiction to read what kinds of stories pop up. And honestly, I would recommend this to anyone, who is starting to watch anime, or looking for a new anime to watch. Extreme, right? :')\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Katekyo Hitman Reborn is a terrible shonen series that is very badly written and doesn't reward its viewers with an actual conclusion (even the manga ending is stupid).\r\nStory:\r\nReborn is baby assassin hired to raise Tsuna, a whiny wimp who was chosen randomly for no actual reason, to be the next mafia boss for the vongola family in Italy. From the beginning of the show to it's end (and even the end of the manga) Tsuna refuses to become the vongola boss because he is a coward, even after saving the world multiple times he still refuses for no valid reason. It's not like he hasany other goal in life, he showed no passion towards anything which leads us to believe that he's a lazy deadbeat throughout the whole anime without actually developing as a character. The only times he becomes inexplicably calm is when he turns on his powers and turns into a different personality to take on his enemies. That completely stops him from growing as a character because the Tsuna that fights is different than the normal one and thus he can pass through every arc without actually growing a pair and taking control of his future. Nothing on the mafia is delivered throughout the story, in fact if the word mafia didn't get repeated over and over you wouldn't guess that that's what this anime is about. Nothing about organized crime, nothing about gang wars, and nothing about drugs or police. The worldbuilding in this anime is horrid, it feels like there's no one in the world other than the established characters.\\n\\n\r\nStory Arcs:\\n\r\n1- 20 or so episodes of comedy and character introductions. Most people believe that these are the worst episodes of the show, but they aren't actually worse than what's to come. Yeah the humor is flat and it's lacking in action but it doesn't fill itself with plot holes and obnoxious characters while also not making you lose all hope for the anime yet as you know that there's action to come.\\n\r\n2- Mukuro arc. First battle arc, forgettable.\\n\r\n3- Varia arc. The best arc despite having many flaws. Old villain becomes ally for no reason. Random high school boy with no experience sword fighting beats an experienced assassin after a week of training, another high school boy obliterates a killer robot by just hitting it with a stick.\\n\r\n4- Future arc. If the anime ended before this point I might've given it a 4-5 but this arc makes this mediocre anime terrible. After Tsuna and co. beat a small group within vongola they go 10 years in the future to fight a mafia boss who have conquered the world and beat their 10 years older selves. Power ups are given randomly to the heroes and for some random reason they can beat foes their future selves couldn't. It's like sending kid goku to the future to beat beerus, it doesn't make any sense. Add onto that the fact that powers became dumber now. Every person has a magical colored fire that they can insert into their magical boxes to summon a magical animal that allows them to use a random magical ability that they will use only once and then when they get into another fight they will get their next random magical power.\\n\\n\r\nThe manga continues after the previous arc and it still doesn't make sense how Tsuna and co. are struggling to beat anyone after coming back from the future where they defeated the man who conquered the world.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nCharacters are very flat in this anime I'm confused why anyone likes any of them. Tsuna is a coward that never grows up to give any satisfaction for sticking around to see him change. Hayato is a Tsuna worshipper. Takeshi is always cheerful and Ryouhei is hot-headed and manly I guess. Lambo is an annoying brat who got chosen as a member in vongola for no actual reason. Hibari is op from the start for no reason at all and has no personality. Mukuro has no reason to join vongola and Chrome is cute I guess but that's all there is to her. There are two girls who are supposed to be love interests but nothing on that is ever delivered throughout the anime or the manga for that matter so all they ever actually did was stand around and repeat Tsuna-kun over and over.",

I'm giving it a 6 overall but I would say the first season is a 4 andthe later seasons are an 8.  If you do decide to watch this series don't give up it takes a while to get good and an even longer time to get consistently good.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are up to the task of watching what amounts to roughly 30 episodes of filler with 5 or 6 good episodes in the middle you're in for a treat but I honestly  can't give it a high grade because the first season is just awful.",

            "content": "This is the first anime I have ever watching and I thoroughly enjoyed it mainly for its interesting characters, good plot and outstanding fight scenes.\r\nstory- Katekyo Hitman Reborn is no doubt a very original anime with an enjoyable plot. There are several arcs throughout the anime which all link together into a lovely story. I have heard  many people say that the first arc (daily life) can be boring however i disagree, the great humor and lighthearted atmosphere contrasts well with the intense battles that take place later in the series. The daily life episodes also set up the characters' personalities and attitudes.\r\nart- theseries had great art which slowly evolved alongside the story. \\n\\n\r\nsound- the voice acting was exceptional throughout the series, all the voice actors made the characters come to life beautifully . The soundtrack was also memorable especially during the fight scenes where they created amazing action. I still get goosebumps when I hear particular tracks.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters- all of the characters in the series are well thought out, unique and progress with the series. All the characters are extremely different so there is something for everyone. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- i thoroughly enjoyed this anime, the battle scenes were fantastic and I enjoyed every moment of this series.\\n\\n\r\noverall I gave this series a 10 and I highly recommend people to watch it. While at the start it might seem weird and complicated it is truly a great anime series.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you found this review helpful!",

            "content": "I just finished to watching this anime and still reading the manga. The result is simple: I love this anime! It's incredibly awesome, it's almost my favorite  anime/manga! But, I wanna review it. First: The story.\r\nThe presentation arc isn't that good. The good is that the fillers are only moments in series, so there is FULL filler series. Then the bad is the presentation series of Haru, Bianchi, Fuuta. And then another good presentation series - Ryohei, Hibari-san, Lambo, Gokudera, Yamamoto, Dino, I-Pin. So, there is more good than bad and it's a very good 7.0 for the beginning!\r\nThe Mukuro arc is the realbeginning of the interesting story. The fights are pretty awesome, but the most amazing think in the arc is the X gloves, Omega Mode and the fight Omega mode Tsuna VS Mukuro. Words for this arc are Exiting, Amazing, Awesome, Very Interesting. A 9.4!\\n\r\nThe Varia arc is the real explosion! The beginning is prime really! There are plenty of awesome things in the arc! The most interesting fights are Lambo VS Levi (because of the 25 years old Lambo), Gokudera VS Bel (the worst of the best), Yamamoto VS Squallo (VOOOOOOIIIIIIII), Chrome VS Marmon (I was shoked/exited when Mukuro appears) and, sure, the final battle Tsuna VS Xanxus. A prime arc! 10.0\\n\r\nAfter watching the Varia arc I thought it was the best arc, but no! There is the Future arc! This is the best beginning of an arc that I have ever seen in an anime! I thought that I will finally see the TYL Reborn (adult), but no, he disappeared! And then - BOOM - a knew prime/exiting/awesome/amazing arc! The appearence of the TYL Vongola familly is really something new! And the training/Mello base adventure was... AWESOME!!!!! After all Ultra amazing battles I see that Chouichi is a good guy. It was and a disappoint and an excite, because always wanted that Choichi was a good guy. And the X BURNER was really awesome. 10.0\\n\r\nThe Arcaballenno arc was a small one but a great one. Now I know all of Arcaballenos! 8.5\\n\r\nThe Choice arc was a beautiful arc. It was very interesting to know how we play Choice. The game rules were awesome, but the most interesting part is that our precious Vongola family and Milfeore family were the participants. And new attacks are really awesome (I mean the Kambio forms). So, 10.0.\\n\r\nThe I(1) generation/Final battle arc is the best! It was very good to see th 1st generation! And the more good is the Tsuna VS Byakuran battle. It was very cute when Giotto said \"Decimo, give this Mare-kid a scare\"! This is my favorite moment in the anime! They really looked like father and son!! 10.0\\n\r\n7+9.4+10+10+8.5+10+10=64.8:7=10.0\\n\r\nThe story is outstanding.\\n\r\nThe Art:\\n\r\nThe art of characters :\\n\r\nEyes- They are really awesome!They are even more than prime! 10.0\\n\r\nNose- They are pretty original. It's kind of new + old. 10.0\\n\r\nMouse- It isn't different from other animes at all.But it's still great. 10.0\\n\r\nArms- They are great. Original and great. 10.0\\n\r\nLegs- Normal... But, if they are in a Mafia costume they are prime. 10.0\\n\r\nHair- Cool. There are so many hair styles! And they are great. 10.0\\n\r\nBody- Standart. But they Arcaballenno body is great. 10.0\\n\r\n10+10+10+10+10+10+10= 70:7=10\\n\r\nSo, the art is outstanding, too.\\n\r\nThe sound:\\n\r\nThe openings are outstanding! All 8 are very nice and no one of them isn't bad. 10.0\\n\r\nOST are the best really. The most \"starry\" are \"Tsuna awekens\" and \"The leader of Discipline Committee - Hibari Kyoya\". 10.0\\n\r\nI never watched the endings, so I don't care.\\n\r\nSound Effects are cool and very nice. The sound effects when you ignite the ring and when you open the box are really amazing. 10.0\\n\r\n10+10+10=30:3=10\\n\r\nWow, the sound is outstanding, too.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nTsuna(w/o Omega/Reborn mode) - he's really a loser. I don't like him. 2.0\\n\r\nTsuna(Reborn mode) - he's a crazy dude. He'll do everything that he regret's when was dying. I like him. 9.0\\n\r\nTsuna(Omega mode/X gloves) - He's my favorite character. It's totally not the same Tsuna from the first episodes. 10.0\\n\r\nGokudera - he's cool. He's strong. He's intelligent. He's popular. 10.0\\n\r\nYamamoto - he's very positive. And sure pretty strong. But, I don't like him as much, as I like Gokudera because of his stupidity. 9.5\\n\r\nHaru - she's very beautiful in the last episodes. I like her, but only in the last episodes. For the last episodes's Haru - 9.0\\n\r\nKyoko - I really don't understand why Tsuna love her? 7.0\\n\r\nRyohei - very strong character. Extreme!! 10.0\\n\r\nLambo - a ******* little crybaby! I hate him! 1.0\\n\r\nLambo (TYL) - cool. But, still a crybaby. At least he's better than 5 years. 6.0\\n\r\nLambo (20YL) - badass, cool, not anymore a crybaby. I really liked him. 10.0\\n\r\nHibari - the coolest and the best ever. Kamikorosu! 10.0\\n\r\nChrome - **** her! 4.0\\n\r\nMukuro - the same as Hibari - coolest and best! 10.0\\n\r\nReborn - \"cute chibi version of Chuck Norris\". 10.0\\n\r\nGiotto Vongola Primo - the best of the best of the best! 10.0\\n\r\nByakuran - funny, strong, best of the evil guys. 10.0\\n\r\n2+9+10+10+9.5+9+7+10+1+6+10+10+4+10+10+10+10=127.5:17=7.9\\n\r\ncharacters- 7.9 - 8.0 - very good.\\n\r\nIt enjoys soo much that once I thought that I'm Omega mode Tsuna! 10.0\\n\r\n10+10+10+8+10=48:5=9.3 - great. \\n\\n",

            "content": "First off, this is all my own opinion. But it's shared by most of the people who have seen the show. Also, this is going to be a LONG one. \r\nWhen I first heard about this anime, it seemed interesting.\r\nWhen people told me about the story, it seemed amazing.\r\nWhen people made me listen to the music, it seemed unbelievable.\r\nAnd let me tell you, it's all that and more.\r\nSo it starts of with a baby trying to make a boy into the 10th head of a mafia gang. \r\nNow hold your horses and let me finish. \r\nWhile it may seem boring for the first 24-ish episodes(honestly, even those episodes gave me a good feeling), after that it dives off into a tale so epic, a story so full of amazing and loveable characters, soundtracks that give you the power to punch through a concrete wall, a true masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nStory -\\n\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, it's about a baby trying to make a boy into the 10th head of a mafia gang. Now let me explain this a bit. This ''baby'' is the number 1 hitman in the world, (hard to believe I know, but it's an anime what did you expect) The boy is the perfect example of a shounen protagonist; He's not the smartest, bad at sports and such a big clutz others call him No Good Tsuna. Oh also the usual \"I won't let you hurt my friends!'' stuff. However the change he makes is unbelieveable. He turns into such a badass it made me wonder why they could ever call him a good for nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of arcs, and to each his own. However, it's not some random filler-like arcs, it's actually making progress throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters -\\n\\n\r\nThere's a load of characters, and they're all amazing in their own way. Some are cool, some are funny, some are just outright badass. I'm sure everyone can relate to at least one character. There are, however, annoying characters. (I'm talking to you Lambo, I-Pin and Haru...) Ah, who am I kidding! Lambo may be a baby in a cow suit, wearing horns on his afro and having an arsenal bigger than Skyrims inventory in it aswell, he's just so loveable. And his transformations are also incredible. (20 years is all I'm going to say) I-pin might also be a baby, but she's a living bomb! A chinese, adorable living bomb! 'Nuff said. And Haru is just... Haru I guess. Can't really say anything good about her except for... uhh... nevermind I don't.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters develop really well as the story progresses, working out flaws, becoming stronger and doing whatever they can for what they have to do.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - \\n\\n\r\nUnbelievable. From openings to epic fighting music to sad tracks, this anime has it all. I can't really stress it enough. My personal favourite and most famous is Tsuna Awakens. This soundtrack can give me enough energy after a 40 hour marathon to do it again. I can honestly say I would be able to be on par with Goku while listening to it. It's like an upgraded version of the Rocky theme. While Tsuna Awakens may be the best, don't let that fool you, the others are almost equally as good.\\n\\n\r\nArt -\\n\\n\r\nSince it has ran from 2006 to 2010, it doesn't have the art style of a Madhouse anime. It may not have overly epic visual effects like in Fate/Stay Night UBW 1st and 2nd season. And the backgrounds may not be as astonishing as those from K. But let me tell you, for a 2006 anime, it's still really good. I am a huge critic on art style, but this show was so good, it made me feel like art didn't even matter.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -\\n\\n\r\nFunny scenes, epic scenes, fight scenes, awkward scenes, it's all in one big package of goody goodness. It gives the right kind of mood at the right moment.\\n\\n\r\nIf by now you're still not convinced, I can write about 20 pages more about how much I love this show. 203 episodes may seem long to most, but I've seen (and read) it twice and would do so again in a heartbeat. Honestly it doesn't feel like 200+ episodes.\\n\\n\r\nJust watch it, you won't regret it.",

            "content": "Well, I'm not too sure how I found out about this anime, but it's synopsis appealed to me when I read it on myanimelist. So I started watching Katekyo Hitman Reborn! Oh man how hard it was to keep watching, but it was so worth it. I still remember just going to the synopsis page and rereading it forcing myself to watch it and be like this might be worth the wait and it was.\r\nStory: This story in the beginning has tons of gaps and holes in which one might be like what the hell. Don't worry about the gaps and the holes, they willall eventually be filled in, yes even the one about the babies. In the beginning it is pretty boring and very confusing, but as the story goes on it becomes more interesting and exciting, but at times it gets pretty boring repeating the theme of never giving up and getting even more power. When I was around the 100th episode or so, I was starting to feel bored, but now that I finished, I simply feel sad that there is no more.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Perhaps it is because I am not too critical about art, but many people find Reborn!'s art style pretty bad, but I find that it is ok and that yes even Reborn is drawn fine.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Katekyo Hitman Reborn!'s sound is pretty good and matches with the atmosphere and scenes. I enjoyed the ending and openings very much, and only one or 2 of the theme songs did I delete from my playlist. The rest are in my top 20 songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were great, but they repeatedly bored me with the never give up and use your dying will theme.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This anime is a very good one and I really enjoyed it. Although it is not as enjoyable as Naruto or Black Butler, it is still a very great anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I loved it and it was great.",

Also, who the hell is this baby?. Is he a sadist who toyed the main character?. What a waste. I should ignore it and watch other anime. But well, I will continue watching this to see how much it will improve\". These are what I've been thinking since I started watching this anime. Being impatient and a short temper man is my nature so I totally irritated because I've already watched 20 episodes and still themain character is slowly improving. However, despite of that, I continued watching this because I really want to watch through the end so because of that I did not give up. As I said, I continued watching it and with my surprise, the series become pretty interesting. At last, I already feel satisfied and decided to watch it until the end. The story and the arc presented in the anime were all well done and pretty good. The story itself is superb however, there are some arc that are disappointing. Every arc has fighting scenes and it was all intensifying. To be honest, my heart pounding very fast if I saw a good fighting scenes and this anime is one of that. It proves that it was worth watching. Until the end of the series, I will say that the development is very good. There are a lot of plot twist. But, I really hesitant if I'm gonna give this anime a 10 or just a 9 because somehow there is a discontentment in me. Nonetheless, I gave a perfect score for this because it meets up my expectations. To summarize it all, the story of this series is good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n      The characters in this series are all pretty good. Both protagonists and antagonists developed their characters and each of their characterization are consistent from the start to the end. However, there are some points that some of the characters have no development at all. Despite of that, the author write and develop good characters. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound\\n\r\n      The art and sound of this anime are also good. The fighting scenes are all well done.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you gonna try this, just be patient and you will see a lot of development while the story continues. Also, you will enjoy it a lot if you love an adventure-type shounen anime. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Story(9/10):\r\nThe story takes a little while to just start and it takes upto 20 - 22 episodes to start the main arc of the anime. The 20 episodes builds the relation of TSUNA with each of the character and also makes us emotionally attached through comedy and intense comedy. The story was supposed to be a comedy story but then was changed to shounen.\r\nArt(9/10):\r\nThe art is the only weak link it has. Art is good but it could have been better once it got to 16:9 ratio i.e from 105 episode onwards. Apart from that the art is good and suits the anime very well.The transformations are hands down just EPIC. Tsuna our protagonist is just awesome and also very reliable once he gets serious. Art is nothing exceptional, but it handles the transitions very well without dropping the quality where it matters the most.\\n\\n\r\nSound(10/10):\\n\r\nOh God the OST and also the background build up music. Just epic and also the very best you can ever find in any anime. The epic background music build up is the 2nd one that I can give 10 without hesitation 1st being the FMA's music. The OST's are also great and fits the arcs perfectly to depict their situation and story arcs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(9/10):\\n\r\nAll the characters are lovable and also very much badass when time comes. Not only the protagonist but also all the supporting male and baby characters where badass and very well executed. The only character that I personally would have loved to watch grow into something more was LAMBO's character. But that was the only disappointment and also he was the only character that irritated me the most. But still if it wasn't for him comic scenes wouldn't have been easy to create.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10):\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed each and every moment of the series. Be it the first 20 episodes or the story arcs I loved this show and also enjoyed it to my fullest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(10/10):\\n\r\nThis anime is worth a watch and also people who love comedy will love this anime as well as people who love action will love this too.",

It starts out a bit lame nd boring I have to admit but then bam! it gets really gd nd all the characters change from pathetically weak to strong. I would  give this story a nine!\r\nArt: wellthe art was fine with me, it started out kinda weird nd I have to admit ugly. my first impression on Tsuna was wow his hair is worse then the ppl in DBZ (no offense) , but the art is unique nd gd lookin ppl do come later ^_~\\n\\n\r\nSound: normal not bad and not gd it suited the story nd the background\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: this is what hit me, the evolution of the characters. Tsuna was pathetically weak nd stupid. When I first watched him I was like  *_* nd  Hibari was plain weird who can be that in love with school??? but the characters all change they get stronger and nicer. Tsuna mostly, he gets hotter too!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I am enjoyin the anime alot, its funny and has action. Weird story but u get used to it! There are times when I would be yawning and fast forwarding the ep cause it got boring nd there where times when I would watch 7 or 8 eps a day,  biting my nails!  It gets really gd ^^\\n\\n\r\nOverall: for me 8 is best suiting for an anime like this, probably cause I've watched better. but still the anime is worth watching! REBORN!!!!!",

            "content": "Hitman Reborn\u2019s story revolves around a teenage boy attending Junior High whom everyone calls \u201cTsuna\u201d. He is known to be bad physically and academically and top of that, he is unpopular, an absolute \"loser\" and had no friends. His life however, takes a sudden and extraordinary change when \u2018Reborn\u2019, an infamous hitman from the Vongola mafia family, takes a flight to Japan and trains Tsuna into becoming the 10th boss of Vongola.\r\nOne of the largest flaws in Hitman Reborn\u2019s storytelling is the plot inconsistencies, not much planning can be seen in the plots department. That\u2019s the sole reason why Hitman Reborn\u2019s story changed so muchdrastically over the years as the author published it.  First, we have normal everyday school life with humors and styles that could easily been seen as a gag comedy. Many people may not know this but originally the author Amino Akira intentionally thought that the manga was going to be a gag comedy or a parody of sorts.\\n\\n\r\n The action comes in and the anime finally became what it is more intended for.. shounen. It is at this time where arcs like the Kokuyo Arc and Varia Arc emerged. And for the final arc which is the largest arcs in the series the \"future arc\",  now turns into a bizarre arc which even involved time traveling on a large scale. Ironically, it seems this franchise gotten more known just when the actions started kicking in. I myself, also prefer the more technical and bizarre plot too, with all those time traveling, guardians, rings, boxes and deathperation flames, in contrast to the formerly gag tropes and comedy that was supposed to be hilarious, but i personally didn't find it the parodies or the comedy that funny at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHitman Reborn is pretty poor at character developments. Out of all the characters, Tsuna is probably developed the most. But even then the way the MC is developed in this show is spread out so thin, that you have to be well into 100+ episodes just to see slight change in his personality and character. By the end of the show, he finally shows some qualities, but STILL does not accept the fact that he wants to join the mafia, i really found this very agitating after going through so much growth and change, he still denies that he is a boss which is something that happened at the very start of the series. For the other characters, I found them a bit annoying at first but after learning more about them, I grew to love some of them and each of their special traits the characters possesses. Yamamato is probably my most favorite of the vongolo guardians, reborn is definitely the most intriguing and interesting character in the series.\\n\\n\r\nHitman Reborn has a big character cast and I can\u2019t help but find that some of them are nothing more then just plot devices. Besides, some of the characters could even be removed and the show would have been perfectly fine too. Especially when it\u2019s nearing the end, there\u2019s the main character and his guardians, the Varia, the Acrobelona, Mukuro/Chrome and the rest of the gang.\\n\\n\r\nAfter some epic fights, the Antagonists guys are defeated but they usually don\u2019t die. Then after a while, they return and help the protagonist. Rinse and repeat and that explains the huge character cast and over all structure of how the story is told. Having so many characters made viewers lose focus on the main characters, namely Tsuna and his guardians. Nevertheless, Hitman Reborn still has some good traits for certain characters.  \\n\\n\r\nThe acrebelno characters were my in my opinion my most favorite and the background history behind these charactersz  in the show during some of the acs were the most compelling i though and definitely gave the linear and inconsistent story structure some redeeming qualities. This is not the largest focus in the anime though, i imagine in the manga their will be much more focus on the acrebelono.\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime that started in 2006, it has quite a decent level of art and animations. Though I found their battle animations looking a bit stiff at some points but that is nothing to fret about as most of the elements are illustrated thoroughly. The art styles is well designed and the characters and settings did not lack too many details from the original artwork.\\n\\n\r\nHitman Reborn has a lot of great openings and endings, one of the redeeming things i loved bout the music in the show. One of my favorite is LM.C\u2019s BOYS & GIRLS. I also like LM.C\u2019s 88, CHERRYBLOSSOM\u2019s DIVE TO WORLD and Ame Ato by w-inds. The voice acting is good too. I think the only voice acting I don\u2019t like in this show is Gokudera. He sounds too forced, especially when he had to shout during battles, doing tsukkomi or when he had to show sincerity in his voice. I do like Mukuro\u2019s distinctive \u201cfufufu\u201d and Hibari\u2019s \u201ckamikorosu\u201d and Squalo\u2019s \u201cVOOOI!!!\u201d Kind of reminds me of one piece's unique laughs.\\n\\n\r\n Both the sound effects and background music are good but seems reused a lot as you watched the more later episodes. I really wished they mixed it up  a bit and didn't rehash the same over used music from the start of the show in later arcs. How ever it definitely makes up for it when you get towards the end with some ground breaking epic music used to close off the show, but that really doesn't redeem its quality as far as music, to much rinse and repeat tunes and the limited amount of sound tracks really didn't keep me that interested during some of the more dramatic events, or the comedy moments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion i would have to say that their is quite the fan following in this series, alot of people enjoyed it, i just happen to not be one of them. Like i said the inconsistencies of the pacing of the story and the underdeveloped characters, personalities types, such as the infamous \"hibari\" which lots of fans loved, i really didn't care for him because of his over used lines such \"i will bite you to death\" or \"you must not lay a hand om nanimori\" and almost dense like personality. It really turned me off as a viewer. Many of the characters i guess you can say have these types of traits to them then uniquely identify them as who they are but the dialogues they used are just over used to the point, that it kind of takes away the enjoyment in watching them go through growth and change through out the show. \\n\\n\r\nIf your an action fan, some of the fights are choreographed pretty well like bleach. Some of the action moments i really enjoyed and watching is a definite improvement over the manga in that regards. How ever if you are looking for a series that has a deep compelling plot, look else where, because this is really catered to more of that action shonen demographic rather then some one who really wants to see a deep interesting story unfold and characters with lots of depth to it. \\n\\n\r\nOn a final note, it has taken me literally almost 8 months to finish this show and thats a long time. I still have yet to read the remainder of the manga, some mysteries and some plot threads are introduced towards the end that i found very intriguing, so i may continue the manga, but the story that amino akira wrote could of had much more development, much more interesting characters and over all a more consistent and deep plot rather then using the same old competition like scenario's in the show.",

            "content": "(not a full review, just my thoughts on the series.)\r\nThe story really picks up around episode 60 (?) and gets quite interesting. It's almost as if it were a different anime from the previous episodes.\r\nI just want to say that the characters are pretty one dimensional. Even Reborn. his appeal is basically he's a chibi badass. what more is there to him? even less for all the other characters. one dimensional take everything easy guy, one dimensional super extreme guy, one dimensional grumpy loyal guy, one dimensional \"i love the school, i'm an aloof guy\"  their catch phrases are basically repeated every freaken episode.\r\nTheone character that i really like and is fresh is Lambo. His voice actor does one heck of a job too. Granted he may be one dimensional too, but it's not boring in the way the others are. His mannerisms are likable. It's mainly the voice acting that I fell in love with =]\\n\\n\r\n(It has been brought to my attention that the original manga was a gag series, and then was adapted by the anime. Possibly the reason why it suddenly got much better, idk. So that's sort of an excuse for the one dimensionality of the characters. Yet it still detractcs from the enjoyability of the anime, and I don't think it was impossible for the anime adapters to just give them more personality either)\\n\\n\r\nThe previous episodes serve as an introduction, but it is seriously way too long. it's like the first 3 episodes of a 26 episode series dragged out for 50 episodes. But still they're not too bad. You'll just definitely notice when the real story arc starts.\\n\\n\r\nAfter being on that exciting new story arc, you'll find it kinda slows down in some parts. Especially \"training arcs\". Training arcs are basically one by one character episodes that follow each element. During this time, you really notice the one dimensionality of the characters and you just know it's a mini filler for acquiring new power/upgrades. And they're not substantial like the challenge arc for the Vongola X seat, just a nuisance. If the training arcs were removed or made more enjoyable from the series (they're sort of like mini fillers imo), the pace would be quite solid. Still, i stopped watching every newest episode b/c the pace was too slow at 1 episode a week. I'll maybe come back to it months later, after \"buffering\" a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOne other note is about elements. Wind water fire earth lightning, or other combinations of that have been done to death, BUT YET! Katekyou i think executed the most fresh take on elements in a very long time. Sky elements of cloud, sun, rain lightning etc? that by itself would not have gotten it so much points, but they way they weave it in to themes and stuff blends in smoothly. \\n\\n\r\nSo i have mixed feelings... im not raving about the fact that elements was used again in a shounen, but it's the best twist on elements  done in a long time... possibly ever will be. So i give it props for doing the fullest potential of elements.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:  the good parts are really good, especially when they drop the new-setting bomb (ep 60) on you. I shave off points for for having such a long intro arc and characters being one dimensional thus making it feel kiddy, and the boring training series.\\n\\n\r\nBut the good parts are pretty darn good. highlight mini arcs are Yamamoto's ssword series, the introduction of the new setting around ep 60, and the roots of the weaponry. The main plot is of course epic.\\n\\n\r\nstill, it's a bit immature of a shounen for me, but i can't deny the things it's done well (which i really didn't talk much about here did i? haha). Maybe i'm just growing up.\\n\\n\r\noh, some of the openning songs are just goosebump-inducing, like around ep 165...EYUGHH, soooo no-TY. But for sound rating are OP's and ED's even considered part of the anime series? the sound effects and music in the actual series aren't bad at all. I just really don't like some of the OP songs.",

            "content": "Katekyo Hitman Reborn!\r\nThis series is one of my personal favorites to be honest. It takes a middle-school boy who is good at nothing-and turns him into a strong talented individual. I believe one of the values this show teaches us is that everyone has a talent, even if it appears we are no good.\r\nWhen I first started this show, I was sort of puzzled. An infant calling himself a \"hitman\" shows up to teach this boy \"no-good Tsuna\" how to be a top mafioso? Now I'm not going to lie, but this was a huge confusion for me. My first thought was that this wasa young children's show because of how the characters acted and sounded-especially the infant \"Reborn\". For the first 20 episodes or so, it was goofy, it was childish, and it was unappealing. Watching over the show again, I still think that. Even later on, it's still goofy, but at least it doesn't go overboard, and manages to keep it's cool. It's a fact that the show has a weak start and doesn't attract the audience as it should as this series is more of a supernatural action show rather than comedy. It bolsters both comedy and action and combines it to try and grab a greater audience, although I feel that most of the audience is here for the action(maybe i'm wrong, just my beliefs). That being said, I feel it does a great job of introducing new characters and their personalities into the fray. Tsuna makes some friends, and so the show begins. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that threw me off at beginning was the character of Hibari Kyoya. Supposedly a tough bad boy who beats up on the weak to teach them a lesson. He rules the entire school through fear. When his character gets introduced into the anime, I get the wrong feeling about him. Usually, the good guys in an anime are there to protect the weak and defeat the strong, and he doesn't make an exception for Tsuna. This would generally imply that he's a bad guy, but it didn't quite pan out as expected(not to spoil anything). That being said, his personality is excellent and hard to find among anime good guys. He is one of a kind and made a fantastic addition to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing but good things to say about this anime. The one thing that prevented me from giving it a 10 for enjoyment was how some of the episodes waste themselves giving a recap of previous ones. This also includes the first five minutes excluding the opening song,(one-fifth of the show) recapping what happened last time on the show. I feel this is an excuse to shorten the length a little bit. If people have missed previous episodes, that is their own fault. That is what re-runs are for. \\n\\n\r\nThis show throws the audience for a loop when the major action starts. I found myself watching 30 episodes a day. Supernatural powers, intense battle scenes with amazing twists, and maturing characters spring up out of nowhere and turn this into a struggle of survival. I guarantee this show will knock your socks off, even if you're not wearing socks. The soundtrack is great, some of the best anime music ever made. The art is beautiful, perfect for an anime of this caliber. This show teaches us the values of friendship and to work hard and do our best so we can live life to the fullest. I highly recommend this anime to anyone who is a fan of superpowers/action.\\n",

            "content": "I'd have to say this first; Shounen is not really my cup of tea. After all, I am a girl but Katekyo Hitman Reborn stood out to me along with very few shounen animes that I liked. \r\nKatekyo Hitman Reborn is a manga (adapted into an anime) by Amano Akira. (Want to know a fact you probably didn't know? Amano Akira used to be a yaoi artist!) Let me just say this first; I didn't like the graphics at first but as time passed, her art gradually improved. I took note that her art before wasn't detailed enough (I point out Tsuna's hairstyle in themanga and in the first episodes of the anime among many other things) but it then improved after a while. Compare the first few episodes to the more recent ones and then you'll see what I'm talking about. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, I applaud to Toshihiko Sahashi for his compositions. They worked well with the anime, especially during fight scenes and their character theme songs portray the character well. The most memorable ones probably (for me anyways) would be Hitoribocchi no Sadame sung by Kondou Takashi (Seiyuu to Hibari Kyoya) and Tsuna Life sung by Yukari Kokubun (Seiyuu to Sawada Tsunayoshi). They portray the character well. The rest of the character songs (There is an extensive list of it) are very good as well. \\n\\n\r\nNow, on to the touchy subject which is the plot. The whole point of the story is to see the progress of Sawada Tsunayoshi into becoming Vongola Decimo. The story is supposedly mafia-centralized (There are a lot of famiglia mentioned) but the whole \"mafia\" thing was practically null and void from the start. But, as the plot progresses, KHR developed into what it was supposed to be--a shounen manga that targets young boys (coughandraginghormonalgirlscough) that highlights more on fights and friendship and among other things. I'll just point this out; the anime and the manga could have done well without the unrequited romance. Seriously, that's what ticks off most female fans off the most. (coughamongmanyotherthingcough)\\n\\n\r\nI pretty much consider Katekyo Hitman Reborn to be a shounen, fantasy anime due to the un-mafia like features of the story. Even though it was supposed to be labeled as \"mafia\"; I mean, cursed people turned into babies? BABY spartan tutors? Animals the come from boxes? Power-up rings? (That sound really weird but it gets to the point) TIME TRAVEL? (seriously, that was by far the weirdest--and yet satisfactory--arc). That's only the short list too. \\n\\n\r\nDespite what I say, I enjoyed this anime. It's an entertaining show to watch due to the comedy and the iconic characters. Character development is well done in... most characters. They all have their backstories and reasons for this and that. What irks me is the fact that Hibari Kyoya remains as the most enigmatic characters in the entire series. I mean, unlike everyone else who has this backstory to them and shoves it up other people's faces, Hibari Kyoya remains the most mysterious (AND DOWN RIGHT HANDSOME) character in the KHR series. \\n\\n\r\nAn even touchier subject would be the fandom. Specifically, the shipping fandom. I'll just say this now; ship what you want to ship. Do not dis other people's ships unless you want a shipping war to commence. It's not a pretty sight, especially against me. Mind your own business and and we'll mind ours. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this anime to those who enjoy a good laugh and action scenes. I will warn those who have not seen it yet that the first arc is basically the most boring one of all. Seriously. It was just them in their daily lives. Also, beware to those who do not like people running around in their underwear with fire burning on his head. That was what put me off from watching this.",

            "content": "This story is a little ridiculous at first. It's starts out as a daily life/slapstick comedy, but then it evolves into an incredible story of succession and comradery. The main character is always reluctant about his destiny, but he steps up to protect those that he cares for and the world around him. Tsuna is the main character, but Reborn is his partner/tutor from start to finish. This anime covers quite a bit of the manga series and it has a couple of watchable filler arcs. I always advise skipping filler, but it's not necessary in this anime.\r\n\"No Good\" Tsuna is an ordinary kid inevery way (like the synopsis says), but his gentle nature is really what earns his nickname among his peers. He's not good at much, but his hidden potential is so vast that others gravitate to him as Reborn unlocks his \"power.\" This is an action/super power sort of story, but the daily life and comedy do great job of establishing an emotional bond with all of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in the manga is better, and there is a lot more of the story after the anime ends. The anime does end at a good point, so it doesn't feel lacking, but I recommend reading the manga.\\n\\n\r\nDo not miss this series. It's worth watching and it has high repeat value.",

            "content": "Story: The story is at the begin of the anime a little slow, but at episode 20 there is going to happen something that changes the whole anime. Namely it turns into an action anime. And that is when the story is really getting interesting. The point where most of the people are complaining about is the Future Arc, but i think that that is the point where the anime gets really good. There are two filler arcs in the Future Arc, and they are so well done that you won't even notice that it are fillers.\r\nArt: The art is really great. What i likeabout the art, is that it looks like every character is drawn with another art style. You have the children that are drawn like chibi characters and you have the normal people that are drawn like normal people. There is one thing that I didn't like about the art, that is after the first 2 arcs they censored the blood.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is also pretty good. The voice actors are good, and you never have the feeling that a voice actor doesn't fit with a character. All of the openings are good, they all stick in your head. They are so good that when i made a top 20 anime openings, that they where all in it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are really love-able. And you will memorize all of them. The character development is maybe the best of all anime. We begin with good-for-nothing Tsuna, and we end with i-saved-the-world Tsuna.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: In my opinion this is the most enjoyable anime. You will love the jokes, the fights and the plot twists.  \\n",

This serie will remind you of bleach or Naruto or other series like them.\r\nAt the start the charachers are weak and must train to take on greater oponents. \r\nThis may sound average but this serie does it great. \r\nAnd after a while in the story around season 3/4a super plottwist will happen wich is the highlight of the serie.

(Also.. english isn't my first language.)\r\nOk, Katekyo Hitman Reborn! is just a wonderful anime, it's funny action-packed and it's an anime that has something for everyone.\r\nWell even though I love it very much, i must say the first 20 episodes weren't very interssting. It was a Daily Life Arc and nothing really happened but it was funny and made me smile that's why I gave the anime a chance and didn't drop it. In those episodes you get to known the loveable characters until it starts getting interesting at episode 20 andthe Kokuyo Arc starts.\\n\\n\r\nStoryline: \\n\r\nKatekyo Hitman Reborn! is about a guy called Sawada Tsunayoshi (Tsuna) who just sucks at everything. His grades are bad, he fails at sport, doesn't really have any friends, and has only once talked to a girl (Sasawaga Kyoko) and has now a crush on her. Short: he is a failure and kinda pathetic, that's the reason why his classmates call him Dame-Tsuna/No-Good-Tsuna. Actually he sounds like a normal boy right? Wrong! Because Tsuna is a candidat for the position of the 10th boss of the Vongola Famiglia (a very famous mafia famiglia). But of course, he wouldn't be able to be a good boss right now, that's why the current vongola boss - the ninth - sends a great hitman who is a baby (called Reborn) from italy to japan, so that he teaches Tsuna how to become a good mafia boss. \\n\r\nAnd from this moment on, Tsuna's adventures start. He has to go through Reborn's hard training, meets a lot of 'scary' people who are part of the mafia, fights against them and finds while that training a lot of friends. But not only Tsuna is fighting. His friends - also his famiglia - are fighting and training with him.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good, and i don't know what else to say. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe sound is wonderful ! All the openings, endings and character songs were great and I always listen to them if I start missing this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nOk, now let's be honest. I never watched an anime where i like EVERY CHARACTER. They are maybe some characters I love more then others, but there isn't acutaly a character I don't like/ hate. Every single one is just loveable, unique and perfect just the way they are. All the characters grew on me and I loved it to watch their development and even the antagonists are great and you just can't hate them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI love Katekyo Hitman Reborn! and I love every single thing about it. The characters, the openings the endings, the character songs, and it just makes me happy and makes me smile. And I'll probably never love an anime more then KHR! There was only one thing that wasn't that great - the ending. But I don't know if it's just me? \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nListen here, if you are still don't watching KHR! then seriously- WTF ARE YOU WAITING FOR? Go and watch it right now, you won't regrent it ! This anime is great, the story, the characters, the art, the sound- just everything is amazing, and even though the Daily Life Arc isn't that interesting I still rated this anime as 10/10.",

But the only thing that no one will win against is how he treats hes friends with more respect than he can handle... Also Hitman reborn tells a story about Mafia and its worlds even thought its a funny one it has its own moments which shines more than in any other anime... \\n\\n\r\nWhen Tsunayoshi gets a letter from his to be tuttor and meets him his World is turned around 360 degrees and so the story of struggle , friendship , fights and many tears just to reach Peace comes in action ... All in all its a funny show with epic fights and heartwarming friendship moments which is a must watch in my oppinion (even thought i'm not the one to talk when i dropped it so many times...)\\n\\n\r\nBut where else can you find people flying ? time travel ? mafia fights and comedy in one ? which helds a awesome balance between everything plus some funny romance and many more!.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Kind of fantasy you know fantasy in real life flams coming out of nowhere and etc ... but its nice and looks cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I love the soundracks and some osts which i listen to everyday.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Alot of them eveyrone of them are different and has their own free will but still a strong bond between them all resides.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: At first i was like omg mafia ?

            "content": "*Includes spoilers*\r\nConstructive criticism is preferrd\r\nI recommend Katekyo Hitman Reborn with some caution as the series is really goofy at times and can get a bit annoying at middle of arcs.\r\nKatekyo Hitman Reborn tells a story about spineless and useless Sawada Tsunayoshi and his involvement with the \"mafia\". Start of the series is really comedic and most likely was intended as gag manga as in manga all of the really slice of life/comedy parts were in one arc taking up chapters 1-60. In anime first 19 episodes are the comical part,with some small stories being in between first 3 story arcs. For those who do notlike comedy I wouldn't recommend this anime but even if you are ok with comedy I would recommend starting from episode 19.\\n\r\nCharacters are introduced precisely in the order of importance at least for the main cast Reborn(the \"infant\"), Sawada,Gokudera,Yamamoto, Hibari and Ryohei. \\n\r\nMajority of the story revolves around Sawada,10th head of mafia and Reborn the infant hitman. The guardians (rest of previously named characters and one villain ) are constantly present at the story but the focus is rarely on them.\\n\r\nFor the actual story you could say the arc starts with Sawada being reluctant in taking the mantle of 10th head of mafia. Then suddenly enemy appears and defeat the guardians and it's time for some power ups. After the power ups the guardians defeat their corresponding enemy usually and Sawada defeats the big boss. End result everything is fine but the enemy becomes their allies for the rest of the arcs. Regardless of the linear plot of arcs  each of story arcs is enjoyable.\\n\r\nOn larger scale the plot is really full of plot holes and contradictions. Some are  later commented at manga but most are just let unattended. The longest,best  and darkest of arcs is the last of arcs in anime \"Future arc\" but instead of fixing any contradictions made earlier it makes just a load of new ones for example new gadgets and combat system. Meaning of elements and their interactions for example.\\n\r\nOn visual and sound side of things Katekyo Hitman Reborn! is great. Sounds sound great and visuals is great , combat in the future arc gets slightly worse grading from me, maybe for the combat system but I really don't like firing beams in anime and it wasn't really well done. \\n\r\nOverall I would give describe comical shonen series with it's fair share of twists, plenty of near meaningless fights and even less clear power ups. Bit series does keep you entertained and amused while watching Reborn.",

Moreover, the animation quality gets a lot better half way through!\r\nHowever, to truly appreciate this story I think you would have to read the manga portion after the anime...\r\nI would recommend reading the whole manga instead of watching the anime lol but then you would miss out on the awesome music....\r\nAnyways, in my humble opinion, I think this anime series was very good (I give it an 8.5, rounded up to 9) but the manga was mind blowing to me - the story, the humour and the dynamic just flows a lot better in mangaform... the fights and characters also look more badass in my opinion (the manga fight scenes had a lot more blood, character were more detailed)\\n\r\nAnyways that was just my opinion, I would recommend either the anime or manga - Katekyo Hitman Reborn is a great story!!",

I wish I've watched this anime when I was 14, I guess I would have been blown away by that but nevertheless since I am 22 it still gave an incredible impact. The perfection of the anime starts with the introducing the characters that are EXTRAORDINARY, all of them with no exceptions!! The plot throughout the series is getting stronger, and stronger, and stronger. The main advantage of the anime is its lightness - you watch and do not notice how time flies. The comic side of the story - brilliant, the dark side of the story - brilliant as well. But thefactor that made me love this anime completely is the person who has created the INCREDIBLE SOUNDTRACKS for this anime, opening and endings I am just in <333 with them all. And for everyone who wants the continuation - READ THE MANGA!!!! because it still has several twists and all the secrets become uncovered. Overall - 10/10! LOVE!!!",

            "content": "After watching this anime, it was apparent that superpowers and mafia, couldn't get any better than this. I enjoyed the action, in spite of the first 20 episodes, which were a bit of a bore, do the fact that it seemed to be just another guy with girl problems type anime but after that 21st episode, I was transfixed. Great use of character development, excellent use of color, balanced power levels for the characters. It was never something where the MC always won. He lost some battles, but learned lessons from them, and came back stronger, and that's what I love in a good anime.I would stay up till 2:00 in the morning, even though I had school the next day. That\"s how good an anime should be, with action, adventure, and amazing plot development. Now, my only issue is the supporting characters. For the love interest, and best friend, they were too stereotypical. We've all seen the love type that the MC can't seem to man up to approach. Yet in its defense, it was good that she wasn't the type to get in the way of his progress. I can appreciate that. As for the best friend, he was much too angry and haughty, but he was able to lean to control his actions, as he should. In all, this an amazing anime, and I would highly suggest that any Dragon ball or Naruto fans who are looking to delve deeper into anime, you might wanna give this anime a watch.",

You would not believe that Tsuna is important, until his caring mother hires a tutor to help Tsuna to get better grades, but it will be a shock for both of them when the supervisor is found to be a five-year old baby named Reborn. But he is no ordinary baby, he is a hitman from the infamous Mafia family, Vongola family, and tells Tsuna that he`s going to train him tobecome the tenth generations  next boss of the Vongola family. In the begining Tsuna dosen`t believe him, but later when Reborn shoots Tsuna with the Dying Will Bullet, Tsuna gets incredible powers and realizes that Reborn is serious. After that Tsuna starts to get new friends and fight, laugh and have fun with them. Throughout the series Tsuna grows together with his friends and become stronger and more mature, they go through a lot together, but they support each other and always go through it together without any problems, and it just shows how good friendship is. After that I started to watch the Katekyo Hitman Reborn series I saw a whole new kind of world of action, adventure and comedy. It is simply wonderful and full of friendship, relating moments and wonderful feelings. After that you have started to see the anime you will see the maffia from a whole new perspective and that's why I want you to look at series, so you can get a whole new understanding of how the Mafia could be and who knows maybe you will like the series. Unfortunately the series end on episode 203, but don`t worry there is always the Manga that still continues. But you never know maybe some day they will begin to broadcast the series again.",

Simply watch this 203 (so far-it's on leave at the moment) episode series and watch it unfold before your eyes. 203 episode too many, you say? Well you'll be wishing for more once you finish them all. There is constant danger and new technology, feeding your mind with unreachable possibilities. You'll be onthe edge of your seat on minute, laughing unintelligebly the next, and then talking, pleading to your computer screen, telling Tsuna what to do next. The characters are very relateable and very varied. The storyline never stops and as soon as you think it's over, the next great thing occurs. A fantastic anime that fills your imagination, mind, and heart.",

It was especially comedy and for somebody who don\u00b4t like comedy can be hard to get through but after that KHR changes its coat and change itself for awesome, action anime with great story. Another plus are characters. You can see some story behind each one of them oryou can just use your own  fantasy to create it with hiden hints in anime. \\n\\n",

            "content": "My first review. \r\nI watched Katekyo Hitman Reborn with an open mind. I heard a lot of good things about it and saw Tsuna in J-stars Victory VS. When I started it, I had fun watching the first episodes of it. But then I started to think it was getting old until I got to episode 20. \r\nStory:10\r\nTsunayoshi Sawada, a clumsy, not-so-athletic middle-schooler that doesn't get good grades, gets chosen by the current Vongola boss and has to be trained by cursed, which makes him look like a baby, Arcobaleno named Reborn. He gets shot by Reborn with a dying will bullet, which will onlywork if he regrets anything before he gets shot. He gets different types of people for his team in future battles.\\n\r\nArt:10 \\n\r\nDespite being made back in 2006 to 2010, the art style looks fantastic. There is a lot of things to notice in the place where the main characters are or even in the background. Even the main characters look perfect. \\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in the anime is awesome in the entire series. It even got to the point where I began to search up the soundtrack online. Even the opening songs are actually good and well done. My favorite opening song in KHR is opening 4 and my favorite in-anime soundtrack is either Tsuna Awakens or In Operation. \\n\r\nCharacter:10 \\n\r\nKatekyo Hitman Reborn lets you know that it is a mix between an action and a comedy when it comes to the characters. The first 20 episodes makes sure you thoroughly know all of the main main characters, are Tsuna, Gokudera, and Yamamoto. There are a lot of characters in KHR. Especially during the Future Arc which introduces the most characters in the entire series. All in all, the characters are all cool.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nThe amount of enjoyment is a lot as it starts to pick up. The fight scenes are really well done and will really start to get better in episode 74. It is an anime well worth the 3 months if watching and so glad I watched it.\\n\r\nOverall:10 \\n\r\nThe story is well written, the art is well drawn, the sound and characters are all original and cool, and it is really enjoyable. Even though it finished, I would really like to see a second series or a dub (even though dubs are bad) so more people could watch it. The anime really deserved the time I spent on it.",

            "content": "I'll sum up my review right now: I loved this anime like no other series I've watched. It was a truly trilling and fun journey I've been through when watching these 203 episode. Also, I'll admit, I re-watched the whole series 3 times. 3. I'm planning on a fourth time. I could watch 25+ episodes everyday including both the opening and ending songs. There was just no way I could skip them because of how epic it is.\r\nIf you love action, easy-going, comedic, yet sometimes sad and surprising type of anime, I highly recommend this. True, some people watch the first few episodes and theygive up. They miss out greatly at the end.\\n\\n\r\nFrom someone who's watching this over and over again, I'm giving some advice. Watch this to the end. It's worth it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThe story was beautiful but it had it's problems - it started a bit too late. The real plot began after around 20 episodes. That's the reason why people drop watching this anime before the plot even starts. Like I said before, don't give up and just watch through these starting episodes. Have a good detailed understanding of the characters! They are so original that you hope for them to be real in our world. These episodes may not be about the main story itself but it is: Useful, Funny, and Heart-warming.\\n\r\n(Note, if you don't feel motivated to watch this anime yet, go listen and watch all their opening/endings.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is just like the story - it started off a bit on the rough side but soon improved greatly. In the first few episodes, characters had slightly weird face proportions, well not totally like that but just slightly weird when draw from different angles. After about 10 episodes though, it improved. Everything did, the smoothness, angles, shadows, etc. If you compare a picture of Tsuna from episode 203 with episode 1, you can see a giant difference which for me, didn't even notice when watching through this series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nWhat can I say, the soundtracks and openings/endings for this anime are just legendary! I've never skipped a single opening/ending from the first time I watched this anime - which I normally do to other animes. Sometimes, instead of listening to the song, I also watch the animation there because it's just so beautiful. Back to sound, Reborn is one of those anime which has the best songs and soundtracks for every moment. Whenever 'Into Sorrow' or 'Tragic Past' plays, I literally start bawling. On the other hand, when 'X-Burner' or 'Flame of Resolution' plays, I feel like I can overcome anything. Because of all these awesome songs/soundtracks, I have 83 of them in my Itunes and more still coming.\\n\r\nThe songs for Katekyoushi Hitman Reborn has its own category in the list of epic. In my opinion, it's the best of the best.\\n\r\n(Make sure you listen to 'X-Burner'. Thats song itself will motivate you to watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI've mentioned slightly before (Story), the characters in this anime have their own past, story, and originality. The difference between them just make up this goofy yet undefeatable group.\\n\r\nLeadership, Loyalty, Fun, Determination, Strength, Mystery - these make up our heroes and it's what they'll use to fight for the world. They all have their qualities and their bad points but that's why they'e so lovable.\\n\r\nSpoiler: I love Kyoya the most. He's just so cool.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nFrom all that I've said, I'm pretty sure you all know what I'll write for this one.\\n\r\nKatekyoushi Hitman Reborn is the anime I've ever loved so far and I'm pretty sure, the one I'll never forget and love till the end.\\n\r\nIn my heart I pray and hope that they'll make a sequel - the few arcs left at the back. In fact, I don't even mind if it's all fillers. I just want this anime back so badly. Also, I can talk about how much I love this anime but we'll sum it up: I love everything about it. Everything.\\n\r\nIt makes you laugh till there are tears, it makes you cry and it makes you so pumped you can punch the table. (I did)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nYou still reading this? I want you to go watch it right now! Or else you'll miss out on a lifetime fun and enjoyment. Also, don't forget to watch their Rebocons (They're live shows) Thy have about 6 of them, this shows how famous it was. Make sure you watch it and have fun!!!",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite anime. There are a lot of interesting and fun characters. After the first 20 episodes, it gets better and better and you can't help watching it one episode after another. tsuna's development as a character is fun to watch especially even though he is still a coward at heart, he still does everything in his power to protect his loved ones. Future Arc is the most enjoyable part of the series and all the characters keep improving to defeat their enemy and you can feel their struggle and achievment. I watched it nearly four times from the beginning tothe ending. I'm still hoping for the rest of the manga to be turned into anime. Also the music is awesome. Tsuna's theme and Hibari's theme especially makes you live their fight.",

            "content": "KHR is a relatively lighthearted battle shonen which begins its story in a rather unusual way, focusing on slapstick comedy and a bizarre set of characters even by shonen standards. This mode of storytelling continues for most of the first season before suddenly switching to a slightly more mature tone and introducing battle situations. This is where the series really starts to develop into its own identity, carrying its comedic nature with it and balancing it with the tougher issues facing our unlikely hero as he is dragged further into the mafia world. \r\nThe resulting plot develops into a rather strange adventure involving elements ofillusion magic, science fiction, and other concepts you wouldn't expect to see in a typical mafia story, but KHR is hardly a typical story of any sort. It's a creative and colorful action series which manages to depict a developing set of characters as they battle corrupt opponents much bigger than them while remembering its roots as a comedy story. \\n\\n\r\nPart of KHR's strength is its devotion to developing these characters from folks who once regularly took part in gag episodes with no serious consequences for their actions into characters who can overcome the hurdles thrown at them by their new lives as members of the powerful Vongola family. Tsunayoshi Sawada, our lead character, starts out as a nearly hopeless timid wreck, yet over time he grows into a character who becomes willing to bear the burdens of others and use his powers to defeat the corruption he encounters in the mafia underworld (which often results in him further cementing himself as the eventual heir to the Vongola family, despite his apprehension of the idea). His motley crew of friends, most of which are also dragged into this situation unexpectedly, must also learn to take responsibility in their own ways as the guardians of the soon to be 10th Vongola boss. Unfortunately, some of the main cast is left behind in character development as the show progresses, but watching certain characters (especially Tsuna) grow into stronger, more insightful individuals continues to be a rewarding part of an already entertaining adventure.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is standard for a long running series. Most episodes do not stand out compared to the higher production values of many shorter action anime, though there is the occasional beautifully animated episode for some of the more dramatic battles from the manga version. Where KHR does manage to stand out, however, is in its unique art style and vibrant colors. The show can be a treat to simply look at, with the vibrant colors reflecting its equally lively tone. \\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, KHR is a mixed bag. While comedic sound effects during its slapstick humor often fit right in, the sound effects during battles are sometimes underwhelming, and one might say that much of the soundtrack introduced later in the series fails to capture the viewer's attention as effectively as the tracks from earlier seasons. Fortunately, the opening and ending themes are much more enjoyable, ranging from pop music to harder rock songs. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, KHR is among the more creative long running shonen series out there, combining an odd set of characters, lighthearted comedy, and the most bizarre mafia adventure you'll ever see into one package. It's one of the more under appreciated battle shonen series, and well worth a look if you enjoy series such as One Piece and Naruto.",

So with much hesitation, i decided to try it out. The start wasn't extremely captivating but it certainly was interesting. It might have been a slow start but CERTAINLY WORTH IT! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! It's EXTREMELY funny and the action is great! As a Narutaud, i would say KHR almost matched up to Naruto, in some cases, might excel it. I think the only problem,for me, would be 203 EPISODES IS NOT ENOUGH! The story is great, the art is great, the characters are AMAZING and i ENJOYED IT SOOOO MUCH! :)",

I kept on watching it by skipping it 10 seconds and going fast-forward only because I was the only Shonen anime I hadn't watched and it's definitely below them all. I was intrigued by the prospects of the base story of the Mafia world in the beginning, the Flames in the middle and the Box weapons in the end. This series could have been much better if only the writer had gone into more character development. The anime has useless childish moments of the protagonistTsuna's girlfriends worrying about him,. Instead they could have utilised it in character development of the some really interesting characters, Rokudo Mukuro, byakuran, etc. and provide a history of their past events. Half of the characters history is unknown (Flan and others). The series should have exploited more of their calibre by getting more fights. \\n\r\nAnother bad thing was any good weapon/concept was only used once, e.g. the combination of box weapons, etc. \\n\\n\r\nThis series has humour and little action but fails on the story part. The concept of Mafia, ring, flames, 7 policy, etc in the anime could have made it a marvellous anime but the inadequate usage of the elements has brought it to the bottom of my anime list.\\n\r\nNow that I think about it, I wasted quite a long time, especially during the starting 50 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nPotential wasted !",

Yeaah making a 14 year old a boss of a mafia family, yeah like nothing bad's ever going to him except dying and also being atarget and can easily be killed with a bullet in his head. But you know what this is an anime,oh yeah and another thing you know how this is an anime about the mafia only TWO characters have guns the rest of the cast has like close combat weapons, which is stupid how they can't kill them when they can just stand on a roof top across the school and you can just shoot them with a sniper rifle. But yeah the stories okay, because the first 20 episodes are going to be the most stupidest way to introduce characters and it will forever just to get good make sure you have alot of time to kill or if you do watch it just make sure you have something soft and fluffy to hit your head against.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 5\\n\r\nI can't really say anything for the art it's okay nothing particularly special about it, since it's like any other long running anime, There maybe some weird moments where the characters look weird, but yeah that's the only bad thing I could say. The fight scenes are the only good part about probably where all the money went. But other than that it's okay.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nThe sounds are the only things that I would consider giving it something over an eight, because the voices actually fit the characters, but I don't really remember the back round that's probably just me, it may be different for other people. The OPs and EDs are actually the best things about the sound section they got right music for the arc and the OPs and EDs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 3\\n\r\nUgh, the characters I hated the characters, they were so annoying, this is what almost made me quit the series the characters. There's so much things I hate about them, first of all you know nothing about the characters or just barely any thing about them just little things, another thing their not funny I don't get why? Tsuna is a wimp it's annoying, well to me. Gokudera is another annoying character, He basically warships Tsuna like a god and completely f*cks off everybody else. Yamamoto..... there's nothing to say about him except that he's a nice kid. Ryohei he's like the annoying screaming neighbor kid. Lambo annoying crying spoiled brat that makes you want to throw him off a cliff. Hibari I seriously think that he's just here for the famale fanbase and for the fujoshi's. Chrome, ugh Chrome she is completely useless in fighting. Mukuro, seriously dude you could've gotten a better person than Chrome. The girls they do nothing it would've been better if they weren't involved with the mafia because, ugh, this is so misogynist all the girls get defeated easily, get saved by them, do nothing but housework and cook..... May be it would've been better if they die that'll be real twist a dark one. Oh yeah, the villans are a joke by the way don't even think of them as villans. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3\\n\r\nkilled me with the characters but thats about it I can't really say anything about it.\\n\\n\r\nOh and another thing why there only two characters that have guns in this entire anime about the mafia. Okaythings that make it a awesome mafia show awesome and likeable main characters, guns a very dark story from the beginning and good villans. this anime lacks those things there fore making it a bad mafia anime. \\n",

I'll watch it.\" I got hooked! It was so cool and I fell in love with it!!! I was like \"How could I find this stupid before???\" I watched the whole first season in two days. I toldthe friend how I love it and she was all I told u so. It's an amazing anime and I am almost done with it. Every plot line is interesting and keeps u wanting more. You can't just watch one epsiode and leave. The characters develop in unique ways and have interesting personalities. Learning about their pasts and seeing the fights are amazing. Thevoice actors are also amazing. Listening to Tsuna's voice actress throughout the whole series shows her fantastic abilities! I highly recommend this anime! I also agree with many ppl who say kids should be watching thus instead of Pokemon, the Jersey Shore, etc.",

So during the summer where I had loads of free time, I finally picked it up again. This time I was really immersed in it (going on a Reborn Rampage) and now impatiently waiting for the next episode.\r\nI really recommend Reborn, and according to me it is the best anime ever. Theplot on Mafias is really interesting, and I find it great how they like to focus on a ''Future\" arc where all the characters are shown their adult forms, as normally in other anime series everyone is dying to see the main character after 10 years, but they either don't show it or show a glimpse of it only.\\n\r\nReborn's story is original, and I seriously enjoyed every part of it.",

            "content": "When I first started watching Reborn! The anime looked liked any other apart from a  baby infant carrying a gun, WEARING A SUIT not a diaper'. But you understand that soon, the main protagonist is absolutely nuts when he gets serious. What was the author thinking? Without that aspect he's just a wimp and a No gooder. \r\nBecause of this I put the anime on hold for a while, but wondered a 203 episode anime couldn't be so shit. So I carried it on and what do you know, upon reaching the first arc everything changed it totally met my expectations. The story includeslots of cliffhangers making you want to watch the next episode as fast as you can. This feeling doesn't die down until you've seen what's going to happen next.  \\n\r\nSo after sifting through all the episodes I ended up watching the next 189 episodes all in one go.  It was definitely worth my time\\n\\n\r\nLikes:\\n\r\n- A unique story, something different that hasn't been created yet.\\n\r\nBrings a new light on shounen manga as its mainly aimed at boys because even as a girl it was very enjoyable and suited my tastes.\\n\r\n- Interesting characters with development throughout the story. Various characters are introduced and some are then involved in the further arcs which is good. \\n\r\n- Multiple battles with action, not to mention the result of the battles are satisfying.\\n\r\n- The flow of the story as the characters moved from one predicament to another. \\n\r\nEven though there are fillers in between they have relevance to the upcoming arcs. Which I cant argue about but it could do with a change to the story. All action animes have some of these moments in them to not bore us out.\\n\r\n- A range of genres adapted into the story to make it more entertaining and not too serious for it to be hardcore. A nice mix.\\n\\n\r\nDislikes\\n\r\n- Too many fillers \\n\r\n- I think there was a slow start to the story because it wasn't serious enough to be proper action(in my opinion) and it started to get boring towards the beginning. Which could easily make you halt the series.\\n\r\nAs well as the first 14 episodes not having any particular purpose other than background information on the protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'm giving this series a 9 mainly because of the beginning because so many people could miss out on such an exciting anime. \\n\r\nIf your looking for a thrilling, action, comedy, a bit futuristic anime. Try it out, it might become your #1.\\n",

            "content": "Katekyo Hitman Reborn is no doubt one of my all-time- favourites. Everyone has different opinions, and albeit rewatching this anime many times, this is my first time writing a review, so this might not prove helpful. \r\nThe first 20 episodes, yes, messy and looked like utter nonsense. The author had planned to make the show that of comedy, but changed midway to focus on the action shonen genre. The real fight starts from around ep 25/26, before mostly focused on character introductions. \r\nLike the summary says, the story revolves around a middle-school student known as Tsuna. He was bad at sports and academics, also clumsy,hence earning him the nickname 'Dame-Tsuna' (No-Good Tsuna). One day, an infant called Reborn appeared and revealed the truth of Tsuna's paternal bloodline, having originated from the founder of the currently strongest Mafia Famiglia. The anime isn't very mafia-like in the sense that it isn't bloody and full of guns. It has its own superpower, but one that relies on the character's resolve/determination. The series shows the trials Tsuna goes through as the only heir left to the famiglia, even though he was supposingly a civilian and not a mafioso.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, Tsuna seems very whiny, and that didn't really change due to him constantly refusing to be the heir of the family. But well, Tsuna grew up without any unique skill, constantly bullied and jeered at, with a father that hardly visited home, a loving but oblivious mother and also whilst a bit of a spoiler, had his power and a partial memory sealed. \\n\\n\r\nThe series would be a far better experience if you continue the manga, revealing a greater character developments and also about Reborn. He isn't plainly sadistic, he knows what he is doing. \\n\r\nAlso whilst cliche, Tsuna is the type that fights for his friends. Even amidst him loathing the mafia and violence, he continues to risk his life to fight, at a point for the future of the world. As one who didn't have friends growing up with him (due to his incapabilities), he strongly valued them, as well as the home tutor Reborn who brought them along with the suffering he gave.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is also somewhat old, so the art at the beginning is not as satisfactory, and animation quality mostly available at 360p. Additionally, the soundtracks are captivating.",

            "content": "*Some Spoilers...kinda?*\r\nI think the Story started really good and could have been great. But it seemed like at a certain point it became simply training arcs and a bad story. I really think it was great at the start, and the time travel thing was actually really cool the way they did it (despite the fact that the explanation was kinda dog shit and annoyed me). It had great things to work with a so much potential but they stuffed it towards the end with such desperation in hyping stuff up and then no being able to deliver. Story 6/10\r\nThe art isn't amazingly clean butit was made in 2006 and looks alright for the time, since animation has progressed a lot. Plus I actually really like it's animation anyway. It's really fun to watch but can be made pretty damn cool too. It's nothing amazingly special but it was still pretty good. Art 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSoooooo it wasn't bad in sound really. I mean it worked alright in all the animation and the op's were always really fun to watch, and I honestly love them. Don't really know what to say about sound a lot unless something sticks out so that's it. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are kinda ok. I mean some to pretty good. It's just...they're kinda predictable. Gokudera either loses or draws, yamamoto is going to win unless he's dealing with some crap which happened like once. Tsuna trains and gets plot armored like all hell (granted he has easily one of my favourite powers in all of anime and uses them like a boss). The rest kinda start blending in after that. They don't really have any other tones to them and I'm not saying they have none, because they definitely do. Just not enough. I would have preferred a bunch of those training episodes be something really cool to watch and have some decent character development. Character 5/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite everything I have to say about this and that I'm trying to give it redeeming qualities on paper,I really did enjoy the crap out of it. Yes later in the show kinda drained the life outta me a bit and the end was...trash. I honestly have no excuse to the fact I binged it like crazy because it gave me a really good form of simply being happy with a show having fun with itself...Did I make sense there? I can't be bothered reading over it so I'll say it did. Anyway yeah, it was just something that was so much fun to watch really. Plus the fights were for the most part actually pretty good in my opinion, and at the very least they were fun to watch. Gokudera vs...um...crap...ah...GAMMA!! Yeah that guy. Favourite fight of the whole series. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI can bash on things for ages but it doesn't change that I'm gonna say just give it a shot and see how you do. It has a slightly slow start but is fun to watch anyway and has some really good things too. Just um...good luck with Lambo...he might make you stop watching...Good luck fam",

This anime gives you a really good chance to get to know the characters and see how they react and shows that people have weaknesses . This anime definitely isn't like other shounen anime where the weakling becomes superstrong or becomes a hero in one night but it's a gradual build up that shapes the characters personality.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime remains one of my all-time favorite anime since I watched in March 2015 and I haven't found that many anime that I love as much as this one.",

            "content": "It may not have a great start into introducing one's self into both Manga and Anime culture like both Dragon Ball and Pokemon have the effect of doing so but Katekyo Hitman Reborn! is a Shonen Jump series aimed at slightly younger audiences then the ones that primarily watch Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto and Bleach so it may be a good idea to start with Reborn! before getting too deeply into what Manga/Anime is.\r\nReborn! is a story of adolescence, learning and conviction...every Shonen genre based franchise tends to always have a theme to center focus upon, for Dragon Ball-aliens and martial arts, for OnePiece-pirates, for Naruto-ninjas and for Bleach-ghost samurai.\\n\\n\r\nIn Reborn!'s case its mafia, it is the story of a young man of whom has been chosen to inherit a great destiny for himself and others for he discovers that he is descended from a bloodline that a great mafia boss once belonged to and now, having reached the 10th generation of the mafia family known, as the Vongola, Tsunayoshi Sawada has been chosen, as the 10th generation Vongola boss.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there's just one problem: he's no good, literally, he's no good at anything whatsoever, he has earned the nickname \"No good Tsuna\" because he's hopeless at basically everything, in order to prep him for when he eventually takes over the Vongola and in order to inspire both confidence in himself and others, the Vongola sends one of its members to serve, as Tsuna's tutor about many things, about the mafia, life in general and etc...the member they send in question is a talking baby hit man named Reborn and he becomes determined to make Tsuna's life, as miserable, as can be...\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the series Reborn! may not start from anything special, soon enough, it begins to change and evolve into something interesting, originally Reborn! was envisioned, as a parody series about mafia and daily life elements mixed together but upon reaching the 2nd Story Arc of the series, it became more Shonen battle like and had started introducing unique elements not shown in a Shonen Jump series before.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time the 3rd Story Arc begins, Reborn! becomes an official proper Shonen battle series but manages to keep itself fresh and show new ideas almost practically all the time, giving viewers time to engage themselves into the story of it all.\\n\\n\r\nI will say now that Reborn! doesn't really match up to Dragon Ball standards but again, it is intended for younger viewers and it may help to introduce someone into what Manga/Anime is truly all about.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and the characters are engaging, can't say much about the artwork used for the Anime but the artwork for the Manga definitely gets high points, these would have to be Reborn!'s strongest points.\\n\\n\r\nStory, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment and Overall all deserve praise, Reborn! is definitely a worthwhile series to watch and if it matches your tastes for what you want to see in a Shonen battle series then it will not disappoint but lastly remember, since its intended for younger audiences, it will not measure to the scopes of series like Dragon Ball, comes pretty damn close though.\\n\\n\r\nI have only two problems with Reborn!, as a series:\\n\\n\r\n1-Like Bleach's Anime, it doesn't cover the whole story line featured in the Manga.\\n\\n\r\nand 2-It is the only Shonen battle series i know so far that has not got a proper English Dubbed version at all whatsoever, this might make some viewers happy since not everyone holds high regards of English Dubbed Anime.\\n\\n\r\nI hope my Review was helpful in any way.",

Story starts off slowly and it takes a while to get to the action but then picks up speed. There are episodes where I just want to shout at the characters for one thing or another and then there are episodes where I am on the edge of my seat. No matter how many times I watch it I always feel the same. \r\nSome of the characters are more mature than others and some I just wanted to tell them to grow up andact their age.  The MC is treated like a child at some times and at others expected to be an adult. \\n\r\nThe only problems I have is that the whole story wasn't animated and its not dubbed in english.",

Set in the mafia world where a baby is a hit man may seem a bit weird but after character introductions in the first 20 episodes you really get to see the world of mafia and how cool it really is. \r\nThe fights are cool and do take time so it displays a hard fought out fight and not a one hit K-O in one episode. I love how the powers are related to elements and I love the meaning ofeach element. Character development is also good as it shows how each member grows to become stronger which I love as well. The comedy is also quite funny at times and overall I really enjoyed this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime may have finished but I really hope they bring it back as there is still a lot to get through.",

            "content": "When I say Mafia what do you think about? My first guess would be Don Corleone, stories of vengeance, gruesome deaths and inter mafia family intrigues. Yes that's the way to think about Mafia, because in real life Mafia was often cruel, self-serving and did everything for more power.\r\nNow what about this anime?\r\nKatekyo Hitman Reborn (KHR in the future) overall is a good anime, hence the 7 points, but it could be better if not some serious flaws in the story, art, characters and overall setting of the story.\r\nI have not read the manga and this review is not about comparing the two. \r\nStory: Wellstory was pretty basic. An underdog that undergoes a lot of training to become a hero. There are people along the way that join his family, they fight etc. Simplicity is not the problem of the story, but the way it is given to us. More often than not the story boils down to the inability of some main characters to do simple things, to come up with valid strategies to defeat enemies. \\n\r\nAs far as I know there are no fillers in KHR, but there are a LOT of recap episodes. Episodes where some character or the other is telling the whole story-arc from the beginning to another character. \\n\r\nWhile this plot device is meant to educate people who are jumping in the middle of the show, it is very annoying to people who actually followed the story through and through.\\n\r\nYou can skip the recap episodes now, that it is completed, but I cannot imagine the disappointment of people who watched this show as it was ongoing, from week to week.\\n\r\nThis anime likes it's Deus Ex Machina plot devices. Last second saves, unusually rapid development of character powers. They are present in the story but not very annoying.\\n\r\nEnding of the anime while complete, annoyed me a lot. Do you remember fairy tales of the old? Where everything would be alright as long as protagonist achieved his/her goal? Well this anime decided that in the end everything can be explained not by logic, but by the existence of... hm... this will be a hard one... I guess MAGIC. Yes, not by science, logic or conventional thinking but the existence of MAGIC can make everything better and you can forget that we just destroyed the time-space continuum theory and every other similar theories JUST to make this ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Not much can be said about the art of this anime. It is fairly good. While some fights are not as detailed and thoroughly drawn as, let's say in Hunter x Hunter 2011 or Soul Eater, they still are fairly good and satisfying. So all in all art is good and pleasing to the eyes.\\n\r\nAlthough when dealing with Mafia story I think anime needs darker settings, not this overly sunny and shiny art form that is given to us. Biggest concern for me was almost total absence of Blood. I mean come ooon even some of the most childish animes have blood in them pleeease give us something to work with.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Anime has, to my taste, few good op/end songs, but some are really good so it is worth listening at least once and not skipping. Seiyuus worked hard and delivered good performance, not great, but still good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Not much can be said about characters without spoilers, thus I will be short. For me protagonist was a little annoying. I was annoyed by the way he thinks till the very end of the anime. Of course there are times, like in a fight when he is more linear protagonist than not, and because of that the annoyance is gone but that is for a short while, so all in all protagonist for me was annoying. On the other hand antagonist of the last ark lacks a little sense. I can understand WHY he does what he does but we have absolutely NO BACKSTORY as to what changed him from what he was to what he is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well despite the great black hole in the plot that for me is the ending, I enjoyed the anime Very much. This anime knows it's serious moments, but sometimes overplays it, know the funny moments, but then again sometimes they are very overplayed. First 20 episode for me were very hard to watch. I thought HOW can you take the idea of Mafia story and make THIS out of it, but there were times when faith was restored in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I think this anime deserved 8 overall but the serious problems of the story and character development just got in my way to giving this anime more than 7. Yes, as I said, I enjoyed this anime very much, but still it was sometimes too predictable and too annoying to give higher score.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal opinion is that this anime is totally WORTH watching. Even with the problems it is very enjoyable and a good way to spend time.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nI first watched Reborn when a couple of Facebook friends always said how it was so hilarious so I thought I would watch it to have a laugh. When I watched the first episodes, I was only 11 so I loved it because it was REALLY funny. I always loved how Tsuna's clothes were always ripped to bits and something really hilarious and fun happened! When it went into the story line it was a very unique one. Every character had their own weapon and style of fighting which made it very interesting.\r\nArt:\r\nIt wasn't the best in the beginning but it became MUCH better aroundepisode 34. You can NEVER mistake a character with another by appearance, they all have their own characteristics. The battles are very well animated and it always has a very nice flow between moves.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe openings and endings ARE FANTASTIC!! The 1st one (Drawing Days) had a very happy feeling and fit the first 'slow' season of the anime perfectly. The others were always exciting and you just really want to watch them every episode! The OST always goes well with the situation they're in. For example, an OST called 'Into Sorrow' is always put with a moment in the anime where they're in a real mental pinch. Other ones like 'Standing Friends' give a very good feel of victory and makes you feel happy for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI LOVE THE CHARACTERS!! They're all so unique and fun! There's tough girls, happy-go-lucky guys, really calm characters and they're all different! Even their fighting styles, choice of weapon and especially the VOICES. All the voices fit perfectly and it's almost impossible to imagine them with different voices.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this has been my favourite anime for over a year and I never once thought about giving it up. I really think it deserves more fame because nearly every character teaches a lesson that you can use in real life. So basically, it's the best anime I've ever seen! :)",

            "content": "To be honest I'd never been into anime/manga until I happened to stumble across something a while ago. It had Mukuro in it and I can remember me saying 'who is that?' So as you do I did a little digging and within reading only a little about it I decided I would watch it.\r\nFor a first anime it probably wasn't that best idea in the world as it was quite heavy going I even gave up. But after a nights sleep I realised I was never gonna know who that dude was. So I continued to watch and soon I was hooked. I couldn'tstop watching it!\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing KHR I decided to move on, but Reborn has a strange way of bringing you back. I don't know if anybody else felt this way but a while later I heard a theme song from it, and I got the most lonely feeling ever, like I was empty. Like there was a part of me missing. \\n\\n\r\nSo it drawed me back! Good things about this anime are that eventhough the storyline is heavygoing at the start- it is well worth it! Believe me, it gets much better! Also, fight scene in this, I've seen some anime where the fight scene are horrible and fuzzy but this is so great and the idea behind it is very good (flames and such) !!\\n\\n\r\nBad things however were it seemed to take a long while for the story to actually begin, but such be. Also, the story line can be confusing and it doesn't help that there are lots of filler episodes. However this probably couldn't be avoided as it is a low budget anime.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I would reccommend this to anyone, even people I don't know. I've never found this feeling before but after watching this anime you feel terribly empty and something will click, and you'll find yourself watching it again!That's how Reborn rolls.",

The fighting scenes were awesome, the story line was fascinating, and it gets better more and more!\r\nEventually, I fell in love with this anime.

It has a good plot, awesome characters so awesome I can't hate any of them (well.....maybe some....), the animations are all beast, so is the music, it has comedy, action, supernatural elements to it, it's just so AWESOME, I mean I re-read the whole manga like 2 times already even  though it just ended, I re-watched the whole anime 5 times too. \r\n       A lot of people don't like this anime just because there's a lotof yaoi fangirls and the first 20 episodes (reason why I think its underrated) . I was like that too when I first read the manga and when when my friend said that it was so beast and gave the latest volume to read and I was immediately hooked! So i tried reading it again and found that the first arc really amusing, even now me and my friends are fangirling about how awesome Tsuna is!>//////<  (no yaoi plz it makes us puke) \\n\r\n      Anyways what I'm saying is give this a chance if you're droping it just because of the first 20 episodes you are really missing out on something, I mean it's SOOO interesting that there is a crap load of fangirls and fanboys. Really, I dare you bet you won't regret it.",

It was more like 40, it was really hard to get through them, but I'm glad I stuck with it. In the end it gets crazy good. \r\nThe story starts slow and pointless, until about ep 20 when there is some action for about 6 eps. Then more filler until 40 or so. Then it is on after 40, stuff gets crazy, there are some serious power ups. Then it gets even crazier, and just when you thought it couldn't get any crazier,it does. All the way up to the end. And the characters keep getting cooler and the battles keep getting better.  \\n\\n\r\nThe character development is great, they start as whiney little snots, and by the end they are super badass, and awesome. It's definitely typical shounen as in all the females (except a couple) do in it is cook and clean, literally. The main character Tsuna, goes through the most changes and is the most likeable. The other characters have their roles and rarely break out of their molds. Lambo is one of the most annoying characters ever, and by himself got this anime -1 in my view. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is good especially during the fights, and the music is great and really sets the mood. The intros and outros, are for the most part really good, albeit long. The episodes usually had 5min of intro/outro, recap and silly junk at end, really adds up when your talking 203 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall really great anime. Some of the best fights out there, with great character development One of the few anime I would recommend skipping some of the filler eps because there are soooooo many of them. 8/10 because -1 for excessive filler, and another -1 for Lambo- the most annoying character ever, maybe even worse than blackstar. But definitely worth checking out, it just keeps getting better and better the more you watch. \\n",

It would be understandable, you know, since they're kids, xcept that the anime outright declares him to have good intuition and resolve and then portrays him as having neither. Gokudera is also awful in my opinion, but it doesn't contradict the plot nearly as badly.\r\nThe sexism really makes me want to punch the main character in the teeth. I'm hoping that's a flaw the author will have him overcome.\r\nThat said, the rest of the characters are good, the overall story is interesting, there's hardly any filler, and there are lots of good fights. Definitely a kid'sshow but if you can bear with the dumbed down actions everyone takes then there's some decent entertainment to be had.",

            "content": "Be warned, this review contains /spoilers/. Also, this review has some references to the manga version.\r\nKatekyo Hitman Reborn! is one of those anime that you either love to pieces or hate with your entire soul. There is no \u201cin between\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d ground with this one.\r\nThe main character of Katekyo Hitman Reborn! is Sawada Tsunayoshi \u201cTsuna\u201d, who is the unwilling candidate for the Vongola Decimo, the Tenth Vongola Boss. He was chosen due to the fact that his great-great-great-great grandfather, the first Vongola Boss, moved to Japan and set off the long chain of reactions that would eventually lead to Tsuna being born. Tsuna isn\u2019texactly your ideal boss candidate \u2013 basically, he\u2019s a useless wimp, putting it bluntly. He also has no intention of being involved with the mafia, or any sort of underground organization. One day, his mother applies for a tutor to teach him, as he is failing at school. This home tutor happens to be Reborn \u2013 a gun-wielding infant who is apparently the best hitman of the Vongola family. He immediately starts off training Tsuna; most of these episodes are gags, as it was originally supposed to be a comedy manga. Eventually it kicks off as a slightly formulaic beat bad guy, get a power up, beat the next bad guy series.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, as a mafia man, Tsuna needs \u201cGuardians\u201d, who embody or control the six Flames of the Vongola Family. Gokudera Hayato has a love of dynamite and is Tsuna\u2019s self-proclaimed right-hand-man; he is the Guardian of Storm. Yamamoto Takeshi sees mafia as a game, loves baseball, and is the Guardian of Rain. Lambo, an infant from the Bovino Family who has an ongoing rivalry with Reborn, is the Guardian of Lightning. Sasagawa Ryohei, a boxer, is the Guardian of the Sun. Hibari Kyouya, a young man who is obsessed with rules and regulations, is the Guardian of Cloud. Rokudo Mukuro and Chrome Dokuro are the Mist Guardians. (No, they are not the same person. Their situation is quite an interesting one.) The plot doesn\u2019t really get exciting until the second or third arc, when the Varia comes into play. And it gets even better during the Future and Choice arcs.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, for a formulaic animanga, the characters do grow and change as the story develops from one antagonist to the next. The art also changes drastically \u2013 it improves greatly over the course of the series, from slightly sloppy drawings to art that can almost be called beautiful. (Although it will, of course, never be as beautiful as Nabari no Ou.) The plot is obviously somewhat lacklustre and simple, although it does become more complicated as the characters become more and more entangled in the affairs of the Vongola family. All the characters have some sort of back story and a reason, as it were, to behave as they do. More or less. There are some characters that we know next to nothing about, but these are generally characters that have little importance to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t mind some mindless fun, KHR! is a good animanga to watch or read. Both the anime and manga are long, with the anime being over two hundred episodes and the manga still ongoing. On this note, I\u2019ll inform you that, in my humble opinion, the manga is better. It is more mature than the anime \u2013 its counterpart had many things either censored or cut out completely. For example, in the manga, Gokudera is a chain smoker, while in the anime, he doesn\u2019t smoke at all. Also, some events in the manga are either scrapped or twisted around in the anime. Therefore, the manga would be the slightly better choice, as it was made first and the original media is usually best, as in the case of Nabari no Ou and Pandora Hearts. (Yes, I\u2019m just making up reasons to say \u201cNabari no Ou\u201d. You caught me.)\\n\\n\r\nIf formulaic action isn\u2019t your thing, I advise you to stay away from this series. If, however, you don\u2019t mind it and can use a bit of mindless animanga, you\u2019re good to go. I for one enjoy KHR! quite a bit, although not enough to call it the best series in the world.",

            "content": "As many others before me have writen I will to. This was a deseptically good anime. Hidden after the first twenty episodes is a gold mind of great fights and even plot, something you would think would never happen after seeing the first twenty episodes.\r\nStory/Plot: As I said before the anime changes deractically after the first twenty episodes and actually starts having a story other then picking up characters. You can also tell that the plot was well thought out even with the filer like episodes. The plot consistes of, like in many anime, the main character growing stronger to protect the people he caresabout.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was good, but not great. In fact our main character looks rather plain to be honest, so much so that I didnt believe that he was the main character. However the art isnt everything so dispite the avarege to slightly above so art it was a great show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music was well picked. The sound effects were well done as well.I went down a piont because I didnt like a ending song in there but hey, we cant have it all right?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The Characters are all very origanal. After all how often do you see a infent hitman walking around. Or someone with no talent becoming a mafia boss? I'll tell you, no were but this anime. The 'origanalness' of the characters, for lack of a better word, made up for the ok plot and almost average art.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: The enjoyment of this anime was great and really was funny. Often sending me out of the room because I couldnt stop laughing and pauseing the show to calm down so I cound consintrate on the show again. Overall I would recomend this anime.\\n\\n\r\nHope this helped, Later\\n\\n",

            "content": "KHR is quite the underrated anime. I have to say it took me a long time to start watching it and I had to start several times because the first episodes are quite boring, but once you pass that it gets really good.\r\nThe story is a bit different then usual, we do have the typical Shonen protagonist, week that gets stronger with the training, but the Mafia setting gives a different edge to the story. Specially when you start to understand the Family and what it stands for. That was one of the points that made me keep watching. The bad part was that ittook a while to get there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art starts as generic but it gets better when you start to enter the action parts of the series. The fighting scenes are good animated. I absolutely love Yamamoto's fights. They were the best for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also one the points that make the anime very good. The openings are very catchy and stay in your head. The background music also ads to each scene and during the fights it's really good. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters can be enjoyed as a whole, like the story says its about a Mafia family so they are all very close and you see that bound develop as you watch the show. I love how each of them represent a element or specific characteristic. Tsuna is the sun, Yamamoto the calm, Gokudera the storm and so on. I couldn't stand Tsuna at the beginning, but after his first fight you see that he's a bad ass Mafia Boss when he needs to.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked this show. The only problem was the slow pace in the beginning and sometimes between arcs where they would put fillers or summary episodes. I'm quite sad that they didn't continue with it, because the manga continued for some time more. I'll have to check it to see how it ends.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would recommend this to any fan of anime or if you want some action with a nice story. Just stay strong for those 20 something episodes in the beginning and after that you are in for a treat.\\n\\n",

I was like \"what the hell?\" I dropped it after the first 3 eps since I thought it was kind of stupid. It was like a comedy show but even though I like comedy I was finding this show really empty. A lot of time after that my best friend came to me saying she was addicted to some anime called Hitman Reborn and that I should watch it. I was like \"no -__- I won't\" but she was so excited about it that my curiosity grew a bitand I started watching it all over again. And I admid that when the battle with Xanxus was over I was totally into KHR. Everyday after school I would come to my computer to watch two episodes. It's not the anime I would watch all over again, but there was a big development around the main characters from the very start to the end. The story was nothing like I expected at first and the future arc just blew me away. The art was really better in the end and the big amount of characters with different personalities made it quite enjoyable. It's something I recomend if you want to have some funny moments watching anime because besides all the cool battles there's also this ironic side behind each character.",

            "content": "Hitman Reborn is is a cutesy comedy anime for a piece of its run. Although the anime starts off light-hearted and comedy-based it eventually becomes more serious in the shonen sense (in other words the main characters start battling for their lives). During its running (including the manga) it competed with the big 3, One Piece, Naruto, and Bleach on equal grounds. Naturally, if you enjoyed/enjoy those three you should also give this anime a shot. \r\nThe story is quite interesting. A mafia hitman comes to an average good-for-nothing telling him that he will be the new mafia boss. Naturally the storyline then develops intointernal struggles of the mafia and external. A very typical shonen setting. Let's be honest here, though. Most of these types of shonen anime/manga we watch/read because the super powers and the separate individual characters are incredible. So, the story is quite good. The super powers and individual characters make it better.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. I can't quite explain it but it just feels like the typical battle anime/manga art style. \\n\\n\r\nEach character has their own individual characteristics. I feel like the biggest advantage of this anime in the character pool are the little babies. They're pretty cute but at the same time they're also very strong! \\n\\n\r\nI started this anime when it pretty much JUST finished. After it did I went on to read the manga (because the anime stops before the manga does in terms of story line). I marathon'd the anime within a week or two and caught up on the manga within a week after that. This anime had no end to its brilliance and honestly I feel like they should have continued the anime as my favorite parts of the series came after the last story arc of the anime.",

Or call him the \"NO GOOD TSUNA\". But when he grew his age at 14 he met a baby/chibi named Reborn and told him that he would be the next boss for the Vongola family. Of course at first Tsuna insisted but when the days grew longer he improved and turned out to be one of the most toughest and successful bosses of all time. \r\nWhen i watched this it made me realize that when youfeel horribly horrible and useless to yourself, in the future you can improve and be at your best in no time flat. For short, i liked this anime because it showed me that anyone, and i mean ANYONE even the disabled people can improve in the future and be at their best and at the peak of everything. This anime reflects everyone's life. :)",

            "content": "[Edited Cuz last one was to long...xD]\r\nOut of the 300+ animes I have seen, Katekyo Hitman Reborn! was one of the few long running Shounen animes to make it onto my top favorites list. The only others to apply to that rule were: Prince of Tennis, Yu Yu Hakusho and HunterxHunter. Shows like Bleach, Naruto and One Piece don't even begin to compare to those four shows in my opinion.\r\n[STORY: 8]\r\nMost Shounen stories start out with a 'hero' who is either completely worthless, or has a 'special skill' that will allow him to 'save the world'. Reborn! is not an acception to that stereotype, andyet it oddly enough made it work better then most shows that I have seen. As far as I know the idea of a 'Mafia' based Shounen anime has yet to be done before this (I don't know if Baccano counts as Shounen or not...). So the idea itself is pretty original. Though despite that it starts focusing less on the Mafia parts, you need to keep in mind that the characters are ranging from ages 14-17 on average. They are not exactly cut our for 'high-end Mafia battles' like the elders of the cast are. Given that you can accept that, the plot is throughly enjoyable (though a bit slow at the beggining and after the Varia Arc until part way into the Future Arc).\\n\\n\r\n[ART: 8]\\n\\n\r\nNormally I would give the Art here a 10. However earlier episodes were to blame for lowering the score. In early episodes Reborn had a very angular and almost square like animation (even in the manga this is apparent). Making the anime seem older then what it actually was. However over time the animation improved greatly. The main turning point for the animation was when Tsuna first went into 'Hyper Mode' during his fight with Mukuro in the 2nd story Arc.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND: 10]\\n\\n\r\nPretty much all the music in Reborn is absoultely pleasing to the ears. It doesn't matter if it's the background music or the OPs and EDs. All were highly enojyable.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTERS: 10]\\n\\n\r\nPretty much all of the characters are likeable, even the 'bad-guys'. Sadly lots of characters are highly under-rated as well in the anime. Particularly the females. However this is Shounen after all, and Shounen sells best with a kick-ass male dominated population! It's sad but true. If you learn to accept that fact, its easy to get passed the characters being over-looked. Despite the lack of popularity of he female characters though, everyone in the series is quiet likeable.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT: 10]\\n\\n\r\nDespite some boring or slow parts, Reborn doesn't over kill them much longer then needed (unlike other series). The series seem's to know when to draw the line, making it much more enjoyable overall. A great watch for those with sorter patience levels that don't allow them to cope with stories like DBZ, Bleach or Naruto.\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL GRADE: 10]",

It just takes forever to get to the end.\r\nFast review concerning the set up of the anime.  Although the anime is great, the way it's set up is very frustrating. There are 203 episodes in total, but new content time is much less.  The reason for this is that during the last 2/3rds of the series there are VERY long recaps at the beginning of each episode. Then to make each episode even shorter, thereis a vignette or a type of skit after the ending credits which sometimes last close to 5 minutes.  Because of the short time that NEW material is shown, the plot develops at a snail's pace.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes it's just about 5 or 6 minutes into the show when new content is finally presented and then for only about 10-15 minutes before the ending credits and vignette/skit.  Don't forget, occasionally there are complete recap episodes and filler episodes as well.  Overall, the anime series is a lot shorter than the episode count suggests.\\n\\n\r\nFinal note, if single fights that last like 10 episodes annoy you, then give Hitman a pass.  There are quite a few fights that last many episodes due to flashbacks and the \"Oh wait, they aren't defeated quite yet\" moments.  What content that is there is great, but sometimes you just feel like weeding through all the blah to get to it.",

Thestory was quite interesting as you won't find mafia and Shounen together but but what made me liked the story is how nicely the Shounen/Super power/Mafia elements blended so smoothly as it didn't look like something mashed up together rashly or odd.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 - The art was nice as showed the motion movements clearly as well as the character designs were done befittingly but it could've done better.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 - Some of the soundtrack was good while some wasn't but overall the soundtrack fulfilled it's duty by fitting in with the situations satisfactorily and the seiyuu's portrayed their character's emotions well enough though it's a shame that most of the voice actors in this series aren't that famous.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8 - The characters were quite interesting as they were distinct from each other including some supporting ones too and how the main characters develop but some characters weren't explored and developed as much as they could despite having the potential too but the characters did their job accordingly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 - I enjoyed this series as it held it's own moments and it can be seen by any audience.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who liked: Ao no Exorcist,Bleach,Naruto,One Piece,Fairy Tail,Nurarihyon no Mago,Beelzebub.Pandora Hearts,Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood) and Hunter x Hunter will like this series because these series have the Shounen/Super Power element too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 - Overall it was a nice watch and is worth a try if you like shounen anime.",

Drawing style had nothing special simplicity was its thing. The first time i watched it the way reborn looked was so weird :D but it all was explained further on but it would have been nice to see Reborn do his thing back in the day ^^ Tsuna the unlikely mafia leader... his first transformations were purely hilarious but further on he mastered everything little by little and it was fun that they showedthe way they trained also the fact that they failed at some points was an interesting way to go but it only made it more interesting. All of the battles were full of great action scenes. But as the anime went on it got more and more breath taking and interesting to watch. For me personally I got up watched it all day went to sleep and repeat... And i wouldn't say that i regret it. Sadly it ended... Why did something so great have to end... If by any chance they would continue i would watch it with pleasure ^^",

            "content": "I just finished KHR and I'm writing this review for you guys who are wondering if you should watch this or not. So what I have to say is, if you haven't started it yet, go for it! If you already have, but are wondering whether you should continue, the answer is again, go for it! You won't regret it.\r\nLike most people, when I first started watching this (which was 3 years ago, btw), after watching half of the first episode, I was so repelled by the weird kid named Reborn, and that wimpy main character Tsuna, that I seriously didn't get interested at all.I decided to give it another try this year, and at the start I pretty much had the same feelings as then, but I stuck around patiently waiting for things to take a turn for the better. And I definitely wasn't mistaken this time!  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe story progresses really, really slow in the first 20-25 episodes, mainly emphasizing on the characters, their traits, their personalities, etc. You might go like...why does Tsuna have to get naked every time he goes in dying flames mode? Or why are these little babies showing up one after another? Well, after some point you'll end up watching one episode after another non-stop, and still wonder how those lame-looking characters grew to become so cool and strong and mature. I think that the mafia theme is  really nice idea and it adds a touch of uniqueness in the whole \"evil villain that has to be defeated\" idea. The time jump is also pretty interesting, giving us ~ahem~ \"older girls\" some eye-candy :P \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nIt's not one of the new ones, so don't expect the latest neat looking art or the great effects, but it's still pretty good. The characters are pretty well drawn most of the time, although simple, but there is great detail when needed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the OST of KHR. Starting from the openings, I mostly liked the 1st one, and the 4th one (by LM.C), the others were not bad either. I almost never watched the endings, cause I generally never do. The tracks within the anime itself, well, I think they were pretty amazing. Some of them were so badass that got you into the mood right away, even after you'd heard the same track over and over again. I did get hooked on a couple tracks and I listen to them even now.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the part I liked the most. The characters are so well-developed that you can see through them, always. Almost as if you know them personally. Their personalities are so distinctive that it's clear what they are likely to do, what they won't so, what they like, what they hate...For example, Gokudera is the short-tempered guy who scolds everyone except for Tsuna, and his loyalty is so true. Yamamoto is the easy-going person who forgives easily and stays calm even in hard times. Ryohei is the EXTREMELY straightforward guy with the idea of how a proper man should be. You may think that this is too simple but...that's what I liked about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nThrough the carefree times, the funny times, the times when they had to fight, they were all enjoyable to the max. I really did feel a lot of stuff watching this anime, and that's the reason you watch them right? Sadness, suspense, peace, happyness, and everything else that keeps you want to know the rest of the story. KYOKUGEN enjoyment!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nI don't think I should say much else, this anime is worth to watch, from the start to the end of it. So don't waste any more time reading stuff around here, go watch!!",

Too abrupt and too sudden. For the length of this series, the ending was totally inappropriate. I wouldn't recommend watching it unless you already watched part of it. If you are completely new to this anime,then if you are like me and really enjoy good endings, then you will probably be disappointed.",

But the more you watch on the anime, it turned out the anime wasn't really bad. It was actually really funny, addicting, and warm. Don't judge an anime by it's cover.",

Most of the first few episodes were spent on tsuna and d gang fooling around. I droped the anime at a point but decided to keep going...Finally at episode 19 or so,the story kicks off. And later on, no more underware tsuna.\r\nThe ring conflict saga was especially enjoyable.....\r\nThe art,in my view,is not awesome. but it's above average.\r\nThe sounds are quite memorable. Especially Kyoya's theme...\r\nThe characters are quite nice. My favorites being kyoya, mokuro andsqualo.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor of this anime is really hampered by those unneeded episodes in the beginning of the show. But it does get better as you go on...\\n\\n\r\nOverall,you are gonna have to put up with the initial episodes for the sake of getting to know the characters. But after that,it gets good.",

A good friend of mine recommended me to start it, saying KHR would suit my tastes. \r\nI confess that I tried reading 30 chapters of the manga first before giving up on it. What I could not tolerate was the less than tasteful art and Gokudera's introduction. All I could think of was WTH is this world and why does it seem to thinka naked boy shrouded in flames screaming and another dude running around with bombs is normal?! I just closed my manga tab and left KHR on the shelves until this fateful year: 2013. I moved on to, \\n\\n\r\nthe Anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime for KHR has incredible art, sound effects and made my general enjoyment soar. The only disappointed I had with it was that it ended too soon for my liking (yes, I know 203 is a long life for most animes) and the repetitiveness of keeping up the personality of characters. \\n\r\n-Gokudera just had to keep butting into everyone else's considerably reasonable and good ideas. For a smart guy, his patience is his downstreak. \\n\r\n-Lambo... lets not talk about him shall we? \\n\r\n-Tsuna does not display his newfound wit even by the end of the anime (besides the I will destroy the Vongola bit), which he does superbly in what I have heard from the manga.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, Katekyo Hitman Reborn is one anime I indefinitely RECOMMEND.",

Don't judge an anime by it's cover.\r\nThe art wasn't the best at first but you know, character development? I loved the character design though. \r\nI'm giving KHR a 10 because it was the first anime I actually enjoyed till thevery end.
