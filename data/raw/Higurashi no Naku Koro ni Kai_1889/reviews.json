            "content": "In this review, I am including both Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni and Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai in my comments. I will be calling the anime simply \"Higurashi\" in my review to save time. During the few times that I do choose to differenciate between the two seasons, I will refer to \"Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai\" simply as \"Kai\".\r\nStory: Higurashi's storyline is stellar. It starts off as a horror/thriller anime where numerous mysteries arise in the small town of Hinamizawa. These mysterious storylines are filled with tension and suspense as the viewer fears for Keiichi's (the main character) life. Since Keiichiis a righteous character who means no harm, the viewer sympathizes with him and fears for his well-being- which is constantly at risk due to the seemingly murderous girls he befriends. Several story arcs arise as we experience Hinamizawa through Keiichi's eyes. Although these storylines may seem slightly confusing and seemingly unrelated at first, the second season of Higurashi ties them all together extremely well (I won't say how because of spoilers, of course). This ability to keep the viewer in suspense and tieing so many intriguing stories together makes Higurashi's storyline extremely engaging, and is my favourite storyline out of every anime I have seen to date. This intricate storyline also carries a heart-warming underlying theme of the importance of friendship and continually shows us extremely hyperbolic possibilities of what the world may become without trust and friendship. I find it particularily interesting that such a theme exists under Higurashi's superficial hack-and-slash plotline.\\n\\n\r\nArt: As I read other people's comments on Higurashi's art, I noticed that people generally preferred the second season's artwork more than the first. While the second season's art did seem more well-rounded and fleshed out that season one, I had no major complaints with the first season's artwork whatsoever. Both seasons' art tricks most people into believing the anime essentially a typical harem or shoujo. The shock that people recieve when they see such cute characters are actually involved in an intelligent horror/mystery story is priceless. This is the primary reason for which I feel that Higurashi's artwork is extremely effective.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Higurashi's soundtrack suits the anime extremely well and the only reason I did not give it a 10 is because I cannot remember any specific background music besides Rika's theme. But just because the soundtrack is not memorable does not necessarily mean it is bad. The undertoned, haunting soundtrack is suited so well to Higurashi that it does not interrupt the flow of the anime's plot whatsoever. It only increases tension and suspense as haunting melodies are quietly played on a piano or violin in the background. As for opening/ending themes, Higurashi's openings are extremely catchy and memorable. Both are definitely worth downloading onto an ipod or mp3 player (along with &quot;Dear You&quot;, a song from the original Higurashi videogames). The first ending however, did not do anything for me while Kai's ending (Taishou.a) was a lot more pleasurable to listen to. I enjoyed it for it's graceful melody juxtaposed against its rather gruesome lyrics which essentially served as a parallel to highlight the main concept of Higurashi's storyline. This fact alone made Taishou.a an excellent choice for Kai's ending song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Character development in Higurashi is also amazing. The characters interact with each other in a very natural, human manner and their personalities are not sterotypical in the least. In the first season, Higurashi's character personalities are also quite complex and can keep the viewer guessing at characters' true personalities and motives for episodes upon episodes because of how mysterious every character is (with the exception of Keiichi). During Kai, the characters often adopt a more optimistic or positive outlook on everything as a result of their efforts to work together against a common enemy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you cannot tell by now, I thoroughly enjoyed both seasons of Higurashi and am definitely going to re-watch them both at least a few more times in the future. What is not to love moe girls that have a murderous streak to them? ^^\\n\\n\r\nOverall: My favourite anime series. If you have not seen this, please watch it IMMEDIATELY! The world needs more Higurashi fans. Also, I am aware that a third season of Higurashi will be released sometime this year and I am anxiously anticipating its release. Hopefully, it will explain what happened at the very end of the second season, since I was left feeling fairly confused... but that might just be because I was too stupid to interpret the ending accurately O_o Thanks for reading, I hope it helped!",

            "content": "I will say this now, if you have not seen the anime called Higurashi no Naku koro ni, then this review will be as useful as the dust that lies under your bed.\r\nWith that said, most of what I have to say about Kai will be a rehash of what I said in my season 1 review; therefore, I will not be giving a detailed review. Instead, I will say what I thought were the stronger aspects in Kai compared to that of the first season. No doubt, both seasons of Higurashi were wonderful and one cannot exist without the other. Because of this, itis not exactly fair for me to use the same criteria I use with a stand alone season series or a stand alone anime. Thus, I rate and review Kai based on what was different, whether it be an improvement or not, from season 1.\\n\\n\r\nStory: As said earlier, Kai is a direct continuation of where season 1 left off. Kai shows the last two answer arcs of Higurashi plus an anime-exclusive arc to fill up the holes to answers that were missing from season 1. Every mystery or question posed in the first season is answered nicely. The way everything falls together is very well thought out. The solutions provided to the mystery leaves very little things unanswered. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Vast improvement in the art department from the last seasons. Animation, however, while it is much better, can still be inconsistent. Well, Higurashi was never known for its animation, and it does its job fine without KyotoAni, Bones, or Madhouse quality animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: One aspect of Kai that was the same as the first season. The first season had an OP that matched very well with its atmosphere and mood. Kai was no different. Instead of the creepy, unsettling feeling, Kai uses an OP the shows the drama and desperation of Rika's struggle. The voice acting is still superb, and besides the major theme that is used in Kai and some new tracks, the music remains the same.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I found the character development to be better and given more time in Kai. While the first season introduced and partially developed the characters, they are fully fleshed out in Kai, especially Rika. Even the characters that you think played minor roles in the first season, Akasaka, Tomitake, Takano, Irie, and Ooishi, gets a good deal of development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While I had a lot more fun brainstorming theories and (sometimes, not always) being confused, I enjoyed Kai for other reasons. Firstly, I loved Minagoroshi-hen. It is, no doubt, my favorite Higurashi arc. While some people might enjoy watching psychotic girls beat the hell out of a certain, horrible uncle (I mean, who does not?), I had just as much fun watching Keiichi give his epic speeches. After all, Keiichi is called the Magician of Words for a reason. I also enjoyed watching as everything unfolded.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:This would average out to a 9.4. I did think there was improvement of pacing, being a lot more consistent, quality wise, than season 1, and the awesome ending. The pacing in season 1 felt rushed at some parts and caused certain facts to be left out. Thankfully, most of that was rectified in Kai. So yes, in some ways, I did think Kai was superior to the first season. The first season did really well in setting up the mystery and atmosphere. While Kai's atmosphere may seem too different from that of season 1, it is actually a lot closer to its original source material (the VN). Of course, I will not be going into this, but overall, the way the story unfolds is wonderful, especially if some of your theories turns out to be correct. Even with all that said, this series is not perfect. While the ending itself and final episode was brilliant, the lead up to that ending was weak and could have been executed better. Even with that said, Higurashi, as a whole, is a series that I would definitely recommend. Final verdict: 9/10",

Or a weird mixture of both?\r\nWhatever that emotion is, that's what'll you feel upon completion of Higurashi Season 2. Brilliant twists, unparalleledsuspense, the series builds to a full crescendo as the true devils behind the horrors of this countryside village is revealed is stunning fashion. All that is left is for the final confrontation, the one that will end it all...\\n\\n\r\nYou brace yourself. You know what the characters you've grown to love are up against, you know it'll be an uphill struggle. Yet, you know that with their sheer brilliance, they'll likely succeed. The three final episodes are finally here, and you prepared yourself to wowed, just as you were for the past 26 episodes... eager to see just what ingenious plan Kiechi and his group of resilient girls have brewed.\\n\\n\r\nThen... suddenly, you're watching something the looks like came straight of Home Alone. The antagonist's forces, always so powerful, so disciplined, and so deadly, has magically transformed into a mob of bumbling fools. The comedic, idiotic and pathetic ways in which the villains appear totally out of place.\\n\\n\r\nIts like watching Terminator, where after surviving massive explosions and shot gun shellls to the head, Arnold suddenly got killed by a Knife in the gut. You scream `WTF?'? Where's those snipers? Where those silencers? Did all the villains just drop themselves in a a barrel of toxic goo and had their IQ reduced by 50?\\n\\n\r\nIt seemed like he writers just run out brilliant ideas something so powerful could be defeated... and decided to take the easy way. This a true pity, given that the second arc was a true masterpiece, one-upping everything in both seasons combined.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, a final rating for Higurashi ni Ki difficult to give. Up till the final episodes, the series deserves a 10/10. The meets, and even surpasses the incredible standards set by the season before. They have managed to construct a mystery that is unpredictable, and yet fits naturally with all clues given before, creating that elusive `Eureka' moment that is almost magical.\\n\\n\r\nYet, Higurashi fumbles at the critical moment, where the protagonists must use this knowledge to change their hellish destiny. The ending episodes are not bad (They deserve 7/10), but look immeasurable weak when compared to the hand standards set before.\\n\\n\r\nIs it worth watching? Absolutely! Is it an masterpiece? Almost. But just like seeing Terminator die to a knife wound, one just cannot help but feel a little disappointment at the ending and endings tend to have a last impression.",

            "content": "After finishing the first Higurashi series, I was actually looking forward to seeing what Kai had in store for me. Despite my dislike of the horror genre, I was more than willing to give this one a chance too, since I was proven wrong by the former. I was proven wrong, all right, but it was not for the right reasons.\r\nWhere the first Higurashi was centered on shocking the viewer at every turn, Kai went for a slower, more suspenseful approach. Because of this decision, this approach turned out to be exceedingly slow. With only two major arcs present and twenty-four episodes to use, manyevents were stretched out beyond their limits. There were several occasions where the story virtually stalled for two episodes at a time with almost nothing being accomplished. Perhaps because of this, the twists that were thrown in became more surprising. There were just enough of these to help me see this series to its unexpected end.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, thanks to this pacing change, I did see some good come out of Kai. With several major questions raised at the end of the first Higurashi, the series took each one and explained the reasoning behind everything clearly. I can safely say that I had no further questions about any past events when the final credits rolled. There was one other good thing about this slower approach; something that I didn&rsquo;t expect. The amount of back story given was a rather nice treat. Most of this was focused around Takano, someone that barely received any time in the first season, but proved to hold much more that what I saw previously. Her story was more compelling and memorable than the actual plot ever was at any given point.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the entire run of Kai, there seemed to be something missing. The sense of paranoia that was so prevalent in the first season was absent. Granted, this had to do with the focus shift, but there still could have been a way to keep it in the plot. Without the constant fear that someone or something may be lurking around the corner, this series felt rather dull outside of Takano's story. At least the beginning and ending of each episode is enjoyable with the new opening and ending themes.\\n\\n\r\nWhen all was said and done, I could do nothing but sigh. The ending may have been satisfying, but I still wanted more. Despite my distaste for graphic violence and horror, I actually wished that it were there from the beginning. That, my friends, is saying something.",

To my shock the anime was such an improvement I  \r\nJust could not get over myself.  The story,  just like it's previous season is Unique and  a bit confusing, however, this season is where things are finally \r\nStarting to be explained. All of the \"wait I don't get it\" and \"I'm confused\" \r\nThat you may have been saying to yourself or out loud stop. In Kai,\r\nLosing for Rika & Hany\u016b are not an option. Theintense story and drama\\n\r\nOverall shape the relationship between our beloved friends in Hinamizawa.\\n\r\nSo moving on, The art is still cliche for it's time. Can't really say it's bad, but\\n\r\nThere really could have been more improvements made to our characters.\\n\r\nThat said, the OST is amazing, it complements the nonstop drama in \\n\r\nHinamizawa.

Higurashi Kai does a really\\n\r\nGreat job finishing off where Season 1 left off, When you start it, it's not \\n\r\nAt all like you're going into something completely new, 7th expansion does a \\n\r\nMagnificent job at giving you something old, changing it adding new\\n\r\nElements and etc.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave this show 9/10 out of ten because personally\\n\r\nI felt more could've been done to make it new watcher friendly, and more background information on the characters so that it's even easier to understand. That aside,  regardless of its defects. Kai was and is still a masterpiece in my opinion and will always be one of my favorite shows.  Read the first letters down dudes.",

This season was the same universe but felt like it was written by someone else. Where the first season gave you suspense and fear, the second season was too corny and drawn out at boring parts to do anything for me.\r\nWhile I found Hanyou adorable, I also found her to be detrimental to the story. The first season made it possible for the cause of madness to be anything from disease to aliens. Withthe introduction of Hanyou I expected her and Rika to start fighting crime in sailor fuku. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was in my opinion horrible.

            "content": "Disheartening Sunset\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai [Kai] is the sequel to the popular original [Higurashi] that aired the year before, based off the 07th Expansion's sound novels of the same name. The first season covered the four arcs of the original game and the first two arcs of the sequel. Kai covers the last two arcs of the second game and give closure to mysteries presented in Higurashi. \r\nKai's story is satisfying at the very most. The riddles that hung like loose threads are woven together nicely giving us most of the big picture. A few questions are left unanswered, which hopefully Rei, thesecond sequel, will answer. \\n\\n\r\nWith this in mind, it's still hard to say that Kai at any way lives up to the drama of the first. The characters become paper actors, two dimensional, lacking their psychological depth. I commend the series for giving Furude Rika personality, being the main protagonist between both halves of the show. It could be debated she was the shallowest of the Hinamizawa crew in the first outing, but I feel that rest of the club was sacrificed and should have maintained their complexity.\\n\\n\r\nThe atmosphere as well is very upbeat, at each turn of the plot, glass balls of sunshine and hope illuminate the way for our protagonists. It's disappointing considering the most engaging element of the original was the dances of blood and gore and the gritty realization that their is no light at the end of tunnel. \\n\\n\r\nProduction\\n\\n\r\nWe come across similar fare in Kai. There is no noticeable improvement in animation or art which is unfortunate. In the first the super deformed character model served a foil to the violence committed by the characters. In Kai, they serve as symbols for Higurashi's new found optimism, which I found to be more ineffective as a device. \\n\\n\r\nThe music and voice acting were similar to the first. I must say I appreciated Yukari Tamura's work behind Rika. The Violet haired priestess moved between bouts of depression and when she wore a mask of delight, which Tamura handled expertly. The line \"Nippa\" was endlessly endearing, feeling an 'Aww' form at my lips every time she uttered the word. \\n\\n\r\nWatchability and Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nKai requires you to watch the original, making it even less accessible than Higurashi, which required you to have a strong stomach. Kai isn't as addictive as the first either, I found myself trudging from episode to episode just to learn more about the skeletons in Hinamizawa's closet. Though, sometimes at the end of each twenty-one minute session I was left wondering, \"How come no one is being hacked to fucking pieces! This is HINAMIZAWA! Why ain't the bodies hitting the floor?!\" Maybe I'm just a Sadist. \\n\\n\r\nThemes\\n\\n\r\nKai looks up, where as Higurashi looked down. The glass ceiling of fate is meant to be shattered by will power. Ignore the glass shards that will come raining down on those around us, we must always move forward. In Higurashi fate acted as an iron maiden, not a question of if, but when it's spikes would make swiss cheese out of your soul. In Kai, fate is tub of play-doh, ours to mold and create. \\n\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai is easy to recommend to those that have seen the first for one reason alone: the antagonist is finally revealed. The show fails to deliver a product as engrossing as the first but that is the nature of sequels I suppose. Unless it's Godfather II of course.",

            "content": "What did we see in Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni so far?\r\nWell, it's been an amazing journey through the depths of human psychology, telling us that everyone is capable of becoming a killer under different circumstances... Watanagashi's mysteries were quite fascinating and there were specific scenes and moments the watcher won't forget that easily, in matter of psychological tension or brutal violence. The season ended with a slight glance of hope to escape the murder scenario repetition going on, so the watcher was looking forward seeing the resolve of that twisted maze.\r\nThen there was Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai... ...and the tension was gone.\r\nThesecond season of Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni was successful in erasing every intriguing aspect of the first one.\\n\\n\r\n- The Story:\\n\r\nThe second season tells you every answer you need to understand what's going on in Hinamizawa, not only once, but plenty of times, so that even the most distracted watchers would understand. Maybe because of that, the answers presented seem very odd and the excitement level drops. The rest of the screentime is used in more unnecessary scenario repetitions, which feel quite inappropriate,  because you already had a complete season using this method and it becomes boring. The higher quality of exciting psychological mystery plot vanishes and gives way to some kind of youth adventure filled with plotholes, similar to Spielberg's The Goonies...\\n\\n\r\n- The Atmosphere:\\n\r\nHigurashi was all about the tension created by the menacing situation the main characters were in. Well, because of the disappearance of most of the elements concerning that, the atmosphere becomes dull and you start to loose the contact to the characters. Also, because of the trivial answers you get to the big mystery, the enigmatic factor in atmosphere gets lost as well. In the final part of the season, the watcher will find himself watching some kind of Arnold Schwarzenegger movie with oneliners, shootouts and fistfights... THAT completely destroyed the mood...\\n\\n\r\n- The Design\\n\r\nThis is one of the few minor improvements Higurashi went through. The character design looks far smoother than season one's did. Also, the rate of SD usage was increased, which makes the humorous sequences more enjoyable than in season one.\\n\\n\r\n-The Final Conclusion:\\n\r\nHigurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai destroyed most of the precious elements of the first series. The psychological mystery disappeared complety, the disturbing scenes of violence are not disturbing anymore and the twisted plot gets cleared in a most trivial way. Even without comparing the second season to the first, you will still find yourself bored by the redundant scenario repetitions and the more than unnecessary flashback sequences.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.\r\nWorst sequel ever.\r\nReasons:\r\nThere are many reasons, but the greatest failure in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai is the way it ends. I've endured tons of episodes, for the sake of finally seeing HOW  Rika would overcome her fate.  And what did I learn from watching Kai?\r\n1.If you want to overcome your destiny, just  set up some overly lame traps, in the forest that can take down even an army. \r\n2. Hire a Chuck Norris(known Akasaka Mamoru here), and make him beat up 7-8 members of Yamainu with his bare hands(ending of episode 22). (This whole 1 vs 8is totally unbelievable on its own, not to mention the fact that Yamainu MUST HAVE HAD weapons with them, so why didn't they just shot down that policeman??????\\n\r\nBeats me.\\n\\n\r\n(edit: oh and he just allowed them to return to their base instead of tieing them up with a rope or something...see beginning of episode 23...funny, how did they get back??)\\n\\n\r\n3. Did you know that, with only 4 people you can take control of an underground base?  Well in Higurashi it isn't impossible, even if one of the 4 people is a schoolgirl and another one is a doctor.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's talk a bit about the childish traps I mentioned above. As I said it's completely unrealistic that some kids from a village can take down a platoon of  trained soldiers. But it's not only that. The other thing that really annoyed me at this part, is the total lack of any tension. Just compare it to the first series of Higurashi and you will see the difference.\\n\\n\r\n Keiichi and the others were hunted by soldiers who wanted to kill them. What would be the normal reaction of people who are surrounded by armed soldiers in a forest? Well, I've never been in such a frightening situation, but I'm pretty sure I'd be  scared. \\n\\n\r\nNow look at the face of the characters in Higurashi when they are in the forest with the soldiers. Do they look scared to you? NO\\n\r\nNot only they aren't scared, but they keep on laughing and joking with each other!!!  WHAT A JOKE!  Totally ruins the tension.\\n\\n\r\nJust 2  concrete examples:\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 13 a Yamainu car stops near Keiichi and the others and Keiichi suggests capturing it(baseball bat and a meat cleaver vs firearms.....yeah they have a chance). Mion then says she will drive the car if they manage to capture it. Someone then asks if Mion has a driving license(what does it matter in this situation anyway?), Mion replies something, then Satoko begins to laugh loudly.(meanwhile the Yamainu car is right in front of them packed with people trying to kill them,  but looks like these kids aren't interested in such minor things. They're having fun.)\\n\\n\r\nOr in episode 24 when Keiichi and Hanyuu use a loudspeaker to scare away the WELL TRAINED MIGHTY soldiers aaaand THEY SUCCEED! LOL\\n\r\nI hope there aren't any soldiers like these in my country's military force, because if there are, then we are in great trouble.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course after this hyperlame   \"psychological warfare\", the kids begin to happily praise each other, laugh at each other and trying to act funny like usually. Well they have every reason to do so right?....I mean they can't be sure how many ARMED SOLDIERS remained in the forest TRYING TO KILL THEM.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly don't get the author's true intention. There are episodes that give me the feeling that this anime is aimed at an older audience because of the gore and cruelty. Yet there are episodes which are so childish, that I would only show them to  little kids in the age group of 8-12.\\n\\n\r\nThe author took the cheapest solution in everything in this anime.(referring to the childish traps and Chuck Norris...I mean Akasaka Mamoru's fate changing fists)\\n\\n\r\nSame with this whole hallucination thing. Why create a satisfying explanation to the series??? Yeah, just take all the questions that has been raised in the first series and explain everything with hallucination even  if it doesn't make any sense sometimes(at least to me). Maybe you think it was a really good twist, OK I know it's just a matter of taste, but for me it looked like the author didn't want to spend a lot of time trying to figure out a fine resolution for the series and ended up with this because it's the cheapest of all.\\n\\n\r\n(\\n\r\nEven you can write such stories. It's really simple......just put every craziness that occurs to you into the first season, then in the second one, just say that all those stuffs were just someone's imagination.  It's not that complicated.\\n\r\n)\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd as I mentioned there are  still things that I don't understand....\\n\\n\r\nIn the first series, they mentioned that people keep dying and disappearing ALWAYS on the day of the Watanagashi, and they called this the Curse of Oyashiro-Sama. I found this really cool, because it's full of mystery and stuff and of course I didn't wonder why it's happening always the same day(after all it's a curse).\\n\r\nTHEN we found out that the curse is actually a virus(parasites to be more accurate). So I ask the question now. \\n\r\nWhy did the killings and disappearances always happened on the same day??\\n\r\nThere isn't any mystical curse now. What we have is a virus that activates itself when someone gets stressed, or leave Hinamizawa. Takano Miyo was the one who killed Rika's parents purposely on the day of Watanagashi, so the villagers would believe in the curse and again Takano was the one who killed that photographer AGAIN on the day of Watanagashi for the same reason.\\n\r\nBUT this still doesn't explain the other killings.\\n\r\nThat director of the dam project had gone crazy on the day of the Watanagashi  and was killed by the workers out of self-defense. Then 1 or 2 years later on the same day the parasites within Satoko's body became active which caused Satoko to push down her \"parents\" off the cliff. Then year(s) later AGAIN on the exact same  day Satoshi's aunt was killed while Satoshi disappeard. What a coincidence.\\n\\n\r\nI can't shake the feeling that the creator of this anime had only one purpose while creating the first series. Complicating things and complicating things and complicating things  then suddenly he realized: \"OMG this won't make any sense in the second season! Oh well the people surely won't notice  minor failures, if I make the story really overcomplicated and put in this hallucination thing.\" (This whole dying-on-the exact-same-day stuff was only included to make the story scarier and to raise the mystery level, after all it doesn't make any sense if it's not a curse.)\\n\\n\r\nReminds me of the series, Twin Peaks.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (YEAHH! Here comes the fun part.)\\n\\n\r\nKeiichi: \\n\\n\r\nOne of the thing that annoyed me in Keiichi is him being a total pushover. No matter what kind of contest he takes part in, he sucks always. Card game in Episode 1...he lost , eating contest....he lost, fight against Rena with Water Guns....it was a draw!!!!(holy ****) , fight against Rena on the top of the roof of the school...he lost, zombie tag in the school....he lost, playing a card game again when Hanyuu was a newcomer....guess what...HE LOST AGAIN. And like the rest of the characters, he was always acting cheerful even there was no reason for it and was totally unrealistic given the situation he were in.\\n\\n\r\nA quick question: How many times Keiichi  gave  courage boosting speeches thorughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nA: 1               B: 2\\n\r\nC: 3               D: Dunno the exact number, but if I have to guess than it's between 10000 and 20000(a little exaggeration  doesn't hurt, does it?)\\n\\n\r\nYup you're right the correct answer is D. Congratulation.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, it was so annoying to hear Keiichi's blabbering about friendship after the 500th time..........\"Never give up..You can't give up..You will make it beacuse we're here  with you blahblahblah.\" Basically he always repeated the same thing, but he used different words each time he gave a speech, so it won't be THAT annoying. \\n\\n\r\nUsually I don't mind such blabberings  in any anime, but here they were sooo forced and repetitive. By the time I reached episode 17-18 I could foretell when will be another Keiichi speech with 95% accuracy.\\n\\n\r\nRena and Rika: (aka Kana, Kana?? and NIPA!) \\n\\n\r\nRena's personality was virtually non-existent. IMO she was only included in the series because she is so  kawaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii with her constant \"kana, kana\" and \"I' ll take her  home!!\". In the beginning I DID find her cute(and freaking psycho too) but this feeling quickly changed to ..........bah I don't know how to describe it without using vulgar words......let's say I don't like her anymore.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Rika....NIPA! So dull.....and why is she speaking  with 2 voices? Looks like some kind of splitted personality so I used google.com to search around a little bit and I found out that the other, more serious voice Rika has, belongs to Frederica Bernkastel... you know the witch from Umineko no Naku Koro Ni(episode 5). Someone even said this (of course it's not confirmed officially and it DOES sound lame IMO): \\n\\n\r\n\"Frederica is the combined form of the mental states Rika had in each of the alternate Hinamizawas\"\\n\\n\r\nYeah right, and I'm Santa Claus. Someone reads too much fan fiction here.\\n\\n\r\nOh and Rika's/Frederica's behavior is really irrational sometimes. If I wanted to warn Akasaka that his wife's life is in danger then I'd probably say \\n\\n\r\n\"Hey dude, your wife is in danger so leave Hinamizawa go back to the hospital immediately before it's too late.\" \\n\\n\r\nand not\\n\\n\r\n\"Akasaka! Go home to Tokyo! You should hurry along home to Tokyo.(and here comes the best part)  Otherwise you'll seriously regret your decision.\"\\n\\n\r\nWHAT THE HELL??(she was even smiling like some kind of evil mastermind)\\n\\n\r\nWhy coudn't she just be more concrete?? It's like Rika/Frederica knew that she was starring in a horror anime so she was supposed to act scary in front of the viewers. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the creator of this rubbish.....I mean anime, wanted to scare the viewers with everything he had whether it makes sense or not.\\n\\n\r\nSatoko: \\n\\n\r\nNot much to say, I liked her laughing most of the times. Until it became annoying as well.......\\n\\n\r\nMion: \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite girl of the series. It's not like she was THAT special, but at least she didn't have  annoying catchphrases or unrealistic personality. She was normal and that's a big deal here.\\n\\n\r\nand finally Hanyuu:\\n\\n\r\nFirst she was the queen of pessimism -  Hauu. Then in the final episodes she suddenly became a real badass and announced that she was a god  - Hauu.\\n\r\nMaybe it's just me but if someone said the word \"god\" to me, the image of Hanyuu would be the last thing that'd  pop up in my mind.   Hauuuu.\\n\\n\r\nLol I've just remembered another \"interesting\" stuff about Rika so let's return to her for a moment. Previously I was talking about, unrealistic behaviors, wasn't I?\\n\\n\r\nSo let me ask you a question. What'd you do if you were in Rika's place? How'd you gather allies in order to defeat the Yamainu. I mean, everybody'd think you went nuts, if you began to talk about parasites and infinite time loops suddenly, without backing them up with proofs. \\n\\n\r\nIT'S SO OBVIOUS that the easiest way to make the others believe you is to predict something that will happen in the near future and then everyone will believe your story when they see you're prediction is right. \\n\r\nThe same way Rika did in episode 6 of Kai.......in episode 6 of Kai......\\n\r\n........after being in the time loop for at least 100 years, she realizes something totally obvious.  No comment.\\n\\n\r\nAnd another funny thing occured to me while I was writing......this is related to the final episode of Kai, when the Banken arrives(you know that special combat unit).\\n\\n\r\nTakano asked the leader of Yamainu why didn't he keep fighting and the leader replied that the banken is a special combat unit so they didn't have any chance to win against them.\\n\\n\r\nWell I think the correct answer would have been this:\\n\\n\r\n\" How could we have any chance against trained soldiers, if most of our people were defeated by a bunch of  kids?\"(oh and most of them were girls)\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to waste more time  with this review so I'll stop here. I could lament all day why this anime is so bad, but it'd be pointless. \\n\\n\r\n It's a sad thing that the once great Higurashi became a total joke. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Even though Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai and Higurashi no naku koro ni are in the same series as a whole, they both have many differences. I'm not going to go on about how season one was better or worse, but I will point out some things that were interesting to me. \r\nStory: I was very pleased with the story and how it really brought some light to the first series. I was no longer in the dark about why their were arcs and why some things were happening. Higurashi Kai takes you through two very intriguing and exciting answer arcs that are adirect continuation of the first series. The development of the story was brilliant and I found it to be very enjoyable. It has a sense of hope that the first series could not provide, but still keeps you on the edge of your seat, and guessing. The way that the questions and mysteries of the first season were answered was amazing. There are very few things that are left unanswered. I also found the development and pacing of the story to be much more enjoyable that the first. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was still brilliant. Especially the background scenery. It makes you feel like you're really in the story and plays a very major roll in the development of the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: I definitely saw an improvement in animation from the first series. The animation doesn't look like it was pressed for time, and there are less weak animation spots.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound in this Higurashi series, like the first, was absolutely outstanding. The creators have outdone themselves again with music, themes, and jingles that make the series believable and fit it perfectly. I think they used some of the sounds again from the first series, which made it even more enjoyable. I especially like the opening theme. It fit the series very well. For example, Higurashi no naku koro ni had an opening that created a very unsettling feeling, just like the show. While, Higurashi Kai's opening created a feeling that something was about to come along and make all the characters lives better. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character development was a lot better in Higurashi Kai. In Higurashi season one, the characters were built at the beginning with little bits over time. Characters that didn't seem to play a substantial role, ended up being very significant in Higurashi Kai. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I would definitely say that I enjoyed this series more than the first because it gives all the answers and reasons that things happened in the first season. I really enjoyed the pacing and the \"just for fun\" episodes. This series really shows how the characters can work together to fight for what they believe in. It really shows how close knit the group is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The series was very enjoyable, and I find that it meets all the expectations that I would consider for a great anime. All the effects and situations the characters were put in, show how much they really care for each other, which is a big difference from what the first series shows. Higurashi Kai is an anime, that I would put as a \"must watch\" for any type of anime fan.",

Which gives it that feeling of, \"I have to keep watching on too understand.\"\r\nI felt as though I got to grow with the characters in Higurashi, I got to feel the same exact emotions they did. I got to laugh and cry with Higurashi. It's more than just a bunch of lolli girls, or even a bunch of physco lolli girls. The plot is knee-deep and wonderful. The different emotion you get to feel with Higurashiis beautiful. The action, blood, gore, romance, pretty girls... etc... you don't find it all packed into one anime often. With the exception of Elfen Lied.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, I wish I could have watched other anime before Higurashi, because now everything else just seems like a big dissapointment. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I disliked about the anime, was that it's hard to follow. People might watch the first five episodes, and be mad, because they have no clue what is going on. *cough cough* me *cough cough* But I think it was the sneaky way of getting people to watch the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I would like to wrap up with the comparison of the two similar animes, Higurashi and Elfen Lied. To me, Elfen Lied was well written, there was great art with emotional scenes. But Higurashi was amazingly written, with beautiful art, and scenes you could connect with. Scenes where you can say to yourself, \"I feel that/I feel bad for that character.\" Elfen Lied was great, but Higurashi walks on water next to it.",

Since it's a part two, it's necessary to have seen the first set, as it's divided into \"question\" and \"answer\" arcs. This series formulates the many, complex answers to the question: What exactly is happening to Hinamizawa in June of 1983? \r\nArtwork and Animation: 7\r\nLike its predecessor, Kai is approaching 10 years old, and looks somewhat dated when put up against more recent efforts,both by studio Deen and others. By no means does it detract from the show though, as the somewhat rough look gives it a dated feel too, and brings the rural 1983 Japanese mountains to life in a way that pulls you in with how it frames and presents the visuals. \\n\\n\r\nIt's overall a very dark show, both in atmosphere and coloration, which intertwine excellently together to give it a dense, oppressive feel. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe opening, \"Naraku no Hana (Flower in Hell)\", by Eiko Shimamiya is a wonderfully haunting song that really sets the mood for the show, with lyrics to match. The ending song, \"Taish\u014d.a\", by anNina is even more foreboding, with soft violin and piano that really affixes the ending scenes in the mind's eye, like an ellipsis at the end of a particularly thought provoking sentence. \\n\\n\r\nKenji Kawai, who also did the original Higurashi and Fate Stay Night's composition does more great work here. Most of the music is very atmospheric, setting the mood and tone for the show. It's very subtle, not in your face loud or obnoxiously playing over the characters. It creates tension, and resolution when necessary- very good. \\n\\n\r\nLet's just say that Kai is the Yukari Tamura show, because her performance as Rika is nothing short of stunning. Certainly the best of her career, and that's saying something. As the focus is 90% on Rika throughout the show, we get a lot of time with her, and in three different voices. Ms. Tamura truly put in an award worthy performance for bringing little Rika to life through as many emotions and moods as can be brought through a visual medium in which the actors themselves are not present. Just excellent. \\n\\n\r\nHowever much talent Yukari Tamura showed, it's nearly matched by Miki Itou's Miyo Takano. As a character who wasn't fully fleshed out in the original series, she plays a much larger role here, and is explored through an emotional and compelling voice role. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Kai expands somewhat from the original series. The introduction of some new characters along with expanding the roles of previous supporting and main characters also expounded upon the intrigue that drives the heart of the show. Higurashi is a show that will lie to you. I was constantly on edge, trying to figure motivations and goals out, because it's never clear; not until it's too late. \\n\\n\r\nThe focus changes from one of each arc having a main character to just two \"real\" main characters. This enables the character driven portion of the story to be a lot more fleshed out and have less of the disjointed feel that the original had, where the perspectives of the different characters were constantly changing. This is much more nailed down, and is better for it. The familiar and the new faces all have weight in the story- no one is there just for the sake of having the \"token character\" for plot devices. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10 \\n\\n\r\n\"The sin of this world is like Old Maid. Everyone pushes the one Old Maid onto one another. It's not a game you seek to win, but one in which you seek to make someone the loser. The sacrifice.\" - Miyo Takano\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\\n\r\nKai takes a somewhat different tonal and execution approach to its predecessor, in that it's a much more complex and intrigue driven narrative than outright horror. Gone are the short arcs that depict brutal murders and a hanging sense of \"something is just...'wrong'\", and in their place is a deep narrative filled with deceit, betrayal, hunger for power, cold blooded \\n\r\nhate, and a myriad of dark themes. Where Higurashi is the \"tell\", Kai is the \"show\". \\n\\n\r\nThe best suspense and mystery narratives are those that are not heavy handed in shoving the plot down your throat, but allowing you to discover for yourself, to guess and be proven wrong, and to ultimately be surprised and perhaps even shocked by the outcome. This is Higurashi. While everything is revealed to you in time and nothing left unresolved, the manner by which it slowly unveils creates a nearly tangible level of tension. Again, everything starts out happy and fun, but you know that it's just not going to end well. \\n\\n\r\nKai, and Higurashi before it are shows that eliminate the element of surprise about how the arcs go, though. That's not to say they're predictable; no, it's that you \"know\" it's not going to end well... it's just how that ending comes about that is shocking and/or heart rending. Just when I thought it was going to be a good ending, so many things that can go wrong do, and it ends in a sorrowful way again. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike Higurashi part one, Kai is divided up into a mere 3 arcs, which allowed the plot to develop slowly, but with more (necessary) exposition. Again, it's a slow burn of a show: it twists and turns within the arcs, and when I thought I had everything figured out, it managed to turn everything on my head with revelations of who and why. Higurashi is predictably unpredictable- and that's the genius behind it.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't have to be a straight Whodunnit horror show involving cutesy school kids, even thought that could have been plenty entertaining on its own. No, Kai takes it to the next level with a cleverly crafted political conspiracy and treachery by those in positions of power over others. The mysteries of the first series are just the base bricks built into the steps of the pyramid of deception, betrayal, and conspiracy of Higurashi in sum total. These, which ultimately lead to a narrative of immense proportions, and heights of weighty answers that were previously inconceivable from the prior portions of the story. \\n\\n\r\nA maze of irrational questions constructed elaborately by deft hands, that turn to a dark hallway with answers that are both revelatory and thought provoking- a real masterpiece. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I liked most about this show was the very first episode, which serves as a direct epilogue to Higurashi part one. One of the most edge-of-my-seat, intriguing, and addictive openings to a series I've seen, that served as an awesome introduction to the unveiling of the mysteries of Hinamizawa to come. \\n\\n\r\nA note:\\n\r\nDue to the incident in 2007, where a 16 year old Kyotanabe girl murdered her father with an axe to the neck, some of the violence in the anime was censored, and certain parts edited out altogether (along with the cancellation of the last episode of School Days, airing the same time). With this event, there was a noticeable shift in the amount of extreme violence content vs the original series and manga. Not that the show is lacking such content altogether, but for a show that has built a reputation on brutality alongside Alfred Hitchcock style horror storytelling, it was strangely absent in some places. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned above; the story was unpredictable, and in the best possible way. The characters all have their parts to play, and with an expanded cast- all of them get a fair share of development and exposition, though it would have been easier to sideline them. They all remain relevant, and the tone of the series is also very consistent- I very nearly felt time ticking by in their universe as I anxiously watched the events of June 1983 unfold once again. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs both a mystery and a psychological horror show, Kai succeeds with flying, dark colors. As an intense, relentless narrative and a tragic, but ultimately beautiful story, Higurashi Kai surpasses all expectations. It has the necessary elements for an Alfred Hitchcock or Rod Serling worthy masterpiece; the characters, the story, and the atmosphere to back it all up. It's all there. \\n\r\nAll Higurashi needs is an audience. \\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\\n\r\n+ Dark, twisting narrative\\n\r\n+ Great, compelling characters\\n\r\n+ Detestable villain that you can't help but sympathize with on some level.\\n\\n\r\n+/- Lack of ultraviolence? (see above)\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?\\n\\n\r\nAb-so-lute-ly. If you've not seen Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and are reading this for some strange reason, please, go watch the original- you owe it to yourself to see a show of this caliber, because there aren't many of them. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\"My will will weave an absolute future. No one can hinder me or overthrow it: even fate is up to me to decide, with my unwavering, absolute will.\" -Miyo Takano\\n",

            "content": "Personally, my favourite kinds of stories are the ones that really make you think. Ones that make you look back on what you've already seen, and realize there was more going on than you had initially picked up on. Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai makes you realize that the entire first season was preparing you for the story it has to tell. \r\nThe first season of Higurashi is fantastic in its own ways. It's unique in the way it tells its arcs; but it leaves the viewer questioning what they each have to do with one another. The second season, Kai, answers every singlequestion you could have asked, and also adds multiple layers that you didn't realize were even happening. It is the most satisfying psychological story I have experienced in a very, very long time. In terms of story, it is possibly the most impressive psychological story I've ever seen - its internal logic is consistent and wraps up in a way that leaves you with no lingering questions. \\n\\n\r\nArguably one of the most successful parts of Higurashi is its characters. The characters are the story, and the story is what matters. Especially when taking the first season into account, each and every character is given proper time & weight. You understand their backstories, their fears, their traumas, et cetera. They even introduce a new character in Kai that, honestly, makes the whole series make sense. Without this character, the show couldn't wrap up as fantastically as it does. \\n\\n\r\nThough I'm praising Higurashi a lot, that isn't to say it is without fault. The animation can be a bit lackluster at times, and the little I heard of the English dub was aggressively awful. With that being said, I felt the Japanese voice acting was actually fantastic, and the fansubs for the second season were adequate (some awkward phrasing, but they're fansubs haha). As for the art, I never felt the faults in art ever detracted from the show, and there were many moments of beauty in terms of art - I enjoyed it all.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, the soundtrack to Higurashi is wonderful! It uses its themes appropriately, and the production on the music never feels cheap. It is a triumph along with the story, and added a ton of depth and emotion to impactful scenes. \\n\\n\r\nI can't recommend Higurashi enough. I've watched the entire series three times now (first time on my own, second two times with different friends) and always catch something new with each watch. It is a show that is firmly placed in my personal Top 3, and it would take something truly incredible to move it from that spot for me. Higurashi is completely worth your time, and it comes with a heartfelt recommendation from me!",

            "content": "If you have not watched the first season (Higurashi no naku koro ni), this anime is practically useless and the same goes for this review.\r\nWow! Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai was a great addition to an already very good season one. As I found season one rather interesting and enjoyable, Kai was a must watch for me, in the hope that it would be just as great. With many questions left unanswered, Kai primarily focuses on answering questions and revealing to us the \"true\" truth. There are a lot less gore and horror elements compared to the first season, as Rika becomes the mainpoint of view. The introduction of a new character called Hanyuu was certainly an interesting add into the plot. Her introduction into the story was done smoothly but it is likely that you'll ask &quot;Where on earth did she come from?&quot; at first.\\n\\n\r\nAs Kai is a continuation of the first series, the chain of mysterious deaths continues on from Rika's point of view. The first episode of this season kinda acts as a recap and a look into at the aftermath of season one's last arc. It then moves into another arc, raising some questions but answering many, and by the end of the first arc, I'd say it's almost impossible to not continue watching the rest of Kai. The other two arcs finally give us answers to those questions that remained. The telling of a certain character's past in the beginning of the the third arc really unraveled the mystery and told us the cause and effect. It's what makes Higurashi a great story, how the answers are not force fed to you, but instead rather open for interpretation; whether the judgments the characters make are truly right or wrong. How some of the little things can make huge differences, and change the outcome of the future.\\n\\n\r\nA stellar performance by Tamura Yukari playing Furude Rika! The voice acting by her was just amazing (I just love Rika's scream in episode 8!) and should be highly commended, along with all the other seiyuus! Rena's voice is more consistent this time, and Horie Yui's performance of Hanyuu was cute! I have absolutely no objections to the wonderful musical score by Kawaii Kenji, along with another great opening theme by Shimamiya Eiko, and the closing theme which all were very fitting in both lyrics and music. HUGE improvement in the animation! The faces and characters are not as exaggerated or contorted as the first season. It is much more consistent, detailed and kinda makes the characters a little more prettier... \\n\\n\r\nI do believe that the introduction of Hanyuu was certainly necessary, although whether she had to be that &quot;moe&quot; is a little questionable to me. There were large developments in some of the supporting characters such as Akasaka, Dr. Irie, Takano, Tomitake and Satoshi which were vital to the storyline. The only thing is, the concentration on the development of these characters kinda left the mains Rena, Mion and Shion out for a while...\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi just had to go to my favourites list! To me it was such a great story with amazing music and voice acting and very interesting and complex character personalities and relationships, with touches of humour here and there. Although the ending is a little lame, well for me at least, it still deserves an overall 9.5 out of 10. Definitely enjoyable and an interesting ending scene. I'd certainly recommend this to anyone! I wait in anticipation for Higurashi no naku koro ni Rei and Umineko no naku koro ni in the hopes that the creators can continue to make such amazing stories!",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nProbably the biggest reason Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai fails as a sequel is because of a matter of expectation. Now, you might be thinking I just spoiled the entire review right there, but give me a moment, I'm not done, because Higurashi Kai is a very complex thing to pin down why exactly it is the way it is. I guess where you need to start is to consider that any mystery must inevitably have an answer. And when that mystery is played through a dark and chaotic mess, in other words, most of what season 1 of Higurashiencompassed, well, you'll need to go to some very... expressive places in order to justify it all. Needless to say, Higurashi no naku koro ni and Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai(which I'll just call Higurashi Kai from now on) are two, very, very different beasts, a byproduct of the nature of the first season, taking the second season in a new direction, a direction that could have worked, bringing the franchise into a mixed tonal experience of awesomeness. But for whatever reason, whether it be a few key mistakes at critical moments, or simply that the creators of Higurashi simply did not think this whole thing through enough, Higurashi Kai is ultimately a swing... and a miss.\\n\\n\r\n     Hello people of \"The Wired\", my name is Quan, I hope you've been having a lovely day, because it's time for the long overdo review of Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai, something I promised, hell, what was it, 10 months or so ago? It's pretty crazy I've lasted this long actually. For fear of pushing the same information down your throats, I will be not repeating the studio and people behind this season, because they remain largely unchanged from S1, and if you want that info for cataloging or something, feel free to check out my review of S1. For everyone else, let's jump right into the plot.\\n\\n\r\n     At the end of the first season, a couple of things became clear. Keiichi suddenly remembered a couple of things that he probably shouldn't have forgotten in the first place, namely that he killed Mion and Rena savagely with a baseball bat, and through a short talk with Rika, he confirms something that we the viewers have been suspecting all along. That the plot of Higurashi is not in fact a mash-up of possible \"what-if?\" scenarios, but rather a veritable Groundhog Day situation of an infinitely repeating loop of death and murder that will never ever stop, erasing all memories of the traumatic events every-time it goes around for another go. Well... almost all memories, because as it turns out, Rika is the only person who remembers every single iteration, and is becoming slowly desensitized from the transpiring events as she re-lives the deaths of her friends over and over again. Not only this, Rika is the only one aware of the presence of Hanyu: a mysterious girl invisible to basically everyone, that may hold the key about this repeating summer(and also may be the person that Rika has been talking to when she is all by herself this entire time). Upon this realization, Rika slips from the role of the mysterious onlooker of the anime to the spotlight of Higurashi's main protagonist. And so, the stage is set for Higurashi Kai, as Rika Furude must struggle to not lose hope and keep going in the face of the seemingly inevitable result of the death of everyone in Hinamizawa, as she must dodge conspiracies, murderers and the twisted hand of fate in this infinitely repeating labyrinth of sorrow, so maybe, one day, she can find an outcome where everyone can make it out alive.\\n\\n\r\n     Now, this means that the tone of the anime sort of changes drastically, shifting from a horror/psychological mystery into something more resembling a supernatural thriller, which isn't in itself a bad thing, but this loops back to the problem about expectation I mentioned in the beginning of the review. See, a huge point I made in my review of the first season is that horror anime, are to be more precise, good horror anime, are very rare. That's why the release of Higurashi no naku koro ni is such a landmark for me, even nearly a decade after the release of the first season in 2006, nothing else has really ever come close to replicating the paranoia-fueled creepy mindf*ck that the anime was, so switching genres half way through to something much more main-stream in terms of the medium is a little, well, disheartening I guess. As a horror and mystery fan myself, I didn't want a season of Rika fumbling around for an answer to Groundhog Day, I wanted more of the same. But just because I didn't want this sort of season didn't mean that it couldn't be good. Here's the problem. It sort of isn't.\\n\\n\r\n     The first problem lies in pacing. While Higurashi season 1 was a series of wild, savage arcs that all eventually boiled over in blood-soaked mayhem, Higurashi Kai takes a much slower, more reflexive approach. Since it's from Rika's point of view this time, we get many monologues from her about the situation she's in and her ponderings, which are interesting at first, but quickly become boring as they drone on and on, over and over again, like they didn't have enough other things to fill their time with. Actually, everything in Kai seems unnecessarily dragged out. One arc: \"Massacre\", lasts a grand total of 9 episodes, nearly twice as long as an average arc in the series, and it doesn't help that this arc is half boring slice-of-life, and half more deeply exploring Satoko's situation with her abusive uncle, which is helpful for character development, but is also milked for all its worth. Now putting that arc together with the first two arcs of the series, one which is confusing beyond reason, and one is which is basically just Rika reflecting on the situation, and the first half of Higurashi Kai ends up being a slow slog with hardly any of the gore, horror, and Rena stabbing people that we've come to expect from this franchise, and I guess it's no wonder that that pissed a lot of fans of season 1 off. This is somewhat redeemed at the end of the \"Massacre\" arc in spectacular fashion, but we'll get to that later.\\n\\n\r\n     It doesn't help that the answers to the questions raised by the first season are sort of ridiculous. Of course I won't straight out say what they are, but let's just say some are more satisfying than others. I mean, one of the biggest things I appreciate about Higurashi Kai is that is actually answers questions and ties up pretty much all loose ends from the first season, and what it doesn't straight out tell you, can usually easily be gathered from context clues or perhaps re-watching a few choice episodes from the first season. Some of revelations are even amazing in both delivery and the way they were built up throughout the franchise. Answers like what exactly happened to Satoshi(remember him, Satoko's older brother?), and one particular piece of information dropped in episode 12 or 13(I can't quite remember), that had me, no joke, jump up from my seat, walk in circles around my living room, yelling \"Oh, snap!\" repeatedly for a good 5 minutes. Yeah, I know, I'm a nerd.\\n\\n\r\n     On the other hand, for all the well-built up and foreshadowed answers, there is a couple that make me wonder if Higurashi is making up this crap as it goes along. Like, aliens? Really, Higurashi? Aliens? You had no better answer for why- oh never mind.\\n\\n\r\n     But the up most crest of stupidity and downright silliness is reached in the series finale. The finale to the entire franchise, and... I swear, I felt like I was watching a goddamn Scooby Doo cartoon, slapstick included for my viewing displeasure. Actually, the whole last episode and the build-up to it feels sort of cartoonish in nature. It kind of makes you wonder actually, how a franchise that previously built itself on concepts of betrayal, brutal reality, paranoia and how the ugly true nature of humanity is revealed when we are pushed to the brink of sanity... is now relying on... the goddamn... \"power-of-friendship\" to be the answer to everything. Friends who had been killing each-other up till recently. I mean, how did we get to this point? I\"ll get back to you later.\\n\\n\r\n     The characters are a mixed bag, though mostly a positive one. While development has been pretty much burned out completely for the main cast by the start of Kai, we still have one character to shine the spotlight on: the new protagonist of the show, Rika. Now, I will recognize that the basic idea of her character isn't exactly anything new: an all-knowing yet helpless onlooker, worn down to the point of apathy, but I think the reason she works so well as a character in this season lies in the execution. Even if her monologues become tiresome in the first half of the anime, Rika still voices clear thoughts about her stance in this endless summer, and it becomes rather fascinating as her desire to protect her friends clashes against the knowledge that no matter what she does, the result will always be the same. It's admirable really, how she keeps going in the face of utter despair, quite similar to [ERASED FOR SPOILERS] from Madoka Magica, but what really sells her character for me is that she is clearly more tired of this sh*t than anyone, and continually becomes more frustrated and dismissive as the series goes on. As she continually gets her hopes up that maybe the actions she takes this time will change the outcome, only for her preconceptions to be crushed by the crushing hopelessness of her situation. This is illustrated beautifully in one of my favorite scenes of Kai, when Rika, finally pushed to her limit, unleashes a flurry of rage and frustration over her hopeless situation at the world, as her final hope putters out in the face of an impossible challenge. And it's just... so good.\\n\\n\r\n     Hanyu is the new character for Kai, and unfortunately, she is not nearly as interesting as Rika. While we never get a proper explanation on what exactly she is, we can gather form context clues, and honestly, it's pretty stupid, especially when you consider the implication this has on certain events of the first season. As for her motivation, it pretty much begins and ends with wanting to protect Rika, and that isn't a bad motivation per say, but now I have nothing much left to say about her, for that is what drives her character throughout the entirety of Kai. The only interesting thing about her is that she is much more pessimistic than Rika about, as she puts it, \"overcoming fate\", and encourages Rika to just give up on trying to beat death so she won't continue to disappoint and hurt herself. But now that's just looking for depth that isn't there.\\n\\n\r\n     The last character to talk about is \"the villain\", who will remain nameless and gender-less so you won't be spoiled on one of the biggest and best surprises of the season. Anyway, I can see you raising your eyebrow(yes, I can see you), and I understand completely. Higurashi was never the kind of anime that needed a villain; the antagonist of the first season was more or less the dark side of humanity, and that was the way I liked it, but I think you'll find that this villain more than makes up for the loss of subtlety in that regard. I don't know, maybe I like this antagonist so much is that once the antagonist is first revealed(in one of the most awesome ways imaginable) about half-way through the season, it heralds the coming of the best episode of the season, in which a visceral, awesome, satisfying and honestly, quite soul-crushing last 10 or so minutes follow, and makes you think \"hey, this almost feels like the first season again.\" I also quite liked the back-story and unique motivation, for that matter. I thought it was rather interesting.\\n\\n\r\n     Just because I hate Studio Deen doesn't mean I can't give them credit where it's due. Compared to the animation of the first season, Higurashi Kai has drastically improved in several key areas. For one, characters look a lot smoother and better integrated into the world, and speaking of the world, the environment is lot more bright and expressive, with a lot more variety of colors compared to the dull temperatures of the first season. Some say that they prefer the rougher and uglier designs of the first season, arguing that they helped pound home the brutality of the show, but honestly, that seems a little to me like they're grasping at straws. The first season had bad animation, end of story, and Higurashi Kai looks a lot better. I mean, it still doesn't look particularly good, but it's probably one of the best efforts I've seen from Studio Deen. Not that that's saying much. \\n\\n\r\n     Kenji Kawai has returned for Kai's soundtrack, and as per usual from the composer, it is quite superlative. If you remember, the strength of the soundtrack of the first season was the palatable creepy atmosphere that the music let off, and Kawai has done much of the same with the OST for Kai, though this time, he has adjusted his music for tone. There's still a couple of good and creepy tracks in there like \"Shinsou\", but Kai's soundtrack embraces the thriller and supernatural aspects of the season, changing the atmosphere of the music(and by extension anime) by quite a bit. You have proper battle music like \"Gekitotsu\", and even some emotional tracks thrown in for good measure. But undoubtedly the highlight of the music is the OP: \"Naraku no Hana\", a truly haunting and beautiful song that captures the desperate feel of Kai perfectly, using symbolism and meaningful lyrics to its full advantage. I like it so much that I may even think it's better than the first season's OP: and if you know me, that's not said lightly.\\n\\n\r\n     So, throughout this review, it has probably become quite clear that I have some mixed feelings when it comes to Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai. Is it sinful blotch on the legacy of the Higurashi franchise? Not really, because despite being not as good as S1, there are plenty of good things to talk about as well. So is it a worthy successor to the original Higurashi no naku koro ni? Well no, it's not that either, because it pretty much takes everything that made the first season good and throws it away without a care, especially in that good awful ending. So then, what does that make Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai? What I would say, if I were to judge Kai solely on its own merits- well, there's the problem. Actually, if I were to say, I'd say that that is the problem with Higurashi Kai. It's impossible to judge on its own merits. Regardless of what Kai wanted to be, it's still attached to arguably the best horror/psychological mystery anime of the past decade, and that shadow is being cast over it the entire time, overshadowing the good points and enhancing the flaws. It's something just kind of good being compared to something great, and in the end, that \"something good\" is always going to be seen as a disappointment when compared to \"something great\". That's why for all the things I don't like about Kai, I can't find it in myself to hate it. Because, really, it never stood a chance. Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai is a decent supernatural thriller, with a great protagonist and villain, but ultimately is let down by poorly handled pacing and an ending that is just kind of... stupid. It's passable. It's something I can enjoy. I just wish it wasn't part of Higurashi no naku koro ni. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Oh... so she was never dead to begin with. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog!

            "content": "Television has brought back murder into the home - where it belongs.\r\n~Alfred Hitchcock, 1969\r\nIt's a rare occurrence when an anime (or any TV show) is able to hold thrill and fear in a perfect balance. For starters, the show has to reach a certain standard of quality in order for the viewer to feel either of those two emotions, but in addition, the series must be able to switch between excitement and terror with ease. But maintaining that equilibrium is in fact possible, and such is the beauty of the Higurashi world as a whole.\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai (Often abbreviated Higurashi Kai) isthe second installment in the Higurashi set, and  the predominant purpose of this anime is to provide resolution for some of the unanswered mystery arcs in its prequel, Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni. Many people review the two shows as a single anime, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I don't have any intention of merging two full-length anime into a single, 50-episode conglomerate.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I'm going to assume you've already seen the first season of Higurashi, because if you haven't, you should probably watch that before considering Kai.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, let's get get on with the review.\\n\\n\r\n~the STORY~\\n\r\nMany people (myself included) were left somewhat unsatisfied with the closure of the first season. It just begged too many questions that were left unresolved. How could such adorable, innocent schoolchildren become psychotic killers at the flip of a switch? What were the unforeseen consequences of each killing? And mst importantly, who was the grand mastermind behind the murders of Showa 58? As the only two who have witnessed the endless cycle of June 1983 and as the only two who know the truth behind the shrine god's curse, Furude Rika (nipaa~) and her celestial companion Hanyuu take the reins as the main characters of Higurashi Kai as they venture to expose the true cause of the murders, and more importantly, how to escape from the endlessly repeating vicious circle.\\n\\n\r\nIt is impossible to sum up Higurashi Kai's plot in one word, but if I were to try, I would say it's  \"satisfying.\" Over the course of 24 episodes, the viewer builds a powerful empathy and love for Rika and Hanyuu. Watching them struggle, watching them uncover dark secrets, and watching them have a good time in the game club all helps to increase this feeling of devotion for the main characters. Thus, each time they overcome a major obstacle, it is immensely gratifying. This is a device used in many popular mystery books and movies, but I have to say: It works quite well.\\n\\n\r\n~ART 'n SOUND~\\n\r\nMost of the time, I put art, animation, and sound into three different categories. For this anime and this anime only, I will group them because they all contribute to a feeling of uneasiness the viewer will eventually develop. The art perfectly portrays cutesy middle/high school students running around, playing games, and having fun, but it portrays each character's psychotic side equally well. An ambient soundtrack further enhances the suspense between what feels like a high school rom-com and a free-for-all killing spree.\\n\\n\r\n~them CHARACTERS~\\n\r\nAnother qualm I have about the first Higurashi series was its total lack of any kind of character development, with the exception of Shion and Mion. Each character gets a lot more depth in Kai, and characters with less significance in the first season (such as Satoko's uncle and Miyo Takano) are expanded into major importance.\\n\r\nThe only negative remark I have to say about the characters, and the only negative remark I have to say about the whole series in general, is the unwavering resolve of each character. Nobody really changes over the course of 24 episodes, so people became somewhat predictable. But each character is explained in such depth, I could probably forgive it.\\n\\n\r\n~Higurashi Kai: OVERALL~\\n\r\nThis is the rare breed of anime that almost touches absolute perfection. If you haven't seen this yet, watch it now!\\n\\n\r\nOne of only three anime I have ever given a perfect 10/10.\\n\\n\r\n~Dechie",

            "content": "For years I thought that Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, and it's sequel, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai were among the best Anime I had ever seen. This is in fact the general consensus, that Higurashi is an amazing Anime and it has garnered much praise over the last few years. \r\nI'm here to tell everyone that I, and everyone else, could not have been more wrong about the Higurashi series. When you look at it on it's own, you may see a wonderful story full of drama, comedy, suspense and mystery, but in actuality, you are only seeing a small portion of thestory.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is adapted from a Visual Novel, and for years the English speaking Anime community didn't have any way to read it, since it wasn't translated, so they knew of the Anime (and perhaps the Manga), but had never read the VN. But now the VN is completely translated and can be read by anyone, and it should be read, because after I completed the VN, I realized just how bad the Anime adaptation really is.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, the Anime adaptations of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, and it's sequel, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, are a travesty. Roughly 1/4 of the entire story from EACH arc are cut completely, and there are numerous other changes and cuts from what they DID manage to include in the Anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThis adaptation is virtually devoid of the superb character development and storytelling present in the VN, not to mention cutting vital clues that prevent the mystery from being solved. In fact, some people don't even realize that Higurashi is a mystery at all, most people think that it's a suspense or horror series, a series about \"lolis killing people\", when in fact it is a mystery meant to be solved, as well as an emotional drama that the Anime completely fails to capture.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, I would almost say that the Anime of Higurashi isn't an adaptation at all, but a joke that DEEN created to make fun of the original material and showcase their own inability to create a proper adaptation. Some parts of the series don't even feel like the same story because so much is changed and cut, and though you may not notice these issues when watching the Anime by itself, by reading the VN it is made clear just how little DEEN actually cared about this series.\\n\\n\r\nPutting the hackjob of a story adaptation aside for a moment, let's talk about the other aspects of the series. The original VNs had a spectacular soundtrack, especially Kai's, but DEEN decided to just remove ALL of the VN music and replace it with much worse music, often opting to just keep things silent half the time anyway. In fact, the ONLY good part about the Anime, and by association, the only bad part about the VN, is the character design and animation.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have watched the Higurashi Anime, you have never experienced Higurashi. You essentially wasted your time watching it because you missed huge chunks of story and character development, and if for some reason that doesn't bother you, then you are an idiot and should go back to watching your Naruto crap where you can turn off your brain and not care or notice that the story is shit. \\n\\n\r\nIf it bothers you that you've never truly experienced Higurashi, or you've never actually watched the Anime in the first place, I strongly urge you to read the Visual Novel, and forget that the Anime even exists.\\n\\n\r\nOh and by the way, the Umineko no Naku Koro ni Anime is shit too, that doesn't exist either, read the VN.",

            "content": "If you haven't seen the first season, Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni, \"Kai\" will make almost as little sense to you without watching the first one as the watching the first one without watching Kai afterwards does. For those who loved the gore in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, I'm sorry to tell you, that if you were looking forward to another twenty-four episodes of eviscerated adolescence and chopped loli then you are in for a disappointment; Kai focuses primarily on giving the viewers a satisfying answer and summarization of the questions and mysteries aroused in the first season. \r\nEvery once in a great while,there's an anime that completely alters your perception of what constitutes a \"masterpiece.\" For me, one of those anime was Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni (Kai). The greatest problem found within the walls of any mystery conceived is that within those boundaries there must be an answer, a solution to that mystery. In Higurashi's 1st season, the plot strung us along, sliding us down the merry chute of deceit greased with the blood of torn up moe archetypes - shooting us out the other end so fast that there was a good chance you could have missed the clues to what was building up just beyond the ending credits. Obfuscation was Higurashi's greatest strength. It's a show that gets you asking the wrong questions so you end up missing the obvious right answers. Kai moves slightly away from that and focuses primarily on on the brief theories on the Hinamizawa syndrome touched upon in the first series and runs with and adds considerably too that, making for story which is much more \"external\" in nature. The 2 seasons function like a mystery followed up by a solution. Higurashi is a real feat in many regards. First, lots of deep thinking and meticulous planning has clearly gone into the show. What we've got out of it is an outstandingly well written plot that\u2019s both elaborate and almost completely seamless with hardly any plot-holes. While there are some things that this sequel lacks (nothing can be perfect right?), it does is bring the mystery full circle, and it also gives the audience the answers that we barely got a mere hint of in the first series. Pacing is not an issue and to call it riveting would not be an understatement. The characters remain and the individuality and sympathies that the first season built up remain strong even without the focus they received in the first season. Even when the antagonist is revealed they are not taken for granted and receive characterization and a back story that make them perhaps one of the most sympathetic and interesting villains that anime has to offer - too evil to support but I found myself not wanting anyone to lose either. The ingenious character development in season 1 followed through into Kai once more. I must mention that, it\u2019s the newly revealed antagonist who is Kai's most fascinating and dynamic character. I've always thought that well rounded and developed antagonists make the most interesting conflicts (I love villains). In Kai we get a character with a deep past and clear motivations, but we\u2019re never annoyed by a plea for sympathy. What we have instead is a genuine character study; the antagonist is evil, but they are motivated by things which are distinctly human (Kind of like Light Yagami from Death Note). \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the animation in Kai was decent, a step-up from the first season. The characters, dark setting, and backgrounds were all beautiful yet sinister, but art was never Higurashi's strong point. The music was needless to say spectacular, with all the tragic, tear-jerking piano pieces. As expected of Kawai Kenji, an amazing composer, although there were some pieces of music that played at times when the music didn't fit in with the scene. As for the openings, they fit in right with the anime, spooky, gloomy, and sinister describes it! Go to youtube and listen to \"Dear You\" on the piano ~ Beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed this series to it's max, but there were some things that disappointed me such as the comic relief being dropped at the most inappropriate of times (too much useless talking). The finale though just amazing, it provides a fitting end to the grand tale of Higurashi no Naku Koro. Higurashi is a true epic and one of the few mystery anime that has a set of solutions that do justice to the initial questions (absolutely genius). Furthermore Higurashi no Naku Koro delves into a deeper theme beyond the front story, regarding human nature, and bonds of friendship/trust. Genius. I conclude this review by recommending those who haven't seen Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai to watch it, for although it does lack the \"violence, gore\" of the first season, it prospers in \"themes, and answers\".",

            "content": "Higurashi (yes, I'm shortening the name once again) must be observed not as two seasons and whole load of OVA's and specials, but as a collective entity, and what a brilliant one! Beware, because I'm including some plot segments and ideas of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. If you haven't watched it yet - then go and do it right now, before it's too late!\r\n-Story-\r\nThis is the strongest and the most striking point of the whole show. I was puzzled while watching the first season, because most of the events seemed random and somewhat insane: characters murdered each other, resurrected again and kept going mad.But I also enjoyed all the mystery surrounding these events ans even started building up some theories. I was hoping for some answers in the second season, and I got them to the fullest extent. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing this season did straight away was prove, that there was a method through madness of this show. The \"infinite loop\" idea was not really uninspired and new, but it did fit and it explained most of the strange moments. But the thing that amazed me the most was the slowly, but surely unravelling of a big ball of ideas in my head. Do you remember the cake theory? Never eat it at once, or you will hate it eventually. Well, this theory works for these series too. Those pieces of plot which I connected with each other throughout Higurashi kept me watching at the edge of my sit and asking for more. I personally place the conspiracy of Higurashi somewhere near the storyline of Death Note, because the psychological and information warfare near the end of the show was absolutely brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nThe are only two real cons in the way they handled the story of Higurashi. The first is Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. The madness and \"random\" events can really put off some viewers. Thankfully, it didn't happen to me. \\n\\n\r\nSecond con is a somewhat ridiculous way the company of kids won the battle against the whole squad of special forces just by using some traps and a bit of an advanced tactic. Still, this is Japanese show, can't blame them too much, right? \\n\\n\r\nThe viewers were also kept wondering about the origin of Hinamizawa Syndrome, which I feel is the first thing worth explaining.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\nAnother strong point of Higurashi is the way it develops the main characters. All of them have commited some sins, which drove them into the village, but they are trying their best to live happy lives. I began to empathize the MC to the fullest in the second season, when the battle against fate started and most of the backstories were revealed. The only problem was that some characters (mainly Rika and Hanyuu) were still left aside ang quickly captured by sharp-clawed paws of OVA directors. \\n\\n\r\nSome didn't like the series mostly because of all the comedian \"fillers\" in it, but I feel that I enjoyed  it even more because of them and the contrast they made. All the \"quiet before the storm\" episodes were really heartwarming and funny. The scenes, where all the MC started to combine their strength and help each other in their trials, where really well made too.\\n\\n\r\nAnother pro is the development of the antagonist. It was hard for me to watch her struggle in her childhood. Desperate people become the \"Pierrot marching around the stage\" really easily, and this fate didn't pass her by. My feelings about the antagonist are controversal, but at least it's not the typical \"kill them all and get the crown\" villain without any ulterior motives.\\n\\n\r\n-Art- \\n\r\nThe artwork of Higurashi is not bad, but old. Plus, I had to watch the show in 480p. It didn't really spoil the overall enjoyment or anything, though. Characters were happy and cute when they wanted to be, but also really scary and insane at time. This contrast was very well drawn and it created all the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nAll the openings and endings are pretty catchy and they actually fit the atmosphere. The first OP is quite intense and bloody just like the first season, while the second one is more dramatic and calm. I didn't pay much attention to music, but it was changing mood when needed.\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nOverall, I feel that watching all the seasons is indeed worth it because of an amazing storyline and most of the urgent questions answered. I enjoyed Hirugashi a lot and I would advice everyone to watch it, but certainly not as a first title.\\n\\n\r\nQuick summery:\\n\r\n-Story-\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\n+ The \"answering\" second season, which slowly unravelled most of the mysteries.\\n\r\n+/- Madness and random events of the first season.\\n\r\n- No explanation to the origin of the Hinamizawa Syndrome.\\n\\n\r\n-Character-\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\n+ Amazing development of MCs and the sins they commited.\\n\r\n+ Desperate antagonist with sad and depressing backstory.\\n\r\n- Not enough attention to Rika and Hanyuu in the main series.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\n+ Art changing mood when needs be.\\n\r\n+ Bright and well drawn characters.\\n\r\n- Bad quality and overall stale artwork.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\n+ Mood changing.\\n\r\n+ Brilliant OPs and EDs.\\n\r\n- The music is not really that impressive.",

I'm going to not try to spoil this anime, but it's VERY hard not to spoil it. And if you haven't seen the first season of Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni, you might not want to read the rest of this review. \r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai is pretty much the answers to some of the arcs in it's premises. But the main storyline instead of different people at each time, we have one and only one forevery arc, the one and only Rika Furude. That's right, the girl that got the least screentime in the first season. Anyway, the story follows Rika and how each arc goes along, and some of the arcs about herself. The first episode starts off with Akasaka Mamoru with Ooishi going through Hinamizawa which supposedly had a gas leak killing everyone. When they're going through, Akasaka tells Ooishi that these things were told by them by the one and only Rika Furude. Going through more of Hinamizawa, Ooishi finds the only person who lived through the gas leak, everyone's favorite, Rena Ryuguu. When Ooishi talks to Rena about Rika, she also heard the apocalyptic events that ended up being the future as well. After that, the rest of the series is involved with the past, which means this is the only episode that involves with the future. The first arc involves the events with the Higurashi gang before the gas leak. The second arc involves the gang trying to fight for their lives. The last arc is very much like the second one, but just a little different. Trust me, there would be WAY more I would say about the story, but just trying to explain the story can easily spoil the show. Overall I enjoyed the story for Kai, and can be enjoyed by all Higurashi fans.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of Kai resembles the first season very much. The characters and the backgrounds don't change from the first season, so there is nothing much to say about the artwork. I enjoyed the art from the first season, so I couldn't not enjoy the art from the second season. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors and the score for Kai do not change. Though for some reason, I keep on thinking that the core improved from the first season, when pretty much the score didn't even change.  The opening for Kai has more of a dramatic tone than more of a creepy tone as the first season did. The ending theme as well. I did enjoy both the opening and ending themes. The ending in my opinion is better than the first, but the opening in my opinion still can't beat the creepy psychological first opening. Really, nothing has changed, therefore it's hard to talk about this.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in my opinion become much better from the first season. In the first season, I didn't care for Rika, but now, Rika is now one of my favorite anime characters. Rika now in this season has a personality to her, which makes her sparkle. Her thoughts to keep on trying and to never give up makes her memorable, and therefore she tops my list. We do get a new character for the series that accompanies Rika in the last two arcs, Hanyuu. Hanyuu is supposedly following Rika for pretty much the rest of her days until it ends. Hanyuu doesn't get much screen time in Kai, just like Rika did in the first season. Though I do believe Hanyuu is a very memorable character, especially in the last episode. Keiichi does not change that much, and since Kai revolves around Rika, we do not get much Keiichi in Kai. Though in the last two arcs, Keiichi sparkles, just as Rika does. At first I didn't understand why Keiichi was so popular, but now I completely understand. He is very confident and is one of the most caring characters in any anime. Rena isn't crazy this season. But just because she isn't insane, doesn't make her a bad character. In fact, I enjoy Rena more in Kai (Sorry people, but I'm not a big fan of crazy Rena). Rena is more intelligent with the choices she makes, and she cares for everyone, no matter how cute they may be. Mion does not change in Kai. She is still the energetic tomboy that everyone can be idolized by. As for Satoko, she doesn't get really any attention in Higurashi. The first arc has some stuff to do with Satoko, and the second arc, the gang is trying to help her, but even still, she doesn't get screen time. And for Shion fanboys and fangirls, she doesn't appear either :(\\n\\n\r\nNow watching Kai, I thought that I wouldn't enjoy it as much as I would the first season, but Kai proved itself worthy with the last two arcs. The second arc is definitely one of my favorite arcs in almost all the animes I've seen, and the ending to Kai has one of the best endings to the other animes. The first arc was good but didn't stand out. And the first episode made me snooze. But even though, I can't say that I didn't enjoy every second of Kai. If you haven't watched Kai and you've seen the first season, I would strongly recommend Kai to you. I hope it won't disappoint.\\n",

            "content": "In this review, I am including both Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni and Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai in my comments. I will be calling the anime simply \"Higurashi\" in my review to save time. During the few times that I do choose to differenciate between the two seasons, I will refer to \"Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai\" simply as \"Kai\".\r\nStory: Higurashi's storyline is stellar. It starts off as a horror/thriller anime where numerous mysteries arise in the small town of Hinamizawa. These mysterious storylines are filled with tension and suspense as the viewer fears for Keiichi's (the main character) life. Since Keiichiis a righteous character who means no harm, the viewer sympathizes with him and fears for his well-being- which is constantly at risk due to the seemingly murderous girls he befriends. Several story arcs arise as we experience Hinamizawa through Keiichi's eyes. Although these storylines may seem slightly confusing and seemingly unrelated at first, the second season of Higurashi ties them all together extremely well (I won't say how because of spoilers, of course). This ability to keep the viewer in suspense and tieing so many intriguing stories together makes Higurashi's storyline extremely engaging, and is my favourite storyline out of every anime I have seen to date. This intricate storyline also carries a heart-warming underlying theme of the importance of friendship and continually shows us extremely hyperbolic possibilities of what the world may become without trust and friendship. I find it particularily interesting that such a theme exists under Higurashi's superficial hack-and-slash plotline.\\n\\n\r\nArt: As I read other people's comments on Higurashi's art, I noticed that people generally preferred the second season's artwork more than the first. While the second season's art did seem more well-rounded and fleshed out that season one, I had no major complaints with the first season's artwork whatsoever. Both seasons' art tricks most people into believing the anime essentially a typical harem or shoujo. The shock that people recieve when they see such cute characters are actually involved in an intelligent horror/mystery story is priceless. This is the primary reason for which I feel that Higurashi's artwork is extremely effective.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Higurashi's soundtrack suits the anime extremely well and the only reason I did not give it a 10 is because I cannot remember any specific background music besides Rika's theme. But just because the soundtrack is not memorable does not necessarily mean it is bad. The undertoned, haunting soundtrack is suited so well to Higurashi that it does not interrupt the flow of the anime's plot whatsoever. It only increases tension and suspense as haunting melodies are quietly played on a piano or violin in the background. As for opening/ending themes, Higurashi's openings are extremely catchy and memorable. Both are definitely worth downloading onto an ipod or mp3 player (along with &quot;Dear You&quot;, a song from the original Higurashi videogames). The first ending however, did not do anything for me while Kai's ending (Taishou.a) was a lot more pleasurable to listen to. I enjoyed it for it's graceful melody juxtaposed against its rather gruesome lyrics which essentially served as a parallel to highlight the main concept of Higurashi's storyline. This fact alone made Taishou.a an excellent choice for Kai's ending song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Character development in Higurashi is also amazing. The characters interact with each other in a very natural, human manner and their personalities are not sterotypical in the least. In the first season, Higurashi's character personalities are also quite complex and can keep the viewer guessing at characters' true personalities and motives for episodes upon episodes because of how mysterious every character is (with the exception of Keiichi). During Kai, the characters often adopt a more optimistic or positive outlook on everything as a result of their efforts to work together against a common enemy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you cannot tell by now, I thoroughly enjoyed both seasons of Higurashi and am definitely going to re-watch them both at least a few more times in the future. What is not to love moe girls that have a murderous streak to them? ^^\\n\\n\r\nOverall: My favourite anime series. If you have not seen this, please watch it IMMEDIATELY! The world needs more Higurashi fans. Also, I am aware that a third season of Higurashi will be released sometime this year and I am anxiously anticipating its release. Hopefully, it will explain what happened at the very end of the second season, since I was left feeling fairly confused... but that might just be because I was too stupid to interpret the ending accurately O_o Thanks for reading, I hope it helped!",

            "content": "I will say this now, if you have not seen the anime called Higurashi no Naku koro ni, then this review will be as useful as the dust that lies under your bed.\r\nWith that said, most of what I have to say about Kai will be a rehash of what I said in my season 1 review; therefore, I will not be giving a detailed review. Instead, I will say what I thought were the stronger aspects in Kai compared to that of the first season. No doubt, both seasons of Higurashi were wonderful and one cannot exist without the other. Because of this, itis not exactly fair for me to use the same criteria I use with a stand alone season series or a stand alone anime. Thus, I rate and review Kai based on what was different, whether it be an improvement or not, from season 1.\\n\\n\r\nStory: As said earlier, Kai is a direct continuation of where season 1 left off. Kai shows the last two answer arcs of Higurashi plus an anime-exclusive arc to fill up the holes to answers that were missing from season 1. Every mystery or question posed in the first season is answered nicely. The way everything falls together is very well thought out. The solutions provided to the mystery leaves very little things unanswered. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Vast improvement in the art department from the last seasons. Animation, however, while it is much better, can still be inconsistent. Well, Higurashi was never known for its animation, and it does its job fine without KyotoAni, Bones, or Madhouse quality animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: One aspect of Kai that was the same as the first season. The first season had an OP that matched very well with its atmosphere and mood. Kai was no different. Instead of the creepy, unsettling feeling, Kai uses an OP the shows the drama and desperation of Rika's struggle. The voice acting is still superb, and besides the major theme that is used in Kai and some new tracks, the music remains the same.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I found the character development to be better and given more time in Kai. While the first season introduced and partially developed the characters, they are fully fleshed out in Kai, especially Rika. Even the characters that you think played minor roles in the first season, Akasaka, Tomitake, Takano, Irie, and Ooishi, gets a good deal of development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While I had a lot more fun brainstorming theories and (sometimes, not always) being confused, I enjoyed Kai for other reasons. Firstly, I loved Minagoroshi-hen. It is, no doubt, my favorite Higurashi arc. While some people might enjoy watching psychotic girls beat the hell out of a certain, horrible uncle (I mean, who does not?), I had just as much fun watching Keiichi give his epic speeches. After all, Keiichi is called the Magician of Words for a reason. I also enjoyed watching as everything unfolded.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:This would average out to a 9.4. I did think there was improvement of pacing, being a lot more consistent, quality wise, than season 1, and the awesome ending. The pacing in season 1 felt rushed at some parts and caused certain facts to be left out. Thankfully, most of that was rectified in Kai. So yes, in some ways, I did think Kai was superior to the first season. The first season did really well in setting up the mystery and atmosphere. While Kai's atmosphere may seem too different from that of season 1, it is actually a lot closer to its original source material (the VN). Of course, I will not be going into this, but overall, the way the story unfolds is wonderful, especially if some of your theories turns out to be correct. Even with all that said, this series is not perfect. While the ending itself and final episode was brilliant, the lead up to that ending was weak and could have been executed better. Even with that said, Higurashi, as a whole, is a series that I would definitely recommend. Final verdict: 9/10",

You launch forward... only to find your opponent collapsed on the ground due to a heart attack.\r\nYou won! But what's the feeling? Elation? Disappointment? Or a weird mixture of both?\r\nWhatever that emotion is, that's what'll you feel upon completion of Higurashi Season 2. Brilliant twists, unparalleledsuspense, the series builds to a full crescendo as the true devils behind the horrors of this countryside village is revealed is stunning fashion. All that is left is for the final confrontation, the one that will end it all...\\n\\n\r\nYou brace yourself. You know what the characters you've grown to love are up against, you know it'll be an uphill struggle. Yet, you know that with their sheer brilliance, they'll likely succeed. The three final episodes are finally here, and you prepared yourself to wowed, just as you were for the past 26 episodes... eager to see just what ingenious plan Kiechi and his group of resilient girls have brewed.\\n\\n\r\nThen... suddenly, you're watching something the looks like came straight of Home Alone. The antagonist's forces, always so powerful, so disciplined, and so deadly, has magically transformed into a mob of bumbling fools. The comedic, idiotic and pathetic ways in which the villains appear totally out of place.\\n\\n\r\nIts like watching Terminator, where after surviving massive explosions and shot gun shellls to the head, Arnold suddenly got killed by a Knife in the gut. You scream `WTF?'? Where's those snipers? Where those silencers? Did all the villains just drop themselves in a a barrel of toxic goo and had their IQ reduced by 50?\\n\\n\r\nIt seemed like he writers just run out brilliant ideas something so powerful could be defeated... and decided to take the easy way. This a true pity, given that the second arc was a true masterpiece, one-upping everything in both seasons combined.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, a final rating for Higurashi ni Ki difficult to give. Up till the final episodes, the series deserves a 10/10. The meets, and even surpasses the incredible standards set by the season before. They have managed to construct a mystery that is unpredictable, and yet fits naturally with all clues given before, creating that elusive `Eureka' moment that is almost magical.\\n\\n\r\nYet, Higurashi fumbles at the critical moment, where the protagonists must use this knowledge to change their hellish destiny. The ending episodes are not bad (They deserve 7/10), but look immeasurable weak when compared to the hand standards set before.\\n\\n\r\nIs it worth watching? Absolutely! Is it an masterpiece? Almost. But just like seeing Terminator die to a knife wound, one just cannot help but feel a little disappointment at the ending and endings tend to have a last impression.",

            "content": "After finishing the first Higurashi series, I was actually looking forward to seeing what Kai had in store for me. Despite my dislike of the horror genre, I was more than willing to give this one a chance too, since I was proven wrong by the former. I was proven wrong, all right, but it was not for the right reasons.\r\nWhere the first Higurashi was centered on shocking the viewer at every turn, Kai went for a slower, more suspenseful approach. Because of this decision, this approach turned out to be exceedingly slow. With only two major arcs present and twenty-four episodes to use, manyevents were stretched out beyond their limits. There were several occasions where the story virtually stalled for two episodes at a time with almost nothing being accomplished. Perhaps because of this, the twists that were thrown in became more surprising. There were just enough of these to help me see this series to its unexpected end.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, thanks to this pacing change, I did see some good come out of Kai. With several major questions raised at the end of the first Higurashi, the series took each one and explained the reasoning behind everything clearly. I can safely say that I had no further questions about any past events when the final credits rolled. There was one other good thing about this slower approach; something that I didn&rsquo;t expect. The amount of back story given was a rather nice treat. Most of this was focused around Takano, someone that barely received any time in the first season, but proved to hold much more that what I saw previously. Her story was more compelling and memorable than the actual plot ever was at any given point.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the entire run of Kai, there seemed to be something missing. The sense of paranoia that was so prevalent in the first season was absent. Granted, this had to do with the focus shift, but there still could have been a way to keep it in the plot. Without the constant fear that someone or something may be lurking around the corner, this series felt rather dull outside of Takano's story. At least the beginning and ending of each episode is enjoyable with the new opening and ending themes.\\n\\n\r\nWhen all was said and done, I could do nothing but sigh. The ending may have been satisfying, but I still wanted more. Despite my distaste for graphic violence and horror, I actually wished that it were there from the beginning. That, my friends, is saying something.",

To my shock the anime was such an improvement I  \r\nJust could not get over myself.  The story,  just like it's previous season is Unique and  a bit confusing, however, this season is where things are finally \r\nStarting to be explained. All of the \"wait I don't get it\" and \"I'm confused\" \r\nThat you may have been saying to yourself or out loud stop. In Kai,\r\nLosing for Rika & Hany\u016b are not an option. Theintense story and drama\\n\r\nOverall shape the relationship between our beloved friends in Hinamizawa.\\n\r\nSo moving on, The art is still cliche for it's time.

Higurashi Kai does a really\\n\r\nGreat job finishing off where Season 1 left off, When you start it, it's not \\n\r\nAt all like you're going into something completely new, 7th expansion does a \\n\r\nMagnificent job at giving you something old, changing it adding new\\n\r\nElements and etc.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave this show 9/10 out of ten because personally\\n\r\nI felt more could've been done to make it new watcher friendly, and more background information on the characters so that it's even easier to understand. That aside,  regardless of its defects. Kai was and is still a masterpiece in my opinion and will always be one of my favorite shows.  Read the first letters down dudes.",

            "content": "before you start to hate me for the low score listen to my reasons. I watched the first season and found it to be amazing and easily deserved a 10 rating. This season was the same universe but felt like it was written by someone else. Where the first season gave you suspense and fear, the second season was too corny and drawn out at boring parts to do anything for me.\r\nWhile I found Hanyou adorable, I also found her to be detrimental to the story. The first season made it possible for the cause of madness to be anything from disease to aliens. Withthe introduction of Hanyou I expected her and Rika to start fighting crime in sailor fuku. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was in my opinion horrible. All of a sudden these characters who were so human and vulnerable were able to take down an army. I could talk more about the conclusion but it would be a spoiler filled rant.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I never get or like is when all of a sudden the main character becomes a supporting character. This season seemed to be all about Rena, Rika, and Hanyou where the first season focused on Keiichi and Rika. I found that it hurt the character development you get to see in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nIn all this would have been an okay anime by itself but following such amazing first season, in comparison, it is rather mediocre.",

            "content": "Disheartening Sunset\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai [Kai] is the sequel to the popular original [Higurashi] that aired the year before, based off the 07th Expansion's sound novels of the same name. The first season covered the four arcs of the original game and the first two arcs of the sequel. Kai covers the last two arcs of the second game and give closure to mysteries presented in Higurashi. \r\nKai's story is satisfying at the very most. The riddles that hung like loose threads are woven together nicely giving us most of the big picture. A few questions are left unanswered, which hopefully Rei, thesecond sequel, will answer. \\n\\n\r\nWith this in mind, it's still hard to say that Kai at any way lives up to the drama of the first. The characters become paper actors, two dimensional, lacking their psychological depth. I commend the series for giving Furude Rika personality, being the main protagonist between both halves of the show. It could be debated she was the shallowest of the Hinamizawa crew in the first outing, but I feel that rest of the club was sacrificed and should have maintained their complexity.\\n\\n\r\nThe atmosphere as well is very upbeat, at each turn of the plot, glass balls of sunshine and hope illuminate the way for our protagonists. It's disappointing considering the most engaging element of the original was the dances of blood and gore and the gritty realization that their is no light at the end of tunnel. \\n\\n\r\nProduction\\n\\n\r\nWe come across similar fare in Kai. There is no noticeable improvement in animation or art which is unfortunate. In the first the super deformed character model served a foil to the violence committed by the characters. In Kai, they serve as symbols for Higurashi's new found optimism, which I found to be more ineffective as a device. \\n\\n\r\nThe music and voice acting were similar to the first. I must say I appreciated Yukari Tamura's work behind Rika. The Violet haired priestess moved between bouts of depression and when she wore a mask of delight, which Tamura handled expertly. The line \"Nippa\" was endlessly endearing, feeling an 'Aww' form at my lips every time she uttered the word. \\n\\n\r\nWatchability and Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nKai requires you to watch the original, making it even less accessible than Higurashi, which required you to have a strong stomach. Kai isn't as addictive as the first either, I found myself trudging from episode to episode just to learn more about the skeletons in Hinamizawa's closet. Though, sometimes at the end of each twenty-one minute session I was left wondering, \"How come no one is being hacked to fucking pieces! This is HINAMIZAWA! Why ain't the bodies hitting the floor?!\" Maybe I'm just a Sadist. \\n\\n\r\nThemes\\n\\n\r\nKai looks up, where as Higurashi looked down. The glass ceiling of fate is meant to be shattered by will power. Ignore the glass shards that will come raining down on those around us, we must always move forward. In Higurashi fate acted as an iron maiden, not a question of if, but when it's spikes would make swiss cheese out of your soul. In Kai, fate is tub of play-doh, ours to mold and create. \\n\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai is easy to recommend to those that have seen the first for one reason alone: the antagonist is finally revealed. The show fails to deliver a product as engrossing as the first but that is the nature of sequels I suppose. Unless it's Godfather II of course.",

            "content": "What did we see in Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni so far?\r\nWell, it's been an amazing journey through the depths of human psychology, telling us that everyone is capable of becoming a killer under different circumstances... Watanagashi's mysteries were quite fascinating and there were specific scenes and moments the watcher won't forget that easily, in matter of psychological tension or brutal violence. The season ended with a slight glance of hope to escape the murder scenario repetition going on, so the watcher was looking forward seeing the resolve of that twisted maze.\r\nThen there was Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai... ...and the tension was gone.\r\nThesecond season of Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni was successful in erasing every intriguing aspect of the first one.\\n\\n\r\n- The Story:\\n\r\nThe second season tells you every answer you need to understand what's going on in Hinamizawa, not only once, but plenty of times, so that even the most distracted watchers would understand. Maybe because of that, the answers presented seem very odd and the excitement level drops. The rest of the screentime is used in more unnecessary scenario repetitions, which feel quite inappropriate,  because you already had a complete season using this method and it becomes boring. The higher quality of exciting psychological mystery plot vanishes and gives way to some kind of youth adventure filled with plotholes, similar to Spielberg's The Goonies...\\n\\n\r\n- The Atmosphere:\\n\r\nHigurashi was all about the tension created by the menacing situation the main characters were in. Well, because of the disappearance of most of the elements concerning that, the atmosphere becomes dull and you start to loose the contact to the characters. Also, because of the trivial answers you get to the big mystery, the enigmatic factor in atmosphere gets lost as well. In the final part of the season, the watcher will find himself watching some kind of Arnold Schwarzenegger movie with oneliners, shootouts and fistfights... THAT completely destroyed the mood...\\n\\n\r\n- The Design\\n\r\nThis is one of the few minor improvements Higurashi went through. The character design looks far smoother than season one's did. Also, the rate of SD usage was increased, which makes the humorous sequences more enjoyable than in season one.\\n\\n\r\n-The Final Conclusion:\\n\r\nHigurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai destroyed most of the precious elements of the first series. The psychological mystery disappeared complety, the disturbing scenes of violence are not disturbing anymore and the twisted plot gets cleared in a most trivial way. Even without comparing the second season to the first, you will still find yourself bored by the redundant scenario repetitions and the more than unnecessary flashback sequences.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.\r\nWorst sequel ever.\r\nReasons:\r\nThere are many reasons, but the greatest failure in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai is the way it ends. I've endured tons of episodes, for the sake of finally seeing HOW  Rika would overcome her fate.  And what did I learn from watching Kai?\r\n1.If you want to overcome your destiny, just  set up some overly lame traps, in the forest that can take down even an army. \r\n2. Hire a Chuck Norris(known Akasaka Mamoru here), and make him beat up 7-8 members of Yamainu with his bare hands(ending of episode 22). (This whole 1 vs 8is totally unbelievable on its own, not to mention the fact that Yamainu MUST HAVE HAD weapons with them, so why didn't they just shot down that policeman??????\\n\r\nBeats me.\\n\\n\r\n(edit: oh and he just allowed them to return to their base instead of tieing them up with a rope or something...see beginning of episode 23...funny, how did they get back??)\\n\\n\r\n3. Did you know that, with only 4 people you can take control of an underground base?  Well in Higurashi it isn't impossible, even if one of the 4 people is a schoolgirl and another one is a doctor.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's talk a bit about the childish traps I mentioned above. As I said it's completely unrealistic that some kids from a village can take down a platoon of  trained soldiers. But it's not only that. The other thing that really annoyed me at this part, is the total lack of any tension. Just compare it to the first series of Higurashi and you will see the difference.\\n\\n\r\n Keiichi and the others were hunted by soldiers who wanted to kill them. What would be the normal reaction of people who are surrounded by armed soldiers in a forest? Well, I've never been in such a frightening situation, but I'm pretty sure I'd be  scared. \\n\\n\r\nNow look at the face of the characters in Higurashi when they are in the forest with the soldiers. Do they look scared to you? NO\\n\r\nNot only they aren't scared, but they keep on laughing and joking with each other!!!  WHAT A JOKE!  Totally ruins the tension.\\n\\n\r\nJust 2  concrete examples:\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 13 a Yamainu car stops near Keiichi and the others and Keiichi suggests capturing it(baseball bat and a meat cleaver vs firearms.....yeah they have a chance). Mion then says she will drive the car if they manage to capture it. Someone then asks if Mion has a driving license(what does it matter in this situation anyway?), Mion replies something, then Satoko begins to laugh loudly.(meanwhile the Yamainu car is right in front of them packed with people trying to kill them,  but looks like these kids aren't interested in such minor things. They're having fun.)\\n\\n\r\nOr in episode 24 when Keiichi and Hanyuu use a loudspeaker to scare away the WELL TRAINED MIGHTY soldiers aaaand THEY SUCCEED! LOL\\n\r\nI hope there aren't any soldiers like these in my country's military force, because if there are, then we are in great trouble.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course after this hyperlame   \"psychological warfare\", the kids begin to happily praise each other, laugh at each other and trying to act funny like usually. Well they have every reason to do so right?....I mean they can't be sure how many ARMED SOLDIERS remained in the forest TRYING TO KILL THEM.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly don't get the author's true intention. There are episodes that give me the feeling that this anime is aimed at an older audience because of the gore and cruelty. Yet there are episodes which are so childish, that I would only show them to  little kids in the age group of 8-12.\\n\\n\r\nThe author took the cheapest solution in everything in this anime.(referring to the childish traps and Chuck Norris...I mean Akasaka Mamoru's fate changing fists)\\n\\n\r\nSame with this whole hallucination thing. Why create a satisfying explanation to the series??? Yeah, just take all the questions that has been raised in the first series and explain everything with hallucination even  if it doesn't make any sense sometimes(at least to me). Maybe you think it was a really good twist, OK I know it's just a matter of taste, but for me it looked like the author didn't want to spend a lot of time trying to figure out a fine resolution for the series and ended up with this because it's the cheapest of all.\\n\\n\r\n(\\n\r\nEven you can write such stories. It's really simple......just put every craziness that occurs to you into the first season, then in the second one, just say that all those stuffs were just someone's imagination.  It's not that complicated.\\n\r\n)\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd as I mentioned there are  still things that I don't understand....\\n\\n\r\nIn the first series, they mentioned that people keep dying and disappearing ALWAYS on the day of the Watanagashi, and they called this the Curse of Oyashiro-Sama. I found this really cool, because it's full of mystery and stuff and of course I didn't wonder why it's happening always the same day(after all it's a curse).\\n\r\nTHEN we found out that the curse is actually a virus(parasites to be more accurate). So I ask the question now. \\n\r\nWhy did the killings and disappearances always happened on the same day??\\n\r\nThere isn't any mystical curse now. What we have is a virus that activates itself when someone gets stressed, or leave Hinamizawa. Takano Miyo was the one who killed Rika's parents purposely on the day of Watanagashi, so the villagers would believe in the curse and again Takano was the one who killed that photographer AGAIN on the day of Watanagashi for the same reason.\\n\r\nBUT this still doesn't explain the other killings.\\n\r\nThat director of the dam project had gone crazy on the day of the Watanagashi  and was killed by the workers out of self-defense. Then 1 or 2 years later on the same day the parasites within Satoko's body became active which caused Satoko to push down her \"parents\" off the cliff. Then year(s) later AGAIN on the exact same  day Satoshi's aunt was killed while Satoshi disappeard. What a coincidence.\\n\\n\r\nI can't shake the feeling that the creator of this anime had only one purpose while creating the first series. Complicating things and complicating things and complicating things  then suddenly he realized: \"OMG this won't make any sense in the second season! Oh well the people surely won't notice  minor failures, if I make the story really overcomplicated and put in this hallucination thing.\" (This whole dying-on-the exact-same-day stuff was only included to make the story scarier and to raise the mystery level, after all it doesn't make any sense if it's not a curse.)\\n\\n\r\nReminds me of the series, Twin Peaks.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (YEAHH! Here comes the fun part.)\\n\\n\r\nKeiichi: \\n\\n\r\nOne of the thing that annoyed me in Keiichi is him being a total pushover. No matter what kind of contest he takes part in, he sucks always. Card game in Episode 1...he lost , eating contest....he lost, fight against Rena with Water Guns....it was a draw!!!!(holy ****) , fight against Rena on the top of the roof of the school...he lost, zombie tag in the school....he lost, playing a card game again when Hanyuu was a newcomer....guess what...HE LOST AGAIN. And like the rest of the characters, he was always acting cheerful even there was no reason for it and was totally unrealistic given the situation he were in.\\n\\n\r\nA quick question: How many times Keiichi  gave  courage boosting speeches thorughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nA: 1               B: 2\\n\r\nC: 3               D: Dunno the exact number, but if I have to guess than it's between 10000 and 20000(a little exaggeration  doesn't hurt, does it?)\\n\\n\r\nYup you're right the correct answer is D. Congratulation.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, it was so annoying to hear Keiichi's blabbering about friendship after the 500th time..........\"Never give up..You can't give up..You will make it beacuse we're here  with you blahblahblah.\" Basically he always repeated the same thing, but he used different words each time he gave a speech, so it won't be THAT annoying. \\n\\n\r\nUsually I don't mind such blabberings  in any anime, but here they were sooo forced and repetitive. By the time I reached episode 17-18 I could foretell when will be another Keiichi speech with 95% accuracy.\\n\\n\r\nRena and Rika: (aka Kana, Kana?? and NIPA!) \\n\\n\r\nRena's personality was virtually non-existent. IMO she was only included in the series because she is so  kawaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii with her constant \"kana, kana\" and \"I' ll take her  home!!\". In the beginning I DID find her cute(and freaking psycho too) but this feeling quickly changed to ..........bah I don't know how to describe it without using vulgar words......let's say I don't like her anymore.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Rika....NIPA! So dull.....and why is she speaking  with 2 voices? Looks like some kind of splitted personality so I used google.com to search around a little bit and I found out that the other, more serious voice Rika has, belongs to Frederica Bernkastel... you know the witch from Umineko no Naku Koro Ni(episode 5). Someone even said this (of course it's not confirmed officially and it DOES sound lame IMO): \\n\\n\r\n\"Frederica is the combined form of the mental states Rika had in each of the alternate Hinamizawas\"\\n\\n\r\nYeah right, and I'm Santa Claus. Someone reads too much fan fiction here.\\n\\n\r\nOh and Rika's/Frederica's behavior is really irrational sometimes. If I wanted to warn Akasaka that his wife's life is in danger then I'd probably say \\n\\n\r\n\"Hey dude, your wife is in danger so leave Hinamizawa go back to the hospital immediately before it's too late.\" \\n\\n\r\nand not\\n\\n\r\n\"Akasaka! Go home to Tokyo! You should hurry along home to Tokyo.(and here comes the best part)  Otherwise you'll seriously regret your decision.\"\\n\\n\r\nWHAT THE HELL??(she was even smiling like some kind of evil mastermind)\\n\\n\r\nWhy coudn't she just be more concrete?? It's like Rika/Frederica knew that she was starring in a horror anime so she was supposed to act scary in front of the viewers. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the creator of this rubbish.....I mean anime, wanted to scare the viewers with everything he had whether it makes sense or not.\\n\\n\r\nSatoko: \\n\\n\r\nNot much to say, I liked her laughing most of the times. Until it became annoying as well.......\\n\\n\r\nMion: \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite girl of the series. It's not like she was THAT special, but at least she didn't have  annoying catchphrases or unrealistic personality. She was normal and that's a big deal here.\\n\\n\r\nand finally Hanyuu:\\n\\n\r\nFirst she was the queen of pessimism -  Hauu. Then in the final episodes she suddenly became a real badass and announced that she was a god  - Hauu.\\n\r\nMaybe it's just me but if someone said the word \"god\" to me, the image of Hanyuu would be the last thing that'd  pop up in my mind.   Hauuuu.\\n\\n\r\nLol I've just remembered another \"interesting\" stuff about Rika so let's return to her for a moment. Previously I was talking about, unrealistic behaviors, wasn't I?\\n\\n\r\nSo let me ask you a question. What'd you do if you were in Rika's place? How'd you gather allies in order to defeat the Yamainu. I mean, everybody'd think you went nuts, if you began to talk about parasites and infinite time loops suddenly, without backing them up with proofs. \\n\\n\r\nIT'S SO OBVIOUS that the easiest way to make the others believe you is to predict something that will happen in the near future and then everyone will believe your story when they see you're prediction is right. \\n\r\nThe same way Rika did in episode 6 of Kai.......in episode 6 of Kai......\\n\r\n........after being in the time loop for at least 100 years, she realizes something totally obvious.  No comment.\\n\\n\r\nAnd another funny thing occured to me while I was writing......this is related to the final episode of Kai, when the Banken arrives(you know that special combat unit).\\n\\n\r\nTakano asked the leader of Yamainu why didn't he keep fighting and the leader replied that the banken is a special combat unit so they didn't have any chance to win against them.\\n\\n\r\nWell I think the correct answer would have been this:\\n\\n\r\n\" How could we have any chance against trained soldiers, if most of our people were defeated by a bunch of  kids?\"(oh and most of them were girls)\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to waste more time  with this review so I'll stop here. I could lament all day why this anime is so bad, but it'd be pointless. \\n\\n\r\n It's a sad thing that the once great Higurashi became a total joke. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Even though Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai and Higurashi no naku koro ni are in the same series as a whole, they both have many differences. I'm not going to go on about how season one was better or worse, but I will point out some things that were interesting to me. \r\nStory: I was very pleased with the story and how it really brought some light to the first series. I was no longer in the dark about why their were arcs and why some things were happening. Higurashi Kai takes you through two very intriguing and exciting answer arcs that are adirect continuation of the first series. The development of the story was brilliant and I found it to be very enjoyable. It has a sense of hope that the first series could not provide, but still keeps you on the edge of your seat, and guessing. The way that the questions and mysteries of the first season were answered was amazing. There are very few things that are left unanswered. I also found the development and pacing of the story to be much more enjoyable that the first. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was still brilliant. Especially the background scenery. It makes you feel like you're really in the story and plays a very major roll in the development of the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: I definitely saw an improvement in animation from the first series. The animation doesn't look like it was pressed for time, and there are less weak animation spots.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound in this Higurashi series, like the first, was absolutely outstanding. The creators have outdone themselves again with music, themes, and jingles that make the series believable and fit it perfectly. I think they used some of the sounds again from the first series, which made it even more enjoyable. I especially like the opening theme. It fit the series very well. For example, Higurashi no naku koro ni had an opening that created a very unsettling feeling, just like the show. While, Higurashi Kai's opening created a feeling that something was about to come along and make all the characters lives better. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character development was a lot better in Higurashi Kai. In Higurashi season one, the characters were built at the beginning with little bits over time. Characters that didn't seem to play a substantial role, ended up being very significant in Higurashi Kai. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I would definitely say that I enjoyed this series more than the first because it gives all the answers and reasons that things happened in the first season. I really enjoyed the pacing and the \"just for fun\" episodes. This series really shows how the characters can work together to fight for what they believe in. It really shows how close knit the group is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The series was very enjoyable, and I find that it meets all the expectations that I would consider for a great anime. All the effects and situations the characters were put in, show how much they really care for each other, which is a big difference from what the first series shows. Higurashi Kai is an anime, that I would put as a \"must watch\" for any type of anime fan.",

            "content": "Being able to sum up the story of Higurashi in less than a chapter of writer is impossible. Being able to explain the story of Higurashi? Even more impossible. Which gives it that feeling of, \"I have to keep watching on too understand.\"\r\nI felt as though I got to grow with the characters in Higurashi, I got to feel the same exact emotions they did. I got to laugh and cry with Higurashi. It's more than just a bunch of lolli girls, or even a bunch of physco lolli girls. The plot is knee-deep and wonderful. The different emotion you get to feel with Higurashiis beautiful. The action, blood, gore, romance, pretty girls... etc... you don't find it all packed into one anime often. With the exception of Elfen Lied.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, I wish I could have watched other anime before Higurashi, because now everything else just seems like a big dissapointment. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I disliked about the anime, was that it's hard to follow. People might watch the first five episodes, and be mad, because they have no clue what is going on. *cough cough* me *cough cough* But I think it was the sneaky way of getting people to watch the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I would like to wrap up with the comparison of the two similar animes, Higurashi and Elfen Lied. To me, Elfen Lied was well written, there was great art with emotional scenes. But Higurashi was amazingly written, with beautiful art, and scenes you could connect with. Scenes where you can say to yourself, \"I feel that/I feel bad for that character.\" Elfen Lied was great, but Higurashi walks on water next to it.",

            "content": "\"Someone taught me something- that the power of belief will give rise to a miracle that will cut through fate.\" - Hanyuu\r\nPreface: \r\nBirthday review!\r\nThis review is solely for Higurashi Kai, which I will refer to as \"Kai\" from this point on. Since it's a part two, it's necessary to have seen the first set, as it's divided into \"question\" and \"answer\" arcs. This series formulates the many, complex answers to the question: What exactly is happening to Hinamizawa in June of 1983? \r\nArtwork and Animation: 7\r\nLike its predecessor, Kai is approaching 10 years old, and looks somewhat dated when put up against more recent efforts,both by studio Deen and others. By no means does it detract from the show though, as the somewhat rough look gives it a dated feel too, and brings the rural 1983 Japanese mountains to life in a way that pulls you in with how it frames and presents the visuals. \\n\\n\r\nIt's overall a very dark show, both in atmosphere and coloration, which intertwine excellently together to give it a dense, oppressive feel. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe opening, \"Naraku no Hana (Flower in Hell)\", by Eiko Shimamiya is a wonderfully haunting song that really sets the mood for the show, with lyrics to match. The ending song, \"Taish\u014d.a\", by anNina is even more foreboding, with soft violin and piano that really affixes the ending scenes in the mind's eye, like an ellipsis at the end of a particularly thought provoking sentence. \\n\\n\r\nKenji Kawai, who also did the original Higurashi and Fate Stay Night's composition does more great work here. Most of the music is very atmospheric, setting the mood and tone for the show. It's very subtle, not in your face loud or obnoxiously playing over the characters. It creates tension, and resolution when necessary- very good. \\n\\n\r\nLet's just say that Kai is the Yukari Tamura show, because her performance as Rika is nothing short of stunning. Certainly the best of her career, and that's saying something. As the focus is 90% on Rika throughout the show, we get a lot of time with her, and in three different voices. Ms. Tamura truly put in an award worthy performance for bringing little Rika to life through as many emotions and moods as can be brought through a visual medium in which the actors themselves are not present. Just excellent. \\n\\n\r\nHowever much talent Yukari Tamura showed, it's nearly matched by Miki Itou's Miyo Takano. As a character who wasn't fully fleshed out in the original series, she plays a much larger role here, and is explored through an emotional and compelling voice role. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Kai expands somewhat from the original series. The introduction of some new characters along with expanding the roles of previous supporting and main characters also expounded upon the intrigue that drives the heart of the show. Higurashi is a show that will lie to you. I was constantly on edge, trying to figure motivations and goals out, because it's never clear; not until it's too late. \\n\\n\r\nThe focus changes from one of each arc having a main character to just two \"real\" main characters. This enables the character driven portion of the story to be a lot more fleshed out and have less of the disjointed feel that the original had, where the perspectives of the different characters were constantly changing. This is much more nailed down, and is better for it. The familiar and the new faces all have weight in the story- no one is there just for the sake of having the \"token character\" for plot devices. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10 \\n\\n\r\n\"The sin of this world is like Old Maid. Everyone pushes the one Old Maid onto one another. It's not a game you seek to win, but one in which you seek to make someone the loser. The sacrifice.\" - Miyo Takano\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\\n\r\nKai takes a somewhat different tonal and execution approach to its predecessor, in that it's a much more complex and intrigue driven narrative than outright horror. Gone are the short arcs that depict brutal murders and a hanging sense of \"something is just...'wrong'\", and in their place is a deep narrative filled with deceit, betrayal, hunger for power, cold blooded \\n\r\nhate, and a myriad of dark themes. Where Higurashi is the \"tell\", Kai is the \"show\". \\n\\n\r\nThe best suspense and mystery narratives are those that are not heavy handed in shoving the plot down your throat, but allowing you to discover for yourself, to guess and be proven wrong, and to ultimately be surprised and perhaps even shocked by the outcome. This is Higurashi. While everything is revealed to you in time and nothing left unresolved, the manner by which it slowly unveils creates a nearly tangible level of tension. Again, everything starts out happy and fun, but you know that it's just not going to end well. \\n\\n\r\nKai, and Higurashi before it are shows that eliminate the element of surprise about how the arcs go, though. That's not to say they're predictable; no, it's that you \"know\" it's not going to end well... it's just how that ending comes about that is shocking and/or heart rending. Just when I thought it was going to be a good ending, so many things that can go wrong do, and it ends in a sorrowful way again. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike Higurashi part one, Kai is divided up into a mere 3 arcs, which allowed the plot to develop slowly, but with more (necessary) exposition. Again, it's a slow burn of a show: it twists and turns within the arcs, and when I thought I had everything figured out, it managed to turn everything on my head with revelations of who and why. Higurashi is predictably unpredictable- and that's the genius behind it.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't have to be a straight Whodunnit horror show involving cutesy school kids, even thought that could have been plenty entertaining on its own. No, Kai takes it to the next level with a cleverly crafted political conspiracy and treachery by those in positions of power over others. The mysteries of the first series are just the base bricks built into the steps of the pyramid of deception, betrayal, and conspiracy of Higurashi in sum total. These, which ultimately lead to a narrative of immense proportions, and heights of weighty answers that were previously inconceivable from the prior portions of the story. \\n\\n\r\nA maze of irrational questions constructed elaborately by deft hands, that turn to a dark hallway with answers that are both revelatory and thought provoking- a real masterpiece. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I liked most about this show was the very first episode, which serves as a direct epilogue to Higurashi part one. One of the most edge-of-my-seat, intriguing, and addictive openings to a series I've seen, that served as an awesome introduction to the unveiling of the mysteries of Hinamizawa to come. \\n\\n\r\nA note:\\n\r\nDue to the incident in 2007, where a 16 year old Kyotanabe girl murdered her father with an axe to the neck, some of the violence in the anime was censored, and certain parts edited out altogether (along with the cancellation of the last episode of School Days, airing the same time). With this event, there was a noticeable shift in the amount of extreme violence content vs the original series and manga. Not that the show is lacking such content altogether, but for a show that has built a reputation on brutality alongside Alfred Hitchcock style horror storytelling, it was strangely absent in some places. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned above; the story was unpredictable, and in the best possible way. The characters all have their parts to play, and with an expanded cast- all of them get a fair share of development and exposition, though it would have been easier to sideline them. They all remain relevant, and the tone of the series is also very consistent- I very nearly felt time ticking by in their universe as I anxiously watched the events of June 1983 unfold once again. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs both a mystery and a psychological horror show, Kai succeeds with flying, dark colors. As an intense, relentless narrative and a tragic, but ultimately beautiful story, Higurashi Kai surpasses all expectations. It has the necessary elements for an Alfred Hitchcock or Rod Serling worthy masterpiece; the characters, the story, and the atmosphere to back it all up. It's all there. \\n\r\nAll Higurashi needs is an audience. \\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\\n\r\n+ Dark, twisting narrative\\n\r\n+ Great, compelling characters\\n\r\n+ Detestable villain that you can't help but sympathize with on some level.\\n\\n\r\n+/- Lack of ultraviolence? (see above)\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?\\n\\n\r\nAb-so-lute-ly. If you've not seen Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and are reading this for some strange reason, please, go watch the original- you owe it to yourself to see a show of this caliber, because there aren't many of them. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\"My will will weave an absolute future. No one can hinder me or overthrow it: even fate is up to me to decide, with my unwavering, absolute will.\" -Miyo Takano\\n",

            "content": "Personally, my favourite kinds of stories are the ones that really make you think. Ones that make you look back on what you've already seen, and realize there was more going on than you had initially picked up on. Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai makes you realize that the entire first season was preparing you for the story it has to tell. \r\nThe first season of Higurashi is fantastic in its own ways. It's unique in the way it tells its arcs; but it leaves the viewer questioning what they each have to do with one another. The second season, Kai, answers every singlequestion you could have asked, and also adds multiple layers that you didn't realize were even happening. It is the most satisfying psychological story I have experienced in a very, very long time. In terms of story, it is possibly the most impressive psychological story I've ever seen - its internal logic is consistent and wraps up in a way that leaves you with no lingering questions. \\n\\n\r\nArguably one of the most successful parts of Higurashi is its characters. The characters are the story, and the story is what matters. Especially when taking the first season into account, each and every character is given proper time & weight. You understand their backstories, their fears, their traumas, et cetera. They even introduce a new character in Kai that, honestly, makes the whole series make sense. Without this character, the show couldn't wrap up as fantastically as it does. \\n\\n\r\nThough I'm praising Higurashi a lot, that isn't to say it is without fault. The animation can be a bit lackluster at times, and the little I heard of the English dub was aggressively awful. With that being said, I felt the Japanese voice acting was actually fantastic, and the fansubs for the second season were adequate (some awkward phrasing, but they're fansubs haha). As for the art, I never felt the faults in art ever detracted from the show, and there were many moments of beauty in terms of art - I enjoyed it all.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, the soundtrack to Higurashi is wonderful! It uses its themes appropriately, and the production on the music never feels cheap. It is a triumph along with the story, and added a ton of depth and emotion to impactful scenes. \\n\\n\r\nI can't recommend Higurashi enough. I've watched the entire series three times now (first time on my own, second two times with different friends) and always catch something new with each watch. It is a show that is firmly placed in my personal Top 3, and it would take something truly incredible to move it from that spot for me. Higurashi is completely worth your time, and it comes with a heartfelt recommendation from me!",

            "content": "If you have not watched the first season (Higurashi no naku koro ni), this anime is practically useless and the same goes for this review.\r\nWow! Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai was a great addition to an already very good season one. As I found season one rather interesting and enjoyable, Kai was a must watch for me, in the hope that it would be just as great. With many questions left unanswered, Kai primarily focuses on answering questions and revealing to us the \"true\" truth. There are a lot less gore and horror elements compared to the first season, as Rika becomes the mainpoint of view. The introduction of a new character called Hanyuu was certainly an interesting add into the plot. Her introduction into the story was done smoothly but it is likely that you'll ask &quot;Where on earth did she come from?&quot; at first.\\n\\n\r\nAs Kai is a continuation of the first series, the chain of mysterious deaths continues on from Rika's point of view. The first episode of this season kinda acts as a recap and a look into at the aftermath of season one's last arc. It then moves into another arc, raising some questions but answering many, and by the end of the first arc, I'd say it's almost impossible to not continue watching the rest of Kai. The other two arcs finally give us answers to those questions that remained. The telling of a certain character's past in the beginning of the the third arc really unraveled the mystery and told us the cause and effect. It's what makes Higurashi a great story, how the answers are not force fed to you, but instead rather open for interpretation; whether the judgments the characters make are truly right or wrong. How some of the little things can make huge differences, and change the outcome of the future.\\n\\n\r\nA stellar performance by Tamura Yukari playing Furude Rika! The voice acting by her was just amazing (I just love Rika's scream in episode 8!) and should be highly commended, along with all the other seiyuus! Rena's voice is more consistent this time, and Horie Yui's performance of Hanyuu was cute! I have absolutely no objections to the wonderful musical score by Kawaii Kenji, along with another great opening theme by Shimamiya Eiko, and the closing theme which all were very fitting in both lyrics and music. HUGE improvement in the animation! The faces and characters are not as exaggerated or contorted as the first season. It is much more consistent, detailed and kinda makes the characters a little more prettier... \\n\\n\r\nI do believe that the introduction of Hanyuu was certainly necessary, although whether she had to be that &quot;moe&quot; is a little questionable to me. There were large developments in some of the supporting characters such as Akasaka, Dr. Irie, Takano, Tomitake and Satoshi which were vital to the storyline. The only thing is, the concentration on the development of these characters kinda left the mains Rena, Mion and Shion out for a while...\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi just had to go to my favourites list! To me it was such a great story with amazing music and voice acting and very interesting and complex character personalities and relationships, with touches of humour here and there. Although the ending is a little lame, well for me at least, it still deserves an overall 9.5 out of 10. Definitely enjoyable and an interesting ending scene. I'd certainly recommend this to anyone! I wait in anticipation for Higurashi no naku koro ni Rei and Umineko no naku koro ni in the hopes that the creators can continue to make such amazing stories!",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nProbably the biggest reason Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai fails as a sequel is because of a matter of expectation. Now, you might be thinking I just spoiled the entire review right there, but give me a moment, I'm not done, because Higurashi Kai is a very complex thing to pin down why exactly it is the way it is. I guess where you need to start is to consider that any mystery must inevitably have an answer. And when that mystery is played through a dark and chaotic mess, in other words, most of what season 1 of Higurashiencompassed, well, you'll need to go to some very... expressive places in order to justify it all. Needless to say, Higurashi no naku koro ni and Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai(which I'll just call Higurashi Kai from now on) are two, very, very different beasts, a byproduct of the nature of the first season, taking the second season in a new direction, a direction that could have worked, bringing the franchise into a mixed tonal experience of awesomeness. But for whatever reason, whether it be a few key mistakes at critical moments, or simply that the creators of Higurashi simply did not think this whole thing through enough, Higurashi Kai is ultimately a swing... and a miss.\\n\\n\r\n     Hello people of \"The Wired\", my name is Quan, I hope you've been having a lovely day, because it's time for the long overdo review of Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai, something I promised, hell, what was it, 10 months or so ago? It's pretty crazy I've lasted this long actually. For fear of pushing the same information down your throats, I will be not repeating the studio and people behind this season, because they remain largely unchanged from S1, and if you want that info for cataloging or something, feel free to check out my review of S1. For everyone else, let's jump right into the plot.\\n\\n\r\n     At the end of the first season, a couple of things became clear. Keiichi suddenly remembered a couple of things that he probably shouldn't have forgotten in the first place, namely that he killed Mion and Rena savagely with a baseball bat, and through a short talk with Rika, he confirms something that we the viewers have been suspecting all along. That the plot of Higurashi is not in fact a mash-up of possible \"what-if?\" scenarios, but rather a veritable Groundhog Day situation of an infinitely repeating loop of death and murder that will never ever stop, erasing all memories of the traumatic events every-time it goes around for another go. Well... almost all memories, because as it turns out, Rika is the only person who remembers every single iteration, and is becoming slowly desensitized from the transpiring events as she re-lives the deaths of her friends over and over again. Not only this, Rika is the only one aware of the presence of Hanyu: a mysterious girl invisible to basically everyone, that may hold the key about this repeating summer(and also may be the person that Rika has been talking to when she is all by herself this entire time). Upon this realization, Rika slips from the role of the mysterious onlooker of the anime to the spotlight of Higurashi's main protagonist. And so, the stage is set for Higurashi Kai, as Rika Furude must struggle to not lose hope and keep going in the face of the seemingly inevitable result of the death of everyone in Hinamizawa, as she must dodge conspiracies, murderers and the twisted hand of fate in this infinitely repeating labyrinth of sorrow, so maybe, one day, she can find an outcome where everyone can make it out alive.\\n\\n\r\n     Now, this means that the tone of the anime sort of changes drastically, shifting from a horror/psychological mystery into something more resembling a supernatural thriller, which isn't in itself a bad thing, but this loops back to the problem about expectation I mentioned in the beginning of the review. See, a huge point I made in my review of the first season is that horror anime, are to be more precise, good horror anime, are very rare. That's why the release of Higurashi no naku koro ni is such a landmark for me, even nearly a decade after the release of the first season in 2006, nothing else has really ever come close to replicating the paranoia-fueled creepy mindf*ck that the anime was, so switching genres half way through to something much more main-stream in terms of the medium is a little, well, disheartening I guess. As a horror and mystery fan myself, I didn't want a season of Rika fumbling around for an answer to Groundhog Day, I wanted more of the same. But just because I didn't want this sort of season didn't mean that it couldn't be good. Here's the problem. It sort of isn't.\\n\\n\r\n     The first problem lies in pacing. While Higurashi season 1 was a series of wild, savage arcs that all eventually boiled over in blood-soaked mayhem, Higurashi Kai takes a much slower, more reflexive approach. Since it's from Rika's point of view this time, we get many monologues from her about the situation she's in and her ponderings, which are interesting at first, but quickly become boring as they drone on and on, over and over again, like they didn't have enough other things to fill their time with. Actually, everything in Kai seems unnecessarily dragged out. One arc: \"Massacre\", lasts a grand total of 9 episodes, nearly twice as long as an average arc in the series, and it doesn't help that this arc is half boring slice-of-life, and half more deeply exploring Satoko's situation with her abusive uncle, which is helpful for character development, but is also milked for all its worth. Now putting that arc together with the first two arcs of the series, one which is confusing beyond reason, and one is which is basically just Rika reflecting on the situation, and the first half of Higurashi Kai ends up being a slow slog with hardly any of the gore, horror, and Rena stabbing people that we've come to expect from this franchise, and I guess it's no wonder that that pissed a lot of fans of season 1 off. This is somewhat redeemed at the end of the \"Massacre\" arc in spectacular fashion, but we'll get to that later.\\n\\n\r\n     It doesn't help that the answers to the questions raised by the first season are sort of ridiculous. Of course I won't straight out say what they are, but let's just say some are more satisfying than others. I mean, one of the biggest things I appreciate about Higurashi Kai is that is actually answers questions and ties up pretty much all loose ends from the first season, and what it doesn't straight out tell you, can usually easily be gathered from context clues or perhaps re-watching a few choice episodes from the first season. Some of revelations are even amazing in both delivery and the way they were built up throughout the franchise. Answers like what exactly happened to Satoshi(remember him, Satoko's older brother?), and one particular piece of information dropped in episode 12 or 13(I can't quite remember), that had me, no joke, jump up from my seat, walk in circles around my living room, yelling \"Oh, snap!\" repeatedly for a good 5 minutes. Yeah, I know, I'm a nerd.\\n\\n\r\n     On the other hand, for all the well-built up and foreshadowed answers, there is a couple that make me wonder if Higurashi is making up this crap as it goes along. Like, aliens? Really, Higurashi? Aliens? You had no better answer for why- oh never mind.\\n\\n\r\n     But the up most crest of stupidity and downright silliness is reached in the series finale. The finale to the entire franchise, and... I swear, I felt like I was watching a goddamn Scooby Doo cartoon, slapstick included for my viewing displeasure. Actually, the whole last episode and the build-up to it feels sort of cartoonish in nature. It kind of makes you wonder actually, how a franchise that previously built itself on concepts of betrayal, brutal reality, paranoia and how the ugly true nature of humanity is revealed when we are pushed to the brink of sanity... is now relying on... the goddamn... \"power-of-friendship\" to be the answer to everything. Friends who had been killing each-other up till recently. I mean, how did we get to this point? I\"ll get back to you later.\\n\\n\r\n     The characters are a mixed bag, though mostly a positive one. While development has been pretty much burned out completely for the main cast by the start of Kai, we still have one character to shine the spotlight on: the new protagonist of the show, Rika. Now, I will recognize that the basic idea of her character isn't exactly anything new: an all-knowing yet helpless onlooker, worn down to the point of apathy, but I think the reason she works so well as a character in this season lies in the execution. Even if her monologues become tiresome in the first half of the anime, Rika still voices clear thoughts about her stance in this endless summer, and it becomes rather fascinating as her desire to protect her friends clashes against the knowledge that no matter what she does, the result will always be the same. It's admirable really, how she keeps going in the face of utter despair, quite similar to [ERASED FOR SPOILERS] from Madoka Magica, but what really sells her character for me is that she is clearly more tired of this sh*t than anyone, and continually becomes more frustrated and dismissive as the series goes on. As she continually gets her hopes up that maybe the actions she takes this time will change the outcome, only for her preconceptions to be crushed by the crushing hopelessness of her situation. This is illustrated beautifully in one of my favorite scenes of Kai, when Rika, finally pushed to her limit, unleashes a flurry of rage and frustration over her hopeless situation at the world, as her final hope putters out in the face of an impossible challenge. And it's just... so good.\\n\\n\r\n     Hanyu is the new character for Kai, and unfortunately, she is not nearly as interesting as Rika. While we never get a proper explanation on what exactly she is, we can gather form context clues, and honestly, it's pretty stupid, especially when you consider the implication this has on certain events of the first season. As for her motivation, it pretty much begins and ends with wanting to protect Rika, and that isn't a bad motivation per say, but now I have nothing much left to say about her, for that is what drives her character throughout the entirety of Kai. The only interesting thing about her is that she is much more pessimistic than Rika about, as she puts it, \"overcoming fate\", and encourages Rika to just give up on trying to beat death so she won't continue to disappoint and hurt herself. But now that's just looking for depth that isn't there.\\n\\n\r\n     The last character to talk about is \"the villain\", who will remain nameless and gender-less so you won't be spoiled on one of the biggest and best surprises of the season. Anyway, I can see you raising your eyebrow(yes, I can see you), and I understand completely. Higurashi was never the kind of anime that needed a villain; the antagonist of the first season was more or less the dark side of humanity, and that was the way I liked it, but I think you'll find that this villain more than makes up for the loss of subtlety in that regard. I don't know, maybe I like this antagonist so much is that once the antagonist is first revealed(in one of the most awesome ways imaginable) about half-way through the season, it heralds the coming of the best episode of the season, in which a visceral, awesome, satisfying and honestly, quite soul-crushing last 10 or so minutes follow, and makes you think \"hey, this almost feels like the first season again.\" I also quite liked the back-story and unique motivation, for that matter. I thought it was rather interesting.\\n\\n\r\n     Just because I hate Studio Deen doesn't mean I can't give them credit where it's due. Compared to the animation of the first season, Higurashi Kai has drastically improved in several key areas. For one, characters look a lot smoother and better integrated into the world, and speaking of the world, the environment is lot more bright and expressive, with a lot more variety of colors compared to the dull temperatures of the first season. Some say that they prefer the rougher and uglier designs of the first season, arguing that they helped pound home the brutality of the show, but honestly, that seems a little to me like they're grasping at straws. The first season had bad animation, end of story, and Higurashi Kai looks a lot better. I mean, it still doesn't look particularly good, but it's probably one of the best efforts I've seen from Studio Deen. Not that that's saying much. \\n\\n\r\n     Kenji Kawai has returned for Kai's soundtrack, and as per usual from the composer, it is quite superlative. If you remember, the strength of the soundtrack of the first season was the palatable creepy atmosphere that the music let off, and Kawai has done much of the same with the OST for Kai, though this time, he has adjusted his music for tone. There's still a couple of good and creepy tracks in there like \"Shinsou\", but Kai's soundtrack embraces the thriller and supernatural aspects of the season, changing the atmosphere of the music(and by extension anime) by quite a bit. You have proper battle music like \"Gekitotsu\", and even some emotional tracks thrown in for good measure. But undoubtedly the highlight of the music is the OP: \"Naraku no Hana\", a truly haunting and beautiful song that captures the desperate feel of Kai perfectly, using symbolism and meaningful lyrics to its full advantage. I like it so much that I may even think it's better than the first season's OP: and if you know me, that's not said lightly.\\n\\n\r\n     So, throughout this review, it has probably become quite clear that I have some mixed feelings when it comes to Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai. Is it sinful blotch on the legacy of the Higurashi franchise? Not really, because despite being not as good as S1, there are plenty of good things to talk about as well. So is it a worthy successor to the original Higurashi no naku koro ni? Well no, it's not that either, because it pretty much takes everything that made the first season good and throws it away without a care, especially in that good awful ending. So then, what does that make Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai? What I would say, if I were to judge Kai solely on its own merits- well, there's the problem. Actually, if I were to say, I'd say that that is the problem with Higurashi Kai. It's impossible to judge on its own merits. Regardless of what Kai wanted to be, it's still attached to arguably the best horror/psychological mystery anime of the past decade, and that shadow is being cast over it the entire time, overshadowing the good points and enhancing the flaws. It's something just kind of good being compared to something great, and in the end, that \"something good\" is always going to be seen as a disappointment when compared to \"something great\". That's why for all the things I don't like about Kai, I can't find it in myself to hate it. Because, really, it never stood a chance. Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai is a decent supernatural thriller, with a great protagonist and villain, but ultimately is let down by poorly handled pacing and an ending that is just kind of... stupid. It's passable. It's something I can enjoy. I just wish it wasn't part of Higurashi no naku koro ni. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Oh... so she was never dead to begin with. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog!

            "content": "Television has brought back murder into the home - where it belongs.\r\n~Alfred Hitchcock, 1969\r\nIt's a rare occurrence when an anime (or any TV show) is able to hold thrill and fear in a perfect balance. For starters, the show has to reach a certain standard of quality in order for the viewer to feel either of those two emotions, but in addition, the series must be able to switch between excitement and terror with ease. But maintaining that equilibrium is in fact possible, and such is the beauty of the Higurashi world as a whole.\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai (Often abbreviated Higurashi Kai) isthe second installment in the Higurashi set, and  the predominant purpose of this anime is to provide resolution for some of the unanswered mystery arcs in its prequel, Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni. Many people review the two shows as a single anime, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I don't have any intention of merging two full-length anime into a single, 50-episode conglomerate.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I'm going to assume you've already seen the first season of Higurashi, because if you haven't, you should probably watch that before considering Kai.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, let's get get on with the review.\\n\\n\r\n~the STORY~\\n\r\nMany people (myself included) were left somewhat unsatisfied with the closure of the first season. It just begged too many questions that were left unresolved. How could such adorable, innocent schoolchildren become psychotic killers at the flip of a switch? What were the unforeseen consequences of each killing? And mst importantly, who was the grand mastermind behind the murders of Showa 58? As the only two who have witnessed the endless cycle of June 1983 and as the only two who know the truth behind the shrine god's curse, Furude Rika (nipaa~) and her celestial companion Hanyuu take the reins as the main characters of Higurashi Kai as they venture to expose the true cause of the murders, and more importantly, how to escape from the endlessly repeating vicious circle.\\n\\n\r\nIt is impossible to sum up Higurashi Kai's plot in one word, but if I were to try, I would say it's  \"satisfying.\" Over the course of 24 episodes, the viewer builds a powerful empathy and love for Rika and Hanyuu. Watching them struggle, watching them uncover dark secrets, and watching them have a good time in the game club all helps to increase this feeling of devotion for the main characters. Thus, each time they overcome a major obstacle, it is immensely gratifying. This is a device used in many popular mystery books and movies, but I have to say: It works quite well.\\n\\n\r\n~ART 'n SOUND~\\n\r\nMost of the time, I put art, animation, and sound into three different categories. For this anime and this anime only, I will group them because they all contribute to a feeling of uneasiness the viewer will eventually develop. The art perfectly portrays cutesy middle/high school students running around, playing games, and having fun, but it portrays each character's psychotic side equally well. An ambient soundtrack further enhances the suspense between what feels like a high school rom-com and a free-for-all killing spree.\\n\\n\r\n~them CHARACTERS~\\n\r\nAnother qualm I have about the first Higurashi series was its total lack of any kind of character development, with the exception of Shion and Mion. Each character gets a lot more depth in Kai, and characters with less significance in the first season (such as Satoko's uncle and Miyo Takano) are expanded into major importance.\\n\r\nThe only negative remark I have to say about the characters, and the only negative remark I have to say about the whole series in general, is the unwavering resolve of each character. Nobody really changes over the course of 24 episodes, so people became somewhat predictable. But each character is explained in such depth, I could probably forgive it.\\n\\n\r\n~Higurashi Kai: OVERALL~\\n\r\nThis is the rare breed of anime that almost touches absolute perfection. If you haven't seen this yet, watch it now!\\n\\n\r\nOne of only three anime I have ever given a perfect 10/10.\\n\\n\r\n~Dechie",

            "content": "For years I thought that Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, and it's sequel, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai were among the best Anime I had ever seen. This is in fact the general consensus, that Higurashi is an amazing Anime and it has garnered much praise over the last few years. \r\nI'm here to tell everyone that I, and everyone else, could not have been more wrong about the Higurashi series. When you look at it on it's own, you may see a wonderful story full of drama, comedy, suspense and mystery, but in actuality, you are only seeing a small portion of thestory.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is adapted from a Visual Novel, and for years the English speaking Anime community didn't have any way to read it, since it wasn't translated, so they knew of the Anime (and perhaps the Manga), but had never read the VN. But now the VN is completely translated and can be read by anyone, and it should be read, because after I completed the VN, I realized just how bad the Anime adaptation really is.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, the Anime adaptations of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, and it's sequel, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, are a travesty. Roughly 1/4 of the entire story from EACH arc are cut completely, and there are numerous other changes and cuts from what they DID manage to include in the Anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThis adaptation is virtually devoid of the superb character development and storytelling present in the VN, not to mention cutting vital clues that prevent the mystery from being solved. In fact, some people don't even realize that Higurashi is a mystery at all, most people think that it's a suspense or horror series, a series about \"lolis killing people\", when in fact it is a mystery meant to be solved, as well as an emotional drama that the Anime completely fails to capture.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, I would almost say that the Anime of Higurashi isn't an adaptation at all, but a joke that DEEN created to make fun of the original material and showcase their own inability to create a proper adaptation. Some parts of the series don't even feel like the same story because so much is changed and cut, and though you may not notice these issues when watching the Anime by itself, by reading the VN it is made clear just how little DEEN actually cared about this series.\\n\\n\r\nPutting the hackjob of a story adaptation aside for a moment, let's talk about the other aspects of the series. The original VNs had a spectacular soundtrack, especially Kai's, but DEEN decided to just remove ALL of the VN music and replace it with much worse music, often opting to just keep things silent half the time anyway. In fact, the ONLY good part about the Anime, and by association, the only bad part about the VN, is the character design and animation.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have watched the Higurashi Anime, you have never experienced Higurashi. You essentially wasted your time watching it because you missed huge chunks of story and character development, and if for some reason that doesn't bother you, then you are an idiot and should go back to watching your Naruto crap where you can turn off your brain and not care or notice that the story is shit. \\n\\n\r\nIf it bothers you that you've never truly experienced Higurashi, or you've never actually watched the Anime in the first place, I strongly urge you to read the Visual Novel, and forget that the Anime even exists.\\n\\n\r\nOh and by the way, the Umineko no Naku Koro ni Anime is shit too, that doesn't exist either, read the VN.",

            "content": "If you haven't seen the first season, Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni, \"Kai\" will make almost as little sense to you without watching the first one as the watching the first one without watching Kai afterwards does. For those who loved the gore in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, I'm sorry to tell you, that if you were looking forward to another twenty-four episodes of eviscerated adolescence and chopped loli then you are in for a disappointment; Kai focuses primarily on giving the viewers a satisfying answer and summarization of the questions and mysteries aroused in the first season. \r\nEvery once in a great while,there's an anime that completely alters your perception of what constitutes a \"masterpiece.\" For me, one of those anime was Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni (Kai). The greatest problem found within the walls of any mystery conceived is that within those boundaries there must be an answer, a solution to that mystery. In Higurashi's 1st season, the plot strung us along, sliding us down the merry chute of deceit greased with the blood of torn up moe archetypes - shooting us out the other end so fast that there was a good chance you could have missed the clues to what was building up just beyond the ending credits. Obfuscation was Higurashi's greatest strength. It's a show that gets you asking the wrong questions so you end up missing the obvious right answers. Kai moves slightly away from that and focuses primarily on on the brief theories on the Hinamizawa syndrome touched upon in the first series and runs with and adds considerably too that, making for story which is much more \"external\" in nature. The 2 seasons function like a mystery followed up by a solution. Higurashi is a real feat in many regards. First, lots of deep thinking and meticulous planning has clearly gone into the show. What we've got out of it is an outstandingly well written plot that\u2019s both elaborate and almost completely seamless with hardly any plot-holes. While there are some things that this sequel lacks (nothing can be perfect right?), it does is bring the mystery full circle, and it also gives the audience the answers that we barely got a mere hint of in the first series. Pacing is not an issue and to call it riveting would not be an understatement. The characters remain and the individuality and sympathies that the first season built up remain strong even without the focus they received in the first season. Even when the antagonist is revealed they are not taken for granted and receive characterization and a back story that make them perhaps one of the most sympathetic and interesting villains that anime has to offer - too evil to support but I found myself not wanting anyone to lose either. The ingenious character development in season 1 followed through into Kai once more. I must mention that, it\u2019s the newly revealed antagonist who is Kai's most fascinating and dynamic character. I've always thought that well rounded and developed antagonists make the most interesting conflicts (I love villains). In Kai we get a character with a deep past and clear motivations, but we\u2019re never annoyed by a plea for sympathy. What we have instead is a genuine character study; the antagonist is evil, but they are motivated by things which are distinctly human (Kind of like Light Yagami from Death Note). \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the animation in Kai was decent, a step-up from the first season. The characters, dark setting, and backgrounds were all beautiful yet sinister, but art was never Higurashi's strong point. The music was needless to say spectacular, with all the tragic, tear-jerking piano pieces. As expected of Kawai Kenji, an amazing composer, although there were some pieces of music that played at times when the music didn't fit in with the scene. As for the openings, they fit in right with the anime, spooky, gloomy, and sinister describes it! Go to youtube and listen to \"Dear You\" on the piano ~ Beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed this series to it's max, but there were some things that disappointed me such as the comic relief being dropped at the most inappropriate of times (too much useless talking). The finale though just amazing, it provides a fitting end to the grand tale of Higurashi no Naku Koro. Higurashi is a true epic and one of the few mystery anime that has a set of solutions that do justice to the initial questions (absolutely genius). Furthermore Higurashi no Naku Koro delves into a deeper theme beyond the front story, regarding human nature, and bonds of friendship/trust. Genius. I conclude this review by recommending those who haven't seen Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai to watch it, for although it does lack the \"violence, gore\" of the first season, it prospers in \"themes, and answers\".",

If you haven't watched it yet - then go and do it right now, before it's too late!\r\n-Story-\r\nThis is the strongest and the most striking point of the whole show. I was puzzled while watching the first season, because most of the events seemed random and somewhat insane: characters murdered each other, resurrected again and kept going mad.But I also enjoyed all the mystery surrounding these events ans even started building up some theories. I was hoping for some answers in the second season, and I got them to the fullest extent. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing this season did straight away was prove, that there was a method through madness of this show. The \"infinite loop\" idea was not really uninspired and new, but it did fit and it explained most of the strange moments. But the thing that amazed me the most was the slowly, but surely unravelling of a big ball of ideas in my head. Do you remember the cake theory? Never eat it at once, or you will hate it eventually. Well, this theory works for these series too. Those pieces of plot which I connected with each other throughout Higurashi kept me watching at the edge of my sit and asking for more. I personally place the conspiracy of Higurashi somewhere near the storyline of Death Note, because the psychological and information warfare near the end of the show was absolutely brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nThe are only two real cons in the way they handled the story of Higurashi. The first is Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. The madness and \"random\" events can really put off some viewers. Thankfully, it didn't happen to me. \\n\\n\r\nSecond con is a somewhat ridiculous way the company of kids won the battle against the whole squad of special forces just by using some traps and a bit of an advanced tactic. Still, this is Japanese show, can't blame them too much, right? \\n\\n\r\nThe viewers were also kept wondering about the origin of Hinamizawa Syndrome, which I feel is the first thing worth explaining.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\nAnother strong point of Higurashi is the way it develops the main characters. All of them have commited some sins, which drove them into the village, but they are trying their best to live happy lives. I began to empathize the MC to the fullest in the second season, when the battle against fate started and most of the backstories were revealed. The only problem was that some characters (mainly Rika and Hanyuu) were still left aside ang quickly captured by sharp-clawed paws of OVA directors. \\n\\n\r\nSome didn't like the series mostly because of all the comedian \"fillers\" in it, but I feel that I enjoyed  it even more because of them and the contrast they made. All the \"quiet before the storm\" episodes were really heartwarming and funny. The scenes, where all the MC started to combine their strength and help each other in their trials, where really well made too.\\n\\n\r\nAnother pro is the development of the antagonist. It was hard for me to watch her struggle in her childhood. Desperate people become the \"Pierrot marching around the stage\" really easily, and this fate didn't pass her by. My feelings about the antagonist are controversal, but at least it's not the typical \"kill them all and get the crown\" villain without any ulterior motives.\\n\\n\r\n-Art- \\n\r\nThe artwork of Higurashi is not bad, but old. Plus, I had to watch the show in 480p. It didn't really spoil the overall enjoyment or anything, though. Characters were happy and cute when they wanted to be, but also really scary and insane at time. This contrast was very well drawn and it created all the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nAll the openings and endings are pretty catchy and they actually fit the atmosphere. The first OP is quite intense and bloody just like the first season, while the second one is more dramatic and calm. I didn't pay much attention to music, but it was changing mood when needed.\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nOverall, I feel that watching all the seasons is indeed worth it because of an amazing storyline and most of the urgent questions answered. I enjoyed Hirugashi a lot and I would advice everyone to watch it, but certainly not as a first title.\\n\\n\r\nQuick summery:\\n\r\n-Story-\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\n+ The \"answering\" second season, which slowly unravelled most of the mysteries.\\n\r\n+/- Madness and random events of the first season.\\n\r\n- No explanation to the origin of the Hinamizawa Syndrome.\\n\\n\r\n-Character-\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\n+ Amazing development of MCs and the sins they commited.\\n\r\n+ Desperate antagonist with sad and depressing backstory.\\n\r\n- Not enough attention to Rika and Hanyuu in the main series.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\n+ Art changing mood when needs be.\\n\r\n+ Bright and well drawn characters.\\n\r\n- Bad quality and overall stale artwork.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\n+ Mood changing.\\n\r\n+ Brilliant OPs and EDs.\\n\r\n- The music is not really that impressive.",

            "content": "This review is based on the sequel to Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni (When They Cry), Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai (When They Cry Solutions). I'm going to not try to spoil this anime, but it's VERY hard not to spoil it. And if you haven't seen the first season of Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni, you might not want to read the rest of this review. \r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai is pretty much the answers to some of the arcs in it's premises. But the main storyline instead of different people at each time, we have one and only one forevery arc, the one and only Rika Furude. That's right, the girl that got the least screentime in the first season. Anyway, the story follows Rika and how each arc goes along, and some of the arcs about herself. The first episode starts off with Akasaka Mamoru with Ooishi going through Hinamizawa which supposedly had a gas leak killing everyone. When they're going through, Akasaka tells Ooishi that these things were told by them by the one and only Rika Furude. Going through more of Hinamizawa, Ooishi finds the only person who lived through the gas leak, everyone's favorite, Rena Ryuguu. When Ooishi talks to Rena about Rika, she also heard the apocalyptic events that ended up being the future as well. After that, the rest of the series is involved with the past, which means this is the only episode that involves with the future. The first arc involves the events with the Higurashi gang before the gas leak. The second arc involves the gang trying to fight for their lives. The last arc is very much like the second one, but just a little different. Trust me, there would be WAY more I would say about the story, but just trying to explain the story can easily spoil the show. Overall I enjoyed the story for Kai, and can be enjoyed by all Higurashi fans.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of Kai resembles the first season very much. The characters and the backgrounds don't change from the first season, so there is nothing much to say about the artwork. I enjoyed the art from the first season, so I couldn't not enjoy the art from the second season. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors and the score for Kai do not change. Though for some reason, I keep on thinking that the core improved from the first season, when pretty much the score didn't even change.  The opening for Kai has more of a dramatic tone than more of a creepy tone as the first season did. The ending theme as well. I did enjoy both the opening and ending themes. The ending in my opinion is better than the first, but the opening in my opinion still can't beat the creepy psychological first opening. Really, nothing has changed, therefore it's hard to talk about this.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in my opinion become much better from the first season. In the first season, I didn't care for Rika, but now, Rika is now one of my favorite anime characters. Rika now in this season has a personality to her, which makes her sparkle. Her thoughts to keep on trying and to never give up makes her memorable, and therefore she tops my list. We do get a new character for the series that accompanies Rika in the last two arcs, Hanyuu. Hanyuu is supposedly following Rika for pretty much the rest of her days until it ends. Hanyuu doesn't get much screen time in Kai, just like Rika did in the first season. Though I do believe Hanyuu is a very memorable character, especially in the last episode. Keiichi does not change that much, and since Kai revolves around Rika, we do not get much Keiichi in Kai. Though in the last two arcs, Keiichi sparkles, just as Rika does. At first I didn't understand why Keiichi was so popular, but now I completely understand. He is very confident and is one of the most caring characters in any anime. Rena isn't crazy this season. But just because she isn't insane, doesn't make her a bad character. In fact, I enjoy Rena more in Kai (Sorry people, but I'm not a big fan of crazy Rena). Rena is more intelligent with the choices she makes, and she cares for everyone, no matter how cute they may be. Mion does not change in Kai. She is still the energetic tomboy that everyone can be idolized by. As for Satoko, she doesn't get really any attention in Higurashi. The first arc has some stuff to do with Satoko, and the second arc, the gang is trying to help her, but even still, she doesn't get screen time. And for Shion fanboys and fangirls, she doesn't appear either :(\\n\\n\r\nNow watching Kai, I thought that I wouldn't enjoy it as much as I would the first season, but Kai proved itself worthy with the last two arcs. The second arc is definitely one of my favorite arcs in almost all the animes I've seen, and the ending to Kai has one of the best endings to the other animes. The first arc was good but didn't stand out. And the first episode made me snooze. But even though, I can't say that I didn't enjoy every second of Kai. If you haven't watched Kai and you've seen the first season, I would strongly recommend Kai to you. I hope it won't disappoint.\\n",

            "content": "Based on the first season, it flows on a explains all the mysteries and the fluidity that the first season lacks. The story focuses around Rika in this season, and her perception into the bizarre killings of the Hinamizawa village on June 30th 1983. Little is known to why the events are happening, and Chiaki Kon does a very good job in replicating the manga version. \r\nThe art is well established. The OP is beautifully done, it uses the images of each of the characters in their darkest states. Again, the darkness of the anime is introduced, and the director does a good job increating that mystique and eerie atmospherel. This is followed by the opening soundtrack \"Naruka no Hana\". The theme song was one of the reasons that I started to watch the anime. The voice actors did a pretty good job at each character (just like in first season). Overall, the sounding is probably best portrayed through in this anime series, as it is creates the atmosphere that really brings out the \"creepyness\" of this series.\\n\\n\r\nThere is quite a bit of character development, in particular, Rika, who becomes the main focus of the anime series. Unlike the first season, the season revolves around her, and we see her grow from a helpless little girl,into a woman of action. All of which is achieved through a simple action of Keiichi Maebara who nudges her forward, and he becomes the idol for her to look up to and subconsciously provides her with courage and hope. Takano Miyo's past is also brought to light and it is shown why she acts the way she does....\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. Not because of the killings, but because of the underlying morals Rika portrays in this season. Unlike the first season, there is much more depth into her character, as well as the fact that she now takes responsibility for her own actions, other than blame others. Given the conditions she faces, it is admirable that she looks forward and urges onward, despite the ghastly consequences she faces if she fails. This is what  kept me going in this anime and what made this anime really beautiful.",

            "content": "I think I could pretty much summarise what was going through people's heads when they watched the first season of Higurashi: what the fuck is up with this show?! The entire main cast, which on the surface appeared the average Joe, developed a serious case of insanity, which would result in a barbaric bloodbath. It made for excellent, yet sometimes nauseating entertainment, yet we still didn\u2019t have a clue on why this messed up stuff was happening. I love a good mystery and that\u2019s exactly what it proved to be. It wasn\u2019t perfect but I hoped that the second season would make the franchise evenbetter. Well there\u2019s good news and there\u2019s bad news. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the good elements first, which is primarily the solution the show provides it audience to the many, many questions. We finally discover whether the curse of Oyashiro is the retribution of a wrathful god who has been killing off the enemies of the village or not. There\u2019s this brilliant plot twist half way through the anime that not only sheds light on this issue, but is just so shockingly unexpected. As for the other mysteries, the answer to why people are going insane, is a little bit far- fetched when you first hear it but in the wider scope of the plot it actually works pretty well. Overall I feel that the answer s that are given makes the first series even better, as I can tell it\u2019s been well thought out and written brilliantly. Everything just slips into place by the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole repeated cycle of time that was used for each of last series\u2019 arcs is present here once again. Not only is it explained why time is in a seemingly endless cycle but it\u2019s actually used better. How it was used last series was basically seeing many of the same events from a different angle or seeing how a different event may have any effect on others we know about. It was all about focusing on different perspectives of the victims or the murderers of the show. It was very good mechanic to the whole first season and I\u2019m happy that Kia has made it even better. Of course most arcs would result in either Rika Furde\u2019 death or the release of a deadly virus, and with Kia, we see Rika trying to prevent this from happening. This brings us to another important observation between the two seasons; the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t read my review for season one, what I really liked about the main cast was that they were just the normal stereotypical anime character and the show had them do the most insane, inhumane things imaginable, usually against one another. Series two doesn\u2019t do this, at least to the extent of torturing and murdering a loli, or cutting corpses into pieces. Heck, the craziest thing we see serial offender Shion do is hit someone with a chair... which they shrug off as if it was nothing. What the show does, and does well is show just each of the main cast is capable of great inner strength, against the odds that seem monstrous or impossible to defeat. A personal highlight of mine was when Satako finally stood up to her abusive uncle and how everyone gives it their all in order to help Rika. And it all happens without excessive violence committed by them. This makes the overall message of the show you must not resort to illegal methods in order to help others, and that everything, to con artists and fate itself can be overturned by the bonds of friendship. Its sounds cheesy, and isn\u2019t even something that\u2019s new to anime. But it does work pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the praise I have for the plot and characters, there\u2019s one major flaw with it; the atmosphere. Now some people may be able to live without it, thanks to the reasons I mentioned above. But fans like me who relished the horror of this show will feel let down. I was on the edge of my seat for almost the entire first season. With Kia I wasn\u2019t, due to the horror just not being present at all. It doesn\u2019t even try to be scary. The show spends too much time uncovering the mystery, for there to be room for this atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I think if you just want some answers, then you will probably really enjoy Higurashi Kia. But if you care more for horror, you will be definitely disappointed. Personally I\u2019 m always going to regard season one as the better series, because it was scary which made it stand out from anime I had seen before.\\n\\n\r\nWell I hope you enjoyed reading this review. Please let me know if you found helpful or if you have any comments on it.\\n",

OMOCHIIKAERI!!!!\r\nYou better hope you don't hear these words in the middle of the night, cause Rena is comin for your booty.\r\n*MILD SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T EVEN TOUCHED THE HIGURASHI SERIES*\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai is the continuation and resolving of the psychological horror mystery/thriller that took moe girls and made them go through the most screwed up and twisted experiences ever. It takes the extremely confusing mystery during the first season and resolves it in a masterful way.\r\nAn amazing sequel to resolve the series with a bang, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai replaces the overwhelming mystery of the first seasonwith extremely intense and unpredictable thriller. I'm serious, the thriller aspect of this series went through the roof with this season. The second season of Higurashi is very different from the first. The story starts to take a more linear shape, and the characters start to settle into specific roles, unlike the first season, which set it all up with confusing and mysterious arcs. All of the mystery that was building up from the first season is truly unraveled in this season, thus if you have watched the first season, watching the second season is basically mandatory for an amazing and thrilling experience.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Extreme thriller, had me at the edge of my seat constantly.\\n\r\n- Characters finally take the experiences of the first season to develop into characters with specific roles. They finally band together as a group, while still keeping in touch with their past selves.\\n\r\n- The resolving of the mysteries within this show was executed beautifully.\\n\r\n- Still has high quality comedy!\\n\r\n- Still has the eerie yet beautiful music and sounds.\\n\r\n- Extremely satisfying ending, loose ends are tied up.\\n\r\n- More character development, even for some of the side characters.\\n\r\n- Still as unpredictable as ever.\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Due to the suspense building up, it had slow pacing.\\n\r\n- Less horror in this show (albeit still pretty gorey). Nowhere near the intense fear of the first season.\\n\r\n- Due to the uniting of the characters, some characters don't shine as much as the previous season, particularly Rena.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nThis season ended the main story line with a bang. The absolutely intense thriller moments near the end of each arc was beautifully done. The mysteries were explored deeply and answered masterfully, with the answers being tied in with the thriller moments. Truly an amazing way to conclude a long and thrilling ride.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe usual, seemingly low budget art as seen from the first season, although actually much smoother and high quality. The simplistic art was there for the illusion of a more light hearted show, which it totally pulled off during the comedic moments. The golden facial expression comedy and the character interactions almost reminded me of Seto no Hanayome, which is a purely comedic parody show. However, the art also supported the eerie and twisted mood of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe new creepy OP is here and the eerie OST is back, and the deafening cicadas are here! The voice actors/actresses pulled of their characters perfectly again, even the newly introduced and highly adorable Hanyuu. The mood change that Rika's voice can express was extremely intense as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe best after school club is back at it. Their amazing comedic skits and character interactions make them one of the most lovable anime squads. This season develops them more and they start to fit their own roles, compared to the first season, where in each arc, someone was the antagonist and someone was the victim. In this season, they band together and use their development from the first season to help each other out, which really makes the arcs of the first season more impactful. All the bloodshed wasn't for nothing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nEach arc was packed full of thriller and excitement. The ending in particular was definitely an amazing way to go, and it left me extremely satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nThe Higurashi series is a must see for horror, mystery, and thriller fans. While there may be a lot to stomach, as there are a lot of episodes, it's definitely worth the watch!\\n\\n\r\nI wonder if you'll watch it kana, kana?",

            "content": "This is the second season to Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni, which you should watch first because it's completely amazing, unlike this.\r\nAs much as I love (and I do mean love) Higurashi, I'm sorry guys, but I just can't blindly give this 9 or 10 just because it follows an incredibly awesome anim&eacute;, in fact, I think I can't give it a good score specifically because of that. The season starts out pretty good, but gradually deteriorates and gets just downright terrible at the end.\r\nThe second season of Higurashi had a lot of issues, a few of which:\r\n- The introduction of Hanyuu was, to thepoint she served, little more than plot manipulation. She didn't feel like a real character at all so much as something they randomly stuck in there to look cute and explain certain aspects of the plot. She could have been much better, but they just chose not to have her be that way.\\n\\n\r\n- Pacing issues. Certain things get too many episodes, while other things feel rushed. \\n\\n\r\n- For how mysterious and screw-with-your-mind the first season is, many truths are revealed far too easily and far too quickly. It almost felt like the author just sort of plopped down the hand of God (no pun intended) and said &quot;Alright, here's what needs to be explained now&quot;. For how beautifully and slowly Higurashi unfurled, this was a real disappointment.\\n\\n\r\n- The last arc. Completely unrealistic and contrived. Nothing more I can say other than I think there's only 1 thing that can redeem this &quot;ending&quot;, and, if the rumors I've heard about the 3rd season are true, then I might need to retract this statement. (Let's just say it may be genius for the same reasons I currently think it's stupid.)\\n\\n\r\nSo, should you watch it? Hell, if you've come this far, might as well. I can't guarantee you'll love it, but at least you'll get some answers.",

I would give this anime the same description as the first season, except as I mentioned in the first seasons' review, this season is much less scary. This season makes everything in the first season make sense, and it makes it all the more exciting to see how everything is put together. I found that in this season it was very easy to relate to the characters' emotions, and it shows the moral of the anime, which happens to be a very strong and meaningfull one.\r\nBoth seasons ofthis show seem very different to one another in some ways, but after you put it all together, it's almost like a puzzle who's pieces fit perfectly.\\n\r\nThough it's scary at times, I'de say that it's really worth it to try and get used to it, as I too was really freaked out by the sort of stuff in this anime, but after I got used to it, it became one of my all time ultimate favorite animes, and if I ever got the chance, I would definately watch it all again.",

            "content": "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai is the resolution to the Higurashi series. Keep in mind that during this review I assume you have seen the first season of Higurashi so some spoilers may come if you haven't seen the first season. Just to warn you.\r\nStory- The story picks up in the usual Higurashi style. It has a full arc until the real story takes place. Then, everything from the first season and previous arc starts to come all together. As things start getting explained. Like who the antagonist possibly could be. New characters pop into the scene to make huge impacts but really aren't\"new\" characters. Everything finally comes together in the final portion and the mysteries are revealed. The reveal of everything and the surprise of the actual truth of the series make this story absolutely fantastic. Then there is the pacing. The pacing makes the show very thrilling at times. It had me at the edge of my seat at times. Unlike the first season (in which everyone pretty much dies every arc), the characters have a chance to escape that fate and you cheer for them. The story knows this full well by now and uses that to its advantage when important events happen. Thus they use suspense to their advantage because you don't know what could happen and it works big time. A con would be that while we are in this suspenseful mood, we are taken out of the action to a flashback. And while it does answer questions and builds character for someone. It takes the viewer out of the mood that was built up from the suspense earlier. The viewer is then left waiting a couple of episodes before it picks back up again. Because it is a mystery and they need to explain things it is not a huge con, but it is noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Same things apply as my previous Higurashi review. The animation may not be the best quality, but its the change in the animation from soft and light to dark and scary really sets it apart as a unique animation style. However, even though it wasn't noticeable right away, the animation did improve slightly. Though it wasn't much to make a difference quality wise. \\n\\n\r\nSound- When I look at sound, nothing background music wise really stood out at me. While the ending song has nice animation and such, the music was a bit lackluster for me there. However, a BIG however, the opening to this show is absolutely fantastic. \"Naraku no Hana\" is the reason I rate the music so high. Its motion and beat really set you up for the show. In other words, like the first opening, it SOUNDS like Higurashi's resolution if wrapped up into song. The meaning in the words are there and the key fits the show to a tee. I listened to it every time for each episode and it always set the tone perfectly as good music should.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- The characters that were explored in the first season come back, and now that we know them we don't need to spend as much time on them. This helps the story progress very nicely. However, there was one out of the group of kids that didn't get almost any background and was left as mysterious. That's right, Rika's character gets explored and it is great. She is one of my favorite characters in all of anime. I can't go into detail about it without spoiling anything so I won't say anything more. That's not all, even characters who you thought might not be important come back and have huge roles. And there characters get backgrounds and developments too. From Antagonists to side characters, we get to see some important background and development. Decisions they had to make that caused them to be there and why they are there. Decisions that humanize and make us able to under stand actions that we would see as horrific. And the characters that do not get essential backgrounds do not need it. Except for Hanyuu. A bit of more development or flashback on Hanyuu's side would have been nice, but it was fine as is.  The characters are amazing, that's all I can say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- As I said earlier this show had me on the edge of my seat most of the time. I enjoyed it very thoroughly. When all the pieces come together to make sense it is very pleasing that they all make sense. There may be a few unanswered questions, but none that particularly impact the show in a big way. Anyways I have watched this show multiple times and I still will do so. Its blend of story and character is something that I thought was absolutely great.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi is one of my favorite animes of all time. So to conclude I don't have much to say than I already have said. Higurashi Kai is a great resoltion to the series. However, it does not end it. That's Higurashi no Naki Koro ni Rei's job.",

            "content": "\"Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai\" is the second series of Higurashi, and it takes over where the previous series left off. Basically, if you watched the first series then you must watch this one too in order to fully understand just what is going in the world of Higurashi. \r\nThe story gets even better, but I'm not suppose to write any spoilers so I'll only say a couple of things about it. If you thought the first series was twisted, then this series will (pardon me) mindfuck you. It's completely twisted, it will leave you sobbing in a corner questioning your sanity. But isn'tthis what Higurashi really is about? I mean, it's not so much about violence or gore, even though there are a lot of violent and gory elements in it. But in reality it's about drama, tragedy and sorrow. This anime is supposed to make you cry, not feel scared. \\n\\n\r\nArt, well I'm not really going to expand on that. But I gave it a 10/10 because for the stadards of 2007 (the year Kai came out) the graphics are pretty good. Nothing more to add here.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, brilliant job done on the music, it fits perfectly with the places and situations in Higurashi. We have a murder scene, and a creepy music starts playing. We have a sad scene, and sad music kicks in. Same goes for comedy, a slight bit of romance, and so forth. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters amazing as always. You've learned a lot about them from the first series but that was only a fraction of their real personalities and beliefs. So you can't really predict what they'll do next. It's that kind of mystery and suspence that will keep you hooked to this series right until the end. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? I'd give it a thousand out of 10 if it was possible. As I said in my first review, written about the first series, I don't remember a time when an anime had me so interested in it right from the start. In this series, it's double the fun. Many things are explained but at the same time, many more mysteries await you. It trully is mind-boggling.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series, and the whole Higurashi series is a must watch for every true anime fan. Because if you haven't seen this, you're missing out on one hell of a ride. \\n",

            "content": "\"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai\", when compared to many other animes of the genre, it stands out from the crowd and pulls off something truly unique in a gruesome yet satisfying way. If you haven't seen \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\", do not watch Kai yet. With that being said, let's begin the review. This is my first review, so feedback is appreciated. This review is absolutely 100% spoiler free, so you can read it without being spooked. Also, this was written on my Wii U gamepad, so please excuse my mistakes.\r\n Story - 10/10\r\n The story of Higurashi is certainly a unique onewhen compared to other anime. It is split into different scenarios, or arcs. There are the question arcs and the answer arcs. It takes place in Hinamizawa, a small village in Japan. It is June, 1987, and revolves around 6 (including Shion) schoolfriends, and their daily fun. At least, that is what the show wants the audience to believe. On first sight, one would believe that it is a peaceful town, and the 6 friends are just having lighthearted fun. That is not the case at all. The history of the town is soon learned by the protagonist, and each character is involved in it in some way. Every year, on the night of the cotton drifting festival, one person will die, and one goes missing. This cycle repeats forever, and usually involves many characters dying. This is the very basic plot of the first season. In Kai, it shows Rika Furuude's endless struggle of trying to defy fate and stop the endless June of terror.\\n\\n\r\n Art - 8/10\\n\r\n The art and animation of the show is nothing special, it is average. Although, in Kai, it seems the animation was improved marginally from the first season, but again, it is still nothing special, and doesn't stand out that much from other animes of the genre.\\n\\n\r\n Sound - 10/10\\n\r\n The fucking sound. Holy shit. The soundtrack has to be one of the best OSTs I personally have ever heard, each song fits the mood amazingly well. And then there's the OP. Jesus fucking christ on a stick is the OP of Kai phenomenal. It very easily and amazingly shows Rika's struggle, and puts you into a false sense of security at the beginning of the opening, demonstrating very well what the show is capable of. The ED is great, too.\\n\\n\r\n Characters - 10/10\\n\r\n The characters are done very fucking well. One second Rena will be laughing with everyone, and the next second she will be slaughtering everyone without hesitation. This, again brings us back to the false sense of security I was talking about. The characters seem so out of place in the show upon first glance, but after watching the show, you can really realise how well they were executed. So noice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - tenouttaten\\n\r\n I'm sure many will disagree with me on this rating, but this show took me on a fucking swood journey that I never wanted to end. thx guise 4 tha review r8 5 stars also my dog has cancer so pls gif the spaghetti",

            "content": "~ You cannot oppose fate, no matter how much you deny it . . . ~\r\nAs a continuation to the particularly \"open\" ending of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai - or \"Kai\" as i will refer to it from now on to save time, was everything, and more than i was expecting. At a glance, i would definitely describe it as a thrilling journey. It's one that puts all of the confusion that may have followed you from the first season at bay. The addition of Kai has for me, as i expect for many, made the whole storyfeel infinitely more wholesome, well-rounded, and immersive.\\n\r\nKai is nothing less than a masterpiece in my opinion, and here's why...\\n\\n\r\nWhereas in the first season, i think its safe to say that Higurashi's reputably abstract methods of spontaneous timeline-shifting storytelling, and the way in which the show seemed to skip like a broken record between each arc, acted somewhat as a limiting factor enveloping the relatability to, and the audience's attachment to the cast. After watching the first season alone, i didn't realize this as much, but by comparison, Kai is nothing less than revolution for the franchise. It dispels the comparatively shallow (not sufficiently elaborated upon)  story aspects of the first season, removes the show's distancing in the name of prolonged character attachment - understandably caused by its overly unpredictable nature, defies the show's reputation as nothing other than  \"creepy\", and adds to the presentation: a greatly more personal and dramatic feeling and depth - that will blow your mind.\\n\\n\r\nFor those curious, Kai most certainly retains its \"Higurashi charm\"...\\n\r\nThe story's perspectives change frequently, and occasionally so do its \"timelines\" as i refer to them. This is one of the franchise's signature approaches. It's a sudden and disorienting one, but Kai makes this work especially well - giving the viewer a comprehensive and intimate understanding of the plot; while not drowning out the more delicate aspect of character depth - which ultimately leads me to believe that Kai's balance of storytelling and character attachment, is unrivaled.\\n\\n\r\nKai is a REALLY dramatic season of 24 episodes. By comparison to the first season, it's much harder hitting and meaningful (though i distinctly remember episode 1 being rather dull).  Despite my psychotic appreciation for the torture and violence aspects of the first season, whereas Kai still obviously incorporates it's insane levels of unpredictability, psychotic and often violent instability of some characters... The way in which the show conveys drama, matures significantly, sometimes even making use of dramatic irony to make Kai a genuinely engaging, almost manipulative experience. This without a doubt will keep you on the edge. It works to maintain suspense, tension and emotional friction where appropriate, while allowing you to be overwhelmed more so by the story, the actual scale and reality of what you thought was going on, as opposed to just the immediate scope, or relying solely on \"freaking out\" the viewers. This justifies my reasoning for Kai being a much deeper pool of entangled, conflicting and genuinely engaging hardship - precisely the way a dramatic story should be presented.\\n\\n\r\nI would go as far as saying that Kai escalates far beyond what any \"Pre-Kai\" audience could predict. It takes drama to a whole new level (something i can't stress enough), and utilizes its time/perspective-shifting style to its fullest effect. It rapidly becomes an unforgettable, all-out WAR - a story of conflicting ideals, betrayal, and unity. With the addition of Kai's flashbacks to further the audience's understanding of the whole premise, Kai, to me, \\n\r\nappears as a masterpiece.\\n\r\nIn many ways, it has been the solution the Higurashi franchise,\\n\r\nand alike the first season, it will ALWAYS take you off-guard...\\n\\n\r\nThe audiovisuals for anyone wanting to know, are on par with the first season's distinct, high standards, and so, although i liked the original full version OP more than this one's full version OP, there's really nothing to loose. An epiphany of understanding and appreciation for the Higurashi franchise awaits you, they did indeed, save the BEST for season 2...\\n\r\nYou would be a FOOL not to watch on.\\n\\n\r\n~ I must repeat. Until fate is broken . . . ~",

            "content": "A todos los que vieron esta serie, les har\u00e9 una review en habla hispana, porque estoy algo quemado despues de terminar esta serie (la har\u00e9 de las dos temporadas, porque no tengo ganas de calentarme la cabeza).\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro Ni, es un anime del que habia oido hablar mucho, pero ni sab\u00eda de su tem\u00e1tica ni sus cr\u00edticas, pero por un amigo decid\u00ed verla. All\u00e1 vamos:\r\n-Argumento: Le he puesto un 9, porque a pesar de que es un planteamiento que ya he visto en muchos sitios, le saca mucho jugo al argumento, se recalca mucho el \"efecto mariposa\" (una peque\u00f1a acci\u00f3n puede desencadenar unevento de mayor relevancia en el futuro). Sin embargo, la estructura de arcos es en Koro Ni un poco confusa, pero cuando entiendes el argumento, se comprende que no hay una manera mejor de hacerlo. Y entonces es cuando puede crear adicci\u00f3n... Koro ni Kai, por otra parte, es m\u00e1s absorbente en ese sentido porque ya entiendes la historia y se resuelven muchas preguntas que quedaban en la primera temporada.\\n\\n\r\n-Dise\u00f1o: Un 8, porque a pesar de que el dibujo es bastante bonito, tiene unas cagadas de QUALITY impresionantes (l\u00e9ase ojos bizcos/descolocados, cuerpos desproporcionados, personajes que levitan...) pero por suerte no son demasiado grandes.Por suerte.\\n\\n\r\n-Sonido: Bien, bastante de acuerdo; sabiendo que es un anime de misterio, le queda bastante bien. Koro Ni tiene mejor banda sonora, sin embargo, que la segunda temporada (el ED de Koro ni Kai no me gusta en absoluto...). Los seiyuus son correctos en su papel (algunos mejor que otros, pero en general bien).\\n\\n\r\n-Personajes: Aunque algunos son bastante planos (como por ejemplo Keiichi, que quieras que no, en todos los arcos salvo el primero, siempre acaba haciendo lo mismo y pensando de la misma manera), otros reciben mucho m\u00e1s protagonismo, cosa que est\u00e1 bien, para tratar de descentrar al espectador y aumentar m\u00e1s el suspense, como Rika o Satoko. En particular Rika es un personaje que me ha gustado mucho, todo tengo que decirlo: su cambio en la forma de pensar es bastante l\u00f3gico...\\n\\n\r\n-Disfrute: Un 8, aunque tengo que puntualizar que las dos temporadas son animes que no conviene ver muchos episodios en mucho tiempo, al final algunos arcos largos se te acaban atragantando.\\n\\n\r\n-En general: un 6. La gente que haya leido el an\u00e1lisis entero dir\u00e1: \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 le pone un 6 a pesar de las notas que le ha puesto al resto de apartados?\\n\\n\r\nPara no hacer spoilers, dir\u00e9 que al terminar el episodio 23 de Koro ni Kai, pensaba ponerle un 9 (a la segunda temporada, la segunda tiene un 7 en mi lista). En los \u00faltimos 10 minutos del ultimo capitulo le he bajado 3 puntos de lo falso que me ha parecido el final.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni (+Kai) es uno de los pocos animes que he tenido el placer de ver, y que a pesar de haberme gustado, me veo en la obligacion de calificar mal.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nAfter having a very interesting and pretty damn messed up first season we are left with a lot of questions so hopefully season 2 would be able to fill in the gaps which it does and ends the story fantastically.\r\nThe story continues with our group of characters from Hinamizawa who are trying to break the cycle of death in this village while also trying to find the true mastermind behind these evil scheme's.\r\nGoing into season 2 what I was hoping to get was all of the answer's because season 1 will leave you confused with some idea of whats going on and luckilyseason 2 completely fills in the dots, we learn a lot of things like the curse of Oyashiro is actually some kind of Virus that turns people into paranoiac maniac's and the people who kept dying after the cotton drifting festival were the ones behind everyone dying in the village in some of the arcs.\\n\r\nWe find out that the village of Hinamizawa is really a quarantined place because all of the residents have a disease or parasite that is pretty much seen as the curse of Oyashiro and the government set up a special research facility so they can study the effects of the virus and find a cure for it.\\n\r\nThe second season really shifts from being a gorey, horror like show to being a mysterious action type thriller because even though there are still anthology arcs in this series they are a lot longer as our group of characters do start to put the pieces together and actually fight back true it takes them a couple of attempts, but they get there in the end and this is what I like a lot about the second season because instead of being another season where the kids kill each other again we actually get to see a better relationship between the characters and that the life they are living is so much bigger than what they think.\\n\r\nI really liked the ending too because after seeing these characters die so often you feel glad that they actually got a happy ending plus they seemed like good and fun people so in a way they deserved the victory they got.\\n\\n\r\nThere is actually some development between the main roster of characters because during the first season we usually saw them kill each other along with bits of comedy showing their friendship, but this season really builds upon that as we see them work together to defeat an enemy that has been killing them so many times and the way they defeat the bad guys was absolutely amazing makes me think if these kids join the army the enemy would be fu*ked.\\n\r\nAside from fighting bad guys there was a point where we see these friends come together to protect one of their own because at some point Satoko's uncle comes home and starts abusing her, but unlike in season 1 where Keiichi kills him they actually use every ounce of their power to make the government see what's going on and manage to save her which shows in this season that teamwork, determination and patience are more effective than just quickly killing someone.\\n\r\nAnother thing is that during the first season we thought that Keiichi is the MC, but season 2 actually reveals that the true MC is actually Rika which was actually a surprising twist and does make sense since she along with Hanyuu have been turning back time so they can repeat the same timespan so they can break the cycle and she is the queen carrier of the virus itself meaning that she keeps everyone in the village under control and they'll lose control if they leave her presence which is why she also ends up mysteriously dying sometimes in a gruesome fashion, you also get to see the development in her character as she has experienced this timespan of events so many times that she has lost hope until she eventually starts getting closer to the answer where she gets her determination back.\\n\r\nThere are some characters who had minor roles in the first season actually become much bigger characters thanks to the reveal of their true nature along with a new character to help turn the tables.\\n\r\nHanyuu is the new character that is introduced this season, she is actually a deity and is possibly the real Oyashiro, but she is actually much kinder and cuter than you think since she resembles a young girl about Rika's age and tends to make weird noises when she feels nervous or uncomfortable, despite this she believes that Rika and the others can break the cycle so they can finally live a peaceful life.\\n\r\nKyousuke Irie is the villages local doctor, but really he is actually a scientist who is studying the effect of the virus so he can find a cure, but unlike most of the others on the project he actually cares about the villagers and the kids and eventually helps them defeat the enemy.\\n\r\nJirou Tomitake is a photographer who frequently visits Hinamizawa and actually ends up being one of the victims during the cotton drifting festival, but it is revealed he is actually a bodyguard who works for the same organisation that Irie does until he decides to switch sides and help the kids defeat the organisation.\\n\r\nMiyo Takano is a nurse at the local clinic with Doctor Irie and ends up being another victim during the cotton drifting festival, but it is revealed she is actually the mastermind behind everything and the reason she does this is to prove her grandfathers research is actually real, but everyone thought it was nonsense so she is out for revenge to prove it that the virus is real and she'll even go so far to kill everyone in the village to make sure it is proven real, apparently she also had a horrible childhood since her parents died in a bus accident and she was sent to live at an orphanage where she and the other kids were treated poorly until she attempted to escape which is when she realised what her true destiny was and she was eventually adopted by her grandfather.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle in this season does feel more cleaned up compared to the first because in the first season it was actually quite difficult to see the characters eye colours yet in this season they definitely stand out more plus the design of the characters looks better too just by looking at the female characters is a clear giveaway.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't really any horror in this season since it has become more of a mystery thriller true people still die, but not in a terrifying way more like a mysterious way so pretty much it has become one big mystery which it is really and there is even a good amount of action too especially in the final arc where our group of characters prepare for the final battle which was actually pretty damn good, it was very clever guerrilla style warfare and it shows that these kids have amazing teamwork and shouldn't be messed with.\\n\r\nI also like how it delves a lot into the whole Oyashiro curse and making it some kind of virus which makes sense how it became a curse in the first place and why this village is secluded from the rest of the country because of this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a fantastic end to a mysterious story that was at first terrifying, but really gripping as the more answers came to light the more the mystery was starting to make sense so I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good mystery/horror fest.",

            "content": "Higurashi definitely had a lot of potential.  It started out strong the beginning (including first season), with suspenseful mystery, horror, and character development all being deftly woven together.  The main problem I have with Higurashi is the ending of season 2.  After slowly unraveling the mystery in a masterful display of storytelling, the anime fails to deliver a satisfying end, a powerful conclusion to the climax.  But first let's talk about what Higurashi does well.\r\n1) The use of different arcs and timelines really adds depth to the mystery.  It is also done well so that the audience is able tounderstand the different motivations and backstory of each character within the arcs which leads to more character development and holistic view of the plot itself.\\n\r\n2) The dynamics of Keichii's group of friends also help to make the audience more invested in the characters themselves.  The characters themselves allow us to feel emotions such as sorrow, happiness, pity, and adoration all the while being encased within the theme of horror.\\n\r\n3) The plot itself is interesting and well thought out.  Can't say the same for most mystery/horror genres.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the ending was a major disappointment which made me drop what could have been an 8-9 anime to a low 7.  This is because\\n\r\n1) Plausibility.  Suspense of disbelief is critical to most anime of the horror genre, but it is the sudden change in realistic tendencies this show exhibits that makes it not only unbelievable but also fake.  The ending is supplemented by a bunch of lucky coincidences (such as a certain person suddenly showing up), the town suddenly all decides to believe Rika's story even though they never did in the past, and MOST of all, the way Keiichi's group of students was able to take out a whole squad of highly trained elite guards is simply preposterous.  The anime put a lot of thought into making things seem reasonable in S1 and beginning of S2 so I don't understand why that needed to change at the very end.\\n\r\n2) Killing.  Higurashi spends 1.5 seasons making the viewers absolutely despise certain characters such as the Yanmainu and Takano.  In the previous episodes they had no problem showing gruesome depictions of the Yanmainu and Takano killing children and massacring innocent.  But all of a sudden towards the ending when the tables flip, none of our good protagonists are allowed to kill the evil hit squad or antagonist.  I think the best example of this is when Kasai and Shion are literally holding AK-47s and shooting at a group of unarmed Yamainu yet NO ONE DIES.  Or when Kasai decides to spare a bunch of Yamainu and simply knock them out even though he knows they will regain consciousness and try to kill the children. \\n\r\n Or when Asakawa has a golden opportunity to kill the ringleader of the Yamainu but decides to purposefully miss his punch and allow him to escape instead.  This doesn't make a lot of sense to me ESPECIALLY when the author was perfectly fine showing the gore and killings of innocents in the previous episodes...  To maintain consistency, I think a) Lots if not all of the evil Yanmainu hit squad should have been killed b) Takano should not have had a happy ending.\\n\\n\r\nConsistency is the key.  The show itself is not consistent in terms of what should be possible and shouldn't and also fails to be consistent when it comes to 'death' which made the ending exceptionally cringe-worthy -an unfortunate outcome given how promising the anime started out.",

Putting the two seasons together is really what makes this anime special.\r\nI don't want this review to be super long because I already made a review for season 1 without watching season 2. So basically this time around, everything bad I said about this anime in my first review, is the opposite of what I think now. It was the questions in season 1 that left me totally hungryfor more and full of complaints, but in this season, everything was wrapped up and finished off a great anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was truly a big puzzle but once put together, it was beautiful.",

I really don't like saying this but its really true, this season is why you watch the show. Watching the first season and not this you really just think this is some sadists project seeing kids brutally murder each other over and over again. Murder mysteries have a hard time telling stories in my opinion because you need enough of a cast and a good premise to be able to handle the story well with abig enough cast to not fully narrow it down. Even if you were able to narrow a certain character down, the reasoning for the actions was well foreshadowed and revealed in a great way. This season delivers in spades with a fantastic antagonist and an explanation as to why everything in S1 is the way it is without losing itself in its own story.",

            "content": "After watching both seasons of Higurashi, I personally liked the first season better than this, because I felt Kai was almost too.. fluffy and emotional.  However, both seasons of this anime were great.  I will warn anyone wishing to watch this, however I'm sure if you watch Kai you have seen the first one, that there is a fair amount of gore, blood, and violence in this anime.  Don't watch it if you're sensitive to those things.\r\nLooking back at the first season, nothing seemed to make sense.  However, in Kai, the events that happen in Hinamizawa slowly start to come togetherand make sense, a little at a time.  And once the puzzle is complete and all answers have been given, I can promise you will not be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nAs in the first season, the artwork is not the most amazing I've seen.  However, it is fairly well-done.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and other sounds in this season of Higurashi are like the first seasons; same voice actors, same background music, etc.  The only things to have changed are the opening and ending themes, which don't add as much to the creepiness as the first season's themes did, but they help to shed light on one of the main protagonists (Rika) after analyzing it.  \\n\\n\r\nHigurashi is an anime that I feel was meant to be analyzed.  It may not have a lot of obvious symbolism within it, but it definitely shows what can happen to people when belief turns into obsession, which turns into fear.  Fear can drive people to do crazy things, as Higurashi makes painfully obvious.  Kai, however, is a bit lighter on the violence, as it mainly only answers the first season brought to light.\\n\\n\r\nAlso in this season, Rika's personality seems to be a bit more serious, distant, and matured.  Hanyuu, a new supporting/main character, is also introduced, and helps to solve the mystery of Hinamizawa.\\n\\n\r\nAlone, Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni KAI is not as amazing as its predecessor.  Together, they make a great series for people, of a mature audience, mind you, to enjoy and rewatch again to analyze the symbolism and other things present in Higurashi.",

Granted, yes this series can get extremely bloody at times, but, honestly, it isn't nearly as bad as other shows, like elfen lied.\r\nSTORY 10: I love the story of this show, some mystery shows, it's easy to guess the mystery, but this show makes the task extremely more difficult than the average show. The story goes in directions where, if not for a SOLID story, it could become extremely dumb.\r\nART 8: Yes, the art isn't Attack on Titan, Kara no Kyoukai level, but with the creepy vibe this show may give off attimes, the art, for some odd reason, makes it even creepier, and with the in depth facial features at the EXTRA creepy times, the art just fits.\\n\\n\r\nI won't dive into everything but I love ALL the characters, you care for most, if not all, of the characters, there's even a semi romance built in this show, that is excellent because it doesn't take any from the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I love this show, it amazing. What kept me from watching this show for sooooo long was the idea of watching an overly bloody show, but that's not what this is, it's an extremely well made mystery, and if there's a show that most resembles this show, surprisingly it's the other masterpiece series STEINS; GATE\\n\\n",

            "content": "Anime: Higurashi no Naku koro ni Kai\r\nTitle: Losing faith in this series.\r\nAbout the Anime: It is the year 1983; and in the village of Hinamizawa, on the night of the cotton drifting festival and in the days following it, a series of deaths occurs. The only hope for the village and its inhabitants is the shrine maiden Furude Rika who, with the help of her invisible partner Hanyuu, is able to travel back in time and alter the events that led to disaster. Unfortunately, regardless of what changes are made, each voyage ultimately ends with the death of Rika and many of her friends. Butwhen Rika\u2019s friends start remembering things that happened to them in previous worlds and take steps to avoid the same outcomes, Rika realizes that their chances of survival have never been better. Can she really challenge and defeat fate itself?\\n\\n\r\nStory 4/10: Imagine everything Higurashi no Naku Koro ni was not, and you've got Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai. While Higurashi Kai certainly ties up a number of much needed loose strings causing incoherency issues within the first season, it ultimately degrades the series into meaningless tripe. It seems that the first season followed the original games/manga to the tee, but the second takes on extremely, and I emphasize extremely, watered down adaptations of the original storyline's ending. There is no gore or horror present save for perhaps one or two very light scenes, and the violence is toned down substantially as well, as most of what's present is almost comical in nature.\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I was immensely disappointed with Higurashi Kai, as it ended exactly like most anime intended for young children rather than an honorable, intellectual dramatic masterpiece. Save for perhaps one or two minor incidents, all the duplicitous aspects of the main cast of characters' personalities vanish, and it becomes a real chore to convince yourself you're watching the same show. The final two \"answer\" arcs also happen to be twice the length of the prior six arcs in season one, and are subsequently packed full of filler-esque material which really causes the series to drag in many places - completely opposite of the first season, where constant angst and tension kept you on the edge of your seat and constantly looking over your shoulder while you watched.\\n\r\nEnding and conclusion aside, the sole purpose of Higurashi Kai is to provide the viewer with the story behind everything that occurs in the first season, and on that note it succeeds. Rika takes a much more central role in the second season, explaining many of her mysterious talents such as her vast score of knowledge and her prophetic capabilities; which, in essence, explains who Oyashiro-sama is and what his curse entails with rather great detail. Again, though, the enormous, anti-climactic ending dwarfs the importance of such revelations, as it sucks the very life out of the drama they were supposed to be explaining. While it provides closure, this closure is quite poor, and as such I have a hard time swallowing the series as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 6/10: As far as color vibrancy goes, Higurashi Kai got a substantial boost in quality, but that's about the only noticeable difference in quality. I made a point not to increase the animation score, though, since the total lack of dramatic emphasis took away the first season's exemplary use of facial expressions to convey morbid atmospheres. The additions really didn't do much for me, especially with the huge abundance of stills in most of Higurashi Kai's action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: Without a doubt, my favorite aspect of Higurashi Kai is its second, absolutely superb opening theme. Aside from that, though, the musical score remains virtually identical as the first season, and the voice actors again do a great job, though their roles are made less intensive.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10: I was really quite flustered with how the characters panned out. For obviously having severe paranoia issues, Keiichi seems perfectly normal for most of Higurashi Kai, a far cry from the neurotic xenophobe who has quite a difficult time distinguishing reality between the varying Himizawa worlds in the first season; Rena's random, sporadic violent tendencies disappear entirely, and I hardly see her lift a finger during the first half of the series; Shion displays one instance of her blood thirst, but it's tamed rather quickly and her character immediately seems to revert after with no future signs; the list goes on. The characters simply didn't carry the same feel, and that really gave me pause when trying to rationalize them in the context of the second season. In the first season each of the characters suffered from very fragile and delicate personality problems, and the fact that these problems cease to exist in the latter arcs is simply baffling.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5.2/10: Unfortunately, because of how Higurashi's first season pans out, Higurashi Kai is a must watch to understand the progression of the story. Perhaps I'm overreacting a bit to how much I disliked Higurashi Kai, as I did enjoy the first fourteen episodes, but the last arc was simply atrocious. All in all a settling sequel to the first season, but don't expect to have your brain played with in any sinister fashion - you'll just end up utterly disappointed.\\n\r\n~WhiteBakemono",

            "content": "I'll be including stuff from the first season in this review, but I'll try my best to limit spoilers.\r\nFrom face-value, Higurashi looks like any innocent slice of life. Hell, I thought that the first time I started watching it. But the shockers came - oh they came with a force that will have you wondering if maybe you shouldn't leave your bedroom door open before you go to bed. \r\nThe story in the first season, although horrifying, initially confused me. It always had a sense of, \"Oh my freaking God! What the hell am I watching?!\" to, \"... Wait, didn't they die a very gruesomedeath in the last episode?\" \\n\\n\r\nI'm not kidding. Most of the first season, I wondered why the series kept telling different stories. I always felt like I was missing the bigger picture. I never put much thought into anime. Usually, I just sit back and enjoy the ride. But Higurashi is so unique, you really can't help but entertain notions. \"Maybe they're in different universes? And if so, what the hell is the point if we don't even come to a coherent conclusion?\"\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai is an absolute gem. It reveals, with shocking twists and turns, what's really going on the little village. \\n\\n\r\nThrough it all, Rika truly shines as her own character. Initially, I just thought she was a bubbly little girl who had weird lapses of seriousness. Boy was I wrong. She is a very deep, well-developed individual. You come to understand her struggle and pain, and you feel a sense of pity for her situation. It had become so bad that she chose to remain monotonous, surrendering to fate. But when Keiichi showed her that fate isn't determined for us, that we CAN fight it - that's all it took for a glimmer of hope to blossom, for her AND us (Which, in my opinion, is very important). \\n\\n\r\nThat's another thing. All the characters are unique. What's awesome about them is that their uniqueness can change any time. Confused, huh? Think it's a little too vague? Just watch the show and you'll get what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very original from my standpoint. It's really something I've never seen before, which is a huge plus.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely fell in love with this show and its characters. I was hesitant to watch this season, but I'm super glad that I did! Higurashi is one of the most well-executed anime out there. This season left me with a sense of happiness; a sense of it wasn't all for nothing for them. After so much suffering, it wasn't all in vain.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend it to those who are looking for something dark and thought provoking.",

            "content": "The previous season of Higurashi was a delicate balance of cutesy underage school girls doing cutesy underage school girl things and violent, brutal murder and torture. The plot was masterfully convoluted and needed a lot more explanation than it was given. Thus, the second season, which I like to think of as both the explanatory as well as the happier season. The violence is toned down with only one scene of gore and a lot more scenes of character drama. So basically, those of you who got into Higurashi for the loli murderers will feel a bit let down by how focused on hope thisseason is. For anyone who can look past that, they will get to enjoy a rather entertaining and dramatic tromp through the Hinamizawa of June, 1983.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling too much, the young shrine maiden Rika has been constantly reliving the same few weeks for nearly one thousand years and has seen so many different outcomes that she just wants to get to one where she and her friends survive. While last season focused on a variety of the characters, this season focuses more on Rika than anyone else; though there is also Rika\u2019s constant companion Hanyuu. Together they attempt to find a future where Rika doesn\u2019t die and she gets to live with all of her friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the series is only kind of entertaining. It\u2019s full of happy-go-lucky school-time moments that tend to be really boring. And especially after the fast paced ending of season one, it\u2019s a very different and off-putting pace. It takes quite a while before the plot gets interesting and the drama really kicks into high gear. With a much more involving and deep plot than the first season lets on, Higurashi actually has a pretty kick-ass story. Like the last season, the characters are really not wherein the series shines, much more so the plot is what will draw you in.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say that the characters are bad by any stretch of the imagination. While Shion was my favorite character of last season, I really did enjoy tagging along with Rika. She\u2019s not one of those characters you can invest yourself in, but she\u2019s fun nonetheless. Especially her interactions with her friend Satoko and her companion Hanyuu. She doesn\u2019t develop too much through the course of the anime, but nonetheless she is pretty awesome. She takes death like it\u2019s nothing and doesn\u2019t mind protecting her friends no matter the cost.\\n\\n\r\nSatoko is the cuter one. Despite Rika having her little \u201cnee-pah\u201d thing, Satoko has the fang and her love for her brother. Everything about her radiates cute and adorable. Sure she\u2019s a little sadistic, what with her traps and all that, but overall I liked her. I was happy when she was happy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Hanyuu\u2026she\u2019s just there. She\u2019s cute and that\u2019s about all she\u2019s good at. Why nobody asks about her horns is something I wondered throughout, but that\u2019s just a minor complaint.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the bad guy is pretty cool. While not the best bad guy you\u2019ll ever see, he/she is definitely pretty sadistic.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t get too much into the plot of Higurashi without spoiling a lot, which makes it hard to delve deep into the anime. And I described all of the characters in my previous review. The cons of the anime can mostly be found in the poor animation and the first half\u2019s slow pace. But otherwise, there\u2019s not a lot to complain about. Good characters, a very rich plot, and drama throughout. It\u2019s not at all like the first season, but it is definitely better in many respects. If you enjoyed the first season, I\u2019d at least watch this season to understand the plot, though you may be drawn in even further by said plot than you were first season.\\n\\n\r\nTaken as a whole (and by whole, I mean minus the OVA and the third season that has nothing to do with this), Higurashi is a very good drama series with some neat ideas and very disturbing violence. Edge-of-your-seat drama really doesn\u2019t get much better than this series. Though, of course, you must fight through some dry sections to get to that drama.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nHigurashi became quite a goddamn mess because Ryukishi07 tried to incorporate too many new ideas into his series without the proper execution or build-up.\r\nFirst of all, it loves being really dark and edgy, but at the same time, it doesn't know when to fucking give it a rest; it has an annoying penchant for dragging out the torture of its characters, as if more suffering and pain = higher quality of writing. As a result, the story sometimes becomes too edgy and takes itself way too seriously to be enjoyable. Whatever comic relief the writer shoehorned in is usually unfunny, sometimes cringy, or even downrightannoying. \\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, it's completely fine - cool, even - to be edgy. Some of my favorite series are extremely edgy. The problem with Higurashi is that it just doesn't know how to have fun. Sometimes I feel as if it just loves to torture and create a pity party for its characters for the sake of it. \\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, look at something like Umineko: it rolls around in the puddle of blood, shit, and guts that it creates, smears brains all over its face, and chases after the reader with its bloody hands like a little kid playing tag. It downright invites the reader to laugh at the atrocity along with it. Despite doing these edgy things, at its very core, it understands extremely well what compassion is; it knows how to pull its characters up by the hand. It knows how to be a complete monster without alienating or boring its audience with the same shtick over and over. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, Higurashi has made me suspend my disbelief one too many times . For instance, during many chase scenes, the characters just suddenly stop and start talking to each other, forgetting how to run until the enemy catches up with them. The time loop mechanic, along with Hanyuu, are shoehorned into the story with no context to try and explain away the resetting story arcs. While the writer, Ryukishi07, does explain this mechanic in a way that makes perfect sense in Umineko, it came completely out of the left field in Higurashi. And here, you see, is where Higurashi suddenly makes a leap into fantasy territory when for the entire first half it has been trying so hard to come across as a mystery. This mechanic will always feel off because it's been introduced so late into the story.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, a major suspension of disbelief and one of the biggest gripes I have with the story concerns a certain character's actions. If they have been in a time loop for hundreds and hundreds of years, shouldn't they have tried anything and everything under the goddamn sun? Why haven't they ever tried to explore the option of talking to their friends about it, if it works so well to break through this tragic fate? Did they just hold back for a few hundred years because the plot demands it? As a result, all of their struggles and suffering after the multi-verse reveal just seem artificial and unrealistic somehow. At some point, I became completely detached from the story, apathetic towards whatever happens to these characters who I feel have been overstaying their welcome in this drawn-out story.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, it feels as if Higurashi tried too many ideas without the proper writing prowess to back these ideas up. As a result, it fumbles the fuck out of the plot, pulling aliens, diseases, and organizations out of thin air and cooking up unbelievably cartoonish villains to mastermind a very forced and drawn-out tragedy that's edgy just for the sake of being edgy.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nAt least the characters' facial proportions don't look like those of deformed polio victims like in the 1st season.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening is ok but not as good as the 1st season. The voice acting and sound design are mediocre at best and fucking annoying at worst i.e Keiichi's voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI don't even care anymore tbh\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEhhhhh It was just ok.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n6/10 Satoko did nothing wrong.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR forget Higurashi go play the Umineko sound novel it's lit af tbh lmao it's amazing how much the writer improves after writing one mediocre series.",

            "content": "Its weird for me to do this but since i haven't watched that much anime that came out in this entire year i decided to make a review for an anime that i just finished watching a few weeks ago. But what makes this so weird is that i'm making a review for an anime that came out like 13 years ago but nonetheless this anime still holds out to be timeless (Kind of). So this is my review for Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai and this is my first anime review in the past months considering i haven't opened my MAL after thewhole guidelines thing, now you can consider this my entire review in both seasons of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nNow for those who is reading this, this is the second season of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni so if you haven't watched that I totally recommend watching the first one. \\n\r\nA quick explanation on how the story of Higurashi works is that it is separated in arcs, there are two types of arcs The Question Arc and The Answer Arc each of these arcs featured a different MC and Antagonist. Now how this work is that the setting of the story is that its in a time-loop which resets for when everyone dies (And of course everyone dies in this anime like all the time) so each reset would feature a new story arc with a different Question and Answer arcs with of course different scenarios and mysteries to be solved. \\n\\n\r\nHigurashi is quite different from any other Visual Novel Adapted anime, for example is Fate/Stay Night UBW (I'm not gonna use the 2006 since it has combinations of the three routes of the VN) when it comes to UBW they take the best part of the routes and the true ending of the VN. And almost other Romantic VN adapted anime is that they take all the best part of each Route combine them and make a new ending with it. Higurashi isn't like that it takes every part of the VN and shows it to you in a perfect way, It will show you what it wants to show you and in the perfect time \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Higurashi incredible is just how the story is built up to create tense and mysterious moments and perfectly gives you the answer, remind you this while i was watching it i had a notebook and pen all the time and i wrote every hint they give me and try to figure out the conclusion before they could give it.\\n\\n\r\nThough the main flaw of this is that it can make you expect something big but sometimes get disappointed at the end but after re-watching it i haven't faced this problem yet considering i haven't watched the OVAs \\n\r\nBut nonetheless the Story is written and built up great, if you are the type of person who likes to solve mysteries rather than waiting for it to be told to you this is your cup of tea\\n\r\ni would give it a 9/10 in the story\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNow unto the animation and ooh boy this is really difficult to explain, now when it comes to animation when someone ask me the question \"What do you consider a bad animation\" my immediate answer is if its not appealing to me at all. But that doesn't mean its a bad anime and in fact Higurashi's Animation is perfect for the theme and story of it let me explain.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Higurashi's animation perfect for it is how it can transition to a happy and fun type of animation to a much more darker and disturbing look to it, and in fact with having not a very good animation fits perfectly as gives off this disturbing look when the scene is disturbing but also when it comes to happy moments it uses those weird animation style to make it more upbeat\\n\r\nmy point is that even if the animation of the anime is bad in appearance it doesn't mean its a \"Bad Animation\" since the animation fits perfectly with tone and story of the anime and Higurashi's animation is really on point with scenes, if its supposed to be disturbing the animation would be disturbing and if its more happy it would be more happy and that's perfect for higurashi's setting\\n\r\nplus in each opening including the first season has one of the gorgeous visuals i've seen.\\n\r\nI give the art a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIncredible is one of the words i could describe the OST having a very melancholy theme to it fits perfectly and its just like with the animation It can be a very dark tone to its OST and it can a more upbeat theme to it. I also like to point out the openings, this are one of the masterpiece of anime music of all of time having the sad tone to it but also giving a faint disturbance in each of the OP is truly fitting for the anime with its amazing visuals \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound gets a score of 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is one of the interesting parts of this anime other than the story, Higurashi has very big cast character with arranging from different age and personality but what separates them from each other is each one of them have their own mental issue and dark past. It really tells you much on their personality on each arc that some of them can easily breakdown from their usual selves and with the eerie and disturbing setting and a large of mentally unstable characters and you get a perfect combination of Thriller, Psychological, Mystery, and Supernatural Story. And thing about this is that each character a quite relatable and understandable from each of their action and choices. The Characters of Higurashi are quite likable and easy to be attached to and this is perfect especially since you can consider this a good horror anime, when it comes to horror you mostly need to have the characters to be relatable to the viewers as it gives it more tension for every dark scene and Higurashi does not fail at that as most characters in this anime is i never saw quite bland and lacking any personality. \\n\\n\r\nI give this a score of 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nMy expectations of this anime was really turned around at first impression i had mix look unto this with its disturbing and very graphical moments into it but past that it is quite fun to trying to figure out the mystery before the anime tells you the answer. And i may say this really weird but i wish it had more gore in it just to be more darker to it but overall i enjoyed this anime its really the type of show that will make your head spin with the twist and turns and every Answer Arc is always satisfying to watch as it connects all the dots in the mystery and gives you a good conclusion (Though don't expect everyone to be alive).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment of this anime is a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nThis anime is truly the closes thing we can get of a good horror anime as its really difficult for anime to make a good horror since it needs to be very realistic and since its animated you don't really care for them cause they're aren't real (Yup Anime isn't real) but this anime captures of what to do when tense moments come, it has a very good mystery that will keep your head spinning. \\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime however if you are the type of person that can't handle disturbing and graphical violence that much i do not recommend watching this, but if you can bypass those things then this anime will not disappoint you to an extent.\\n",

The mysteries consisted of the mysterious deaths, the outbreak in Hinamizawa, and the person who was behind it all, and yes, that is exactly what we received. Now the problems, I have with this season of Higurashi would be its take on the horror & gore scenes, and its structure. Everythingregarding the answers given for the outbreak, Rika\u2019s powers, and the mysterious deaths, I can get behind to some degree, but these three categories kill the story for the show a little bit. And I will kindly explain my reasons why, starting with its take with the horror and gore. \\n\\n\r\n\tIn season one, we were shown to have scenes where the characters would undergo some type of mental struggle which would cause them to commit deadly acts of violence on others. Heck, we even seen an older woman endlessly stab a young child, for her sins. However, the problems I found in the horror and gore in Higurashi Kai is that it seems a bit fluffy and nonexistent to be a sequel for Higurashi. I admit we do receive scenes where the characters are abused, or beaten, but it seems that in certain moments, we receive a fade out or other type of transition to get back on track with the explanation of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example of where the horror and gore seem to take a nose dive could be seen in episode four where; \\n\\n\r\nExample \u2013 Episode 04: a policeman is killed by a member of the Yamainu and it gets covered by some type of Red Screen which is seemingly supposed to symbolize the blood shed from this man. And I found that to be quite bothersome.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other moments where the deaths to seem to follow this format, but I wouldn\u2019t count it as censorship in the slightest since the series still has its crazed moments through facial expressions, abusive moments with Satoko, and certain scenes consisting of the gore, but it feels as if the series was trying to erase the darkness that it once had to focus on answering the questions from season one.\\n\\n\r\nWith regards to the Anime\u2019s structure, I found the issues to lie within certain episodes, preferably episode 14 which is the start of the festival Accompanying Arc of the series. Now in episode fourteen we receive the history behind Miyo\u2019s backstory and how she became the woman she is now. However, I didn\u2019t find it to be an enjoyable experience since the episode kept shifting to her adult and child form within the first ten to so minutes. One bit, we get her suffering as a child, and then the next she\u2019s accepting some type of encouragement from someone, and it seemed pretty odd. Thankfully, it stopped near the end of the episode, but it seemed off to me at the time. Another instance where the Anime\u2019s structure seemed to be off can be seen in episode twelve\\n\\n\r\nExample 2 \u2013 Episode 12: where Rika decides to spill the beans behind the outbreak and history of Hinamizawa. The scene does become tense as she explains her points to her friends, which makes the episode not too much of a drag, but the amount of information dropped in one episode could be overwhelming to some individuals.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, I didn\u2019t find the whole supernatural premise behind Rika\u2019s powers to seem that outlandish considering how there seemed to be some set-up of this in the prior arc, but I did feel as though some of the horror and gore elements, structure, and small chances of hope were quite bothersome after witnessing the amount of suspicion and realism, left behind in season one.\\n\\n\r\nAlright now normally Mecha would crank out the gamepad for the character portion, but I believe we\u2019ll just let the menu of Z do that for us, folks.\\n\r\n \u201cFades Out White\u201d\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: - B \u2013 8\\n\\n\r\nAfter having these characters go through the detective\u2019s analysis machine in Higurashi season one, let\u2019s see how they stack up in season two, but this time, I will be grouping them together. So let\u2019s start with Keiichi Maebara and Rika Furude.\\n\\n\r\nKeiichi/Rika \u2013 As you all know Keiichi was the boy next door type of character who received plenty of screen time in the last season of the Anime. We got to learn a bit more about his character in terms of his internal/external conflicts with the girls during the Spirited Away Arc and his life as a teenager in the city before moving into Hinamizawa. However, how does he stack up in season two? In this season I feel that Keiichi gathered a strong sense of unintentional character development, being that he developed as a character, but doesn\u2019t know he did, due to it being a different world form of his character as explained through Rika\u2019s dialog in episode six of the Anime. A couple of examples of this unintentional development can be seen during \\n\\n\r\nExample Keiichi \u2013 Massacre Arc \u2013Episodes 07 \u2013 13: the Massacre arc in episodes seven through thirteen. He shows this development by giving Mion the doll and tells her he views her as a girlish type of woman, which in the prior arcs he felt she was a bit boyish. Rika even states that Keiichi has learned to accept Mion\u2019s girlish feelings toward his character by doing this. Another moment would include this example where Keiichi stands in front of Shion to prevent her from killing Satoko\u2019s uncle, which shows that he believes that killing him would not be the best solution. And this provides more evidence that he has grown as a character.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are some instances where Keiichi seems to be a random stock character, if we take into account that this is the series\u2019 second season and group this with season one that would make him a strong dynamic or round character, in which these examples prove that even though he may fall victim to pessimism that he has knowledge now of what not to do.\\n\\n\r\nRIKA \u2013 Now in terms of Rika Furude\u2019s character, she obtains the amount of screen time that she desperately needed in season one. Since she is now our \u201cmain\u201d protagonist of the series, she is expected to have the toughest challenges and best growth out of all of the characters in terms of her role in the plot, and quite frankly, she does receive this. As we start to learn more about Rika\u2019s character in terms of her origin, powers, and goal to defeat fate, I felt that her mysterious stock character role changed to being that of a more realistic human being. Although human beings don\u2019t have god-like powers like Rika\u2019s character, what I\u2019m referring to is her emotions throughout the run of the series and how they tend to change. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, if we take a look at Rika\u2019s character during the beginning of the series she can seem a bit annoying and boring to some since we get the rinse and repeat scenario of her feeling optimistic about one small change in the world, and when something flips it up, she converts back to pessimism which I find to be a humanistic part of her character since human emotions do tend to converge from happy to sad most of the time. However, her true ounce of character growth can be seen during this example in the \\n\\n\r\nExample Rika \u2013 Massacre Arc \u2013 Episode 10/11 \u2013 Massacre arc near episode ten or eleven when she realizes that thinking about waiting for another miracle to happen would be pointless to some degree, and that taking an effort to save Satoko and not being a useless spectator would be the best option to finding this peaceful world she\u2019s been seeking.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, like Keiichi, she does end up slipping and falling to the ounces of despair, and desperation, she is able to realize that fate can be changed through her words with Keiichi. This may be the reason why I grouped these two together since Keiichi is the foil to her character during this arc, and gives Rika the idea of standing against fate, which is one of Rika\u2019s biggest challenges she ends up defeating by the end of season two.\\n\\n\r\nHanyuu/Takano \u2013 Alright, next up we have the duo of our mentor character Hanyuu Furude, and our main antagonist or bad girl, being Miyoko Takano. Let\u2019s start with Hanyuu\u2019s character. Hanyuu is the calm, clumsy and newest protagonist of the group. We learn that she plays the mentor role for Rika\u2019s character and that she is the one responsible for helping Rika travel to all of these worlds to find that \u201cjust right\u201d world. She seems to be Oyashiro Sama herself, and we gain slight information about her character. For me, I felt that her character seemed a bit underwhelming in terms of her backstory, maybe due to the fact that I wanted to see either a flashback of her past life, as she stated that she died to protect the sins of man, or the villagers at the time. However, her growth as a character does come out to some degree.\\n\\n\r\nAn example of where Hanyuu received the much needed character development could be seen in the beginning stages of the Massacre Arc where she seemed to have less confidence in Rika\u2019s ability to find this peaceful world, when everything was starting to go her way. But by the end of the series, we learn that her character is the missing piece that the others needed in order to find this peaceful world, and this snaps Hanyuu into believing that a peaceful world is possible. Though I found her character to be slightly underwhelming to some degree, I still found Hanyuu to be an enjoyable protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nTakano \u2013 Now in terms of Takano\u2019s character, she seems to have the role of the antagonist in this season. She also receives an intense amount of characterization because of this role, and I found her story leading up to who she is now, to be pretty interesting. We learn about how she lost her parents to some bus accident, goes through a life of despair in an orphanage, and meets her adopted grandfather Hifumi and other key characters that push her to pursue this goal of revealing the truth behind the Hinamizawa syndrome to avenge her grandfather\u2019s pride. She went from being this side/questionable researcher stock character from season one, to being a fully developed antagonist in season two, and I didn\u2019t seem to be bothered with this conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nIf you remember what the detective said in season one, you could pinpoint various hints regarding her role as being the true villain behind the outbreak, and I really can\u2019t disagree with his claim here. I do admit, that some of the events with her character that lead up to the end of the arc were quite weird and strange, but I felt that since her character was able to provide some type of twist in the story, and interesting information of why she\u2019s doing the things she\u2019s doing, that I can\u2019t really knock on her for that reason. Overall, these two characters seem to tie together in terms of a moral dispute, and that is why I find both of them to be interesting in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nShion/Satoko \u2013 Alright, now it\u2019s time to go to our next duo being Shion and Satoko\u2019s character. Let\u2019s start with Shion Sonozaki. From what you have learned from the previous season, Shion wasn\u2019t the best when it came to who to trust after losing her love interest, being Satoshi Houjo to the point of where she would end up killing almost everybody that she felt didn\u2019t seem kind to her. With that being said, how does she stand up in season two?\\n\\n\r\nWell, in terms of season two Shion has fallen prey to mixed development within the series which kind of bothers be to some degree. At certain points she does seem to gather some type of patience and kindness with this concept of unintentional development, however, when it came down to the decisions of how to solve certain issues, she resulted to murder being the best answer which kind of loses her development points with me.\\n\\n\r\nAn example of this moment could be seen in episode 8 \\n\\n\r\nExample Shion \u2013 Episode 8 \u2013 during the Massacre arc where Shion fails to come to terms with having Teppei survive, with the only way of her changing her views was to result to violence to beat down Keiichi during this scenario. I understand that most people have to do some act of violence, to let out steam, but in Shion\u2019s case she doesn\u2019t have any sign of growth since she still clings to Satoshi a bit too much than she needs to. Nonetheless, Shion is a great character in terms of her representation as a real world girlfriend, possibly, but I wished she could grow out of this phase just a tad.\\n\\n\r\nWith respect to Satoko\u2019s character, we learned that she could be bratty, comedic, and fun during the lighthearted moments, but with respect to negativity, she holds her emotions in and views this to be some act of courage and strength. With that being said, how does she hold up in Kai?\\n\r\nWell in terms of the Massacre arc, Satoko does become the Macguffin of the tale, since Teppei Houjo abuses, and threatens her with Satoshi\u2019s room being on the line for her. In terms of character growth, Satoko doesn\u2019t necessarily grow on her own accord. The only reason for Satoko\u2019s character development during this arc was because of her friend\u2019s efforts to save her, and is this necessarily a bad thing, to me, not really. This event in itself symbolizes the theme of friendship that Ryukishi seemed to want the story\u2019s main focus to be about. And with this in mind, I can\u2019t really argue with the author of this tale since it showcases the strong bond that Satoko has with her comrades. \\n\r\nRegardless of this fact, would I have loved to see Satoko grow on her own, and tell the Counseling Center the truth, certainly, but from looking at it from a moral and realistic perspective, it wouldn\u2019t be possible due to the events that transpired after this arc? Overall, I found the needed development, expansion on her character in terms of her family\u2019s inner conflict, and her infection explanation, to help her character recover from the events in season one. \\n\r\nAlso before we shift, I wanted to mention the reason for their groupage, was due to the fact that both of them found Satoshi to be vital in terms of their characterization and growth.\\n\\n\r\nMion/Rena \u2013 Alright, now it\u2019s time to go to our final duo being Mion and Rena\u2019s character. In terms of Mion\u2019s character, the problem that I and the detective came across was that she seemed to be the weakest character of the batch, besides Rika. The only sign of grace to her character was how she played the foil role to most of the characters in the story and seemed like a plot device for the big Shion reveal, and that\u2019s it. So, how does she rank in season two? \\n\\n\r\nWell, in terms of season two, I believe Mion gathered the spotlight she deserved in terms of helping certain characters move past their endeavors, but she seemed to still be the weakest character in terms of any sign of development due to her not really having any sign of personal issues in season one. As a plot device, Mion played a perfect role in the story. Examples of this would be during the events of episode seven where Rena explains that the reason for her not changing would be by consulting with Mion, and Shion evens admits to doing the same. However, we never receive any major issues when it came to Mion\u2019s character, and believe it\u2019s because she didn\u2019t really come across to having any problems in that season besides the Spirited Away arc bits. Overall, Mion although characterized a lot to some, doesn\u2019t seem to showcase any signs of development.\\n\\n\r\nRENA \u2013 Alright now we\u2019ve reached our final protagonist on this board, and that\u2019s Ryuugu Rena. Now in terms of the previous season, Rena\u2019s character seemed to have redeemed a lot of character development during the final arc of season one. We learned that she had problems with her family, and her pastime as a young child, but ends up overcoming this struggle by learning how to trust her friends. Now how does she fair in season one?\\n\\n\r\nNow since Rena has developed from the events in season one, I felt that her character in this season just reflects on those ideals to the point where she is able to contribute to her friend\u2019s goals toward their own sense of happiness which makes her an integral piece to this season\u2019s plot. She does endure some type of internal struggle near the start of Kai, but since she learned how to trust her friends from the other worlds, unintentionally, she was able to defeat this mindset easily to the point where her life became great and wonderful. The only problem I can see with her character is that she ends up playing the therapist role toward her allies, but since she kind of settled the events in season one, I can\u2019t really complain here. Overall, I did find Rena\u2019s character bland throughout this season of Higurashi, but due to her integration in the plot, I don\u2019t really hold this trait against her to a small degree. \\n\\n\r\nNow the reason why I grouped these together would be due to the fact that they seemed to be the overseers of the group to make sure no one gets engulfed by the darkness surrounding the village.  \\n\\n\r\nMinor Characters \u2013 With regards to the minor characters in this arc, I\u2019ll just make this a bit brief. I feel that after the events of season one, that each and almost every minor character gained some type of character development throughout the story. A few examples would include: \\n\\n\r\nOoishi coming to terms that the Sonozaki family weren\u2019t involved with his friend\u2019s murder, thereby helping them defeat and trick Takano near the end of the story.\\n\\n\r\nWe learn that Irie, seems to be pursuing some type of medical career to avenge his father for his crimes, and we get to see more signs of characterization behind Tomitake, Akasaka, and even the side characters in terms of their goals, roles in the plot, and other aspects leading up to the very end of the story.\\n\\n\r\nI feel the side characters all gained some type role in the story that either helped them grow for the better or dive deeper for the worst. Although, I feel that some side characters should have received a bit more screen time, I loved the fact that Studio Deen or Ryukishi gave them some type of characterization so they wouldn\u2019t seem fake or unrealistic to the eye.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: - B \u2013 8\\n\\n\r\nFor this season\u2019s soundtrack, I found it quite meaningful and depressing compared to its season one counterpart, but in a good light. The opening theme titled, \u201cNaraku No Hana\u201d by Eiko Shimamiya was a perfect match for the series. The opening theme through its art direction, composition, and vocalist\u2019s performance captures the motive of this season, quite nicely. It truly capture\u2019s Rika\u2019s desperation to escape this destined fate of June 1983 through it\u2019s slow start to its incredible build up near the middle of the song as if this is Rika herself saying that I can defeat fate. I especially loved how they switched up the opening theme\u2019s art near the reveal of the villain behind the outbreak as an attempt to make it seem fresh and new. Anyway, the opening theme was able to mix together these opposite emotions so well, and I couldn\u2019t be prouder. Another highlight for the soundtrack used in this series would be the voice acting. And sadly for you English dub fans, if there is any, there is no dub for this season as of right now.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the JP voice acting for the show, I believe all the voices fit well for the characters. Similar to season one, their performances during the child-friendly, and critical moments was spot on. During the comedic bits of the Anime, I do admit to chuckling to some of the jokes the characters would make because of how the child-friendly art complimented their wacky voices during these moments. However, the points where the voice acting kicked it up to high gear would be during the breakdowns of these characters. \\n\\n\r\nAn example where the voice acting really hit home in terms of breakdowns could be seen in Takano\u2019s backstory, preferably in episode fourteen;\\n\\n\r\nExample 1 Episode 14 \u2013 Festival Accompanying Arc: Where Takano has escaped from the orphanage and comes face to face with one of the workers. She ends up biting one his thumbs in which the worker gets infuriated with her, and is about to deal a heavy blow. And what makes this scene terrifying is Takano\u2019s scream as he approaches her. Being able to imitate that level of terror in a young girl\u2019s voice made me quite impressed with her voice actress.\\n\\n\r\nAnd quite frankly there are more voice acting build up scenes like this that just add to the horror/thriller lore we come to expect from this series. Although the horror and mystery aspects of the second season wasn\u2019t near the exact level of it\u2019s first, the voice acting in the show makes up for some of its lost atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nIn light of the OST and ending theme of season two\u2019s adaptation, I found the ending theme in this series to stand out a tad bit more than season one\u2019s ending theme. While in terms of the OST I found it to be quite standard. Similar to season one\u2019s ending theme, the ending theme titled, \u201cTaish\u014d.a\u201d by anNina was also relaxing and peaceful, but my reason for liking this theme over season one\u2019s ending theme is that the theme of this song, seems to match the overall feeling of this season\u2019s Anime adaptation, precisely. I admit, there were moments where I just skimmed over the ending theme to see another portion of the episode or the usual clip with Dark Rika and Hanyuu at points, but this ending to me seems to closely resemble the somber tone and mood that the show produces through its setting and characters. On the other hand, the OST in this show is standard to me, since it was already used in season one\u2019s adaptation. There were a couple of different background soundtracks here and there, but they didn\u2019t really stand out to me. \\n\r\nAlthough, I do praise Studio Deen for keeping in the best tracks from Season one. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, as a quick compliment toward the sound department for the Anime, I really appreciate the fact there weren\u2019t any signs of audio desynch age from the characters facial movements. Also the background character audio, doesn\u2019t interfere with any plot discussion moments, which is another great step up from season one. The audio sync and background character audio issues bugged me in Higurashi\u2019s first season, but thankfully with the incorporation of the new art style in the mix, this issue was avoided.\\n\\n\r\nThough I found the background OST to be pretty bland and standard, I found the opening theme, ending theme, and voice acting to be the soundtrack portion\u2019s greatest strength!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: - C+ - 7.5\\n\r\nIn terms of the art and animation quality in Higurashi: When They Cry Season 2, I find this to be a great step in the right direction. In season one there are moments where the characters looked deformed, and an instance when one of our protagonist\u2019s being Rena Ryuguu\u2019s body twists as if she was a piece of Laffy Taffy in Willy Wonka\u2019s Chocolate Factory. However, does this season\u2019s new art and animation style still hold up during the creepy and dark moments, and in my perspective of things, I believe it does, but not to the same degree as season one\u2019s art style. \\n\\n\r\nTo many people, like myself, the art quality in Higurashi\u2019s first season is rather off, but captured the lustful, and vicious lore that the show generated through its divided arcs. It\u2019s what made Higurashi, Higurashi in a sense of its iconic, \u201cHigurashi Laugh,\u201d and mysterious, yet creepy, physically expressive emotions. And compared to season two, the art quality, although sharp and organized, most of the time, doesn\u2019t seem to capture the same level of horror that the bad art of season one set up. Nevertheless, does this really hurt the series in the art style department, and my answer is no.\\n\r\nAlthough it doesn\u2019t meet the same expectations of the art from the first season, and still has slight hiccups in the facial structure of certain characters, I still believe there are scenes which produce the same level of terror. For example, \\n\\n\r\nExample - Episode 08 \u2013 Massacre Arc: In episode 8, during her chat with Takano and Irie, Rika snaps and starts sharing hate felt remarks to these characters for not helping her, help out Satoko during her abusive struggle against Teppei Houjo. If you take a look at Rika\u2019s facial expressions during this moment, it exhibits this same sense of horror and terror from season one\u2019s facial art features. I mean just look at her, she looks like a TROLL!\\n\\n\r\nOther examples where this bad art pops up in the story would be during the other characters\u2019 negative emotional moments. Like Satoko\u2019s depressive state, Takano\u2019s cries of fear montage, and even in some of moments where the characters reflect upon scenes from the past worlds. \\n\\n\r\n\tWith all the character art style choices aside, how do I feel about the animation, and background elements of season two? Well, where season two\u2019s animation department shines most compared to season one, would be through its animation, and background elements. Although there are scenes where some of the facial structures of characters seemed to be misplaced during small discussions, I found the animation to be better than the first season\u2019s usage of animation, in these categories. One example that I found, where the animation looked great in terms of its predecessor would be in\\n\\n\r\nExample 1 - Episode 6: episode six where Rika is in some paranormal dimension, and discusses about the instances from all of the other worlds she has lived in and experienced. And for a typical CGI hater that Mr. Z is, I actually liked seeing the past dimensions through these fragments of time. \\n\r\nIt produced some sign of engagement as Rika told her tale and her overall goal in the series to the viewer, or Hanyuu for those who like to spoil the fun.\\n\\n\r\nAnd not to beat a dead horse, but the facial expressions during the chilling moments in season two seem a bit refreshing, and new. I felt that using this new direction in art style gives the show a new way to express certain emotions, and that if they were to keep the old art form, it could have been repetitious, or an excuse to use old tricks for the sake of the Horror mood, to some viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are definitely errors in the animation and art quality in this season, I found that most of the time, season two was able to avoid a lot of common mistakes with their new art and animation direction, that mostly, season one failed to fix.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: - B - 8     \\n\r\nPersonally, while watching season two of the series I was really looking forward to learning about the answers to these questions we all had during season one. Although, I have mixed emotions with how this part of the Higurashi series turned out, I found some enjoyment out of it. However, we must come to terms with ourselves here. Does this season have its flaws? Yes, yes it does. And obviously this is the part where I would question recommending the Anime, but since this is Higurashi\u2019s answer to the question arcs of season one, asking myself the question of recommendation to my audience should be a no brainer.  Nonetheless, if I wanted to change anything from this season to make it a tad bit better than what would I change? Well\u2026honestly, the only way I would fix this series would be by\u2026\\n\\n\r\nList of reasons, possibly three ways at most.\\n\r\n1.)\tFixing the art quality in some of the character\u2019s facial expressions since they seem to still have some issues.\\n\r\n2.)\tPiecing together some of the Takano backstory bits in their proper format since switching from her childhood flashback to the present was kind of unorganized to me.\\n\r\n3.)\tAnd possibly moving some of the big chunk of information given about the syndrome into two separate episodes while disregarding some of the comedic bits that hold no weight to them would be a good solution.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless this season provided me with answers to the questions that I had about season one\u2019s adaptation during my re-watch of it, and I wouldn\u2019t mind giving it another re-watch some time in the near future.\\n\\n\r\nClosing:\\n\r\nWell, for our first Heist, I\u2019d like to say we completed a good chunk of it. You\u2019re also probably expecting me to discuss about seeing Rika or Hanyuu due to the events of Case Journal Episode 02. Sadly, that won\u2019t happen for now since I have something that must be done first, if you recall Hanyuu\u2019s message from the prior Case Journal. However, I can leave you off by showing you what you all wanted most, and that\u2019s the results based off my ranking system. Without further ado, here\u2019s what yours truly believes the second season of Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni deserves.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score = C+\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Note: I have not played the visual novel game so I won't be comparing the anime to the visual novel in this. \r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai starts off from where Higurashi no naku koro ni left off from, so essentially, it's really important for you to watch the second season after you've watched the first one. The first one consisted of four question arcs and two answer arcs. The second season has two answer arcs as well as some additional ones in both seasons. These answer arcs answer the unanswered questions of the question arcs. As you go deeper in this anime, eachquestion arc and the corresponding answer arc enlightens the viewer about the situations and the overall big mystery behind things. So when you watch the anime, you might want to know which answer arcs corresponds to which question arc to make things easier. \\n\r\nStory: 9/10 \\n\r\nI'm not much of a horror fan, but I absolutely love mystery, so I generally loved the series because of it's unique way of storytelling in question arcs and answer arcs. It's very smooth in the way it can change the point of views in each arc. My main problem when it comes to a lot of the anime that I have watched, is that the overall big mystery surrounding things aren't answered. Thankfully, Higurashi isn't like that and most of the answers are answered. The first season seems to be more horror and supernatural. The second half of season 2 doesn't show much horror at all, and people who really liked this about the series might even be disappointed. It could get confusing because it may seem like the question arcs have nothing to do with each other, but they are significant and if you watch the series, you'll know what I mean. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art is slightly different in season two, but I preferred the art in the first season. The second season seems to look a little more \"clannad-type\" with the wider faces. But I think there was a change to the art because the anime in the second season took a more \"positive energy\" change compared to how dark the first season was. When I first saw the series, I was like, \"What the hell,  the art looks cute but the plot seems so dark.\" After you see the angry expressions of a cute character like Ryuuga Rena, I realized how wrong I was. The way the expressions are illustrated is amazing, it actually gave me the creeps when I saw it. When you see a character snap like that, especially a cute character, it has more affect on the viewer.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nI'm not familiar with voice actors, but everyone seemed to do fine to me. Because I don't know any Japanese at all, and every language has a different way of speaking, it's hard for me to differentiate what is good voice acting and what is not. The music seemed pretty good to me and I liked the opening song for both seasons. The ending song was also good. I didn't really like the first season's ending song though, but that's just me. The background music was good too, especially the parts where they showed the murders or the depressing parts of the anime. It had a good eerie affect to it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThere's a lot of character development throughout the series. Each character has a past and their own story, and act differently because of it. The story didn't just focus on one character, everyone got a chance to shine, and through this, the circumstances of the characters are shown. In the second season though, the characters change, and of course, the change is brought on by Keiichi. They become more positive and make better decisions because of their better understanding of things. They become more considerate of each other, and you can see teamwork growing throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThe serious parts were more entertaining to me then the parts where everyone are carrying out their club activities. Those were the parts where I was mostly was just sitting and thinking \"Hurry up, let's get to the main part\" But I also loved the mystery part to the story. To me, and I'm sure many of you (unless you're one of those that read the last page of a book first) suspense is what makes a mystery so enjoyable. Sadly, if you watch the preview at the end of each episode in the second season, there's a certain episode that pretty much gives away who the culprit is. That completely ruined the story for me, so I'm strongly stressing this part for those of you who like the suspense. DON'T WATCH THE PREVIEWS OF THE ANIME. Maybe I was being stupid but I haven't heard of an anime where they reveal the culprit like that and I watched it unknowingly. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is definitely should be a must watch anime. I'm not a fan of anime that are long (this might not seem so long to some of you, but to me it was since there are two seasons) but I gave this a go and I'm glad I did. It's certainly really enjoyable and will have you at the edge of your seat wanting for more. \\n",

Anyways- the first season ws gory, but this season is less gory and more actual plot. It explains most of the confusion of season 1, so if you didn't understand season 1, make sure to definatly watch season 2. There's also a new main character, Hanyuu, so you have another insane loli to look forward to. Anyways, Rika is now the main focus. Trying to save all of her friends from being doomed to a tragedy. It's really good,and I suggest it. The style looks abit different from season 1 though....\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

And there is a character introduced in this one that plays a crucial part that is not mentioned anywhere in the first Higurashi and this character is pretty much a plot device. \r\nAll in all is enjoyable and givesyou a sense of closure but a it is a let down from the first one.",

This season builds upon season 1 and adds to it.\r\nI found that the character development in this season was formidable, the characters we grew to love (and possible  dislike) from season 1 really showed more layers to themselves. Especially Rika chan was made to be seen in a completely different light, \r\nIn terms of story this is where I have to take my hat off to the creator.The story moved form a psychological thriller/horror to a beautifully developed and explained physiological mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThe season made a great job of explaining everything without dumbing it down. There were certain 'OMFG NOW I GET IT' moments which they didn't spell out to you. In doing so it made it a truly beautiful enigma you unfolded at your' own pace.\\n\\n\r\nArt and music remained pretty much the same from season, although I found the use of music effects to be much effective than season 1.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's an anime that took a completely different path to what I expected from season 1, and for this I think it made a formidable comeback to the disappointments I had in the last arc of season 1.",

            "content": "If you are reading this review, I am presuming that you have already finished the first series, so I'll be dealing on spoilers from season 1.\r\nAs I mentioned in my review of the first series, after meandering a bit too long in what seemed like disconnected, iterating plots with seemingly random variations, the series plays its ace: The revelation that a significant part of the events portrayed are presented as seen through the eyes of increasingly neurotic and paranoid people, to the point of sometimes being outright hallucinations. A brilliant case of \"unreliable director\", if you will.\r\nThe chief effect of that revelation is to bringinto focus the events that\u2014disregarding variation and apparent cause\u2014repeat themselves in each or most of the plot lines, as they become a rule to discern fact from hallucination. With the series' last (and unsurprising) revelation that one of the characters is jumping back in time a la Groundhog's Day, Higurashi goes all of a sudden from mediocre gory horror to enthralling mystery that you feel encouraged to solve.\\n\\n\r\nI was expecting Kai to go along the lines of the previous series, a succession of irrelevant, unrelated timelines where you would be able to glean some nuggets of truth from the information previously gained. However, where series one was abstruse, Kai was straightforward, happening in a mostly linear continuity. Where series one raised so many questions that you could only hope to be asking the /right/ questions, Kai dispenses answers and fills apparent plot holes with generosity. That is not to say that it is heavy handed or overly expository. I manages to artfully leave clues and outright answers just laying around for attentive viewers to pick up and make sense of.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big triumph of Kai is the character development, which had been almost completely stagnant in series one. Finally \"our heroes\" become real people that we can care for and cheer on as they start making use of their agency, as opposed to being the mere puppets that we cynically got to watch murdering and being murdered over and over.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, it needs to be mentioned, production values were raised across the board with greatly improved character design and animation. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a pity that series one was so flawed. Kai is so good that I actually went and raised the score I had initially given it first, but, similarly, I'm giving Kai a lower score than it deserves, because it cannot be enjoyed separately from that big mess. Nevertheless, both together are something that I definitely recommend.",

The overall story is now centered around Rika who was the person who has been experiencing these time loops with Hanyu, the true spirit of Oyashiro. Rika has relieved the same events over and over again trying to find a way for her and her friends to stay alive after June 14th*. After differentdecisions are made by her friends she notices some enormous differences in the previous timelines she has seen hoping this will end her hellacious time loops.\\n\\n\r\nThis show also gives the viewer the person responsible for the Hinamizawa murders the past five years. It is someone that even I would have never guessed it to be, and their backstory is just incredible.\\n\\n\r\nThe show surprisingly has okay comedy. (Spoilers) For example where the group is meeting with Mion and Shion Sonozaki's family to discuss how to get Satoko back from her abusive uncle, Keiichi states that Mion and Shion's father looks like a Yakuza leader to which one of them replies that he actually is one.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again the opening to Higurashi is pretty badass.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the second season are more fleshed out making them even more relatable and showing how strong their friendship has become. Also there are the minor characters who play a huge role to the story like Mion and Shion's grandmother.\\n\\n\r\nThere was only one pet peeve I have in anime and that is when there is more to an episode after the ending credits have finished showing. I don't mind if it's for comedic relief , but when it has to do with the main story it it really ticks me off. And this show only has I think one episode that has it. However, if the show continues during the end credits then I have no problem with it what so ever.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai not only exceeds its predecessor, but it also answers the questions that were left unanswered in the first season. But by far the best part of this show is its ironic ending. There were only one major problem I had with the show. Overall Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai is a great anime and a perfect sequel season.\\n\\n\r\n*Please correct me if I got the date wrong.",

The second season is definitely worth watching because it answers all of the questions that you may have had during the first season. Also, we get to know why certain characters behaved the way they did. Last episodes had great tension and kept me interested. I liked the ending a lot,because comparing to the sort of dark atmosphere throughout both seasons, ending was very suitable and made everything come to a good end. So the story was great for all of the reasons above.\r\n  I also want to mention that characters were developed very wellin this season and we got to see their emotions much more deeper.\\n\r\n  Can not ignore the fact that music and sound in general were on point! Opening theme is outstanding and all of the seiyus did an amazing job.",

            "content": "- English Review (Translated version)\r\nIt is clear that when one finishes watching \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\" what he wants is to see immediately his sequel looking for answers to the thousands of questions, doubts and incomprehensible events that have remained dormant in your head. Not understanding does not end well understood even the structure that has followed the story.\r\nAnd well, certainly \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai\" perfectly fulfills that role. I mean, it's the perfect sequel in the sense that it's not only a direct continuation (literally it could start seconds after the end of the first season), but it also clarifies andexplains each and every one of the loose ends that remained unresolved.\\n\\n\r\nThis is great, there is no doubt. Nobody likes to \"enjoy\" an incomplete story or leave too much to the viewer's imagination (with exceptions), but... also has a drawback, although it seems not. I explained: \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\" was a bewildering series, sinister, very dark and that at times almost dazzled you because of the incomprehensible and at the same time raw of what was being told. Well, in \"Kai\" this factor is completely lost. Something that otherwise is completely logical, even necessary if you want to clarify everything, but obviously the halo of mystery and surprise are lost and that was one of the strengths of its predecessor.\\n\\n\r\nIn exchange we have some odd twist script (mainly through Takano and even by Satoshi) and, as I said before, we can know and know absolutely ALL about Hinamizawa, its festival and its strange crimes. There will be nothing unexplained: all the deaths and disappearances (or \"disappearances\"), all the characters and their true role in history, all about that strange disease and, of course, the reason that supposedly there were different timelines (although this last allows him to glimpse already Rika in the last minutes of the previous season...).\\n\\n\r\nFor the rest and something obvious being a direct sequel, the list of characters is just as good, with some interestings incorporation. The sound section is as spectacular as ever, with the same melodies that gave such a good result before and with a new opening that, although different from \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\" (something obvious, since the tone of this season differs a lot as I said), it has a palpable quality.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, in \"Kai\" we have lost that mysterious and even terrifying halo that caught you, but the possibility that give us to know all the details and recesses of this interesting story makes it very worthwhile to return to Hinamizawa once again. If you liked the first batch, this is essential, without further ado.\\n\\n\r\nOyashiro-sama bless you (or maybe curse you).\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\\n\\n\r\nEst\u00e1 claro que cuando uno termina de visionar \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\" lo que quiere es ver inmediatamente su secuela buscando respuesta a los miles de interrogantes, dudas y sucesos incomprensibles que han quedado latentes en tu cabeza. Por no entender no se termina de entender bien ni siquiera la estructura que ha seguido la historia.\\n\\n\r\nY bueno, ciertamente \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai\" cumple perfectamente con ese papel. Quiero decir, es la secuela perfecta en el sentido de que no solo es una continuaci\u00f3n directa (literalmente podr\u00eda empezar segundos despu\u00e9s del final de la primera temporada), sino que adem\u00e1s aclara y explica todos y cada uno de los cabos sueltos que quedaron sin resolver.\\n\\n\r\nEsto es genial, no hay duda. A nadie le gusta que le dejen las historias incompletas o que dejen demasiado al criterio y la imaginaci\u00f3n del espectador (salvo excepciones), pero... tambi\u00e9n tiene un inconveniente, aunque parezca que no. Me explico: \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\" era una serie desconcertante, siniestra, muy oscura y que por momentos casi te aturd\u00eda debido a lo incomprensible y a la par crudo de lo que se nos iba narrando. Bien, pues en \"Kai\" se pierde completamente este factor. Algo que por otra parte es completamente l\u00f3gico, incluso necesario si quieren aclarar todo, pero obviamente el halo de misterio y la sorpresa se pierden y eso era uno de los puntos fuertes de su predecesora.\\n\\n\r\nA cambio tenemos alg\u00fan que otro giro de gui\u00f3n curioso (principalmente Takano mediante e incluso por parte de Satoshi) y, como he comentado antes, podremos conocer y enterarnos de absolutamente TODO sobre Hinamizawa, su festival y sus extra\u00f1os cr\u00edmenes. No habr\u00e1 nada que quede sin explicaci\u00f3n: todas las muertes y desapariciones (o \"desapariciones\"), todos los personajes y su verdadero papel en la historia, todo sobre esa extra\u00f1a enfermedad y, por supuesto, la raz\u00f3n de que supuestamente hubiera l\u00edneas temporales diferentes (aunque esto \u00faltimo lo deja entrever ya Rika en los \u00faltimos minutos de la temporada anterior...).\\n\\n\r\nPor lo dem\u00e1s y algo obvio siendo una secuela directa, la terna de personajes es igual de buena, con alguna incorporaci\u00f3n de m\u00e9rito. El apartado sonoro es tan espectacular como siempre, con las mismas melod\u00edas que tan buen resultado dieron anteriormente y con un opening nuevo que, aunque diferente al de \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\" (algo obvio, ya que el tono de esta temporada difiere bastante como he dicho), es de una calidad palpable.\\n\\n\r\nEn resumen, en \"Kai\" hemos perdido ese halo misterioso e incluso terror\u00edfico que te atrapaba, pero esa posibilidad que nos brindan de conocer todos los detalles y recovecos de esta interesante historia hace que merezca mucho la pena volver a Hinamizawa una vez m\u00e1s. Si te gust\u00f3 la primera tanda, \u00e9sta es imprescindible, sin m\u00e1s.\\n\\n\r\nQue Oyashiro-sama os bendiga (u os maldiga).",

Now each can't live without the other, but I have to give Higurashi Kai props. The first season does use it's fair amount of shocks to interest us, which is nice and all, but Higurashi Kai always leave me hanging off my seat, and it still isn't as gory.\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, Higurashi Kai was not what I expected, I thought it would be simpler than it was, but no, it's much more complex and it was definitely a pleasant surprise.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I'd love to give this a 10, it does have it's little nicks that downgrades it.\\n\r\nFor example how now one else notices Rika talking to herself except Satoko, and that's only sometimes. Also how when they fight, MION DOESN'T USE HER DAMN GUN. I mean yeah I understand you don't wanna kill em, BUT IT'S SELF-DEFENSE.\\n\\n\r\nAlso after the first arc, which had an ending that made us go like,\\n\r\n\"WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT!?\"\\n\r\nBut then they just set aside about 4 episodes to develop the antagonist and the other characters and I just personally think it was out of place after the first arc.\\n\\n\r\nBut I was really happy with the ending, but also a little confused, but hey, now I have Higurashi Rei to watch. \\n\\n\r\nBut overall, if I were to combine the first and second season, it would be a 20/10, I love this series so much and I can't choose which season is better. It may just be my favorite series right now, I highly recommend to watch this amazing thriller, mystery, believe me, you won't regret it.\\n",

Stay hours thinking how Rika knows something or what was those guys who takes Rika to the temple and them kills her...damn, that makes me see every episode of all the seasons of this anime!\r\nOf course it's a marketing affair, but It worked! (Not like Lost that have about 7 Seasons and it piss me off...)\r\nSo, if you want a little of Misteryand then Aswers, See Kai 1st. But If you one of LOVE the Lost-Way-Of-Life(Don't understand a shit), see the 1st season and then Kai.\\n\r\n2nd: The Art\\n\r\nIn Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, the art problems where corrected (I remember when, in the 1st Episode of the 1st Season, Keiichi got his eyes bigger than his head lol) and Its much better than the 1st season...though, Its a little Cliche I think, not an Inovating drawing.\\n\r\n3rd: Sound\\n\r\nThe sound its a good point...I really get into the Situation with the Soundtrack.\\n\r\nThey use it good...I mean, when you got Mistery, they make you fall into a Mistery Soundtrack that gives me creeps. Its really good.\\n\r\nAnd I'm not saying about the Intro...(Thats if fuckin beautiful!!!)\\n\r\n4th:Character\\n\r\nI still thinking that the creator of Higurashi its an Sadistic...\\n\r\nHe makes you love and BE the Characters and then he KILLs them in a brutal way. Thats what I call sadism.\\n\r\nashusauhashusuha\\n\r\nAnyway, I love Rika...really love her.\\n\r\nThe Characters are really carismatic.\\n\r\n5th: Enjoyment\\n\r\nHow can I say? I just watch EVERYTHING that is related of Higurashi and you still ask me about the Enjoyment?lol go and watch! It will be in your soul forever...\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nJust one word: WATCH!",

            "content": "If you enjoyed the style of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, but was left in utter shock by the end, the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai is simply for you. For myself, i had left the original series for a few months before eventually proceeding to watch this one. Thankfully i did. No spoilers\r\nStory\r\nThis version is done in the same style as the original except with an ending that actually makes sense. The plot is incredibly unique in a way that consistently leaves the viewer trying to guess what happens next. The story starts out with an opening episode, followed by a 4 episodearc. The real story begins to occur after this initial set up, so dont be deterred thinking its the same thing over and over again. It also includes a background of a few of the characters which is extremely helpful in understanding the story at a later point. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nNothing high quality here. Its a basic animation with a constant reminder that this is not real life. At times, the artwork almost seems way too plain and i find that it lacks the graphic details and perspective artwork to portray certain scenes in the best possible way. \\n\r\n7/10  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe character development is one of the reasons which makes the second season so much better than the first. Most of the characters have already been introduced in the first season and a basic development has already been established. Kai has a strong focus on Furude Rika, who now becomes the main character of the anime.\\n\r\n 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime has come a long way since the first season. The story which left viewers pondering finally comes to a full conclusion. The story is profound, the character development is great, and i rushed through the whole 24 episodes in just under 3 days. Needless to say i fully enjoyed it\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "The sequel to Higurashi. Less killing and more speeches? Does it work out? In the end, yes. It's just a lot of pain to get to there.\r\nKai continues the story of Higurashi, but instead of showing more arcs of everyone going insane and murdering each other, it concentrates more on solving why the mysterious events in Higurashi happen and put an end to them. Minus the first one, the arcs are much longer than they were, and the story has Rika as the main character instead of Keiichi.\r\nThe story? I don't know. You see, for me, Higurashi Kai has the worst arc of the show,hands down. The Massacre arc, the second arc after the 4 episode first one (which is probably my second-least favorite) is just terrible. Every episode is compromised of over 5 minutes of the same, dull speeches on how, by working together, you can overcome fate and create a miracle! Not to mention the fact that it's so slowly paced. The show more or less just waltz around not getting anything really accomplished for half of the arc. Fortunately, the final arc picks up the pace. While what happens in it is extremely stupid, it is well-executed enough that I can look beyond that. The background given to the show is very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, on the whole, does Kai provide a good ending for the show? Oh no. There's still so many things that have yet to be explained (such as the whole first arc of the series makes little sense still), and there's also several plot holes too. While they are easy to ignore and you might not even notice them if you don't think, if you do realize them, then it really lowers the quality of the show a bit. Also, the last like, 2 minutes of this make no sense whatsoever, but it doesn't really affect the plot, so it's rather easy to ignore.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters. Hm... Kai concentrates more on Rika, which is fine and all, she's a good character. However, the other main characters? They don't get much. You see, in normal mood the cast of Higurashi is vaguely pleasant and all, but none really stand out. It's when they go into crazy mood where they become the awesome characters they are, and they never really have a chance to go into crazy mood. They don't really even do much besides give speeches and offer some abilities to help save the day in the end. Rika does do a decent enough job pulling along the show by herself ot make up for it, but it's still a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation? It is better than the original (not like that's tough to do, though). Everyone actually manages to stay on model for the majority of the show. Well, minus the time they forgot to draw Mion's arm, but still. It's still obviously a low-budget show, just not obviously low-budget. The animation can get rather nice when it wants to, which is typically about once an episode. It's still pretty bad, but not as bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is the same as last season. Two great opening and endings, great voice actors, and a background track that doesn't stand out, but still adds to the mood.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a must-watch if you saw the original Higurashi season. While the first was better, Kai is not only necessary to understand the plot, but does some notable stuff on its own too. Do not watch this without viewing the original Higurashi though. You will be completely lost. I give Higurashi Kai 7 stars and say that you should watch it.",

The stories/arcs were great, the sound was great. Naraku no Hana was a quite enjoyable song. The art looked amazing but too cute.

            "content": "This is going to be a review for both Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni, and Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai, since I literally watched them back to back and I have a lot to say about this series. \r\nSo before I start, if I were to rate Higurashi based on only the first season, I would have given this series a 9/10. No question, but Kai really didn't come through with me, so my rating went down to a 8/10. Still good, but let me explain.\r\nThe story is already well known. \r\nA young boy named Keichi Maebara transfers to a small village close tothe mountains and befriends a group of school girls. Things look peaceful, but this little village holds lots of secrets.\\n\\n\r\nEven after ten years, Higurashi still stands the test of time. Keep in mind, this anime came out 10 years ago, but it is still relevant to this day. If you are a lot like me, you will come out of this anime thinking: \"Was this really made 10 years ago?\" You have that lingering sensation, that pit in your stomach, that you know some of the topics at hand are still discussed within society to this way. To name a few: the topic of bullying, abuse, hardship, abandonment, trust and most of all fate. At the end of the day, Higurashi heavily focuses on the friendship between all the main characters, but as I stated, there is so much more to it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for me, this is why I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season was tamer and not as scary/gory as the first one -reason why I was a little disappointment with the developments of the second one- but all in all, it's a series that I highly recommend anybody to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIt actually shows that not many things have changed in ten years since it first aired-regardless of what people may think. And within all this gore and horror, it demonstrates that -even if you were to have a replay button- life isn't easy, and we just need to go live it.",

            "content": "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai is a much different beast from first season of Higurashi, one that is rather more accessible on multiple fronts.  As a result, Kai lacks the same capacity for brutally scarring its audience, but this is a come-for-the-intestines-stay-for-the-heart sort of venture, so returning fans should still find the experience rewarding, and for more reasons than merely the promise of closure.\r\nWhere the first season of Higurashi explored its premise through multiple fractured story arcs that reset the narrative frequently, offering few answers to its many questions, Kai spends the majority of its run on two closely related, much morelinear arcs that seek to untangle the complicated web.  Likewise, where Higurashi's disjuncture led to the ensemble of club members sharing the revolving title of \"main character\" (and \"villain\"), Kai has an unequivocal central protagonist in Rika, whose perspective ties the events of the season together.  With this stable narrative structure, Kai leaves behind much of the theatricality and wanton sadism of the first season, devoting more time to setting straight the overarching plot than to ripping off fingernails.  \\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say that Kai lacks violence and gore altogether, but Hinamizawa's evisceration plague is more background circumstance than focus this time around.  I can't say that Kai has any scenes that are particularly difficult to sit through - and if there are, they would be depictions of Satoko's abuse that aim for emotional discomfort, not the stomach-turning physical revulsion of torture or something spine-chilling from the vault of horror.  Kai is more supernatural mystery than horror, which might be construed as an unfortunate step down by some, but there is no major loss; I would put Kai nearly on par with the first season overall.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi's greatest strength has always been its story, whose manifold branches and twisted tragedies make Higurashi one of the most absorbing and chilling horror enterprises of its generation; second come the characters, whose personalities become more heavily imprinted as they regress toward the mean with every new incarnation.  While the story continues to fascinate and only grows stronger with the increasing clarity offered by Kai, I do feel that the series's most powerful artistic expressions came from the diabolical fantasies of the first season.  You won't find in Kai any image as powerful as that of Rika stabbing herself in the head while Mion/Shion laughs maniacally over her corpse, or Rena's unceasing late-night apologies and terrifying cat eyes, or Keiichi bashing his friends' skulls in with a baseball bat.  \\n\\n\r\nOf course, more than simply another set of murders, I want (and feel entitled to) an uplifting ending for the characters I've gotten close to over 50 episodes, along with satisfactory conclusions to the innumerable plot threads initiated in that time, and Kai, to its credit, maintains its tension and mystery right to the last episode in the midst of all the exposition.  Even with the moderated focus on action and the more deliberate pace, the unearthly presence that surrounded the first season still infects Kai, if not in nearly as strong a dosage.  The charmingly bizarre friendship between these characters continues to grow, even as Rika takes the spotlight, and their proud abstention from stolid stereotypes makes them as compelling a group of protagonists as ever, perhaps more so as their positive qualities develop under these new circumstances.  The addition of Hanyuu to the roster further sands down some of the edges with more opportunities for moe moments, thanks in no small part to the wonderful talents of Yui Horie.\\n\\n\r\nKai's improved production values sweep away some of the most unflattering snags of the first season, or at least upscale the quality to more acceptable levels.  The performances and audio quality are stronger, the visuals much smoother; at the same time, while the animation hamstrings the presentation less often, the mildly unnerving effect of the distorting designs, off-model animation, and frequently crude illustrations added character to the first season.  That wasn't always the case - sometimes it just looked sloppy - and, once again, if Kai aims for mystery rather than fright, it's probably not as necessary to be so off-putting; still, Kai looks a little more ordinary.  Looking to Rei, Higurashi's first OVA series, the trend continued, with further polished designs that feel that much less unique.  The same trend can be observed in the OPs and EDs.  I grew to like Kai's OP a lot over the course of the series, but it's a bit of a culture shock stepping into a melancholy J-pop song after the hellish soundscape of the first season OP, which couldn't be scarier if it were performed by Anaal Nathrakh with Scott Walker.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kai isn't quite as striking or viscerally terrifying as its predecessor, but, while it won't leave as much of an impression as a result, Kai has different priorities, so it doesn't need to be a repeat of the first season.  The story and characters were more than enough to carry the first season through some rough waters and that is also true of Kai, whose long-awaited conclusion to the murder mystery/alien invasion/demon holocaust/government conspiracy/mass insanity/viral infection/hash-slinging slasher that gripped Hinamizawa will be fulfilling and enjoyable for any fan of the first season.\\n",

            "content": "After finishing both seasons of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, I feel compelled to give a review. This will focus on the second season, but I will draw comparisons to the first as well. If you want to watch the first season then skip this review to avoid any spoilers. While some people may be disappointed by Kai for a multitude of reasons, I found it to be about as good as the first! Let me explain.\r\nCharacters - 9/10\r\nThe characters are still awesome just like the first season. However, the focus is shifted to different members of the cast. Rika and Takano didn't get muchattention in the first season, but now, they have all the spotlight! \\n\\n\r\nRika Furude is a very determined character that the audience really wants to root for. Her main conflict throughout the series is challenging fate, as she has failed countless times. The audience really feels for Rika character and wants her to succeed. While she does doubt herself, she is not a weak character, and will pull through even the most difficult of times. I thought she had great development in this season, as she learns to place trust in those close to her in order to change the future.\\n\\n\r\nHanyuu is a new addition to the cast. She does have a noticeable character arc, but I don't want to give any details so you can see for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nMiyo Takano is one of the greatest villains that I've seen in an anime! She is sly, cruel, and manipulative. You will end up DESPISING her, yet she still gets a nice backstory to back her motivations. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is still decent. Not too much is developed from the first season, but considering the shift in focus to Rika as the protagonist, it makes sense. The first season gave even attention to the club members, and while focusing on one cast member can appear more boring, I will assure you that is not the case. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMy main gripes with this season is the plot. Now, I still found it to be really engaging and a rewarding experience. However, there were quite a few problems with it that made me give this section a lower score than the first season. To start, Kai is devoid of most of the horror elements from the first season. The original did a great job at building suspense. Much of the tension and atmosphere is lost in this series with the removal of the horror. If the first season was \"Silent Hill\", then the second is basically \"The Goonies\". All of the recommendations on the MAL page include shows such as \"Steins Gate\" and \"Madoka Magica\" as opposed to \"Elfen Lied\" and \"Another\". I wouldn't say that this different approach is bad, just very different, and viewers should be aware before going into this series expecting more slasher action.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to my next problem, and that is basically the ending. Without spoiling, I will just say that the last few episodes were a little silly when it came to resolving the conflict. Many of the situations towards the end are pretty unrealistic and hard to take seriously. If you think Ewoks beating Stormtroopers in \"Return of the Jedi\" was dumb, then you will NOT like the last act of this season. From such a mature series, I was definitely disappointed with the direction the story took by the end. Not to say that I wasn't satisfied with the outcome, I was more disappointed by how clumsily it was resolved. \\n\\n\r\nThe last problem I have with the plot is how the mysteries from the first season were answered. The first season of Higurashi mostly covered the \"Question\" chapters from the visual novel, while the second season covered the \"Answers\". Now, you do get answers to everything brought up in the first season, because honestly, the first season could be confusing for a lot of people. However, this season does the complete opposite by disrespecting the intelligence of the audience. You get your answers, but everything is extremely straightforward and forced. The writers REALLY want you to get what happened. This issue isn't that significant since you do in fact get resolution to all the shit in the first season, I just wish that it was executed better without all of the hand holding.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my complaints, the plot of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai is pretty good! There are many twists and turns and excellent world building to make up for the shortcomings. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a step up from the first season, which didn't have the best animation. The scenery of Hinamizawa looks great. All of the character designs stand out. Animation is generally very smooth and not jarring to look at. I don't have much more to add, the art in Kai is fairly well done.  \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound design is once again amazing in the Higurashi. Voice performances are spot on, the soundtrack is used very well, and the cicada cries can't go unmentioned. I also loved both the OP and ED, never skipped them! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite my issues with the plot, I still enjoyed Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai just as much as the first season! With an engaging story, great cast of characters, and an awesome soundtrack, it's hard not to enjoy this season if you liked the first.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is an amazing series, and if you've never seen the first season, then give it a chance! I don't like how this series gets compared to yandere schlock, there is much more to Higurashi than that. Every aspect of the series is very exceptional, and I think everyone should give it a try if they like murder mysteries and horror series.",

            "content": "About this series (First and second season) - Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni is a series that compiles a combination of gore, mystery, and beliefs. Beliefs can be thought of the act of spreading something that cannot be proved but is still spread to ensure that something is the cause of a strange event. For instance, an unsolved murder can easily be explained by priests. Priests would somehow relate the murder to a \u201ccurse\u201d or something that cannot be explained by the means of science. Higurashi progresses in a different way than other anime would; a complexity of different world or what I call \u201cdimensions\u201d.As an event occurs, it remains in its own dimension. In simple terms, there are save points within this anime. At every bad end, the story goes back to the previous save point. This procedure would eventually be explained more specifically in season 2. \\n\\n\r\nStory- At the beginning of this series, audiences is deluged with many questions. This anime engrosses its audience by building up suspense within the audiences by leaving us with a question by the end of the episode. These \u201ccliffhangers\u201d at every episode make us speculate and theorize every upcoming event of an episode. This is what makes Higurashi special. As the anime keeps on progressing, many questions are answered. This anime flows perfectly in a smooth way that the audience can follow. Additionally, the spread of belief throughout the series makes others understand more about the rejection of a society. The rejection of a society can differ in many ways. In this series, it can be described as being neglected and despised by others. Not being able to be content with one\u2019s belief or defying its existence can contribute to the rejection of a society. The society may not have tolerance towards as such acts. This theme is another positive attribute in this series. \\n\\n\r\nArt- The artwork in this anime can be described as a masterpiece; as it represents and fits in the anime perfectly, similarly as a perfect shoe size. The features of characters usually change drastically. Features such as a character\u2019s face, movement, and eyes. The female characters seem typically attractive and good-looking. When they appear to be frustrated, they appear to have a completely different art style; a frightening art style. \\n\\n\r\nSound- Followed by eerie and extraordinary soundtracks, a scene seems to intensify. The soundtrack attracts the audience by emphasizing a dark and eerie surrounding. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The majority of characters in this series become relevant in the plot, as it progresses.  The behavior of a character and their actions mostly contribute to different events, which enriches the existence of certain characters. Characters learn to avoid certain paths, which enhances their existence as characters. The main character in the second season faces internal conflict multiple times and clearly expresses internal conflict by having ideas of the consequence of a method. However, several characters in the second season suddenly appear without the procedure of introducing a background story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Developing theories of each outcome by the end of an episode; trying to solve the mysteries within the anime was my personal enjoyment throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: This series had so much to offer: the abrupt change in art style, developed characters, and apocalyptic soundtracks. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai! Yes, say it 5 times fast. I'm going to start my review by referencing the first season. First of all, to fully understand and enjoy the series, you will definitely have to indulge in the gore soaked mayhem of the first season. I personally wasn't huge on the first season because nothing ever seemed to develop. It was just a giant loop or violence for various reasons. The stories didn't tie together or achieve anything larger. That being said, I rank the first season a 6/10 BUT.. understand, it is a very importantwatch it to understand the amazing second season.\\n\\n\r\n      Let's get to the main subject, being of course the season at hand. Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai somehow caught my interest, and I was planning on just humoring myself with another mediocre piece while waiting on/selecting a different series. I went in not expecting much, but I was utterly shocked almost immediately. The opening song was the first indication of the enjoyment to come. The glitchy sound played in the track built up suspense and mystery. This series kept me on my feet with a great story. The villain was well developed, and could not be predicted until the writers wanted you to know. The character development was on point, flawlessly using every piece to complete the puzzle. I was constantly on the edge of my  seat, waiting for what might happen next. \\n\\n\r\n        Negatives/cons! Here we go! Every fan boys nightmare, critical comments on their beloved favorite. I must admit, the animation was a bit dodgy at times. A bit more detail could have been added, but I understand why they  would want to match it with the first season. Furthermore, I couldn't help but desire more information at times. The villain had a great backstory, but after the episode, I asked myself, \"What happened to that place?\" There were times when certain stories needed a little fine tuning. \\n\\n\r\n     Overall, I was astounded with this series. I didn't expect much, even if it was a polar opposite of the first season, I couldn't see myself giving this more than a 7, but my predictions were blown out the water. I liked this series a lot. I recommend for those into mystery/thriller type anime. Make sure to watch the first season first! \\n\\n\r\nAs for Kai, I give it 9/10 syndrome injections\\n\r\nAs a whole, a dashing 8.5/10 damn projects",

Well, after season two, everything is clear.\r\nBasically the second season explains what actually happened in the first season and brings us end of the plot. You eventually find out what was the whole anime about. There is not much to say about it. \r\nThe quality is as good as the season one. There are no big differences.  Maybe I should mention that there is less scary atmosphere than in the first season. Everything much more lighter andnicer. Like when night ends and the sun is slowly spreading it's light to the world.\\n\\n\r\nI know this was quick but I guess I described this anime well in my review for the first season.

            "content": "***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***\r\nThe second season of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is great.\r\n*****SPOILERS ALERT*****\r\n*****\r\n****\r\n***\r\n**\r\n*\r\nInstead of a number of short story arcs as with the first season, the second season features long story arcs. While everything goes wrong in the first season, the second season shows how the various tragedies can be avoided and finally, the cause of everything that has happened. Through the many deaths in the first season, the characters finally have the means to fight against their grim fates. Throughout the anime, I find myself rooting for the characters and when they succeed, I celebrate with them.\r\nThis quite drastically changes the toneof the anime from one where the characters are led down into death and despair to one where the characters are actively resisting death and despair. From tragic to epic. This tonal shift perfectly justifies splitting 50 episodes into two seasons instead of just one long one. It's almost a different anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not all about \"fighting against fate\". One important part shows a helpless victim of circumstance and it's great. It shows exactly the events that lead up to forming the malevolent character, how the character changed after living through so much.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art was improved from the previous season but it's still basically the same art style, simple and cutesy. It gives the moments where people are serious more weight since the characters suddenly become more detailed.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the music is the same as the first, it blends into the background and sets the mood. The track titled \"Main Theme\" is still used and to great effect.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, after seeing so much go wrong for the characters in the first season, it became surprisingly nice to see things go right. I would normally feel that so much going the way of the protagonists is contrived but it somehow just feels right in this case. It may be because I want to see them have some good as a kind of redemption for all the suffering before, maybe.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the segment at the end of every episode, the preview for the next episode, was a nice addition. I looked forward to that part whenever I saw the credits. It's fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's an excellent sequel that wraps up the series neatly.\\n\\n\r\n9/10",

I thought i was going to watch more kids get killed and see gore every episode, but Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai makes you learn MORE about the story than in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. Cute little Rika is the main character in this one, she tries her best to change the future, but can the future really change? can rika actually get everyone to believe her? can she get everyone on her side and tell them what is going to happen before it happens? you'll know once you watch this season.\r\nStory 10/10- I likethe story more than Higurashi no Naku Koro ni just because Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai gets into MORE detail about whats going on in the village, yes Higurashi no Naku Koro ni did say whats going on, but i feel like this would actually be the first season if the 2ed season didnt have spoliers from the first season (hopefully that made sense)\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10- Same art as Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10- same as Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\\n\\n\r\ncharacter 10/10- the characters in this season really shows how far someone can go for friendship and how an outcome can either change for good or bad but which one is it?? =)\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment 8/10- I know i wrote good things about it, why is it at the 8, i went in thinking it was a blood fest like Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8/10- This was really good and this will be the last Higurashi i might watch, not because its bad, i just perfer to watch rated 17+ animes and every Higurashi after this its rated PG 13+. but this anime is still very good and it way more detail than the first, after seeing Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai it made me re-download Higurashi no Naku Koro ni because i feel like i missed out on important things about the story. \\n",

            "content": "Okay! Stop! I was lying! I wasn't tired! I came back for a review of this second season considering how good it was!! Please don't beat me up!!\r\nAight. Hello again. Deusen Moose here, with another review. I lied about saying I was tired in the last review of the original Higurashi, but I just couldn't stay away from doing this review. This is so much better than the first season, I just... just couldn't keep my hands away from the keyboard.\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai takes a turn and bases the story off of Furude Rika. I said that in my last review, butthat season wasn't based off of Rika. It was morally based around Keiichi , in others eyes, but I really like this season better than the first one. There's a lot of reasons why.\\n\\n\r\nFurude Rika won't stop dying. She keeps on dying over and over again, but often reincarnated into the same world to overcome the same fate. She gets her friends to help her, but, sometimes they don't succeed, but I can't really give away any more details. But, basically, Rika is a millennium year old girl who just wants to escape fate, grow older, and get breasts. Literally. She mentions that she wants breasts in one of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe graphics in this season are quite improved. Yes, I won't shut up about the graphics. Maybe I should of been called 'Graphics Critic'. But, they're slightly improved and Rika's hair color changed, don't know why, pretend not to notice it... No don't look directly at it! Goddamit! You idiots!\\n\\n\r\nEh... now... the soundtrack in this one is...\\n\\n\r\nPURE GOLD.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this season is extremely legendary! The opening song to the anime is so great, I even know how to sing it! I know, it kind of sounds weird, but I can actually sing this entire song, not sing, but I know all the words to it. I can pronounce them perfectly. In the first season, I didn't know what the fuck was being said.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack alone, without the anime, would make a great performance at a concert. Yes, I am saying this. You gonna bust my head open with Satoshi's metal baseball bat? Didn't think so. But, not a lot of people would appreciate the Japanese music, because they're cocks, and they don't appreciate Japanese culture, the racist cocks. Enough jibber-jabber. To the TARDIS! What? I didn't say anything.\\n\\n\r\nI only really have to introduce a couple new characters, but the characters are truly awesome. I don't even know if I have to introduce characters, but just tell the audience how good they are. Audience. I seriously used that term?\\n\\n\r\nI forgot to mention Kurado Ooishi who is the head of police, I think. He often helps Keiichi and the gang through tough situations, but gets 420 noscoped by somebody on his way to Rika's house.\\n\\n\r\nAkasaka whatever his first or last name is, is actually one of my favorites. He took a punch to the chest, and beat the crap out of that guy that I forgot the name of. He's so epic. I guess you could call him... CHEST OF STEEL!! No? Anyone?\\n\\n\r\nJirou Tomitake is actually of more importance in this season. He often is a spy to Miyo Takano, who is the main antagonist of this season. She is the one that, does that stuff I mentioned above about killing. So, he is often set as a spy, and often is killed by Takano. Is that a spoiler, I don't know anymore... Or maybe he survives. I forget.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the characters are just awesome. AWESOME.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this season much more than the first season. The first season made me make a what the fuck face the entire season, not knowing what the fuck was going down. This season made more sense to me, considering they were the answer arcs of the story. I think overall, this anime deserves a 10. It cleared so much things that happened in the first season...\\n\\n\r\nSo... it gets a 10. You fine with that? Huh? HUHHH!!?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy the anime as much as I did, if not, more.",

            "content": "An amazing anime that is a bit like Marmite in that you either love it or hate it.  The story is at first purposefully confusing, however, as the anime progresses the story begins to make more sense, little by little in its own abstract way.\r\nThe characters are pretty weak, namely only being different from the absolute anime steriotypes by the way they kill eachother off.  Despite this you feel for the characters and they do develope slightly by the end of the anime.\r\nThe content darkens as the series goes on.  If you are planning on watching this for the slice of lifesegments look for another anime.  The horror and unease surrounding each moment after a certain way through is huge.  I personaly like anime that can scare me sometimes but if youre not like that then like I said, look away.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is magnificent.  Not so much in quality but iin suitability.  At first I was put off by the simplictic drawing but the art fitted so well with the content that I developed a temporary discrimination against non stylised anime in general.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime immensly and I can say without a doubt it is one of the few anime that has stuck in my head as a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Alright, M2's second ever review! I'll assume that most of you are familiar with Higurashi already, for convenience's (and spoiler's) sake. Being a long-time Higurashi fan, I'll be an authority to encounter if you want to know about the story.\r\nWe'll begin with the characters. For those of you who've watched the series, don't worry, the characters you all know and love are still here. And you get to watch them show more and more of their talents. In Higurashi no naku koro ni, you're introduced to the major characters: Keiichi, Mion, Shion, Rika, Satoko, and Rena(She scares me sometimes( ._.)). You should go in actuallyknowing the characters, because you notice just how much they change. You would never have guessed how each character reacts to their new situations, or what they act around normally.\\n\r\nBut, you don't just experience the old characters develop, you also meet a new friend with a unique past, Hanyuu. She eventually becomes one of the most important characters throughout the series regardless of being a new face (with leeches attached to it...).\\n\r\nFinally, some of the minor characters, such as Irie and Takano, gain extremely big roles, monumentally important roles, far beyond what anyone would expect.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you familiar with Higurashi no naku koro ni's art, you'll find that the artwork is almost exactly the same. You would find that the artists haven't failed at depicting the righteous and fatal insanity we've grown to love in their eyes and features, and you won't be disappointed by the new characters' designs.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sounds, Kai's OP, \"Naraku no Hana\", by Eiko Shimamiya, the same vocalist who did the first season's opening, does not fail to provide a similar, but even more beautiful with it's dramatic changes and symbolic, with it's lack of the mysterious chants in the background, and instead a cry out to \"run away\" from the fate which we've all grown accustomed to Higurashi presenting us. The sad calls and violent lyrics of \"Taishou A\", the ED call out to us to bring forth call forth to share the sadness we once felt for our beloved characters' deaths, regardless of their insanity, and the tears we're sure to have fall down our face while watching.\\n\\n\r\nAh, the story. It can be summed up simply as the answers to almost all of our questions from season one. I won't go into too much detail, but we find out what's really going on. Questions such as \"Didn't everybody just die?\", \"Why the hell is this happening?\", and \"What's going on here?!\" are answered. We also discover the series' true antagonist, as well as the beautiful will to struggle against the endless cycles of death that we've watched over and over again. We finally can leave this experience with a sense of closure, a sense that this was fitting, overall, given the series of Higurashi.\\n\r\nThe story consists of multiple arcs, which, if I went into any detail with, would end up being spoilers, considering I can't keep my mouth shut when it comes to Kai.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a tear-jerking finale to the blood-ridden episodes I spent my freshman days relishing, a kind of resolution and answer to all of my questions within the series, and finally, something that appeals to deep moral and philosophical issues, such as \"good\" and \"evil\", as well as inducing a kind of an understanding of why people perform things that would be considered morally wrong.\\n\\n\r\nMy Grade for Higurashi Kai: 99.9999999....%\\n\r\nThis is definitely worth watching, even if you have to sit through so much bloodshed first in order to watch it.",

            "content": "When They Cry is back with another season that promises to explain most of the series\u2019 mysteries and give an answer to all the questions. If you\u2019ve watched the first season of When They Cry, you probably know that it got pretty bloody at times and it didn\u2019t fail to shock its viewers several times. Well, the second season doesn\u2019t continue in exactly the same tradition, but more on that later in my review.\r\nFirst, let\u2019s get familiar with the story. I highly recommend you skip reading this if you haven\u2019t gotten the chance to see the first season of When They Cry (you can findmy review of that right here), because I can\u2019t really explain what the heck happens in the second season without any spoilers whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like we already know by now, the events during a certain time span seem to be repeating themselves over and over, often ending with the death of one or more main characters. In the last episodes of the first season we learn that Rika Furude seems to be aware of what is happening. I\u2019m pleased to say that a lot of stuff will be explained right from the very first episodes of this season and it will become easy to understand why everything happened the way it did.\\n\\n\r\nThe explanation may prove to be quite thorough and fortunately won\u2019t leave to many plotholes open, though it will not be as satisfying as expected for some of its audience. First of all, it\u2019s obvious that when something so mysterious and eerie gets a logical explanation much of its magic disappears and the series won\u2019t feel as creepy as before. Actually, scratch that. The entire creepiness that we were all too familiar in season one is now gone.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is the creepiness that made this anime so fantastic gone, but there is also close to zero gore in the second season, even though that\u2019s what made When They Cry so popular and disturbing. The entire horror element of the series is gone, in other words, and while some may not be as bothered with that as others, I feel that the anime just lost an essential element in what made it so effective and fun.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the second season will play out more like a thriller than anything else, where the characters will keep founding clues and getting more and more pieces of the puzzle put together. That may not be such a bad thing to start with, but unlike the first season most of it plays out without too much action or interesting events. The pacing is also much slower now and some arcs can drag on for quite a couple of episodes, even though their importance is not that big in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I wanted to like When They Cry 2 mainly because the first season is one of my favourite anime series ever, I have to say that I am quite disappointed in the direction this season decided to take. It just didn\u2019t do it for me, and while I know I can\u2019t speak for everyone right now, I\u2019m sure that most will agree that something was lost in the transition between this and season one.\\n\\n\r\nUp until now I\u2019ve only criticized When They Cry 2, but there are lots of good things in it as well. The main characters that we\u2019ve come to grow fond of are back and better than ever. I may even dare say that they are written better than in the first season and even the comedic parts of the series are funnier and more entertaining to watch. Season two doesn\u2019t introduce too many new characters, but it sure makes use of the few new ones. The most important new character would have to be Hanyuu, a young girl who seems to be invisible to everyone but Rika. She and Rika share a much deeper relationship than what is revealed at first.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of When They Cry 2 has also received quite an upgrade compared to its predecessor. Many consider the first season\u2019s weakest point to be its animation, but the visual aspect in this one feels much more polished and worked on. The additional detail put into the character\u2019s looks is probably the most noticeable part of this change. Even though the first season\u2019s look was rather simplistic, I have to say that I did not have any problems with it. Furthermore, I seemed to enjoy the look of the first season more than this one. Again, some may actually like the art in When They Cry 2 more, but I just feel that it now looks a bit too polished for the series\u2019 overall atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nIt may have proven to be a bit of a disappointment for me, but When They Cry 2 remains a solid anime that has a lot of good stuff going for it. Halfway through it may become a bit tiring, but the final episodes are definitely worth it all and they offer a great deal of closure to it all. This is definitely a must for those who enjoyed the first season and want to get their questions answered, but if you\u2019re like me and thought that the horror and mystery elements were the ones that made this anime so awesome, it actually wouldn\u2019t be such a bad idea to skip it, if only to remain with that eerie image that left a mark on you in the first season.",

            "content": "Overview: Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni (Kai, the sequel will be included as part of the review) is probably the only anime of the mystery/horror genre that succeeds at what it's defined to be. Sure, there are other good mystery anime, like Gosick, or other good horror anime, like Mirai Nikki, but neither of those really fit those respective genres. Higurashi not only is a fantastic mystery/horror anime, but a fantastic series in general.\r\nStory: 35/37\r\nThe story of Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni (Kai) is a little tough to go into without spoilers, but I will attempt to explain the general setup. Most of the firstseason is divided into short 4-5 episode arcs. In total, there are 4 of these arcs, and each arc is more or less a \u201crepeat\u201d of what happened in the previous arc, but with time reset, and different events occurring. Now, these first 4 arcs are called \u201cQuestion Arcs\u201d, and it is highly unexpected for the audience to understand what the point of the show is, or even what's going on in several situations. However, not only is that part of what makes this show a GREAT mystery anime, but all of these arcs are fun to watch, and have plot twists within themselves. The last couple of arcs from the First Season, and the first arc from the Second Season are essentially non-related to the primary 8/9 arcs. However, these \u201cSide-Arcs\u201d are also amazing, and serve to give important background information and by the first arc of the Second Season, the audience should be getting some hints, and possibly figure out what the over-arching story-line is. Finally, by the end of this first arc of the Second Season, the next 4 arcs consist of what are called \u201cAnswer Arcs\u201d. These arcs, with some exception, are essentially re-tellings of the first 4 arcs from different points of view which serve to answer many of the unknowns in the Question Arcs. This might sound boring, but in reality, these episodes are also great and extremely well put together in order to keep things 100% fresh. By the end of the Answer Arcs, the audience has figured out \u201cwho the main character is\u201d along with \u201cwho the main antagonist is\u201d and things like this, and the final arc is longer, and is pretty much what you'd expect out of a standard, good guys vs. bad guys anime, since, in general, all of the mysteries have been solved. \\n\r\nI have to provide a special mention here, because after getting through the answer arcs, I felt let down. How could there be such a long arc when there are no more serious mysteries left to be solved, in such a mystery-centric anime. However, I cannot say, in any way, that I wasn't absolutely thrilled with this Final Arc (minus the first couple more boring episodes). This Final Arc is absolutely amazing in its own way, and I loved the entire series' complicated but carefully explained story.\\n\r\nBack on topic, while this was probably one of the most boring Story sections I have written, it should in no way alert you to the possibility that I wasn't just as amazed with this Story as any other anime deserving a boggling 35/37, but there is too much to say to waste too much space on unnecessary rambling. In summary, the Story of Higurashi is one of the best, if not the best I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 33/37\\n\r\nThe characters in Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni (Kai) are difficult to talk about, just like the story. On one side of things, there really aren't any characters who stood out to me like a Gasai Yuno, or an Okabe Rintarou which is why I can't really give this anime a perfect score on Characters, but... on the other hand, the way that almost every character who is mentioned is integral, in some way, to the plot is amazing, and all of the characters are extremely well written and always, without exception, match the personalities that they become known for as you watch the show. All of the characters have significant flaws (which are intended), but seeing the main protagonists interact with each other in the lighter, and the darker (and I mean DARKER) moments provide probably as much entertainment as a show like Kokoro Connect, which is the only anime that I will ever award a perfect score on Characters for. To be honest, I can't even say what makes the characters not as good as those from Kokoro Connect, but something about them just isn't \u201cquite\u201d as perfect. Regardless, there is not a single character I didn't like culminating in one of the best casts I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 17/25\\n\r\nAs usual, I don't really have a lot to say about the art, but it was average. It definitely isn't the best looking anime I've seen, and it loses some points for not looking as good as an anime its age could, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with it, and many of the characters and backgrounds are endearing.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few things that decide sound for me: the opening/ending (more emphasis on the OP), series soundtracks, and voices/sound effects. The opening to Higurashi is one of my favorites, although I do admit that I seem to like a lot of anime openings for non Slice-of-Lifes. It's chilling, and the animation behind it is awesome though. It's a shame that the second OP and the EDs aren't as good, but they aren't bad either. The ambient sounds are fine, and the voice actors and actresses are absolutely great and really pull of the casts personalities well. While I usually don't even mention sound effects, with some of the brutality that happens in this show, Higurashi's sound effects appropriately do justice to the horrifying scenes and otherwise.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRomance: 0/1\\n\r\nThis section is basically whether or not there was a romance that I enjoyed. Sorry if this is a spoiler, but I particularly enjoy watching a romance develop, and I wished that other reviews would tell me if I was going to get to see one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 85/100\\n\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro Ni (Kai) was an anime that I wanted to watch for a while, but kept putting off. In some ways I'm glad I did so, since that meant I got to enjoy it to the fullest over the summer, but this is, hands down, the best mystery anime out there. It's the best horror anime I've seen as well, and all of this is paced well and kept in check by the cute, but powerful character interactions throughout the seies. I recommend this show to anyone who likes to think, but warn you that it is, unlike most other anime that claim to be mystery, in fact centered around a mystery and will require attention and thought in order to get the fullest enjoyment out of\\n\\n\r\nDeductions in points from the score are my attempt at being as objective as I can, but they will be listed here in case anyone reading this cares more or less about anything I take points away from:\\n\\n\r\n-There are one of two episodes that feel slightly out of place in the series, and seemed practically like filler. Good filler episodes, but filler nonetheless.\\n\r\n-The art style is consistent, but just seems really outdated for no apparent reason, and really could be a lot better (although there are some definite advantages to the style, especially in some of the darker (thematically) moments).\\n\\n\r\nIf you have any questions about my review (or want to talk about anything at all, really), feel free to email me at: nickwillis64@gmail.com\\n",

            "content": "(WARNING: This review is being made with the belief that the reader has already watched Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, and will be geared towards Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai - or Kai for short - as a sequel.)\r\nI was not the biggest fan of the first installment of Higurashi. While there were several things it did well, I felt like it threw away a lot of opportunities with its mediocre SoL segments that went on for way too long (many times without going anywhere in character development), awful awful animation and its over-dependence on sequels. I am, however, happy to say that Kaisolves many of these problems.\\n\\n\r\nKai adapts the remaining \"answer arcs\" of the original visual novel series. By giving more answers, it is retroactively \"fixing\" a lot of what didn't made sense in the first anime, since the original visual novel series required these arcs to function. While I can't say these answers are without fault (some of it is a bit generic and convoluted), they are nonetheless, answers and an \"okay\" answer is better than no answers.\\n\\n\r\nThis focus towards answering what the fuck was going on in the first series also changes a bit how the series is structured. For once, there's a lot less focus on horror, which is sad because the first Higurashi did horror perfectly, but the sequel compensates by having a better story. It also changes from the 5-6 episode arcs which played out like horror movies so you could watch all of the episodes of the arc at once every once in a while, to a more connected plot-line approach, specially on the later half, which is completely covered by an 11 episode long arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters also seem a lot better this time. Rika finally gets her time to shine as the protagonist of this story, and she is great. We also finally see more of the legendary Satoshi-kun which didn't appear all that much in the original series, only being talked about, and Satoko (his sister and also main character) is even more developed. Shion is also not a crazy bitch in Kai, which is also a plus. The real star of the show however is the main villain, which I'm not gonna spoil. Around half of the final arc is dedicated to them and the way they go off the deep end is absolutely cringe-inducing in how brutal and relatable it is. While you still want them to go fuck themselves in the end it is hard to not feel bad about how they got to where they are.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the more serious part of the show, the lighthearted also got a lot better! The comedy made me laugh a lot more this time, and the new characters adds fresh air to the combination (I'm not going to spoil who it is so you'll just have to watch it). The SoL is also a lot better paced since apart from being decent by itself the show makes sure to add little hints of what the characters really are here and there that make you think \"ohhh\". That is also helped by the fact that the main character is Rika this time and not Keiichi, and Rika is always at alert mode even when things are going fine.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, Kai is a lot better than the first one. The art is more detailed and endurable. It's still generic and low budget but it is not shit which is what matters. They also took the glorious facial expressions from the first one which was the main thing that people brought when argumenting whether the art was good or bad and showed that you do not need to be shit in order to be psycho. The sound is still amazing as always, with the OP being almost on par with the first one's and the ED being amazing and surprisingly enough quite animated which isn't expected for a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a sequel that did everything the original did right (even the horror; though it wasn't as prevalent, it was great when it did happen) and more. While you may have to slog (either for the first or second time) through the first one to watch this (in which case I recommend waiting 1 or 2 weeks between arcs so the SoL is more bearable), it is very well worth it.",

            "content": "Critic\u2019s Log - Earthdate: May 12, 2013. Review #47: Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni: Kai\r\nWell, I survived the horrors that I saw in Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni. And... I am prepared for more. With that said, let\u2019s get out of this tunnel from hell with Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni: Kai.\r\nThe endless cycle of hatred and death that befell the small village of Hinamizawa still continues. Rika Furude is the sole witness of all those tragedies and she tries to find a way out of it with her friends' help, without knowing if there is one after all.\r\nTo be technical, this is another StudioDeen production and this is the sequel of Higurashi. If you think that Higurashi Kai has better quality of animation, you would be half-right. The character designs do look the same and the animation is in the same style that the first show has, but what is upgraded are the aesthetics and the show does look nice compared to the first season. Like the first series, the animation isn\u2019t perfect in Higurashi: Kai but it still looks nice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Kenji Kawai is recycled from the first season, but it is still used effectively and still worth listening to with or without the show. So there\u2019s not much room for me to bring up the music this time, however, The opening is great and the closing is pretty decent.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to voice acting, The Japanese Cast is excellent and an English Dub does not exist in this show. Allow me to explain why this is the case. Geneon was the original licensor of the American release of the first Higurashi anime and well...Geneon went under a few years back. Funimation acquired this anime shortly after but they did not make an English Dub to it as well as an official American release to it. Also, Funimation\u2019s license for Higurashi expired. Making this an Unlicensed Anime for the U.S. My policy with anime is that I don\u2019t review new animes that have not been licensed in the U.S. yet. With Higurashi: Kai, I will make an exception. With that said, The Japanese cast just as good as the first series. There isn\u2019t a bad one in the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as character development goes. Higurashi: Kai has proven to make this topic a lot more interesting. I may have pointed out that character development was a bit hard to analyze because of the \u201cresetting\u201d of the story after the ends of each arc. Well... Higurashi takes a twist in things. For instance, Keiichi is the main lead in the first season. This is made perfectly clear. However, in Higurashi: Kai. It turns out that Rika Furude is the main lead this time. This is one of the few major changes between Higurashi and Higurashi: Kai. Another major change is the tone. Remember when the first Higurashi season had those pants-pissing terrifying moments? Well, that almost plays no part in Higurashi: Kai. Instead of being a Horror anime, Higurashi: Kai is a thriller instead. This could be a turn off for some that were hoping that Higurashi: Kai would have those horrific moments that the first season was known for. As far as character development goes, it is mostly fleshed out to an extent that the development is better than the first . Or maybe that they intentionally developed them in the second season, but I digress. It is much more developed this time. There\u2019s even some thought-provoking moments too but you really have to pay attention in this show to really understand.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the change in genre for Higurashi really does throw a major twist in things. Is this bad? You know what... No! Even though the two seasons combined isn\u2019t balanced, The thriller aspect of Higurashi: Kai really works to the show\u2019s advantage most of the time. The thing I was pleased with is the explanation to why the story kept resetting. I have an analogy for you in case you\u2019re still confused. The \u201cResetting\u201d is like when you play The Legend of Zelda: Majora\u2019s Mask and you play the Song of Time to go back to The First Day and all that. If you saw the first Higurashi season, you would know that the story begins and later on, the majority of characters are meeting terrible fates and it starts all over again. The deaths are really terrible to witness, and they were horrifying. Just remember, when the story arc ends, the Song of Time would be played off-screen. There\u2019s my analogy. Link must be somewhere off-screen and I wish he could\u2019ve stopped playing The Song of Time earlier because I had to witness these cruel events that took place in the first season. Why am I still talking about Zelda? in the end, Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni had one groundbreaking factor, and that is the unconventional narrative that the first season had as well as this, everything else isn\u2019t as groundbreaking, But this is a series that has to be seen if you\u2019re a buff of Horror or Thriller that both have mystery attached.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi No Naku Koro Ni: Kai was never licensed in the U.S. look this series up somewhere at your own leisure.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, Higurashi: Kai makes some twists and turns but still manages to be just as good as the first season, even though it\u2019s a Thriller and not a Horror anime, it\u2019s just as watchable as the first season. It explains some or most of the confusion and this should be seen if you liked the first season but was confused along the way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI give Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni: Kai a 7.5 out of 10, it is GOOD!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment, and let\u2019s play Old Maid.",

            "content": "Review 18: Higurashi When They Cry (simply wtf factor)???\r\nUmmm, does weird cover this series???? \r\nOr just manic and insane tell you enough????\r\nThis amazing series of Anime teaches us all what true confusion whilst trying to figure out what's going on is like. This is already a world wide famous anime that's been out for years, but to me only a recent discovery which has amazed me so far.\r\nIf you've already watched this anime then you'll know what I mean by confusing. People usually get to episode 8 out of 26 and give in because their un intrested.\r\nTheir wrong....\r\nUp to episode 4 we see our maincharacters learning all about a curse which has haunted Hinamizawa for 5 years. everyday, on the same day of every year 1 person will die and 1 will go missing along with that person. in certain cases 2 people will die instead of one, both in mysterious circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've watched some of these episodes than there will be absolute confusion, that's if you don't read in to it. Every 4 episodes the scenario restarts. I won't ruin it for you as the first 4 episodes don't make much of an impact or impression.....But one, well 3 if you count those insane characters too, die.....All within episode 4.\\n\\n\r\nStraight after episode 4....Boom!!!! Their all alive again and happy as can be. I feel as if they've done this to show all of the ways you can possibly die from Oyashiros curse, and all of the possible outcomes small decisions can make.\\n\\n\r\nOyashiro, he is the guardian of Hinamizawa who supposidly looks over the villagers... But in this Anime the guardian does the opposite of what it should do. Apparently when 1 sin is committed you will either die or go missing, if you die someone close to you will go missing. If someone goes missing, someone close to them will die.\\n\\n\r\nI won't say anything about the characters in this story apart from the fact that the main cast will either be seen at least once or those 4 episodes will be based on that character. The main bunch that we see are quite unusual and happy, each of them have their own individual side which is eerie, creepy and slightly disturbing. So I'm going to let you all have your own experience with this Anime.\\n\\n\r\nit is a great watch from start to finish, with parts that don't make sense till later, to parts of the puzzle which you have to fit together yourself to figure out the true meaning of the story. An amazing Anime which I'm going to finish watching no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nFriday 7th Febuary 2013. 8:55. ~AmyXxx",

Although i still prefer the first season, I enjoyed Higurashi Kai almost as much. \r\nThe story was mainly set around Rika trying to change her destiny, and everyone else's in Hinamizawa. The art was still as great as season 1s, the opening theme was still good, and, in my view, it had more of a plot.\r\nSo if youenjoyed Higurashi no naku koro Ni and want more of it, here is the sequel for you to enjoy!",

It gets even darker, and character background is further elaborated, especially the characters Rika and Takano. The mystery is further developed yet answers are also provided.
