            "content": "Have you ever had trouble spotting a bottom-of-the-barrel title? Finding the product of studio algorithm, where the intent is solely that of a product and nothing more? Shows with as much integrity as a used car salesman with a tacky poker-dot tie, or as much validity as McDonald's promoting \"health\" through thinly cut apple slices and a bottle of processed milk? Hogwash that pretends to have artistic merit? And if so, would you like to sift through bottom-tier anime before so much as letting it occupy time on your media device? If you've answered yes to this, here are some quick tips to help youout:\\n\\n\r\n\u25b8Is there a typical school setting? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Is the protagonist a pussy magnet? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Is there a beach or hot spring episode? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Is there a love interest story that goes nowhere? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Is there unnecessary fanservice in the cover photo? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Is the lead easily flustered by anything involving females? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Does it go from tensionless fights to school rom-com at the drop of a hat? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Is there some kind of a pussy beta-male protagonist with a \"unique\"/hax superpower? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Is there a lot of instances where your lead is viewed as a pervert due to stupid misunderstandings? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Is there at least one obligatory scene where this meta-male either walks in on a girl changing or accidentally gropes them? \u2611\\n\\n\r\nIf you answered \"yes\" to most, if not, all of those, then congrats! You've just found yourself a mouth-breather tier anime title. Either that or you've accidentally watched this piece of garbage, Absolute Duo. Absolute Duo does absolutely nothing new. It's the same cookie-cutter assembly-line product regurgitated yearly from the anime industry. With a few slight tweaks here and there, and a fresh coat of paint to mask the stench of unoriginality, these titles are excreted out by the dozen on constant demand. Absolute Duo is just another statistic. \\n\\n\r\nWhy bother writing a compelling narrative when excessive info-dumps and monologuing could do the trick? Why bother to make something with a modicum of artistic expression when you would just flash a few pantsu to win over mouth-breathers? Why bother trying when the audience being pandered to don't even demand anything more? It's hard not to be sardonic about titles like these, especially when the problem stems far deeper than simply \"the studio's fault.\" And in the case of Duo, what we have here is a symptom of audience complacency. Here's a world that exists byways of audience participation to do all the legwork for it. The show doesn't try because it's effectively harvested a viewership that doesn't expect it to. \\n\\n\r\nThe world of Absolute Duo is that of a dystopian future. A detail that's rendered entirely pointless given that it all takes place in a high school setting, with the purpose of even addressing the nature of the world's construct only coming to play to allow these teens the ability to wield supernatural weaponry\u2014no, that's not a joke, the show is really that lazy. And as is the tradition for these kinds of stories, we're given hints of a manipulative government faction. We're given hints at a budding school romance. We're given hints that the powers in the show have something more behind its mechanics than what's being told. We're given hints at a troubled backstory for our protagonist. We're given A LOT of hints but that's all, as this is yet another \"read the manga\" kind of title, where its entire purpose of existing hints towards being an advertisement for the source material. An ugly-looking, drably produced advertisement at that. \\n\\n\r\nThe color placement is flat. Its environment evenly lit, like the backlight of a computer monitor or the glow of a tracing table. This is an anime that can't be bothered with the trivial task of having a personality. It would much rather slouch about. Cardboard cutout characters designed with no discernable feature from its usual counterparts. Personalities equally as stock-piled, their behavior as lackluster as the color choices used to bring them to life. Not a single characteristic that expresses passion. Just a heartless product pumped out by the iron presses of a studio machine looking to make a quick profit with as little effort as possible. \\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to find anything here worth mentioning, as the only thing interesting about Duo is just how much it manages to fail. All you simply have to do is look at all the genres it's supposedly made up of and see it misses the mark with all of them:\\n\\n\r\n\u25b8It doesn't work as a school title since the school is just a backdrop and was never truly utilized.\\n\r\n\u25b8It doesn't work as a romance since nothing ever happens between the main love interest and the protagonist.\\n\r\n\u25b8It doesn't work as an action title since the fight sequences were barely animated with any sort of energy or dynamics.\\n\r\n\u25b8It doesn't work as a supernatural show since none of the power mechanics or lore gets fleshed out beyond face value.\\n\r\n\u25b8It doesn't work as a harem since the protagonist is a typical beta-male that freezes up at the thought of a woman's touch.\\n\r\n\u25b8It doesn't work as an ecchi title since it's not titillating, made worse when titles like Queen's Blade exists with amazing \"plot.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is a title that quite literally fails at everything it attempts to cover, and as such, I can't see how this could be anything less than a waste of 4 hours of your life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Duo/10\\n\\n\r\nAbsolute Duo is Absolute Garbage. It's a cheaply made cash-grab that serves no other purpose than selling the source material it's adapted from. A quick glimpse into the ugly side of the entertainment industry, showing just how far a studio is willing to compromise its principals to make a quick buck.",

            "content": "The writers might as well take out the \"duo\" and slap in \"harem\" instead cuz duo just isn't cutting it.\r\nA bland anime with some generic harem characters. Absolute duo may seem like your average action/harem anime, because it is.\r\nStory: 2/10 \r\nFirst off let me remind you that the plot is set in a world far, far away where girls possess all the cup sizes from A to Z cups. So don't be suprised if they turn out to be the only thing worth watching in the whole show. \r\nAbsolute Duo is about your average male protagonist who gains a special power and wants to seekrevenge for his deceased family. Tooru Kokonoe is a teenager who has the ability to materialize \u201cBlazes\u201d out of his soul. But he has no ordinary Blaze his blaze is an irregular, while other people generate Weapons Tooru can generate a shield. (Big deal right?) He then uses his special ability and enrolls himself into a school that teaches him to become stronger (even though he\u2019s a bit overpowered already). At this school he is forced to kick some booty, which then leads the female protagonist, Julie, to realize his existence. She takes interest in him, and by some random chance they are forced into the dorm room, and as the series goes on they become an \u201cabsolute duo\u201d which also forges an intimate relationship with each other. The anime throws you a couple curve balls later on, which keeps the story somewhat interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n-\tGreat Choice of voice actors, Matsuoka who voiced Sora and Kirito from NGNL and Sao voiced Tooru.\\n\r\n-\tThe OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s so far are pretty great, in my opinion.\\n\r\n-\tGreat soundtracks for most scenes especially the romantic scenes.\\n\r\n-\tDid a good job of using music for suspense and such.\\n\r\n-\tThey need better soundtracks for action scenes.(not really many action scenes so far tbh)\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10 \t\\n\r\nMost of the characters are a bit bland and unoriginal.\\n\r\n-\tTooru- Your average male lead who has a harem, he cares for his peers, and has overpowered combat abilities.  \\n\r\n-\tJulie- Your average shy airheaded dandere who\u2019s a few slices short of a fruit cake, also has good combat abilities\\n\r\n-\tMiyabi- Your average shy useless character who\u2019s afraid of males and her only job is to piss the audience off. (At least for me)\\n\r\n-\tTomoe- Your average female protagonist who doesn\u2019t know what love is, but then realizes she falls in love with the male protagonist. (So let the awkwardness ensue) \\n\r\n-\tLilith- A bratty rich girl, who is apparently from England, and also an irregular, she has mastered the fine arts of Engrish.\\n\r\n-\tUsa Sensei- Their homeroom teacher who has two personalities. (Probably the most interesting character in the show)\\n\r\nNeedless to say if all of these females had the brains the size of their bust it would make the show a whole lot more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe only thing that was good in this anime. \\n\r\n-\tCharacters have big boobs.\\n\r\n-\tGreat use of vibrant colors.\\n\r\n-\tGood contrast between light and dark.\\n\r\n-\tNicely animated action scenes.\\n\r\nI\u2019d say 8-bit studios did a pretty great job.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nThe anime definitely wasn't worth my time. The anime was pretty horrid from it's stupidly broad plot to it's equally broad characters. It's sad to see the anime end up so horribly because it actually had a lot of potential, but the directors or whoever does the screenplay ruined the whole show by making the show 99% fanservice with no plot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nI gave the anime an overall score of 4. Taking all things into consideration I had high hopes for this anime and I'd hoped it wont let me down. But several episodes in, I'd realized that even Jesus couldn't save this anime. The genre and tone seemed to be right up my alley, which is action, harem, and a slight dab of comedy. But after watching this many episodes I think my opinions were most likely clouded. I gave it a chance, but it's a pretty big let down.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended For- People who have watched all the good action/harem/romance anime's and have a lot of spare time. Or if you just love action/harems so much you want to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nNot Recommended For- People who want a action/harem with a good plot, and interesting characters, because I assure you this isn't something worth your time.",

            "content": "Yeah! This is my first review of Winter 2015. Oh yeah. Before I get on with the review just let me put some more nails in the coffin which now lies the ecchi jokes. Excuse me for a second.\r\nOk. I'm done. \r\nSTORY (2):\r\nAbsolute Duo or Absolute Hatred follows these two bland characters by the name of Tor Kokonoe & Julie Sigtuna who attend Koryo Academy where they are trained in combat skills using Blaze. Blaze are supernatural weapons that suit different combat skills. \r\nLet me tell you that I have 0 expectations when going into this anime. The concept is boring and it is anecchi genre. In fact, after that horrendous atrocity known as Rail Wars, I wasn't looking forward to watching this anime. So you know what, why not I review this anime.\\n\\n\r\nYou might say \"Why are you viewing an ecchi anime with expectations?\" My answer is \"I'm sorry. My butt cannot stand being violated by Winter Season Anime especially when it comes to ecchi jokes.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has some of the most horrendous dialogue and horrendous jokes I have ever seen since Rail Wars. There is one scene which is the worst scene I have ever seen in this anime. It is when Tomoe meets Tor for the first time, she keeps apologizing and jumps onto Tor and her head lands on Tor's crotch. Then some pauses and \"I'm Sorry!\" again and then Tomoe does another flip and Tomoe's butt landed on Tor, and pauses again. Rail Wars did that kind of joke like when Takayama accidentally gropes Haruka's boobs, there was a pause and then \"I'm sorry\". Seriously, how many times must an anime follow that kind of rule? I'm sorry, whenever I think of that scene, I always cringe inside.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also this girl get embarrassed when guy looks at the boobs. Bouncing of boobs. Beach episode. I can't take it.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, there was the fight scene between Miyabi & Tomoe. How they end the fight scene was so ridiculous. It ends with Miaybi saying \"I've been foiled by the power of love\".\\n\\n\r\nAt the very end, they tried to tie everything together and it was a fail. The fight scenes were rushed.\\n\\n\r\nART (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is nothing impressive. When it is dark, it is very dull. The action scenes are all dull and boring. These action scenes are all the \"Been there, done that\" action scenes. I never pay attention to the action scenes because I don't care anymore.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (2):\\n\\n\r\nWhere do I begin?\\n\\n\r\nTor & Julie might be like the new Sora & Shiro. However, Tor is more generic than compared to Shiro. His personality is as interesting as Edward Cullen. Especially, Julie, she is just another Bella Swan, who clings onto Tor with no personality.\\n\\n\r\nTomoe Tachibana - Her voice actress is Ayaka Suwa who voiced Tokaku Azuma from the atrocity known as Akuma no Riddle. She had the potential to become an interesting character like Mikazuki Yozora from Haganai. However, her character is annoying by apologizing to Tor a lot of times and she get into comedic misunderstandings with Tor.\\n\\n\r\nMiyabi Hotaka - What can I say? She is the most generic character I have ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nLilith Bristol: I also have nothing to say about her. She is just an generic tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nThe teacher bunny by the name of Rito Tsumiki was so annoying. She tried to sound cute but she sounded more like nails scratching on chalkboard. The voice actress Yukari Tamura, her voice is no longer funny or cute, her voice was just annoying. Your cute voice is no longer relevant anymore, you just sound like a broken record player trying to work.\\n\\n\r\nK is a generic villain. He looks like Gilgamesh from Fate/Stay Night. However, his personality is as interesting as a cardboard box. K only appears on the later half of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (2):\\n\\n\r\nI am so tired of these clich\u00e9d ecchi jokes. They are not funny or entertaining anymore. I didn't get a boner in any of the episodes. They are just cringe inducing. Saekano at least tried not to use these ecchi jokes but instead focus on good character development and serve its purpose well. This anime on the other hand tries to use all those \"been there, done that\" jokes and try to pass it off as entertaining. NO! You don't do that! \\n\\n\r\nEcchi jokes don't work anymore. Anyone who is planning to make an anime, DO NOT use ecchi jokes. Ecchi jokes are dead. They are not funny. All the ecchi jokes are just cash-grabbing, like to take people's time. I value my time and money and you should too. If you want to make a good comedy anime, do not use ecchi jokes. Make a good story with effort. There is no bigger crime than an anime that is meant to make people laugh or have a boner failed to do that.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime might not be a complete atrocity unlike \"Pupa\". But just like \"Pupa\", this anime is a prime example of the continuing bad practices of anime companies producing terrible anime in Winter Seasons. Especially when it comes to Ecchi genres.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have any expectations. The reason why I give this anime a 2 out of 10 is because the voice acting was decent except for Yukari Tamura, decent fight scenes and the animation at least wasn't bad compared to Pupa. Way to start my first review for Winter 2015, well done \"Absolute Duo\"! \\n\\n\r\nI now need to rest my head because there are more reviews to come for Winter 2015.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nWanting to be stronger is something that a lot of people strive for. And that isn't just in the sense of lifting weights to tone one's muscles. There is strength of mind in the form of intelligence or strength of spirit in having the courage to do what's right. But no matter its form, strength isn't something that is easily obtained. Hardship and difficulties are what give shape to such strength, and subsequently determine what strength is ultimately earned. This is what Absolute Duo tries to convey, but without much strength to support even itself.\r\nSTORY\r\nAbsolute Duo follows youngTor Kokonoe as he enrolls in Kouyou Academy to take part in the \"Duo\" program. There, he meets Julie Sigtuna, a mysterious girl who eventually becomes his fighting partner.\\n\\n\r\nAbsolute Duo is an ecchi series, therefore making much of the content focus on showing the girls in promiscuous situations. In other words, there are many scenes involving bouncing breasts, unfit clothing, and risqu\u00e9 positions that attempt to entice the viewer. No girl is left unscathed: Julie often wears a single button-up shirt, Miyabi always has the camera aimed at her enormous bosom, and Lilith revels in her sexuality which gives her the confidence to perform more daring ventures. The ecchi itself isn't too classy or original, usually falling back on easy tropes like lost panties or chest-hugging, but there is a nice amount of it throughout its entire run.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's as far as Absolute Duo gets in terms of positivity. When it isn't sexualizing its characters or going through with a comedic moment, the show doesn't know what to do with itself. The story it attempts to tell is entirely contrived, filled with disjointed segments and an apparent lack of cohesion. The students are fighting in a mall one episode, only to be whisked away to a secluded island the next. The motivation behind many of these events is spurred on by the so-called principal's desire of obtaining \"Absolute Duo,\" but what that really is isn't explained. And that goes for a large portion of the show: What was \"Equipment Smith\" trying to do? Who killed Tor's loved one? How does one become an \"Exception?\" There are other questions that are raised similar to these that are never answered, or even when they are, they are done in a slipshod manner. For example, Julie's actual status and powers are hastily shoved in minutes before the end of the series. Another is the \"Reign Conference\" that brought many different leaders together, but the meeting's purpose wasn't explained properly nor did it affect the outcome that followed. Again, these are just a few, but suffice it to say that the majority of whatever is presented is largely given the bare minimum of attention. All of this says nothing of the fight scenes, the powers everyone uses in them, and how lame most end up being. Tor's hammer-fist exists without explanation, bad guys let people live for no reason, and the battles usually give the side-cast the short end of the stick. It's all just a mess that it never recovers from, from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nHearkening back to the anime's theme, the show plays with the idea of strength, what it is, and how one obtains it. Many of the characters have separate drives when it comes to finding said strength: for revenge, for love, and for protection, to name a few. In order to make the idea more meaningful, the anime also tackles how some kinds of strength are evil: \"taking the easy route\" to get it is bad, as is simply wanting to have it without a purpose. The problem, though, is that such a theme is muddied by the fan-service, the lame narrative, and the pointless battles. Beyond that, the classification of strength in such a way is strange. Because it isn't so much how you get such strength, but what you do with it that matters. \"With great power comes great responsibility,\" as they say. In other words, Absolute Duo's segmentation of strength is not only difficult to see but also difficult to accept.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Absolute Duo is somewhat boring. It usually consists of the same-looking schools and buildings, with some variation in location. Some forests, a beach, and an amusement park here and there, but nothing that catches the eye or causes wonderment for the audience. Perhaps this is simply a product of the setting of the anime itself, with it not lending to such interesting environments. Regardless, what is presented is generally devoid of high detail, making it look general and same-y.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are strangely hit-or-miss. Julie's white hair and magenta-filled eyes are nice, yet Tor's, Tomoe's, and Miyabi's lack of detail is not. Their school uniforms have many layers, with blues, whites, and blacks making up most of their composition. On top of this, the Blazes (the weapons the cast wield) are jagged and black in color, giving them an ominous feeling that reflects the weapons' very nature.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation is not wishy-washy. Bluntly put, it's bad. And that's something that is sorely unneeded for a show that spends a lot of time on the fighting scenes it constantly throws the audience's way. During these scenarios, there are way too many close-ups and simple movements to reduce the amount of animation required. There is also the very jarring use of 3D used for particular situations and characters that is nothing more than distracting.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Absolute Duo do not fair too much better than their story brethren.\\n\\n\r\nTor is the star of the show, so his \"importance\" is the highest. Yet he's arguably the worst of the bunch. Average, kind, and compassionate, he's probably the perfect protector for Julie. This is further reinforced by his lone character trait: screaming \"Julie!\" whenever he has the chance. Obviously, he cares about her, which is fine. But there isn't anything else to him than that. That is, his past is mired in failed protection, so he makes it his life's duty to do what he previously could not. And he doesn't budge from such a stance; he doesn't experience other tribulations nor does he see such protecting as much of a challenge. He's the same super-nice, super-friendly, super-bad character for the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, Julie isn't much of an improvement, either. She's very quiet, sticking to Tor at all times due to some strange attachment. Furthermore, she isn't accustomed to her new surroundings, meaning she constantly does things incorrectly -- a gag rather than a meaningful characterization. Regardless, she, too, has a past that is controlled by death. But where Tor wanted to protect, Julie wanted to eviscerate. This development isn't revealed until much later into the show's run, meaning, once again, she is similar to Tor in that her growth over the course of the anime is nonexistent. She \"likes Tor\" and \"wants to be his Duo,\" but there is nothing more to her character outside of her quasi-girlfriend relationship with the main hero.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is wholly uninspiring as well. Rito is the professor who is also a bunny with a good and evil personality. Ryuutarou likes to flex his muscles. Aoi is quite annoying. Tomoe is quick to misunderstand and Miyabi is very shy. Both of these girls, though, are slightly better off than the others, receiving some focus later on in the series. But the problems they face are resolved too quickly to prove worthwhile to their overall characters. If anything, Lilith, the \"Exception,\" really is the only exception. She begins rather abrasive towards others, acting wholly arrogant given her special status. But after dealing with Tor's unwavering attitude and competing against the people she deemed worthless, she opens up, becoming both approachable and a good friend to the rest of the gang.\\n\\n\r\nAs a further look into everyone's character, and as becomes somewhat known over the course of the anime, the Blazes of the students are designed in such a way as to reflect the soul that wields it. Tor's is a shield due to his absolute need to protect the people around him. Julie wields two swords, demonstrating her need to punish first and ask questions later. Lilith uses a rifle to not only align with the \"Exception\" status but also due to her rather aimed personality. Tomoe's is a whip due to her cracking back-and-forth from being judgmental to apologetic, whereas Miyabi's is a massive jousting spear due to her already large amount of untapped potential. This technique can be applied to each of the named members of the show. And while not a fascinating detail, it is at least an okay concept that is employed to aid in characterization.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP for the show is rather fast, with the vocalist doing a lot of work. She shows a large amount of range, with both high and low notes, as well as extended note-holding. The beat and instruments are surprisingly modern, sounding more techno than instrumental. It's an okay song overall, but largely forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ED is very aquatic in nature. It's slow, with the drums and violin working during the first half. Around the middle, the sound somewhat cuts away, having the singer sort of \"skipping\" with the lyrics. Afterwards, the beat picks back up, with the vocalist continuing with the softer way of singing. Again, an okay piece that isn't highly memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe second ED is rather lackluster, with its easy beat and simple singing. The only mentionable part of the track is the ending \"Happy, happy!\" speaking, which is both cute and fun.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the third ED is more melancholic than the rest. The first third is interspersed with harp-like sounds and high violin playing. The second third becomes more hopeful, with the singer and instruments slowing down just a bit, with the final third picking back up the tempo. But like the second ED, this song just isn't that good to listen to, either on its own or within the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack has nothing worth remembering, either. There are \"soldier\"-esque tracks with drums and violins during battle segments, piano tracks during sad moments, and elevator music during the laid-back ones. They're simple mood pieces that aren't special or significant in any way.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting is about average across the board. Special shout-out to Nozomi Yamamoto as Julie for all of her \"Ja's\" and \"Nej's.\"\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThe show could be funny at times, especially in regard to Julie's ignorance of social cues and general cuteness. From her hair wiggle to her constant clinging to Tor, she could usually put a smile on my face. The other girls could, too; Tomoe's prostrations after mistaking the situation or Lilith's unabashed advances were enough to make me smile.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say that I like any of the characters, though. Or any of the battles for that matter. Or any of the world's rules and what-not. All of it is just \"there,\" with barely any semblance of \"oomph.\" And it's not that it had a lot to work with, but more so the fact that it couldn't do anything with what it had.\\n\\n\r\nAbsolute Duo is an anime that focuses on pairings: relationships and boobs being the most prominent. But no amount of fan-service could save this one from its awful plot, lame characters, boring art, and forgetful music. It's simply a really bad experience the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, okay ecchi scenes, disjointed plot, lame motif\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, okay art style, okay character designs, below average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Tor and Julie are poor characters, the rest of the cast besides Lilith is just as poor, Blazes at least serve some purpose\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, okay OP, okay first ED, bad second ED, bad third ED, bad soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, could be comical at times but not much else\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 2/10",

            "content": "Absolute Duo is like a raisin cookie, everyone thinks it's a chocolate chip cookie and it will be good, until you eat it and realize it's not what you expected, unless you actually like raisin cookies.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story is somewhat unoriginal, mainly because it's those types of anime where you are embedded a certain type of weapon that you carry on for the rest of your life, having the ability to summon it anytime you want. The only twist is, you're in a duo. Now, every time you're in a duo it's likely that your partner is someone of the same sex, right? Well inthis anime the partner is a girl, and they both have to live in the same room. That calls for a shit-load of accidental boob-grabbing in the middle of the night. Not only is that there, but it's a harem. It's not needed for this kind of action anime, mainly because it's set on a duo, not a triplet or a quadruplet. For the action part of it, it's actually somewhat decent mainly because I enjoy those types of anime where the main character is a 'special/chosen/OP AS FUCK' type of character.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very smooth and nice, just by looking at the cover photo. The colors are very bright and easily catch your eyes and the animation is smooth. The details in the eye are quite new to me, but hey new stuff means good stuff right? \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is very modern and fits each scene nicely. My favorite in the sound section is the OP. I first heard it while playing a rhythm game (osu! kek) and instantly to me, it was catchy and stuck to my brain. The ED was the same with the OP, (I also heard it on osu! wtf) but not as good. It's based on apple tea, which is pretty weird for an ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nKokonoe Tooru, is a high-school boy who has a dark past. Tooru may look very weak, but as the anime progresses, he does get much more powerful. He's a very kind person who has the resolve to protect Julie and his other friends. He is an irregular.\\n\\n\r\nJulie Sigtuna (heh tuna), is a high-school girl who also has somewhat of a dark past. She is introduced as a very powerful character and as the anime progresses, she gets much more powerful. She's very attached to Tooru and possibly has feelings for him. She is a very quiet girl and likes apple tea.\\n\\n\r\nTogether, they both make a duo.\\n\\n\r\nBristol, Lillith is girl who graduated and came all the way to Japan to meet the irregular, who is Tooru. She was introduced as a small antagonist but as the anime progresses, she develops feelings to the point where she even mentions of being his future wife. She is a prideful girl who would not let anyone stand above her.\\n\\n\r\nHotaka Miyabi is a high-school girl who is introduced a very shy character. She is introduced as weak and a not-very-athletic character, but as the anime progresses, she starts to also develop feelings for Tooru. A very kind girl who wants to be with Tooru.\\n\\n\r\nTachibana Tomoe is a high-school girl who is introduced as a strong character and is skilled at martial arts. She is the type of character who has never thought of being in love.\\n\\n\r\nMiyabi and Tomoe are both a duo.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story wasn't original, I still enjoyed it mainly because it was made in 2015 and I thought it was going to be something new. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime to me was very rushed, because other things have not been explained, like the history of Exceeds, why this or why that. I doubt that there will be a season 2, because of the low ratings it got. It didn't live up to my expectations though. Would I re-watch this anime? Maybe, because I might have missed a lot of stuff. \\n",

            "content": "In the ocean of generic harems that we've been all been graced by the last few years, here we finally have a show that breaks free of all those bonds and- ...no sorry, Absolute Duo is just yet another one of them from start to finish. After the hilarious trainwreck that Studio 8bit presented with their adaptation of Grisaia no Kajitsu last season, you'd think that at least they couldn't make anything worse right afterwards but you may very well argue that they did. Admittedly I don't think anyone had very high expectations on Absolute Duo in comparison, but that still doesn't change the factthat the show did absolutely nothing to try and defy those expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in a typical magic high-school where the students learn to utilize what's referred to as their Blaze: a physical manifestation of their human soul which normally takes the form of a melee weapon. The school also has a so-called Duo partner system where all the students cooperate in pairs of two for the sake of combat training, which of course conveniently enough enables our protagonist Tooru to end up living with a beautiful silver-haired girl named Julie. It's a shocking plot twist for sure and a never-before-seen way to build up the setting for an action/fantasy/ecchi/harem light novel adaptation. Beyond that, there isn't really much to be said about the story other than it has some fanservice moments, some clich\u00e9 ecchi jokes, some hack & slash fight scenes with generic villains and more along those lines throughout the anime. It really isn't any more interesting than that.\\n\\n\r\nPretty much all the characters are incredibly generic and follow standard character tropes like cardboard cutouts. They're the types which you pretty much can judge immediately after you've gotten your first impression of them, and they're all shallow enough for you to be able to sum them up in a single sentence. The only one that actually stands out in any way is Julie as she's more of an emotionless dandere moecchi loli, compared to the more standard overly-busty fanservice girl which would normally get the main heroine role in a show of this nature. She reminds me a lot of Est from Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance, albeit definitely not quite on that level of cuteness.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is basically what you'd expect; it has a lot of vibrant colors and fancy character designs, but at the same time the limited budget shines through as there are plenty of moments where the overall quality drops, and a few of the episodes look very rushed as a result. On the other hand the voice acting is overall very good with several famous actors in the cast such as Matsuoka Yoshitsugu, Tamura Yukari and Horie Yui. The soundtrack makes good use of music to properly enhance the atmosphere of both the action-packed and the romantic scenes, and also both the OP and ED have some pretty great electronic tracks for them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Absolute Duo is not a terrible show but it's more of a case of a concept which has more or less been done to death by now, and more often than not it's been done better before. Fortunately these kinds of generic harems are rarely boring per se though so it's still pretty easy to watch, but as far as actual quality goes then it has virtually none to speak of. The only reason I would recommend anyone to watch this show is because of how cute Julie is, unless of course you happen to be someone who never gets sick of seeing the same cardboard cutout storyline over and over again. I don't regret watching it, but I can't say it really provided me much to praise it for either.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've got nothing better to do, then Absolute Duo is a pretty simple way to spend an evening. However you will have to really run out of options before you're unable to find anything more worth your time than this.",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\nAll of the reviews of this I've seen have been negative and with good reason. However, I liked that fact that the plot consists mainly of two 'avengers' seeking power to avenge their loved ones who died. it may be clich\u00e9 but It works (for me anyway). And then there's the underlying story of the head mistress and her goal to reach absolute duo. On top of that there's also the character K who is a soilder of a different origin than the exceeds. The plot is under developed but I feel that there's a lot to it which can be exploredin depth which is my main reason for having hope for a second season. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, I like it because all of the characters seem relatable in some way e.g. Tor dealing with the situation of having to live with a girl. Then there's Miyabi who gets turned down by Tor and you get to see how she deals with rejection (although her response was far more radical than it would be of a normal high school kid it was still along the lines of what you'd expect i.e. thinking there's something wrong with herself and wanting to change in order to get Tor to like her). Then there's Julie who gets jealous because of lilith's affection towards Tor etc. There's also Tomoe who cares about everyone and so on. and you've also got Rito who at the start all of the characters don't really like (similar to the way kids in school will have that one teacher they're not that fond of). However, that does change at the end because she protects the dorm and the pupils inside. On a side note, lilith is a very interesting character as she is the only other character other than Tor who has an abnormal blaze. She is also fixated on ensuring that Tor becomes her future husband which leads to an awkward relationship between herself, Tor and Julie. All of the characters are in desperate need of development but there has been slight developments i.e. Tor finally accepting that he'll be living with Julie - that his duo is a girl etc\\n\\n\r\nThe combat is pretty poor for the most part I have to admit, but, I feel like that may be primarily due to the fact that one of the main protagonists are based on protecting and defending. But yeah the actual combat overall is pretty poor but I'm fully invested in the characters and story which make up for the lack of intense combat. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Absolute duo - to me - feels like it's slice of life high school drama but with a twist and that twist is that it's an academy focuses on combt training etc which I guess is why I like it so much. There are a lot of over sexualised moments which aren't needed in the slightest. And the story does need more depth for its viewers to sink their teeth into but I find the anime overall incredibly enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nTo anyone wanting to watch this anime - don't expect much, have an open minded approach to it and I'm sure you'll gain some enjoyment out of it. \\n\\n\r\nP.s this is my very first review and I'm new to watching anime so my ideals may seem stupid etc but I'm hoping that over time I'll be able to become an adept reviewer. Any feedback - positive or negative - is welcome, just send me a message. Thanks!",

            "content": "\"It was like a scene from a teen movie\" -K (except it was four and a half hours long)\r\nPreface: \r\nAbsolute Duo is what we call least common denominator entertainment. It takes _trite_ and true tropes from a hundred other anime that are equally as generic and clich\u00e9, slaps a fresh coat of paint on (and some nasty 90s looking 3D CGI), some new names, and the semblance of a plot, all nicely wrapped up in used toilet paper for your viewing (dis)pleasure. Inspid to the max, somebody dug up some long forgotten, rotting corpse of a moe-harem-action plot from underneath the dumpster outside and said\u201chey guys, wouldn\u2019t it be funny if\u2026\u201d and Absolute Duo was born.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Artwork: 3\\n\\n\r\nDon't let the OP fool you. The OP looks like it could be great for the 1:30 duration of the song, but the visuals in the meat of the show are average at absolute best. The most abhorrent thing is the 3D animated soldiers. If I could vomit fake, run over it with a dump truck, melt it down, eat it, and then crap it out again, it would look better than this hack fraud schlock. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 6\\n\\n\r\nFinally, something worth talking about. Absolute Duo does make good use of some talented VA.\\n\r\nTooru's voice, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, is instantly recognizable as the voices of Kirito (SAO) and Arata (Trinity Seven). \\n\\n\r\nYukari Tamura (Kill La Kill, Higurashi) is FAN freaking TASTIC as always. She reprises her role as Nui Harime here and... *whispers*  \"wait wat?\" I'm being told that she is actually not playing Nui Harime, and is instead Tsukimi, the teacher. Well, they're the same thing anyway.\\n\r\nHaruka Yamazaki (Inou Battle), a relative newcomer, also gives a good performance as Lilith.\\n\\n\r\nOP and both ED's are fast paced electronica tunes. Good stuff.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nTooru: typical MC, out for vengeance... meets all these girls, friendship never eeeeends! (I can\u2019t groan enough here,) Due to {insert generic traumatic past} he must protect his friends at all costs, and given that his Blaze, the manifestation of his soul is a shield... let the self sacrifice begin.\\n\r\n-Julie: na\u00efve, bland airhead, exists for loli fanservice.\\n\r\n-Miyabi: useless, luckless, and serves to be really annoying and drag everyone down (it's probably the weight of her boobs).\\n\r\n-Tomoe: average female protagonist, above average bust size.\\n\r\n-Lilith: I like the way reviewer Poorqs put it: \"A bratty rich girl; she has mastered the fine arts of Engrish.\"\\n\r\n-Nui Harime: The teacher. She has two modes: one; obnoxiously cutesy, bubbly, and overbearing. Two: murderous, unhinged, and deadly. She's also the object of many a fantasy, being both in maid costume at all times with bunny ears and a tail, the aforementioned disproportionate breasts, and stupidly overpowered.\\n\\n\r\nThe character of Lilith was woefully underutilized, in my opinion. Though she says some real groaners, she's a more interesting character than the other females for the sole fact that she knows a lot of things they don't and doesn't act like a giant idiot at all times. She also has a particularly useful power of having a gun when everyone else has melee weapons, but it\u2019s never effectively used, because everyone has to monologue long enough for it to be forgotten about. She does get a little more development other than showing off her unrealistically proportioned boobs.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\\n\r\nTooru Kokonoe, our \"tragic hero\" enters cookie cutter magical school in order to gain MORE POWER!!! with which he vows to get vengeance for his lost loved one. He and his airhead moron of a partner Julie solemnly swear that they\u2019re up to no good and head off to go rip shit up, but mostly just get their butts handed to them repeatedly before the power of friendship takes over. The love stories go nowhere, the plot spins like a broken record, unnecessary side plot and terrible exposition, not to mention the just general trainwreck of tone.\\n\r\nThere's a slew of other cookie cutter character boxes to check off, the x-dere this, y-dere that, and a really contrived love quadrangle that's forced in for plot convenience and to try and give some conflict to this utterly boring schlock. Cutting to the chase: the one driving the Bronco ends up not being the Machiavellian antagonist, but the --HOLY PLOT TWIST BATMAN-- unassuming spurned love interest.\\n\r\nThe heart of the cards wins out in the end, everyone is saved, and a bunch of really crappily 3D animated soldiers get mowed down, crisis averted. Whew.\\n\\n\r\n(they even ripped off Gurren Lagann with a \"grit your teeth\" slap, for shame!)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 3\\n\r\nJunk. Rubbish. Refuse. Detritus. Someone with more money than sense had enough decimal points in the bank to send it this way, and here\u2019s what we got. This isn't some enrapturing show unless you just love moe blobs and bouncing boobs everywhere. Again, this is no high brow, thought provoking show, but it 'is' a pretty boring one. Predictable progression, lack of characterization, and really contrived plot twists, it just screams \"3\".  \\n\\n\r\n+Good choice in VA, despite being a poor show\\n\r\n+Listenable OP and EDs\\n\r\n+/- typical action/magical school\\n\r\n- BAD 3D CGI (Ghost in the Shell SAC 1st's cars look great by comparison)\\n\r\n- Generic and uninspired\\n\\n\r\nRecommend? \\n\r\nNo, unless the ecchi/magic school/action with really bland characters and an inspid plot interest you.\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR An utterly bland, by the numbers fantasy harem romance that feels like it only exists because there was a hole in a schedule that needed plugging. Don't bother.\r\nTo my mind, there are three types of bad show. There's the ones that sincerely think they are good, but end up being terrible. There are those that would have been good if their initial ambition had only been matched by their ability to realise it. & then there are those that just don't care enough to make the effort. Absolute Duo, sadly, is the last of these. \r\nAfter a brief prologue that foreshadows a possible conflictto come between the two main characters (that ends up looking nothing like it's depicted here *spoiler*), we begin by accompanying Tooru (or Tor or Thor or whatever the translator feels like using at a given point in time) on his first day at a new school for magic people. For reasons that don't matter & nobody seems to care, the school is made up primarily of random European landmarks such as Big Ben & the Colosseum, I guess because it looks cool. It is in said Colosseum that our main man suddenly finds himself in a battle royale to decide which entrants are actually worthy of attending the Kouryou Academy, announced by a loli goth who it turns out is the school principal. \\n\\n\r\nIt is during this fight that we discover Tooru to be a special snowflake, because unlike everyone else his Exceed power takes the form of a shield instead of a weapon, marking him out as an Exception. Not that this apparent handicap matters, because he also has a special falcon punch attack that is never really explained but sure is good for hitting girls in the belly. Anyways to the surprise of nobody he passes the battle royale & so begins his & our journey through quite possibly the worst show of the Winter 2015 season.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up Absolute Duo's biggest flaws in a sentence, it is that the show is just going through the motions & really doesn't care if anything makes sense so long as it keeps the story moving in its desired direction. The most obvious example of this is the titular Duos themselves, specifically the one between Tooru & main loli Julie, a foreign exchange student from a made up place in Europe. It's established pretty quickly that forming a duo is a) a pretty unremarkable thing that every Exceed does & b) it is always between two members of the same sex. However, because no homo, when it comes to Tooru agreeing to form a Duo with token guy friend Aoi, suddenly it's a really big deal that they have to sign what amounts to a marriage certificate & our MC must do the right thing & form a Duo with Julie instead. \\n\\n\r\nNaturally nobody else sees what the fuss is about & indeed Tooru & Julie are noted as odd for being a boy-girl duo, which makes it seem all the odder that Tooru had such a problem forming one with Aoi. Of course the answer to why is that the Duo is really just a contrivance to create a \"romantic moment\" where Tooru asks Julie & also to put Tooru & Julie in a binding relationship together, because writing friendships/romances that form naturally is hard work for a Light Novelist. This adds to the already forced fun that is when, to the surprise of nobody watching, Tooru finds himself sharing a room with Julie & shock horror she doesn't know how to look after herself. If you've seen Pet Girl of Sakurasou, you could sum up their relationship as Sorata & Mashiro with magic swords & I think you'd just about get the gist of it.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond this trio (Aoi nonchalantly forms a Duo with another guy but he plays no role beyond kinda making their Duo look like a Uke - Seme pairing), we also have Tomoe & Miyabi, who form the girl Duo in our group. Because :anime: there are some yuri undertones to their bond, with stronger & more outwardly confident Tomoe forming a protective attachment to the more insecure & shy Miyabi. Of course, again because no homo, those undertones are really just there so the second end credit sequence can have them both naked in it, & in fact Miyabi soon forms feelings for Tooru because everyone else is doing it so why not her too? Don't be shocked if her feelings & desire to prove herself worthy of Tooru's non-existent affection end up causing trouble. \\n\\n\r\nOur group, which you can call a harem although it's one of those where it's clear from the beginning that the MC only has eyes for one girl, is rounded off with the arrival of transfer student Lilith Bristol, another Exception who quickly decides she's going to form a duo (& marry) Tooru, but of course his manly man principles see him stick it out with Julie. Much hijinks, many boob grabs & hilarious misunderstandings ensue. It's really fresh & original stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Absolute Duo is one that's best not given too much thought, because it will only hurt your brain. Our first antagonist, for example, is revealed to be none other than the groups class teacher, bunny-sensei (she has a name, but you won't remember it. You'll remember her bunny maid outfit, though) who for reasons unknown decides to try & kill those Exceeds who are doing well during a class exam/battle royale. Of course, our heroes ultimately defeat her through the power of friendship, only for her to go right back to being their teacher because the loli-goth principal thinks she's good at her job. That's it. There's no real indication that she's working with the Rebels, who become the schools main antagonists after this point, nor is it suggested as it so easily could have been that she was doing it on the principals orders as part of her at all costs plan to find the titular \"Absolute Duo\" (which isn't really explained but one can assume means the most powerful Duo in Duodom). It just kinda happens. \\n\\n\r\nSaid Rebels themselves don't make all that much sense as antagonists. Their leader, Equipment Smith (only in anime would he be called that), seems to want to make an army of super soldiers to counter the academy's Exceeds or something but it's not quite clear why or, if that's the case, why him, loli-goth & others form a round table of leaders that meet to discuss...I don't know what in a later episode. But they fill the roll of bad guys, & Rebel member K the role of Tooru's nemesis specifically (something about Tooru & Julie's bond really rubs him up the wrong way, for :anime: reasons), so just go with it. Things happen, decisions are made, allegiances shift, & all simply because the plot requires it at that point in time regardless of whether it makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nTooru & Julie's relationship, like everything else, is also one of those that feels like it's just going through the motions. It starts out with Julie apparently being incapable of looking after herself, so naturally Tooru must, as it were, domesticate her. Then we progress to her feeling unconfident & insecure about her fighting abilities, which naturally Tooru is there to give her the reassurances & head rubs every girl needs to feel good about themselves. Then things take a turn which I wish anime didn't do so often (as if it wasn't patronizing & weird enough), wherein it becomes apparent that Julie is actually capable of being an incredibly powerful fighter (as the prologue foreshadows) but that power is dangerous & it is Tooru's manly duty to both tame it when in danger of going out of control & ultimately for him to get powerful enough that she never need fight herself. Because if there's one place safer for a girl than behind a sword, it's behind the back of the man wielding her sword for her. \\n\\n\r\nIt may come as no surprise that despite obviously being the couple, Absolute Duo pulls the usual anime schtick of never actually having Tooru & Julie express romantic feelings towards each other, instead having them develop a more familial, platonic relationship that's all about trust & protection (& not sex!) despite this being a romance series & theirs clearly being the romance. I don't know why anime does this, but it does get pretty boring hearing the MC shout \"JULIE!\" in that constipated action anime voice during climactic scenes & then the closest thing we get to a romantic moment is a head pat or words of encouragement (I don't count Julie doing something that in a normal relationship would be romantic but because this is anime makes Tooru freak out like she just whipped out a penis). Of course, this is pretty standard for anime, so I guess you just have to go with it. \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help Absolute Duo's case that beyond the at best generic characters & story, there's plenty about the shows production to criticize. There is quite heavy use of CGI in fight scenes, & it looks as bad as you'd expect. It's not like the fight scenes are particularly high octane or exciting to begin with, compounded by how the CGI has that weird effect of making everything look slower, which kinds takes the thrill out of some moments. The character designs, as I have alluded to already, seem in a few cases to be more about pillow cover/figurine sales than anything like reflecting the characters personalities. The characters eyes also have a really odd look to them, as rather than having black pupils they're the same colour as the iris, only with a black rim denoting where one ends & the other starts. It's a minor thing, but I found it really odd, as though they had coloured stones inlaid into the eye socket rather than actual eyes. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond that the art & animation is pretty standard. There is also, as you'd expect, a whole lot of \"titillating\" fanservice, which tends to be like buses in that none comes for a while & then OMG they're all naked in a hot spring together. The OST is pretty bad, the fight music in particular suffering from both being underwhelming & clearly looped. I guess the OP is pretty good, with one of those thumping trance-rock hybrid songs over a pretty action heavy animation sequence. It's a shame that they seem to have shot it entirely on two's, resulting in the OP looking like it's constantly buffering. In short it seems the show was given enough of a budget to get the job done & nothing more; much like everything else about the series, really.\\n\\n\r\nSo then, here we are at the end of a journey we'd all have been better off not taking. It has to be said that as bad as Absolute Duo is, it's not offensively so. Indeed it's biggest sin is that it just doesn't seem to even try to be good, or at least interesting. The whole thing feels like everyone involved, from the author to the publisher to the animation studio, is just doing this project because it's there to be done. If Absolute Duo had been one of those shows that felt sincerely like it's trying to be good, or that it was a case of having more ambition than the capacity to realise it, I wouldn't have minded as much. But the whole thing reeks of being a by the numbers, who cares if it's good so long as it shifts some books & merchandise affair. Don't waste your time with it.",

            "content": "Absolute Duo, based on a decently received light novel series. It enters the competition of generic battle harems of spring 2015 - and clearly doesnt make the cut. The absolute unoriginality of the characters, the linear and terribly explained story and terrible pacing and conversations make watching all the twelve episodes a clear waste of time.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nHigh school setting; Powerful MC who cant love with mysterious past; all types of girls that fall in love with him for dumb reasons; a linear antagonist who breaks from his shell and gets defeated by MC with nakama power. Uhm, where have I seen this before? Well, everywhere.While the first few episodes definitely arent that bad and actually manage to make the usual harem tropes enjoyable, at latest after the 7th episode it gets just terrible. Even if the story and background sucked, we wouldn't know - there's barely even anything explained. I dont even know what the Absolute Duo is in the end...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nCredit due where its due - the art style is good. While not as good as shows like Hyouka, it lives up to today's standards. Especially the animations of the rebel group and the AMAZING dance scene in the opening are worth being called good. Nothing special though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nSame story as the art. Voices are well chosen - especially Tsukimi-sensei - and the background music is decent. I loved both OP and ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nNormally I dont dislike the typical dere-characters, but this is going overboard. I havent hated, no, DESPISED a single character ever - until I met Miyabi. Listening to hear and seeing what she does made me cringe every single time and regret watching it. Julie had great potential but got smashed with her demon side. MC is decent, I've seen far worse.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nI'm sure you'd expect a way lower rating here. Well, the first episodes definitely werent bad at all, noone could've predicted the following shitshow in the last episodes. Pointless conversations and repetitive subjects clearly destroy the positive aspects that were built up in the earlier part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nWhile not being completely terrible, if you pay a closer look and actually expected anything from the story, then this will be a waste of time. This show made everything wrong that could've been done wrong while writing the script and planning the plot. Dont watch this.\\n\\n\r\nI hope that this doesnt get a second season and if it does, I hope it manages to develop a deeper plot and turn away from the extremely boring and even annoying characters.",

            "content": "Anime cliches have been around for a good many years now.  The characters troupes that we become accustomed to, certain kinds of scenes, as well as genres have all become rather well known in the anime community.  It is with this that finding anything really out of the ordinary becomes a somewhat hard task.  And then we have Absolute Duo, a show that touches on both sides of the argument.  \r\nStory (6.44/10): In the world of Absolute Duo, there is a kind of people known as Exceeds, people who are able to harness the power of their soul to form weaponsknown as blazes, ranging from all forms of pre-gun weapons from swords, to daggers, bows, lances, and even a snakeblade.  It is here where we follow the story of Kokonoe Tor, a boy who goes to attend Koryo Academy, a place where they train Exceeds so that one day, they can reach the highest level of power, Absolute Duo.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom a story standpoint, Absolute Duo does show promising development.  A lot of anime that involve a lot of sci-fi/fantasy elements do have that little spark that make them different from the others, thus expressing the uniqueness of a show that I feel is necessary to earn any viewers.  With the idea of the Duo System (which is basically a battle partnership) that this series has, as well as the idea of weapons made from the soul, I felt like Absolute Duo did have quite a bit to promise in terms of story idea, and it did, to a certain degree.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I felt was lacking a lot about the show is more or less the amount of detail that was being expressed at a given time.  Throughout the show, the story hints at these past events that our main two protagonists have that drive them to becoming a soul weapon wielding badasses.  Rather than fleshing that out, the show puts that in the backseat of the show and progresses along with a plot that really at times, wasn't all that exciting.  A major gripe I have about the show in regards to the backstory, is just how forced it feels, thus creating the \"vengeance\" cliche, as I call it.  Basically, this means that the ONLY reason our characters really bother in becoming an Exceed in the first place, is to hunt down and seek vengeance on the person who slaughtered someone near and dear to them without ANY indication over who that person is or what their purpose was.  To me, it hurts the story more than anything because an idea like this is guaranteed to never be touched on again, and that really is a shame since a lot of anime share this cliche, and none of them follow through.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother fault I find is the fact that the show really doesn't try to be different.  While the story idea may be interesting enough, the actual scenes, aren't.  What this means is that the show falls back on cliches whenever it's trying to tell a story.  In any given bit of plot progression the show relies on a reused scene idea used hundreds of times in order to explain what is going on.  Having a conversation during a battle is fine, but saying that your only reason to fight is to get more powerful and power is the only thing that matters is dumb.  Having a girl make a full 180 on her character after the MC beats her?  Seen it, used it, copyrighted it.  The impact from this mostly equates to making the series just lackluster in presentation.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall though, Absolute Duo's story was more disappointing than anything.  While I didn't expect very much from the people who made Infinite Stratos, I felt like Absolute Duo could've turned into something just a little bit more.  The series simply just solves the problems that the series created during the spur of the moment, and not any of the underlying problems like the revenge that Tor is so sought after.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Interesting story idea\\n\r\n-   Lackluster presentation\\n\r\n-   Original problems not solved\\n\r\n-   Very cliched storytelling\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6.42/10): Characters, similar to story, follow a similar path to the story, riddled with cliche anime troupes everywhere, and that one interesting character that sorta turns your head.\\n\\n\r\nUp first, Kokonoe Tor.  Or, as everyone else likes to say: Kokonoe-kun, Tor, KOKONOE TOR!, Danna-sama, Toru, etc.  As expected by someone who is played by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, Tor is the harem lead character of the series, being nice to everyone, spouting the \"I will protect everyone\" speech, and overall being the affection of several girls' desires.  However, unlike the other characters of the series, Tor's Blaze is a shield.  (Unlike a certain swordsman played by the same seiyuu.)  Aside from that one difference, Tor doesn't really play off as any real unique character.  Because he plays the chivalry card, there really isn't much you can say about him other than the fact that he wants to protect people, resulting in the fact that he barely changes in the series.  But at the very least, you won't forget his name!  Cause it's not like they mention his name every 3 minutes or anything like that, maybe consecutive times for the antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Sigtuna Julie, our main female protagonist.  As the main female protagonist of the series, Julie is the Duo of Tor, aka his battle partner and roommate.  (Try and imagine all the non-H things they did.  Whatever you're thinking, the show probably did it.)  Similar to Tor, Julie bears the vengeance ideal, seeking revenge on the person that killed her father using two swords that allow her to spin and slice through whatever the hell she wants.  While Julie herself isn't a bad character, she does come off a little weak in any actual development, similar to Tor.  There really isn't enough emphasis on either one of them, rather putting them both together to make them like a whole with each of them as a half for the other.  Because of this, she, like her Duo, doesn't stand up by themselves as a proper character, and the way I see it, isn't smart to have characters that rely on each other on personality.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have the other characters for the series, such as the rest of the harem girls, Miyabi, Tomoe, and my personal favorite, Lilith Bristol, who wields a freaking rifle.  In addition, we also Tora, Tatsu, Imari, and a couple other characters making up the side cast.  Aside from Lilith, the rest of the student characters that bear any importance suffer a similar problem to the mascot characters of the show, which is not being able to stand up on their own.  A lot of the time, you see the characters fall back on their partner for support and conversation, which for a series that has this for its main plot point, does make a lot of sense.  However, the way it's done makes it so that no one character can really make him/herself stand on their own two feet.  They are restricted to getting their minimal amount of character growth from other characters and individually, they feel hollow and incomplete.  (Also, I kinda hate the bunny teacher.  I know that there's a fandom devoted to her, but I honestly can't take characters like her, what with that stupid bing-bong crap and the dual personality.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters of Absolute Duo weren't really shining examples of what could've been.  I didn't expect much actual character development from a show such as this, but I wanted something more than just troupes and character reliance.  No one really stood out as unique, (except Usa-sensei, sadly.)  and the series did fall in that regard.  Antagonists in Absolute Duo are also lackluster as well, so don't expect anything deep or meaningful with their evil plots.  (Like seriously, who the hell obsesses THAT much over a guy whose only real weapon is a goddamn shield?)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/-  Anime character troupes.  (Helps ease the characters into the character's heads, not so much in terms of significant development.)\\n\r\n-     Character reliance for personality\\n\r\n-     Stereotypical and overused villain troupe\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.21/10): Absolute Duo was produced by 8-bit, the same studio that made La Fruit de Grisaia, Avengelion Ewol, and the show featuring out favorite harem MC, Infinite Stratos.  (Fucking Ichika.)  Likewise, Absolute Duo is done in a similar quality to those shows.  The art for the series does look rather aesthetically pleasing with some pretty nice designs for the Blazes.  The art for the series is standard for the current age of anime, so there's really not much to say beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nThere are however, some...bugs in the artwork.  At times, the art quality both dips and raises up a little bit, making the show waver in appearances from one scene to the next.  In addition to the lack of artistic regularity, 8-bit also pulled up its IS schematics and used a bit of the wonderful... wonderful CGI.  More than anything, it just looks awkward, and glaringly so.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the music side of things, Absolute Duo hosts a somewhat decent soundtrack.  The most memorable of the bunch being its opening, Absolute Soul, which is a song that I have grown to love.  The opening has a very unique sound and rhythm to it that makes it feel actually quite memorable.  Aside from the kickass opening that you could probably listen to for hours on end, the rest of the soundtrack is kind of lacking as nothing else really stands out.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Decent art\\n\r\n+  Kickass opening\\n\r\n-   Art wavers in quality a lot\\n\r\n-   rest of the soundtrack isn't as memorable\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (7.00/10): While I may have been hacking and slashing away at this show for all its worth throughout this entire review, I can't honestly say that this show isn't completely bad.  While unwanted and tired cliches are prominent and plentiful throughout this series, the show itself isn't completely unwatchable. Of course, the show does literally shoot its characters down with guns of all sorts, but that's not what we're worried about at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nFrom an entertainment standpoint, the show gets good marks.  Absolute Duo isn't as far as I can see a show that should be taken with the thought of being wowed.  I went into this show thinking that there were going to be some disappointing elements, and I turned out to be right.  That being said, the idea of the soul weapons \"Blazes\" and some of the fights do actually make up slightly for the mountain full of troupes and cliches that make up a lot of the show's screentime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nWhat I didn't like was simply just how cliched it was.  (Yes, yes.  I am aware that me writing cliched a bunch is turning into a cliche.)  A lot of the show could've been handled in a way that would've made for a more interesting storyline and/or view.  The show goes from one of its more higher points into one that comes from a troupe you've probably seen several times before, and it's this where I find the majority of the problems for the series, aside from, you know, giving us a read the manga ending cause neither one of the main characters have completed their self-appointed task.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it?\\n\\n\r\nAbsolute Duo in my opinion serves more like a bit of fluff entertainment more than anything.  The show wasn't executed in a way that I felt was worth more than just a show you could watch in your downtime, as reused story points plague its entire 12 episode run with old, tired harem troupes.  (In addition, 5 of the girls in this series basically have balloons sticking out of their chest.  I'll leave the rest to you.)  Absolute Duo could've potentially become more than it already was, it had a good bit of groundwork it could've used.  Sadly though, it relied too much on established anime harem scenes, troupes, and characters that I think hurt the show in the long run.  If you want a harem sci-fi show, Absolute Duo does fit the bill.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6.45/10",

Every \"Absolute\"-Pun from here on is unintended.\r\nImagine ANY generic harem Anime with super power.\r\nDone?\r\nGood. That's ALL you need to know about Absolute Duo. You just imagined EVERYTHING there is to it. It has a bland Protagonist with slapped on \"tragic past\" who's too cool for everything with a cast of big-boobed clonesin his harem.\\n\\n\r\nThere is absolutely (sorry) nothing more to it. Every character looks EXACTLY the same, the only differences being eye color, boob size and amout of ribbons in their hair. Not like there's going to be much difference in clothing, it obviously plays in high school again, the copy/paste plotsetting to every generic harem.\\n\r\nThis Anime just oozes chuunibiyo author / audiece in every second.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character can also be summarized in one sentence or with one distinguish characteristic:\\n\\n\r\nThe Protagonist\\n\r\nThe Big-Boobed shy one\\n\r\nThe Tsundere\\n\r\nThe Foreign Tsundere\\n\r\nThe Family-heir\\n\r\nThe one abandoned by her parents\\n\r\nThe Bunny Teacher\\n\r\nThe \"Badass\"-Loli (barely ever shows up, so no need to care)\\n\\n\r\nAll of those seem like a product of someone's mind who never actually spoke to actual people.\\n\r\nNot to mention all they ever talk is how awesome the protagonist is.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is just as pathetic. Even the OPENING is inconsistant and choppy.\\n\r\nI want to stress this out: THE OPENING! Like literally the part that you have to anime ONCE for twelve episodes! The part that's like advertisement! And they fuck that up!\\n\\n\r\nAnyways: Don't watch it. There's absolutely no reason to do so, unless you're 12 and this is your very first anime ever and I wish I could physically prevent you from watching it.",

            "content": "Absolute Duo is absolutely terrible. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve watched an anime series and gone an entire 12 episodes without being able to pinpoint at least one positive aspect. Not only does the plot suffer from being predictable and translucent, but the amount of money grabbing fanservice littering every ounce of substance is beyond upsetting. The premise on its own is promising, but the series ends up drowning in its own inadequacies left and right, leading to a dissapointment for the ages.\r\nUnassuming teenage protagonist? -Check\r\nRandom beach episode? -Check\r\nBarely post-pubescent characters with jiggly titties? -Check\r\nUnnecessary lolli panty shots? -Check\r\nA horribly cast English dub?-Check\\n\r\nAn incoherent plot with as much depth as a kiddie pool? -Check\\n\\n\r\nIf Absolute Duo succeeds in one aspect, it would be to be as underwhelming as humanly possible. Nothing is fleshed out, the storyline never seems to go anywhere and the characters are essentially just cutouts without any amount of development beyond their breasts and oddly deepened voices. Things just seem to happen but most of it doesn\u2019t make any sense, or even follow a cohesive formula for the audience to grab onto. It honestly felt as though the writers for the anime didn\u2019t even care about their jobs. \\n\\n\r\nThe battle system sounds cool on paper, but when you don't spend the minimum necessary time explaining it and end up leaving a multitude of unanswered questions at the end, it becomes nothing more than \"what could've been\". The action scenes often opened up with a still image of the characters with their weapons, multiplying the corny factor, while the animation was inconsistent at best. Young girls with boobs that seem to bounce with the slightest of movement, and nervous blushing emblazoned on the face of basically everyone. Not to mention the sporadic humor and misunderstandings making me want to slam my head against the wall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are entirely too tropey for me to take seriously, as they seem to be more of checks in boxes rather than actual dynamic individuals. I thought I could find something good in the MC until he succumbed to the awkwardness of being in a perverted Japanese high school anime. The enemies were one-offs without purpose, and were almost completely useless in the scheme of things. Plus, literally every voice actor with the exception of our lolli friend was miscast with an older actor, a sign that the budget probably wasn't where it needed to be.\\n\\n\r\nIf you googled J pop, I'm sure you'd find something very similar to the opening and ending of Absolute Duo. Granted the animation in the OP was actually decent, possibly the only highlight of the show for me. The OST is absent or cringey, and I've already given my thoughts on the rest of the animation. Sigh, this show made me sad for the hopeful fans waiting for the manga adaptation\u2026\\n\\n\r\nIn summary,\\n\\n\r\nPositives: the OP isn't bad\\n\r\nNegatives: pretty much everything else\\n\\n\r\nAVOID at all costs, I literally would t recommend this show to anyone\u2026 unless you\u2019re some sort of sadistic masochist or stereotypical weeaboo pervert. So, with that being said there probably is a target audience for Absolute Duo\u2026 but I'm certainly not a part of it. Thanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\nStory-1\\n\r\nArt-3\\n\r\nSound-5\\n\r\nCharacter-1\\n\r\nEnjoyment-3\\n\r\nOverall-2.4",

            "content": "Here's how bad Absolute Duo is: I've never written a review on here before or had a desire to, but it was so horrible that I just had to write one to help people steer clear of this incoherent mess of an anime. I actually watched this because my friend told me about a really good anime where they use weapons created from their souls. Turns out he was talking about Guilty Crown.\r\nTake a suitably clueless shonen stereotype MC with a hero/\"I have to protect everyone\" complex and plop him in a school with a bunch of attractive females who fawn over him for noreason. Make him awkward around women, add in loads of unnecessary fanservice and \"accidents\", and pull it all together with a horribly plot-holey story with bland action and no clear goal or reason for what's going on. Sound familiar? It should, because it's been done many times before. Absolute Duo is as bland and forgettable as they come. I honestly felt ashamed to have watched all 12 episodes. I suppose I was just clinging on to the hope that it might get better.\\n\\n\r\nThe only good thing this anime has going for it is the art, which is fairly good. The scenes were detailed and the effects were nice. It's really sad to think that good animators spent a sizable chunk of time working on this trainwreck. The argument could also be made that the concept was decent as well, but it was just so poorly executed that I can't imagine a good version of this story.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, do not watch this anime unless you're the type that watches specifically for harem/fanservice fantasies and doesn't care about the story at all. Put it this way: if you've ever spoken to a misinformed anime hater, the image that he has in his mind of anime is essentially Absolute Duo. They should have titled it Absolute Garbage instead.",

            "content": "I suppose I am a terrible believer in the idea that, more often than not, a show will get better over time. Whether or not this is true is subjective based on personal values. In the case of Absolute Duo, the idea is untrue, and painful to uphold.\r\nAs an anime, Absolute Duo moved through each episode like a dough ball rolling down an gravelly hill, gradually deteriorating in something that seemed a bit like fanservice wrapped up in cheap Soul Eater cosplay. From title credits and summaries alone, all's fine, but once the thin facade is peeled back, Absolute Duo is an action anime turneddisaster.\\n\\n\r\nOne can recognize the remnants of the story's original planning, and, as a warning, there are many, many remnants. The problem is that there are too many--ideas flood in unevenly, bits of back-story, battle and boobs all mixed together for a bitter anime trope martini. \\n\r\nFrom the first episode, everything is gathered together to follow Kokonoe Tor's journey utilizing his Blaze, a weapon drawn from the manifestation of his soul. However, his Blaze is not a weapon, but a shield. However-however, despite this hinting that he'd rather be the type to defend and protect, the idea is betrayed by the fact that he is an excellent combatant and can fight with the shield anyway. This may have been an attempt to rescue the action part of the story, which already was being slowly trampled by the sticky, gooey topping of school life harem, and even the harem portion of the anime is dissatisfying.\\n\r\nAs always, there is the quiet one, the tomboy, the rich girl, but there is a distinct failure to handle any of them well. With all harems, there will always be a certain air of indecisiveness, but unfortunately the problem here is that Tor seems too decisive before derailing from that decision and heading down a different track. Rather than properly balancing screen time between each heroine, one is dealt with for quite some time before another comes out of nowhere, is accepted by Tor and then forgotten about for the first one. There is nothing endearing about the main character pledging his love and protection to everyone like a shameless people-pleaser.\\n\r\nAdditionally, and as previously mentioned, the harem is not the only piece mishandled--the action side of the anime is often put on hold for fillers that are too obviously fillers, and these fillers end with a random plot point that had little too no previous foreshadowing. The main opposing force is even late to the party in that it doesn't make itself very known until plenty of awkward and useless school day scenarios have been expended. These scenarios also rear their ugly heads once again at inappropriate times, throwing in boob jiggles and pantie shots in the very midst of the emotional thick of a scene. It grows tiring, even to describe.\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime so determined to be compelling and sexy, the art was lazy. In trying to make the girls look cute and attractive, their faces had little expression and no matter the timing, no matter the cup size, no matter the outfit, the girls' chests were shaped like oranges in push up bras. \\n\r\nEven in the final, crucial moments, the main characters were poorly drawn and moved stiffly alongside badly placed 3-D. Like many of the behaviors of the characters themselves, one too many varying head sizes in one scene grew ridiculous, especially given how clean cut the opening could get.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in saying the behavior of the characters was ridiculous, I am saying an incredible truth.\\n\r\nFor heroines introduced as strong and unique fighters, they all had a way of crumbling and abandoning their character traits for the sake of catering to the useless showing off the main character exhibited. One moment, Julie could fight to the fullest, take down ten foes at once, and the next, Tor is vowing to protect her as she sits on the ground, confused. Everyone seemed to blend together to try and make Tor spectacular, when he was a protagonist who could not be saved. His tragic flashbacks received little to no explanation, and so I found I could care less about him. The fact that he was pushed to me as a sensitive and likable guy offended me.\\n\\n\r\nBut then again, much of the anime offended me. Everything was handled so haphazardly I couldn't enjoy myself in any other way than making complete fun of it all. 'Oh man they're all about to have a serious showdown, I wonder which girl is going to fall on her face with her ass in the air--I love that battle tactic.' I was offended at the thought that so little care went into managing the basic elements of the story. Should any of you out there chance Absolute Duo yourselves, I expect you shall share in my offense.",

            "content": "Okay, to start this review off. This anime could have been better if the plot actually made any sense at all. This story starts off with the main character, Tor. Hes the average main character in a harem. He is very similar to most harems that involve some sort of ability or super power out there. He meets girls, tries to protect them, then fails. Then throughout the anime(like most other stories) he magically(duh, this anime involves magic) gets stronger in less than a week, very awkward tbh. This first few episode got off to a goodish~ start(but in all honesty, I wanted Imari tobe his duo throughout the story, as she seems more lively and overall a fun character to watch, whenever shes in any part of the anime). But ends up throwing in this \"mysterious girl\", who apparently suppose to be the \"main\" female protagonist. After watching the whole anime, I've come to realize that, she has the worst character development(as of Tor as well) I've ever seen for a long time now(been watching anime for 8-9 years now) and this disappoints me on who bad it is. Every character, except for bunny-sensei",

            "content": "Absolute duo is about students who have weapons of the soul called blazes. Blazes can only hurt the soul..... At this point you already wonder how bad the show is going to be with such childish characteristics.\r\nStory:\r\nThe plot is average. It isn't very well developped and it doesn't feel smooth at all, rather it sometimes feels a bit far-fetched. We have a bunch of kids getting involved into dangerous scenarios with adults which are close to non-existant. Moreover, you get a sort of dramatic feel on the first episode since everyone has to sacrifice something but that gets shattered to pieces later on because whynot make it worse? Of course, just as expected there is still a plot line left undevelopped even though you'd have a good idea concerning it at the end.\\n\r\nI haven't got much to say to defend the plot except from the fact that blazes can actually hurt people which is a very little consolation.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis is where this anime lacks the most. The characters are beatifully drawn but the action scenes feel like role battles where each character attacks one at a time. There are a billion errors in every fight and all of them are easily noticeable. If you pay attention you can even see some oddness in the drawings during the fights and the pictures feel off every so often. Overall, I think it doesn't really deserve its Action tag.\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe background music is well-made. It serves to add some tension when everything else fails at doing so. The ED is above average, and the OP is good.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is where this show should have some worth. The character are well-made altough a tad generic and sometimes gullible and weak. The strength of this anime lies within the interactions in between the charactes. Dialogues that feel akward or out of place don't show themselves much unlike in most anime.\\n\r\nThen a character was introduced and we inherited the classical interactions that you would except for a very low tier anime. This anime's qualities weren't numerous but it still managed to destroy most of them.\\n\r\nLastly, let's talk about the boobsy HAREM. As we all know, 90% of boobsy harems are completly crappy animes. Absolute Duo does a good job at hiding the harem aspect of it but it jumps in your face when the previously mentioned character appears.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis show is hard to watch. I think it could have been a good show if there was less drama. It feels out of place. Though the drama isn't the only thing that needs to be fixed I think it'd be a good start.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nThis show isn't half bad but still lacks a lot in term of action and plot. I think most people would be able to watch it but it won't ever be considered good. Maybe if it was focused on them growing and ranking up in the academy with more character developpement it would have been much better. Also, if you are looking for an Action anime Absolute Duo doesn't fit the bill.\\n\r\nOverall, you should probably avoid this show and try to find another one that is not this bad. This has reach the point of non return. If a second season were to be aired which I highly doubt, I would Absolutely watch it just so I could spit some more on it with another review.",

            "content": "Truly outstanding, a completely new level for anime storytelling. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe plot is truly on a completely new level from any other anime I've seen. All the exposition dumps and deep mechanics never let me down even once, once I saw the truly incredible and unique setting and wonderfully original powers, I was sold.\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nOnce I was done with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I thought that I had reached the peak of art and design in anime, but this simply blew me out of the water! Never have I ever seen such well designed and well-crafted characters anywhere, truly outstanding. I must also complement the veryextensive use of CGI, it fits wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe audio was really something different from what I was expecting, exotic and beautiful. I must condone the very humble use of royalty-free sound effects, shedding light on how well the animation studio distributes their valuable time and outstanding talent. As if this wasn't enough the ever persistent screams of embarrassment and agony will surely leave you speechless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters were beautifully presented. Every person in this show had overwhelmingly deep and well thought-out personalities and differences. They really managed to make them blossom and develop to new heights, especially during the beach episodes, I would never rate the characters in this show anywhere under a ten.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI could never have predicted how incredibly invested I got, how delicately overjoyed I felt. Countless times I wanted to scream out of excitement or weep out of pure heartbreaking sorrow at the tragic moments where girls bikinis suddenly fly off over a cliff. I must say I'm speechless, never once have I felt so satisfied!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nBut for real though..\\n\r\nThe show was pretty mediocre. It has very bland and shallow characters, very clich\u00e9 setting and plot, an intense focus on fan service and some persistent annoyances (certain characters or plot devices). If your goal is to watch anime to laugh at it, not for it's actual humor but at its obvious lack of quality, then go ahead, that's what I did and I enjoyed it. If you want to watch it seriously, then maybe consider watching the 4000+ anime rated higher first. ~",

            "content": "Have you ever had trouble spotting a bottom-of-the-barrel title? Finding the product of studio algorithm, where the intent is solely that of a product and nothing more? Shows with as much integrity as a used car salesman with a tacky poker-dot tie, or as much validity as McDonald's promoting \"health\" through thinly cut apple slices and a bottle of processed milk? Hogwash that pretends to have artistic merit? And if so, would you like to sift through bottom-tier anime before so much as letting it occupy time on your media device? If you've answered yes to this, here are some quick tips to help youout:\\n\\n\r\n\u25b8Is there a typical school setting? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Is the protagonist a pussy magnet? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Is there a beach or hot spring episode? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Is there a love interest story that goes nowhere? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Is there unnecessary fanservice in the cover photo? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Is the lead easily flustered by anything involving females? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Does it go from tensionless fights to school rom-com at the drop of a hat? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Is there some kind of a pussy beta-male protagonist with a \"unique\"/hax superpower? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Is there a lot of instances where your lead is viewed as a pervert due to stupid misunderstandings? \u2611\\n\r\n\u25b8Is there at least one obligatory scene where this meta-male either walks in on a girl changing or accidentally gropes them? \u2611\\n\\n\r\nIf you answered \"yes\" to most, if not, all of those, then congrats! You've just found yourself a mouth-breather tier anime title. Either that or you've accidentally watched this piece of garbage, Absolute Duo. Absolute Duo does absolutely nothing new. It's the same cookie-cutter assembly-line product regurgitated yearly from the anime industry. With a few slight tweaks here and there, and a fresh coat of paint to mask the stench of unoriginality, these titles are excreted out by the dozen on constant demand. Absolute Duo is just another statistic. \\n\\n\r\nWhy bother writing a compelling narrative when excessive info-dumps and monologuing could do the trick? Why bother to make something with a modicum of artistic expression when you would just flash a few pantsu to win over mouth-breathers? Why bother trying when the audience being pandered to don't even demand anything more? It's hard not to be sardonic about titles like these, especially when the problem stems far deeper than simply \"the studio's fault.\" And in the case of Duo, what we have here is a symptom of audience complacency. Here's a world that exists byways of audience participation to do all the legwork for it. The show doesn't try because it's effectively harvested a viewership that doesn't expect it to. \\n\\n\r\nThe world of Absolute Duo is that of a dystopian future. A detail that's rendered entirely pointless given that it all takes place in a high school setting, with the purpose of even addressing the nature of the world's construct only coming to play to allow these teens the ability to wield supernatural weaponry\u2014no, that's not a joke, the show is really that lazy. And as is the tradition for these kinds of stories, we're given hints of a manipulative government faction. We're given hints at a budding school romance. We're given hints that the powers in the show have something more behind its mechanics than what's being told. We're given hints at a troubled backstory for our protagonist. We're given A LOT of hints but that's all, as this is yet another \"read the manga\" kind of title, where its entire purpose of existing hints towards being an advertisement for the source material. An ugly-looking, drably produced advertisement at that. \\n\\n\r\nThe color placement is flat. Its environment evenly lit, like the backlight of a computer monitor or the glow of a tracing table. This is an anime that can't be bothered with the trivial task of having a personality. It would much rather slouch about. Cardboard cutout characters designed with no discernable feature from its usual counterparts. Personalities equally as stock-piled, their behavior as lackluster as the color choices used to bring them to life. Not a single characteristic that expresses passion. Just a heartless product pumped out by the iron presses of a studio machine looking to make a quick profit with as little effort as possible. \\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to find anything here worth mentioning, as the only thing interesting about Duo is just how much it manages to fail. All you simply have to do is look at all the genres it's supposedly made up of and see it misses the mark with all of them:\\n\\n\r\n\u25b8It doesn't work as a school title since the school is just a backdrop and was never truly utilized.\\n\r\n\u25b8It doesn't work as a romance since nothing ever happens between the main love interest and the protagonist.\\n\r\n\u25b8It doesn't work as an action title since the fight sequences were barely animated with any sort of energy or dynamics.\\n\r\n\u25b8It doesn't work as a supernatural show since none of the power mechanics or lore gets fleshed out beyond face value.\\n\r\n\u25b8It doesn't work as a harem since the protagonist is a typical beta-male that freezes up at the thought of a woman's touch.\\n\r\n\u25b8It doesn't work as an ecchi title since it's not titillating, made worse when titles like Queen's Blade exists with amazing \"plot.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is a title that quite literally fails at everything it attempts to cover, and as such, I can't see how this could be anything less than a waste of 4 hours of your life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Duo/10\\n\\n\r\nAbsolute Duo is Absolute Garbage. It's a cheaply made cash-grab that serves no other purpose than selling the source material it's adapted from. A quick glimpse into the ugly side of the entertainment industry, showing just how far a studio is willing to compromise its principals to make a quick buck.",

            "content": "The writers might as well take out the \"duo\" and slap in \"harem\" instead cuz duo just isn't cutting it.\r\nA bland anime with some generic harem characters. Absolute duo may seem like your average action/harem anime, because it is.\r\nStory: 2/10 \r\nFirst off let me remind you that the plot is set in a world far, far away where girls possess all the cup sizes from A to Z cups. So don't be suprised if they turn out to be the only thing worth watching in the whole show. \r\nAbsolute Duo is about your average male protagonist who gains a special power and wants to seekrevenge for his deceased family. Tooru Kokonoe is a teenager who has the ability to materialize \u201cBlazes\u201d out of his soul. But he has no ordinary Blaze his blaze is an irregular, while other people generate Weapons Tooru can generate a shield. (Big deal right?) He then uses his special ability and enrolls himself into a school that teaches him to become stronger (even though he\u2019s a bit overpowered already). At this school he is forced to kick some booty, which then leads the female protagonist, Julie, to realize his existence. She takes interest in him, and by some random chance they are forced into the dorm room, and as the series goes on they become an \u201cabsolute duo\u201d which also forges an intimate relationship with each other. The anime throws you a couple curve balls later on, which keeps the story somewhat interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n-\tGreat Choice of voice actors, Matsuoka who voiced Sora and Kirito from NGNL and Sao voiced Tooru.\\n\r\n-\tThe OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s so far are pretty great, in my opinion.\\n\r\n-\tGreat soundtracks for most scenes especially the romantic scenes.\\n\r\n-\tDid a good job of using music for suspense and such.\\n\r\n-\tThey need better soundtracks for action scenes.(not really many action scenes so far tbh)\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10 \t\\n\r\nMost of the characters are a bit bland and unoriginal.\\n\r\n-\tTooru- Your average male lead who has a harem, he cares for his peers, and has overpowered combat abilities.  \\n\r\n-\tJulie- Your average shy airheaded dandere who\u2019s a few slices short of a fruit cake, also has good combat abilities\\n\r\n-\tMiyabi- Your average shy useless character who\u2019s afraid of males and her only job is to piss the audience off. (At least for me)\\n\r\n-\tTomoe- Your average female protagonist who doesn\u2019t know what love is, but then realizes she falls in love with the male protagonist. (So let the awkwardness ensue) \\n\r\n-\tLilith- A bratty rich girl, who is apparently from England, and also an irregular, she has mastered the fine arts of Engrish.\\n\r\n-\tUsa Sensei- Their homeroom teacher who has two personalities. (Probably the most interesting character in the show)\\n\r\nNeedless to say if all of these females had the brains the size of their bust it would make the show a whole lot more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe only thing that was good in this anime. \\n\r\n-\tCharacters have big boobs.\\n\r\n-\tGreat use of vibrant colors.\\n\r\n-\tGood contrast between light and dark.\\n\r\n-\tNicely animated action scenes.\\n\r\nI\u2019d say 8-bit studios did a pretty great job.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nThe anime definitely wasn't worth my time. The anime was pretty horrid from it's stupidly broad plot to it's equally broad characters. It's sad to see the anime end up so horribly because it actually had a lot of potential, but the directors or whoever does the screenplay ruined the whole show by making the show 99% fanservice with no plot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nI gave the anime an overall score of 4. Taking all things into consideration I had high hopes for this anime and I'd hoped it wont let me down. But several episodes in, I'd realized that even Jesus couldn't save this anime. The genre and tone seemed to be right up my alley, which is action, harem, and a slight dab of comedy. But after watching this many episodes I think my opinions were most likely clouded. I gave it a chance, but it's a pretty big let down.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended For- People who have watched all the good action/harem/romance anime's and have a lot of spare time. Or if you just love action/harems so much you want to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nNot Recommended For- People who want a action/harem with a good plot, and interesting characters, because I assure you this isn't something worth your time.",

            "content": "Yeah! This is my first review of Winter 2015. Oh yeah. Before I get on with the review just let me put some more nails in the coffin which now lies the ecchi jokes. Excuse me for a second.\r\nOk. I'm done. \r\nSTORY (2):\r\nAbsolute Duo or Absolute Hatred follows these two bland characters by the name of Tor Kokonoe & Julie Sigtuna who attend Koryo Academy where they are trained in combat skills using Blaze. Blaze are supernatural weapons that suit different combat skills. \r\nLet me tell you that I have 0 expectations when going into this anime. The concept is boring and it is anecchi genre. In fact, after that horrendous atrocity known as Rail Wars, I wasn't looking forward to watching this anime. So you know what, why not I review this anime.\\n\\n\r\nYou might say \"Why are you viewing an ecchi anime with expectations?\" My answer is \"I'm sorry. My butt cannot stand being violated by Winter Season Anime especially when it comes to ecchi jokes.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has some of the most horrendous dialogue and horrendous jokes I have ever seen since Rail Wars. There is one scene which is the worst scene I have ever seen in this anime. It is when Tomoe meets Tor for the first time, she keeps apologizing and jumps onto Tor and her head lands on Tor's crotch. Then some pauses and \"I'm Sorry!\" again and then Tomoe does another flip and Tomoe's butt landed on Tor, and pauses again. Rail Wars did that kind of joke like when Takayama accidentally gropes Haruka's boobs, there was a pause and then \"I'm sorry\". Seriously, how many times must an anime follow that kind of rule? I'm sorry, whenever I think of that scene, I always cringe inside.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also this girl get embarrassed when guy looks at the boobs. Bouncing of boobs. Beach episode. I can't take it.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, there was the fight scene between Miyabi & Tomoe. How they end the fight scene was so ridiculous. It ends with Miaybi saying \"I've been foiled by the power of love\".\\n\\n\r\nAt the very end, they tried to tie everything together and it was a fail. The fight scenes were rushed.\\n\\n\r\nART (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is nothing impressive. When it is dark, it is very dull. The action scenes are all dull and boring. These action scenes are all the \"Been there, done that\" action scenes. I never pay attention to the action scenes because I don't care anymore.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (2):\\n\\n\r\nWhere do I begin?\\n\\n\r\nTor & Julie might be like the new Sora & Shiro. However, Tor is more generic than compared to Shiro. His personality is as interesting as Edward Cullen. Especially, Julie, she is just another Bella Swan, who clings onto Tor with no personality.\\n\\n\r\nTomoe Tachibana - Her voice actress is Ayaka Suwa who voiced Tokaku Azuma from the atrocity known as Akuma no Riddle. She had the potential to become an interesting character like Mikazuki Yozora from Haganai. However, her character is annoying by apologizing to Tor a lot of times and she get into comedic misunderstandings with Tor.\\n\\n\r\nMiyabi Hotaka - What can I say? She is the most generic character I have ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nLilith Bristol: I also have nothing to say about her. She is just an generic tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nThe teacher bunny by the name of Rito Tsumiki was so annoying. She tried to sound cute but she sounded more like nails scratching on chalkboard. The voice actress Yukari Tamura, her voice is no longer funny or cute, her voice was just annoying. Your cute voice is no longer relevant anymore, you just sound like a broken record player trying to work.\\n\\n\r\nK is a generic villain. He looks like Gilgamesh from Fate/Stay Night. However, his personality is as interesting as a cardboard box. K only appears on the later half of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (2):\\n\\n\r\nI am so tired of these clich\u00e9d ecchi jokes. They are not funny or entertaining anymore. I didn't get a boner in any of the episodes. They are just cringe inducing. Saekano at least tried not to use these ecchi jokes but instead focus on good character development and serve its purpose well. This anime on the other hand tries to use all those \"been there, done that\" jokes and try to pass it off as entertaining. NO! You don't do that! \\n\\n\r\nEcchi jokes don't work anymore. Anyone who is planning to make an anime, DO NOT use ecchi jokes. Ecchi jokes are dead. They are not funny. All the ecchi jokes are just cash-grabbing, like to take people's time. I value my time and money and you should too. If you want to make a good comedy anime, do not use ecchi jokes. Make a good story with effort. There is no bigger crime than an anime that is meant to make people laugh or have a boner failed to do that.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime might not be a complete atrocity unlike \"Pupa\". But just like \"Pupa\", this anime is a prime example of the continuing bad practices of anime companies producing terrible anime in Winter Seasons. Especially when it comes to Ecchi genres.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have any expectations. The reason why I give this anime a 2 out of 10 is because the voice acting was decent except for Yukari Tamura, decent fight scenes and the animation at least wasn't bad compared to Pupa. Way to start my first review for Winter 2015, well done \"Absolute Duo\"! \\n\\n\r\nI now need to rest my head because there are more reviews to come for Winter 2015.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nWanting to be stronger is something that a lot of people strive for. And that isn't just in the sense of lifting weights to tone one's muscles. There is strength of mind in the form of intelligence or strength of spirit in having the courage to do what's right. But no matter its form, strength isn't something that is easily obtained. Hardship and difficulties are what give shape to such strength, and subsequently determine what strength is ultimately earned. This is what Absolute Duo tries to convey, but without much strength to support even itself.\r\nSTORY\r\nAbsolute Duo follows youngTor Kokonoe as he enrolls in Kouyou Academy to take part in the \"Duo\" program. There, he meets Julie Sigtuna, a mysterious girl who eventually becomes his fighting partner.\\n\\n\r\nAbsolute Duo is an ecchi series, therefore making much of the content focus on showing the girls in promiscuous situations. In other words, there are many scenes involving bouncing breasts, unfit clothing, and risqu\u00e9 positions that attempt to entice the viewer. No girl is left unscathed: Julie often wears a single button-up shirt, Miyabi always has the camera aimed at her enormous bosom, and Lilith revels in her sexuality which gives her the confidence to perform more daring ventures. The ecchi itself isn't too classy or original, usually falling back on easy tropes like lost panties or chest-hugging, but there is a nice amount of it throughout its entire run.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's as far as Absolute Duo gets in terms of positivity. When it isn't sexualizing its characters or going through with a comedic moment, the show doesn't know what to do with itself. The story it attempts to tell is entirely contrived, filled with disjointed segments and an apparent lack of cohesion. The students are fighting in a mall one episode, only to be whisked away to a secluded island the next. The motivation behind many of these events is spurred on by the so-called principal's desire of obtaining \"Absolute Duo,\" but what that really is isn't explained. And that goes for a large portion of the show: What was \"Equipment Smith\" trying to do? Who killed Tor's loved one? How does one become an \"Exception?\" There are other questions that are raised similar to these that are never answered, or even when they are, they are done in a slipshod manner. For example, Julie's actual status and powers are hastily shoved in minutes before the end of the series. Another is the \"Reign Conference\" that brought many different leaders together, but the meeting's purpose wasn't explained properly nor did it affect the outcome that followed. Again, these are just a few, but suffice it to say that the majority of whatever is presented is largely given the bare minimum of attention. All of this says nothing of the fight scenes, the powers everyone uses in them, and how lame most end up being. Tor's hammer-fist exists without explanation, bad guys let people live for no reason, and the battles usually give the side-cast the short end of the stick. It's all just a mess that it never recovers from, from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nHearkening back to the anime's theme, the show plays with the idea of strength, what it is, and how one obtains it. Many of the characters have separate drives when it comes to finding said strength: for revenge, for love, and for protection, to name a few. In order to make the idea more meaningful, the anime also tackles how some kinds of strength are evil: \"taking the easy route\" to get it is bad, as is simply wanting to have it without a purpose. The problem, though, is that such a theme is muddied by the fan-service, the lame narrative, and the pointless battles. Beyond that, the classification of strength in such a way is strange. Because it isn't so much how you get such strength, but what you do with it that matters. \"With great power comes great responsibility,\" as they say. In other words, Absolute Duo's segmentation of strength is not only difficult to see but also difficult to accept.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Absolute Duo is somewhat boring. It usually consists of the same-looking schools and buildings, with some variation in location. Some forests, a beach, and an amusement park here and there, but nothing that catches the eye or causes wonderment for the audience. Perhaps this is simply a product of the setting of the anime itself, with it not lending to such interesting environments. Regardless, what is presented is generally devoid of high detail, making it look general and same-y.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are strangely hit-or-miss. Julie's white hair and magenta-filled eyes are nice, yet Tor's, Tomoe's, and Miyabi's lack of detail is not. Their school uniforms have many layers, with blues, whites, and blacks making up most of their composition. On top of this, the Blazes (the weapons the cast wield) are jagged and black in color, giving them an ominous feeling that reflects the weapons' very nature.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation is not wishy-washy. Bluntly put, it's bad. And that's something that is sorely unneeded for a show that spends a lot of time on the fighting scenes it constantly throws the audience's way. During these scenarios, there are way too many close-ups and simple movements to reduce the amount of animation required. There is also the very jarring use of 3D used for particular situations and characters that is nothing more than distracting.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Absolute Duo do not fair too much better than their story brethren.\\n\\n\r\nTor is the star of the show, so his \"importance\" is the highest. Yet he's arguably the worst of the bunch. Average, kind, and compassionate, he's probably the perfect protector for Julie. This is further reinforced by his lone character trait: screaming \"Julie!\" whenever he has the chance. Obviously, he cares about her, which is fine. But there isn't anything else to him than that. That is, his past is mired in failed protection, so he makes it his life's duty to do what he previously could not. And he doesn't budge from such a stance; he doesn't experience other tribulations nor does he see such protecting as much of a challenge. He's the same super-nice, super-friendly, super-bad character for the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, Julie isn't much of an improvement, either. She's very quiet, sticking to Tor at all times due to some strange attachment. Furthermore, she isn't accustomed to her new surroundings, meaning she constantly does things incorrectly -- a gag rather than a meaningful characterization. Regardless, she, too, has a past that is controlled by death. But where Tor wanted to protect, Julie wanted to eviscerate. This development isn't revealed until much later into the show's run, meaning, once again, she is similar to Tor in that her growth over the course of the anime is nonexistent. She \"likes Tor\" and \"wants to be his Duo,\" but there is nothing more to her character outside of her quasi-girlfriend relationship with the main hero.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is wholly uninspiring as well. Rito is the professor who is also a bunny with a good and evil personality. Ryuutarou likes to flex his muscles. Aoi is quite annoying. Tomoe is quick to misunderstand and Miyabi is very shy. Both of these girls, though, are slightly better off than the others, receiving some focus later on in the series. But the problems they face are resolved too quickly to prove worthwhile to their overall characters. If anything, Lilith, the \"Exception,\" really is the only exception. She begins rather abrasive towards others, acting wholly arrogant given her special status. But after dealing with Tor's unwavering attitude and competing against the people she deemed worthless, she opens up, becoming both approachable and a good friend to the rest of the gang.\\n\\n\r\nAs a further look into everyone's character, and as becomes somewhat known over the course of the anime, the Blazes of the students are designed in such a way as to reflect the soul that wields it. Tor's is a shield due to his absolute need to protect the people around him. Julie wields two swords, demonstrating her need to punish first and ask questions later. Lilith uses a rifle to not only align with the \"Exception\" status but also due to her rather aimed personality. Tomoe's is a whip due to her cracking back-and-forth from being judgmental to apologetic, whereas Miyabi's is a massive jousting spear due to her already large amount of untapped potential. This technique can be applied to each of the named members of the show. And while not a fascinating detail, it is at least an okay concept that is employed to aid in characterization.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP for the show is rather fast, with the vocalist doing a lot of work. She shows a large amount of range, with both high and low notes, as well as extended note-holding. The beat and instruments are surprisingly modern, sounding more techno than instrumental. It's an okay song overall, but largely forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ED is very aquatic in nature. It's slow, with the drums and violin working during the first half. Around the middle, the sound somewhat cuts away, having the singer sort of \"skipping\" with the lyrics. Afterwards, the beat picks back up, with the vocalist continuing with the softer way of singing. Again, an okay piece that isn't highly memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe second ED is rather lackluster, with its easy beat and simple singing. The only mentionable part of the track is the ending \"Happy, happy!\" speaking, which is both cute and fun.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the third ED is more melancholic than the rest. The first third is interspersed with harp-like sounds and high violin playing. The second third becomes more hopeful, with the singer and instruments slowing down just a bit, with the final third picking back up the tempo. But like the second ED, this song just isn't that good to listen to, either on its own or within the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack has nothing worth remembering, either. There are \"soldier\"-esque tracks with drums and violins during battle segments, piano tracks during sad moments, and elevator music during the laid-back ones. They're simple mood pieces that aren't special or significant in any way.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting is about average across the board. Special shout-out to Nozomi Yamamoto as Julie for all of her \"Ja's\" and \"Nej's.\"\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThe show could be funny at times, especially in regard to Julie's ignorance of social cues and general cuteness. From her hair wiggle to her constant clinging to Tor, she could usually put a smile on my face. The other girls could, too; Tomoe's prostrations after mistaking the situation or Lilith's unabashed advances were enough to make me smile.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say that I like any of the characters, though. Or any of the battles for that matter. Or any of the world's rules and what-not. All of it is just \"there,\" with barely any semblance of \"oomph.\" And it's not that it had a lot to work with, but more so the fact that it couldn't do anything with what it had.\\n\\n\r\nAbsolute Duo is an anime that focuses on pairings: relationships and boobs being the most prominent. But no amount of fan-service could save this one from its awful plot, lame characters, boring art, and forgetful music. It's simply a really bad experience the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, okay ecchi scenes, disjointed plot, lame motif\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, okay art style, okay character designs, below average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Tor and Julie are poor characters, the rest of the cast besides Lilith is just as poor, Blazes at least serve some purpose\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, okay OP, okay first ED, bad second ED, bad third ED, bad soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, could be comical at times but not much else\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 2/10",

            "content": "Absolute Duo is like a raisin cookie, everyone thinks it's a chocolate chip cookie and it will be good, until you eat it and realize it's not what you expected, unless you actually like raisin cookies.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story is somewhat unoriginal, mainly because it's those types of anime where you are embedded a certain type of weapon that you carry on for the rest of your life, having the ability to summon it anytime you want. The only twist is, you're in a duo. Now, every time you're in a duo it's likely that your partner is someone of the same sex, right? Well inthis anime the partner is a girl, and they both have to live in the same room. That calls for a shit-load of accidental boob-grabbing in the middle of the night. Not only is that there, but it's a harem. It's not needed for this kind of action anime, mainly because it's set on a duo, not a triplet or a quadruplet. For the action part of it, it's actually somewhat decent mainly because I enjoy those types of anime where the main character is a 'special/chosen/OP AS FUCK' type of character.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very smooth and nice, just by looking at the cover photo. The colors are very bright and easily catch your eyes and the animation is smooth. The details in the eye are quite new to me, but hey new stuff means good stuff right? \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is very modern and fits each scene nicely. My favorite in the sound section is the OP. I first heard it while playing a rhythm game (osu! kek) and instantly to me, it was catchy and stuck to my brain. The ED was the same with the OP, (I also heard it on osu! wtf) but not as good. It's based on apple tea, which is pretty weird for an ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nKokonoe Tooru, is a high-school boy who has a dark past. Tooru may look very weak, but as the anime progresses, he does get much more powerful. He's a very kind person who has the resolve to protect Julie and his other friends. He is an irregular.\\n\\n\r\nJulie Sigtuna (heh tuna), is a high-school girl who also has somewhat of a dark past. She is introduced as a very powerful character and as the anime progresses, she gets much more powerful. She's very attached to Tooru and possibly has feelings for him. She is a very quiet girl and likes apple tea.\\n\\n\r\nTogether, they both make a duo.\\n\\n\r\nBristol, Lillith is girl who graduated and came all the way to Japan to meet the irregular, who is Tooru. She was introduced as a small antagonist but as the anime progresses, she develops feelings to the point where she even mentions of being his future wife. She is a prideful girl who would not let anyone stand above her.\\n\\n\r\nHotaka Miyabi is a high-school girl who is introduced a very shy character. She is introduced as weak and a not-very-athletic character, but as the anime progresses, she starts to also develop feelings for Tooru. A very kind girl who wants to be with Tooru.\\n\\n\r\nTachibana Tomoe is a high-school girl who is introduced as a strong character and is skilled at martial arts. She is the type of character who has never thought of being in love.\\n\\n\r\nMiyabi and Tomoe are both a duo.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story wasn't original, I still enjoyed it mainly because it was made in 2015 and I thought it was going to be something new. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime to me was very rushed, because other things have not been explained, like the history of Exceeds, why this or why that. I doubt that there will be a season 2, because of the low ratings it got. It didn't live up to my expectations though. Would I re-watch this anime? Maybe, because I might have missed a lot of stuff. \\n",

            "content": "In the ocean of generic harems that we've been all been graced by the last few years, here we finally have a show that breaks free of all those bonds and- ...no sorry, Absolute Duo is just yet another one of them from start to finish. After the hilarious trainwreck that Studio 8bit presented with their adaptation of Grisaia no Kajitsu last season, you'd think that at least they couldn't make anything worse right afterwards but you may very well argue that they did. Admittedly I don't think anyone had very high expectations on Absolute Duo in comparison, but that still doesn't change the factthat the show did absolutely nothing to try and defy those expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in a typical magic high-school where the students learn to utilize what's referred to as their Blaze: a physical manifestation of their human soul which normally takes the form of a melee weapon. The school also has a so-called Duo partner system where all the students cooperate in pairs of two for the sake of combat training, which of course conveniently enough enables our protagonist Tooru to end up living with a beautiful silver-haired girl named Julie. It's a shocking plot twist for sure and a never-before-seen way to build up the setting for an action/fantasy/ecchi/harem light novel adaptation. Beyond that, there isn't really much to be said about the story other than it has some fanservice moments, some clich\u00e9 ecchi jokes, some hack & slash fight scenes with generic villains and more along those lines throughout the anime. It really isn't any more interesting than that.\\n\\n\r\nPretty much all the characters are incredibly generic and follow standard character tropes like cardboard cutouts. They're the types which you pretty much can judge immediately after you've gotten your first impression of them, and they're all shallow enough for you to be able to sum them up in a single sentence. The only one that actually stands out in any way is Julie as she's more of an emotionless dandere moecchi loli, compared to the more standard overly-busty fanservice girl which would normally get the main heroine role in a show of this nature. She reminds me a lot of Est from Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance, albeit definitely not quite on that level of cuteness.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is basically what you'd expect; it has a lot of vibrant colors and fancy character designs, but at the same time the limited budget shines through as there are plenty of moments where the overall quality drops, and a few of the episodes look very rushed as a result. On the other hand the voice acting is overall very good with several famous actors in the cast such as Matsuoka Yoshitsugu, Tamura Yukari and Horie Yui. The soundtrack makes good use of music to properly enhance the atmosphere of both the action-packed and the romantic scenes, and also both the OP and ED have some pretty great electronic tracks for them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Absolute Duo is not a terrible show but it's more of a case of a concept which has more or less been done to death by now, and more often than not it's been done better before. Fortunately these kinds of generic harems are rarely boring per se though so it's still pretty easy to watch, but as far as actual quality goes then it has virtually none to speak of. The only reason I would recommend anyone to watch this show is because of how cute Julie is, unless of course you happen to be someone who never gets sick of seeing the same cardboard cutout storyline over and over again. I don't regret watching it, but I can't say it really provided me much to praise it for either.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've got nothing better to do, then Absolute Duo is a pretty simple way to spend an evening. However you will have to really run out of options before you're unable to find anything more worth your time than this.",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\nAll of the reviews of this I've seen have been negative and with good reason. However, I liked that fact that the plot consists mainly of two 'avengers' seeking power to avenge their loved ones who died. it may be clich\u00e9 but It works (for me anyway). And then there's the underlying story of the head mistress and her goal to reach absolute duo. On top of that there's also the character K who is a soilder of a different origin than the exceeds. The plot is under developed but I feel that there's a lot to it which can be exploredin depth which is my main reason for having hope for a second season. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, I like it because all of the characters seem relatable in some way e.g. Tor dealing with the situation of having to live with a girl. Then there's Miyabi who gets turned down by Tor and you get to see how she deals with rejection (although her response was far more radical than it would be of a normal high school kid it was still along the lines of what you'd expect i.e. thinking there's something wrong with herself and wanting to change in order to get Tor to like her). Then there's Julie who gets jealous because of lilith's affection towards Tor etc. There's also Tomoe who cares about everyone and so on. and you've also got Rito who at the start all of the characters don't really like (similar to the way kids in school will have that one teacher they're not that fond of). However, that does change at the end because she protects the dorm and the pupils inside. On a side note, lilith is a very interesting character as she is the only other character other than Tor who has an abnormal blaze. She is also fixated on ensuring that Tor becomes her future husband which leads to an awkward relationship between herself, Tor and Julie. All of the characters are in desperate need of development but there has been slight developments i.e. Tor finally accepting that he'll be living with Julie - that his duo is a girl etc\\n\\n\r\nThe combat is pretty poor for the most part I have to admit, but, I feel like that may be primarily due to the fact that one of the main protagonists are based on protecting and defending. But yeah the actual combat overall is pretty poor but I'm fully invested in the characters and story which make up for the lack of intense combat. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Absolute duo - to me - feels like it's slice of life high school drama but with a twist and that twist is that it's an academy focuses on combt training etc which I guess is why I like it so much. There are a lot of over sexualised moments which aren't needed in the slightest. And the story does need more depth for its viewers to sink their teeth into but I find the anime overall incredibly enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nTo anyone wanting to watch this anime - don't expect much, have an open minded approach to it and I'm sure you'll gain some enjoyment out of it. \\n\\n\r\nP.s this is my very first review and I'm new to watching anime so my ideals may seem stupid etc but I'm hoping that over time I'll be able to become an adept reviewer. Any feedback - positive or negative - is welcome, just send me a message. Thanks!",

            "content": "\"It was like a scene from a teen movie\" -K (except it was four and a half hours long)\r\nPreface: \r\nAbsolute Duo is what we call least common denominator entertainment. It takes _trite_ and true tropes from a hundred other anime that are equally as generic and clich\u00e9, slaps a fresh coat of paint on (and some nasty 90s looking 3D CGI), some new names, and the semblance of a plot, all nicely wrapped up in used toilet paper for your viewing (dis)pleasure. Inspid to the max, somebody dug up some long forgotten, rotting corpse of a moe-harem-action plot from underneath the dumpster outside and said\u201chey guys, wouldn\u2019t it be funny if\u2026\u201d and Absolute Duo was born.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Artwork: 3\\n\\n\r\nDon't let the OP fool you. The OP looks like it could be great for the 1:30 duration of the song, but the visuals in the meat of the show are average at absolute best. The most abhorrent thing is the 3D animated soldiers. If I could vomit fake, run over it with a dump truck, melt it down, eat it, and then crap it out again, it would look better than this hack fraud schlock. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 6\\n\\n\r\nFinally, something worth talking about. Absolute Duo does make good use of some talented VA.\\n\r\nTooru's voice, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, is instantly recognizable as the voices of Kirito (SAO) and Arata (Trinity Seven). \\n\\n\r\nYukari Tamura (Kill La Kill, Higurashi) is FAN freaking TASTIC as always. She reprises her role as Nui Harime here and... *whispers*  \"wait wat?\" I'm being told that she is actually not playing Nui Harime, and is instead Tsukimi, the teacher. Well, they're the same thing anyway.\\n\r\nHaruka Yamazaki (Inou Battle), a relative newcomer, also gives a good performance as Lilith.\\n\\n\r\nOP and both ED's are fast paced electronica tunes. Good stuff.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nTooru: typical MC, out for vengeance... meets all these girls, friendship never eeeeends! (I can\u2019t groan enough here,) Due to {insert generic traumatic past} he must protect his friends at all costs, and given that his Blaze, the manifestation of his soul is a shield... let the self sacrifice begin.\\n\r\n-Julie: na\u00efve, bland airhead, exists for loli fanservice.\\n\r\n-Miyabi: useless, luckless, and serves to be really annoying and drag everyone down (it's probably the weight of her boobs).\\n\r\n-Tomoe: average female protagonist, above average bust size.\\n\r\n-Lilith: I like the way reviewer Poorqs put it: \"A bratty rich girl; she has mastered the fine arts of Engrish.\"\\n\r\n-Nui Harime: The teacher. She has two modes: one; obnoxiously cutesy, bubbly, and overbearing. Two: murderous, unhinged, and deadly. She's also the object of many a fantasy, being both in maid costume at all times with bunny ears and a tail, the aforementioned disproportionate breasts, and stupidly overpowered.\\n\\n\r\nThe character of Lilith was woefully underutilized, in my opinion. Though she says some real groaners, she's a more interesting character than the other females for the sole fact that she knows a lot of things they don't and doesn't act like a giant idiot at all times. She also has a particularly useful power of having a gun when everyone else has melee weapons, but it\u2019s never effectively used, because everyone has to monologue long enough for it to be forgotten about. She does get a little more development other than showing off her unrealistically proportioned boobs.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\\n\r\nTooru Kokonoe, our \"tragic hero\" enters cookie cutter magical school in order to gain MORE POWER!!! with which he vows to get vengeance for his lost loved one. He and his airhead moron of a partner Julie solemnly swear that they\u2019re up to no good and head off to go rip shit up, but mostly just get their butts handed to them repeatedly before the power of friendship takes over. The love stories go nowhere, the plot spins like a broken record, unnecessary side plot and terrible exposition, not to mention the just general trainwreck of tone.\\n\r\nThere's a slew of other cookie cutter character boxes to check off, the x-dere this, y-dere that, and a really contrived love quadrangle that's forced in for plot convenience and to try and give some conflict to this utterly boring schlock.

            "content": "TL;DR An utterly bland, by the numbers fantasy harem romance that feels like it only exists because there was a hole in a schedule that needed plugging. Don't bother.\r\nTo my mind, there are three types of bad show. There's the ones that sincerely think they are good, but end up being terrible. There are those that would have been good if their initial ambition had only been matched by their ability to realise it. & then there are those that just don't care enough to make the effort. Absolute Duo, sadly, is the last of these. \r\nAfter a brief prologue that foreshadows a possible conflictto come between the two main characters (that ends up looking nothing like it's depicted here *spoiler*), we begin by accompanying Tooru (or Tor or Thor or whatever the translator feels like using at a given point in time) on his first day at a new school for magic people. For reasons that don't matter & nobody seems to care, the school is made up primarily of random European landmarks such as Big Ben & the Colosseum, I guess because it looks cool. It is in said Colosseum that our main man suddenly finds himself in a battle royale to decide which entrants are actually worthy of attending the Kouryou Academy, announced by a loli goth who it turns out is the school principal. \\n\\n\r\nIt is during this fight that we discover Tooru to be a special snowflake, because unlike everyone else his Exceed power takes the form of a shield instead of a weapon, marking him out as an Exception. Not that this apparent handicap matters, because he also has a special falcon punch attack that is never really explained but sure is good for hitting girls in the belly. Anyways to the surprise of nobody he passes the battle royale & so begins his & our journey through quite possibly the worst show of the Winter 2015 season.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up Absolute Duo's biggest flaws in a sentence, it is that the show is just going through the motions & really doesn't care if anything makes sense so long as it keeps the story moving in its desired direction. The most obvious example of this is the titular Duos themselves, specifically the one between Tooru & main loli Julie, a foreign exchange student from a made up place in Europe. It's established pretty quickly that forming a duo is a) a pretty unremarkable thing that every Exceed does & b) it is always between two members of the same sex. However, because no homo, when it comes to Tooru agreeing to form a Duo with token guy friend Aoi, suddenly it's a really big deal that they have to sign what amounts to a marriage certificate & our MC must do the right thing & form a Duo with Julie instead. \\n\\n\r\nNaturally nobody else sees what the fuss is about & indeed Tooru & Julie are noted as odd for being a boy-girl duo, which makes it seem all the odder that Tooru had such a problem forming one with Aoi. Of course the answer to why is that the Duo is really just a contrivance to create a \"romantic moment\" where Tooru asks Julie & also to put Tooru & Julie in a binding relationship together, because writing friendships/romances that form naturally is hard work for a Light Novelist. This adds to the already forced fun that is when, to the surprise of nobody watching, Tooru finds himself sharing a room with Julie & shock horror she doesn't know how to look after herself. If you've seen Pet Girl of Sakurasou, you could sum up their relationship as Sorata & Mashiro with magic swords & I think you'd just about get the gist of it.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond this trio (Aoi nonchalantly forms a Duo with another guy but he plays no role beyond kinda making their Duo look like a Uke - Seme pairing), we also have Tomoe & Miyabi, who form the girl Duo in our group. Because :anime: there are some yuri undertones to their bond, with stronger & more outwardly confident Tomoe forming a protective attachment to the more insecure & shy Miyabi. Of course, again because no homo, those undertones are really just there so the second end credit sequence can have them both naked in it, & in fact Miyabi soon forms feelings for Tooru because everyone else is doing it so why not her too? Don't be shocked if her feelings & desire to prove herself worthy of Tooru's non-existent affection end up causing trouble. \\n\\n\r\nOur group, which you can call a harem although it's one of those where it's clear from the beginning that the MC only has eyes for one girl, is rounded off with the arrival of transfer student Lilith Bristol, another Exception who quickly decides she's going to form a duo (& marry) Tooru, but of course his manly man principles see him stick it out with Julie. Much hijinks, many boob grabs & hilarious misunderstandings ensue. It's really fresh & original stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Absolute Duo is one that's best not given too much thought, because it will only hurt your brain. Our first antagonist, for example, is revealed to be none other than the groups class teacher, bunny-sensei (she has a name, but you won't remember it. You'll remember her bunny maid outfit, though) who for reasons unknown decides to try & kill those Exceeds who are doing well during a class exam/battle royale. Of course, our heroes ultimately defeat her through the power of friendship, only for her to go right back to being their teacher because the loli-goth principal thinks she's good at her job. That's it. There's no real indication that she's working with the Rebels, who become the schools main antagonists after this point, nor is it suggested as it so easily could have been that she was doing it on the principals orders as part of her at all costs plan to find the titular \"Absolute Duo\" (which isn't really explained but one can assume means the most powerful Duo in Duodom). It just kinda happens. \\n\\n\r\nSaid Rebels themselves don't make all that much sense as antagonists. Their leader, Equipment Smith (only in anime would he be called that), seems to want to make an army of super soldiers to counter the academy's Exceeds or something but it's not quite clear why or, if that's the case, why him, loli-goth & others form a round table of leaders that meet to discuss...I don't know what in a later episode. But they fill the roll of bad guys, & Rebel member K the role of Tooru's nemesis specifically (something about Tooru & Julie's bond really rubs him up the wrong way, for :anime: reasons), so just go with it. Things happen, decisions are made, allegiances shift, & all simply because the plot requires it at that point in time regardless of whether it makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nTooru & Julie's relationship, like everything else, is also one of those that feels like it's just going through the motions. It starts out with Julie apparently being incapable of looking after herself, so naturally Tooru must, as it were, domesticate her. Then we progress to her feeling unconfident & insecure about her fighting abilities, which naturally Tooru is there to give her the reassurances & head rubs every girl needs to feel good about themselves. Then things take a turn which I wish anime didn't do so often (as if it wasn't patronizing & weird enough), wherein it becomes apparent that Julie is actually capable of being an incredibly powerful fighter (as the prologue foreshadows) but that power is dangerous & it is Tooru's manly duty to both tame it when in danger of going out of control & ultimately for him to get powerful enough that she never need fight herself. Because if there's one place safer for a girl than behind a sword, it's behind the back of the man wielding her sword for her. \\n\\n\r\nIt may come as no surprise that despite obviously being the couple, Absolute Duo pulls the usual anime schtick of never actually having Tooru & Julie express romantic feelings towards each other, instead having them develop a more familial, platonic relationship that's all about trust & protection (& not sex!) despite this being a romance series & theirs clearly being the romance. I don't know why anime does this, but it does get pretty boring hearing the MC shout \"JULIE!\" in that constipated action anime voice during climactic scenes & then the closest thing we get to a romantic moment is a head pat or words of encouragement (I don't count Julie doing something that in a normal relationship would be romantic but because this is anime makes Tooru freak out like she just whipped out a penis). Of course, this is pretty standard for anime, so I guess you just have to go with it. \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help Absolute Duo's case that beyond the at best generic characters & story, there's plenty about the shows production to criticize. There is quite heavy use of CGI in fight scenes, & it looks as bad as you'd expect. It's not like the fight scenes are particularly high octane or exciting to begin with, compounded by how the CGI has that weird effect of making everything look slower, which kinds takes the thrill out of some moments. The character designs, as I have alluded to already, seem in a few cases to be more about pillow cover/figurine sales than anything like reflecting the characters personalities. The characters eyes also have a really odd look to them, as rather than having black pupils they're the same colour as the iris, only with a black rim denoting where one ends & the other starts. It's a minor thing, but I found it really odd, as though they had coloured stones inlaid into the eye socket rather than actual eyes. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond that the art & animation is pretty standard. There is also, as you'd expect, a whole lot of \"titillating\" fanservice, which tends to be like buses in that none comes for a while & then OMG they're all naked in a hot spring together. The OST is pretty bad, the fight music in particular suffering from both being underwhelming & clearly looped. I guess the OP is pretty good, with one of those thumping trance-rock hybrid songs over a pretty action heavy animation sequence. It's a shame that they seem to have shot it entirely on two's, resulting in the OP looking like it's constantly buffering. In short it seems the show was given enough of a budget to get the job done & nothing more; much like everything else about the series, really.\\n\\n\r\nSo then, here we are at the end of a journey we'd all have been better off not taking. It has to be said that as bad as Absolute Duo is, it's not offensively so. Indeed it's biggest sin is that it just doesn't seem to even try to be good, or at least interesting. The whole thing feels like everyone involved, from the author to the publisher to the animation studio, is just doing this project because it's there to be done. If Absolute Duo had been one of those shows that felt sincerely like it's trying to be good, or that it was a case of having more ambition than the capacity to realise it, I wouldn't have minded as much. But the whole thing reeks of being a by the numbers, who cares if it's good so long as it shifts some books & merchandise affair. Don't waste your time with it.",

            "content": "Absolute Duo, based on a decently received light novel series. It enters the competition of generic battle harems of spring 2015 - and clearly doesnt make the cut. The absolute unoriginality of the characters, the linear and terribly explained story and terrible pacing and conversations make watching all the twelve episodes a clear waste of time.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nHigh school setting; Powerful MC who cant love with mysterious past; all types of girls that fall in love with him for dumb reasons; a linear antagonist who breaks from his shell and gets defeated by MC with nakama power. Uhm, where have I seen this before? Well, everywhere.While the first few episodes definitely arent that bad and actually manage to make the usual harem tropes enjoyable, at latest after the 7th episode it gets just terrible. Even if the story and background sucked, we wouldn't know - there's barely even anything explained. I dont even know what the Absolute Duo is in the end...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nCredit due where its due - the art style is good. While not as good as shows like Hyouka, it lives up to today's standards. Especially the animations of the rebel group and the AMAZING dance scene in the opening are worth being called good. Nothing special though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nSame story as the art. Voices are well chosen - especially Tsukimi-sensei - and the background music is decent. I loved both OP and ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nNormally I dont dislike the typical dere-characters, but this is going overboard. I havent hated, no, DESPISED a single character ever - until I met Miyabi. Listening to hear and seeing what she does made me cringe every single time and regret watching it. Julie had great potential but got smashed with her demon side. MC is decent, I've seen far worse.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nI'm sure you'd expect a way lower rating here. Well, the first episodes definitely werent bad at all, noone could've predicted the following shitshow in the last episodes. Pointless conversations and repetitive subjects clearly destroy the positive aspects that were built up in the earlier part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nWhile not being completely terrible, if you pay a closer look and actually expected anything from the story, then this will be a waste of time. This show made everything wrong that could've been done wrong while writing the script and planning the plot. Dont watch this.\\n\\n\r\nI hope that this doesnt get a second season and if it does, I hope it manages to develop a deeper plot and turn away from the extremely boring and even annoying characters.",

            "content": "Anime cliches have been around for a good many years now.  The characters troupes that we become accustomed to, certain kinds of scenes, as well as genres have all become rather well known in the anime community.  It is with this that finding anything really out of the ordinary becomes a somewhat hard task.  And then we have Absolute Duo, a show that touches on both sides of the argument.  \r\nStory (6.44/10): In the world of Absolute Duo, there is a kind of people known as Exceeds, people who are able to harness the power of their soul to form weaponsknown as blazes, ranging from all forms of pre-gun weapons from swords, to daggers, bows, lances, and even a snakeblade.  It is here where we follow the story of Kokonoe Tor, a boy who goes to attend Koryo Academy, a place where they train Exceeds so that one day, they can reach the highest level of power, Absolute Duo.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom a story standpoint, Absolute Duo does show promising development.  A lot of anime that involve a lot of sci-fi/fantasy elements do have that little spark that make them different from the others, thus expressing the uniqueness of a show that I feel is necessary to earn any viewers.  With the idea of the Duo System (which is basically a battle partnership) that this series has, as well as the idea of weapons made from the soul, I felt like Absolute Duo did have quite a bit to promise in terms of story idea, and it did, to a certain degree.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I felt was lacking a lot about the show is more or less the amount of detail that was being expressed at a given time.  Throughout the show, the story hints at these past events that our main two protagonists have that drive them to becoming a soul weapon wielding badasses.  Rather than fleshing that out, the show puts that in the backseat of the show and progresses along with a plot that really at times, wasn't all that exciting.  A major gripe I have about the show in regards to the backstory, is just how forced it feels, thus creating the \"vengeance\" cliche, as I call it.  Basically, this means that the ONLY reason our characters really bother in becoming an Exceed in the first place, is to hunt down and seek vengeance on the person who slaughtered someone near and dear to them without ANY indication over who that person is or what their purpose was.  To me, it hurts the story more than anything because an idea like this is guaranteed to never be touched on again, and that really is a shame since a lot of anime share this cliche, and none of them follow through.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother fault I find is the fact that the show really doesn't try to be different.  While the story idea may be interesting enough, the actual scenes, aren't.  What this means is that the show falls back on cliches whenever it's trying to tell a story.  In any given bit of plot progression the show relies on a reused scene idea used hundreds of times in order to explain what is going on.  Having a conversation during a battle is fine, but saying that your only reason to fight is to get more powerful and power is the only thing that matters is dumb.  Having a girl make a full 180 on her character after the MC beats her?  Seen it, used it, copyrighted it.  The impact from this mostly equates to making the series just lackluster in presentation.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall though, Absolute Duo's story was more disappointing than anything.  While I didn't expect very much from the people who made Infinite Stratos, I felt like Absolute Duo could've turned into something just a little bit more.  The series simply just solves the problems that the series created during the spur of the moment, and not any of the underlying problems like the revenge that Tor is so sought after.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Interesting story idea\\n\r\n-   Lackluster presentation\\n\r\n-   Original problems not solved\\n\r\n-   Very cliched storytelling\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6.42/10): Characters, similar to story, follow a similar path to the story, riddled with cliche anime troupes everywhere, and that one interesting character that sorta turns your head.\\n\\n\r\nUp first, Kokonoe Tor.  Or, as everyone else likes to say: Kokonoe-kun, Tor, KOKONOE TOR!, Danna-sama, Toru, etc.  As expected by someone who is played by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, Tor is the harem lead character of the series, being nice to everyone, spouting the \"I will protect everyone\" speech, and overall being the affection of several girls' desires.  However, unlike the other characters of the series, Tor's Blaze is a shield.  (Unlike a certain swordsman played by the same seiyuu.)  Aside from that one difference, Tor doesn't really play off as any real unique character.  Because he plays the chivalry card, there really isn't much you can say about him other than the fact that he wants to protect people, resulting in the fact that he barely changes in the series.  But at the very least, you won't forget his name!  Cause it's not like they mention his name every 3 minutes or anything like that, maybe consecutive times for the antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Sigtuna Julie, our main female protagonist.  As the main female protagonist of the series, Julie is the Duo of Tor, aka his battle partner and roommate.  (Try and imagine all the non-H things they did.  Whatever you're thinking, the show probably did it.)  Similar to Tor, Julie bears the vengeance ideal, seeking revenge on the person that killed her father using two swords that allow her to spin and slice through whatever the hell she wants.  While Julie herself isn't a bad character, she does come off a little weak in any actual development, similar to Tor.  There really isn't enough emphasis on either one of them, rather putting them both together to make them like a whole with each of them as a half for the other.  Because of this, she, like her Duo, doesn't stand up by themselves as a proper character, and the way I see it, isn't smart to have characters that rely on each other on personality.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have the other characters for the series, such as the rest of the harem girls, Miyabi, Tomoe, and my personal favorite, Lilith Bristol, who wields a freaking rifle.  In addition, we also Tora, Tatsu, Imari, and a couple other characters making up the side cast.  Aside from Lilith, the rest of the student characters that bear any importance suffer a similar problem to the mascot characters of the show, which is not being able to stand up on their own.  A lot of the time, you see the characters fall back on their partner for support and conversation, which for a series that has this for its main plot point, does make a lot of sense.  However, the way it's done makes it so that no one character can really make him/herself stand on their own two feet.  They are restricted to getting their minimal amount of character growth from other characters and individually, they feel hollow and incomplete.  (Also, I kinda hate the bunny teacher.  I know that there's a fandom devoted to her, but I honestly can't take characters like her, what with that stupid bing-bong crap and the dual personality.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters of Absolute Duo weren't really shining examples of what could've been.  I didn't expect much actual character development from a show such as this, but I wanted something more than just troupes and character reliance.  No one really stood out as unique, (except Usa-sensei, sadly.)  and the series did fall in that regard.  Antagonists in Absolute Duo are also lackluster as well, so don't expect anything deep or meaningful with their evil plots.  (Like seriously, who the hell obsesses THAT much over a guy whose only real weapon is a goddamn shield?)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/-  Anime character troupes.  (Helps ease the characters into the character's heads, not so much in terms of significant development.)\\n\r\n-     Character reliance for personality\\n\r\n-     Stereotypical and overused villain troupe\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.21/10): Absolute Duo was produced by 8-bit, the same studio that made La Fruit de Grisaia, Avengelion Ewol, and the show featuring out favorite harem MC, Infinite Stratos.  (Fucking Ichika.)  Likewise, Absolute Duo is done in a similar quality to those shows.  The art for the series does look rather aesthetically pleasing with some pretty nice designs for the Blazes.  The art for the series is standard for the current age of anime, so there's really not much to say beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nThere are however, some...bugs in the artwork.  At times, the art quality both dips and raises up a little bit, making the show waver in appearances from one scene to the next.  In addition to the lack of artistic regularity, 8-bit also pulled up its IS schematics and used a bit of the wonderful... wonderful CGI.  More than anything, it just looks awkward, and glaringly so.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the music side of things, Absolute Duo hosts a somewhat decent soundtrack.  The most memorable of the bunch being its opening, Absolute Soul, which is a song that I have grown to love.  The opening has a very unique sound and rhythm to it that makes it feel actually quite memorable.  Aside from the kickass opening that you could probably listen to for hours on end, the rest of the soundtrack is kind of lacking as nothing else really stands out.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Decent art\\n\r\n+  Kickass opening\\n\r\n-   Art wavers in quality a lot\\n\r\n-   rest of the soundtrack isn't as memorable\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (7.00/10): While I may have been hacking and slashing away at this show for all its worth throughout this entire review, I can't honestly say that this show isn't completely bad.  While unwanted and tired cliches are prominent and plentiful throughout this series, the show itself isn't completely unwatchable. Of course, the show does literally shoot its characters down with guns of all sorts, but that's not what we're worried about at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nFrom an entertainment standpoint, the show gets good marks.  Absolute Duo isn't as far as I can see a show that should be taken with the thought of being wowed.  I went into this show thinking that there were going to be some disappointing elements, and I turned out to be right.  That being said, the idea of the soul weapons \"Blazes\" and some of the fights do actually make up slightly for the mountain full of troupes and cliches that make up a lot of the show's screentime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nWhat I didn't like was simply just how cliched it was.  (Yes, yes.  I am aware that me writing cliched a bunch is turning into a cliche.)  A lot of the show could've been handled in a way that would've made for a more interesting storyline and/or view.  The show goes from one of its more higher points into one that comes from a troupe you've probably seen several times before, and it's this where I find the majority of the problems for the series, aside from, you know, giving us a read the manga ending cause neither one of the main characters have completed their self-appointed task.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it?\\n\\n\r\nAbsolute Duo in my opinion serves more like a bit of fluff entertainment more than anything.  The show wasn't executed in a way that I felt was worth more than just a show you could watch in your downtime, as reused story points plague its entire 12 episode run with old, tired harem troupes.  (In addition, 5 of the girls in this series basically have balloons sticking out of their chest.  I'll leave the rest to you.)  Absolute Duo could've potentially become more than it already was, it had a good bit of groundwork it could've used.  Sadly though, it relied too much on established anime harem scenes, troupes, and characters that I think hurt the show in the long run.  If you want a harem sci-fi show, Absolute Duo does fit the bill.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6.45/10",

It's Harem and Ecchi genres, whenever it involves both kind of categories together, i wouldn't expect too much about the story and character development, but a good fun, enjoyment and laughter. Mainly, as you know, it's more of a fan service type of anime.\r\nI wouldn't recommend anyone who is looking for a fantastic story and a good character development for this anime. The story progression is quite how you would have guessed as the episodes progress, yet i think it is rather interesting of how the characters are able to use their unique ability.\r\nFor anyone who enjoys a fairly good artwork with ecchi andinvolves harem in it, i can say that you would enjoy it.\\n\\n\\n",

Every \"Absolute\"-Pun from here on is unintended.\r\nImagine ANY generic harem Anime with super power.\r\nDone?\r\nGood. That's ALL you need to know about Absolute Duo. You just imagined EVERYTHING there is to it. It has a bland Protagonist with slapped on \"tragic past\" who's too cool for everything with a cast of big-boobed clonesin his harem.\\n\\n\r\nThere is absolutely (sorry) nothing more to it. Every character looks EXACTLY the same, the only differences being eye color, boob size and amout of ribbons in their hair. Not like there's going to be much difference in clothing, it obviously plays in high school again, the copy/paste plotsetting to every generic harem.\\n\r\nThis Anime just oozes chuunibiyo author / audiece in every second.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character can also be summarized in one sentence or with one distinguish characteristic:\\n\\n\r\nThe Protagonist\\n\r\nThe Big-Boobed shy one\\n\r\nThe Tsundere\\n\r\nThe Foreign Tsundere\\n\r\nThe Family-heir\\n\r\nThe one abandoned by her parents\\n\r\nThe Bunny Teacher\\n\r\nThe \"Badass\"-Loli (barely ever shows up, so no need to care)\\n\\n\r\nAll of those seem like a product of someone's mind who never actually spoke to actual people.\\n\r\nNot to mention all they ever talk is how awesome the protagonist is.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is just as pathetic. Even the OPENING is inconsistant and choppy.\\n\r\nI want to stress this out: THE OPENING! Like literally the part that you have to anime ONCE for twelve episodes! The part that's like advertisement! And they fuck that up!\\n\\n\r\nAnyways: Don't watch it. There's absolutely no reason to do so, unless you're 12 and this is your very first anime ever and I wish I could physically prevent you from watching it.",

            "content": "Absolute Duo is absolutely terrible. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve watched an anime series and gone an entire 12 episodes without being able to pinpoint at least one positive aspect. Not only does the plot suffer from being predictable and translucent, but the amount of money grabbing fanservice littering every ounce of substance is beyond upsetting. The premise on its own is promising, but the series ends up drowning in its own inadequacies left and right, leading to a dissapointment for the ages.\r\nUnassuming teenage protagonist? -Check\r\nRandom beach episode? -Check\r\nBarely post-pubescent characters with jiggly titties? -Check\r\nUnnecessary lolli panty shots? -Check\r\nA horribly cast English dub?-Check\\n\r\nAn incoherent plot with as much depth as a kiddie pool? -Check\\n\\n\r\nIf Absolute Duo succeeds in one aspect, it would be to be as underwhelming as humanly possible. Nothing is fleshed out, the storyline never seems to go anywhere and the characters are essentially just cutouts without any amount of development beyond their breasts and oddly deepened voices. Things just seem to happen but most of it doesn\u2019t make any sense, or even follow a cohesive formula for the audience to grab onto. It honestly felt as though the writers for the anime didn\u2019t even care about their jobs. \\n\\n\r\nThe battle system sounds cool on paper, but when you don't spend the minimum necessary time explaining it and end up leaving a multitude of unanswered questions at the end, it becomes nothing more than \"what could've been\". The action scenes often opened up with a still image of the characters with their weapons, multiplying the corny factor, while the animation was inconsistent at best. Young girls with boobs that seem to bounce with the slightest of movement, and nervous blushing emblazoned on the face of basically everyone. Not to mention the sporadic humor and misunderstandings making me want to slam my head against the wall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are entirely too tropey for me to take seriously, as they seem to be more of checks in boxes rather than actual dynamic individuals. I thought I could find something good in the MC until he succumbed to the awkwardness of being in a perverted Japanese high school anime. The enemies were one-offs without purpose, and were almost completely useless in the scheme of things. Plus, literally every voice actor with the exception of our lolli friend was miscast with an older actor, a sign that the budget probably wasn't where it needed to be.\\n\\n\r\nIf you googled J pop, I'm sure you'd find something very similar to the opening and ending of Absolute Duo. Granted the animation in the OP was actually decent, possibly the only highlight of the show for me. The OST is absent or cringey, and I've already given my thoughts on the rest of the animation. Sigh, this show made me sad for the hopeful fans waiting for the manga adaptation\u2026\\n\\n\r\nIn summary,\\n\\n\r\nPositives: the OP isn't bad\\n\r\nNegatives: pretty much everything else\\n\\n\r\nAVOID at all costs, I literally would t recommend this show to anyone\u2026 unless you\u2019re some sort of sadistic masochist or stereotypical weeaboo pervert. So, with that being said there probably is a target audience for Absolute Duo\u2026 but I'm certainly not a part of it. Thanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\nStory-1\\n\r\nArt-3\\n\r\nSound-5\\n\r\nCharacter-1\\n\r\nEnjoyment-3\\n\r\nOverall-2.4",

            "content": "Here's how bad Absolute Duo is: I've never written a review on here before or had a desire to, but it was so horrible that I just had to write one to help people steer clear of this incoherent mess of an anime. I actually watched this because my friend told me about a really good anime where they use weapons created from their souls. Turns out he was talking about Guilty Crown.\r\nTake a suitably clueless shonen stereotype MC with a hero/\"I have to protect everyone\" complex and plop him in a school with a bunch of attractive females who fawn over him for noreason. Make him awkward around women, add in loads of unnecessary fanservice and \"accidents\", and pull it all together with a horribly plot-holey story with bland action and no clear goal or reason for what's going on. Sound familiar? It should, because it's been done many times before. Absolute Duo is as bland and forgettable as they come. I honestly felt ashamed to have watched all 12 episodes. I suppose I was just clinging on to the hope that it might get better.\\n\\n\r\nThe only good thing this anime has going for it is the art, which is fairly good. The scenes were detailed and the effects were nice. It's really sad to think that good animators spent a sizable chunk of time working on this trainwreck. The argument could also be made that the concept was decent as well, but it was just so poorly executed that I can't imagine a good version of this story.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, do not watch this anime unless you're the type that watches specifically for harem/fanservice fantasies and doesn't care about the story at all. Put it this way: if you've ever spoken to a misinformed anime hater, the image that he has in his mind of anime is essentially Absolute Duo. They should have titled it Absolute Garbage instead.",

            "content": "I suppose I am a terrible believer in the idea that, more often than not, a show will get better over time. Whether or not this is true is subjective based on personal values. In the case of Absolute Duo, the idea is untrue, and painful to uphold.\r\nAs an anime, Absolute Duo moved through each episode like a dough ball rolling down an gravelly hill, gradually deteriorating in something that seemed a bit like fanservice wrapped up in cheap Soul Eater cosplay. From title credits and summaries alone, all's fine, but once the thin facade is peeled back, Absolute Duo is an action anime turneddisaster.\\n\\n\r\nOne can recognize the remnants of the story's original planning, and, as a warning, there are many, many remnants. The problem is that there are too many--ideas flood in unevenly, bits of back-story, battle and boobs all mixed together for a bitter anime trope martini. \\n\r\nFrom the first episode, everything is gathered together to follow Kokonoe Tor's journey utilizing his Blaze, a weapon drawn from the manifestation of his soul. However, his Blaze is not a weapon, but a shield. However-however, despite this hinting that he'd rather be the type to defend and protect, the idea is betrayed by the fact that he is an excellent combatant and can fight with the shield anyway. This may have been an attempt to rescue the action part of the story, which already was being slowly trampled by the sticky, gooey topping of school life harem, and even the harem portion of the anime is dissatisfying.\\n\r\nAs always, there is the quiet one, the tomboy, the rich girl, but there is a distinct failure to handle any of them well. With all harems, there will always be a certain air of indecisiveness, but unfortunately the problem here is that Tor seems too decisive before derailing from that decision and heading down a different track. Rather than properly balancing screen time between each heroine, one is dealt with for quite some time before another comes out of nowhere, is accepted by Tor and then forgotten about for the first one. There is nothing endearing about the main character pledging his love and protection to everyone like a shameless people-pleaser.\\n\r\nAdditionally, and as previously mentioned, the harem is not the only piece mishandled--the action side of the anime is often put on hold for fillers that are too obviously fillers, and these fillers end with a random plot point that had little too no previous foreshadowing. The main opposing force is even late to the party in that it doesn't make itself very known until plenty of awkward and useless school day scenarios have been expended. These scenarios also rear their ugly heads once again at inappropriate times, throwing in boob jiggles and pantie shots in the very midst of the emotional thick of a scene. It grows tiring, even to describe.\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime so determined to be compelling and sexy, the art was lazy. In trying to make the girls look cute and attractive, their faces had little expression and no matter the timing, no matter the cup size, no matter the outfit, the girls' chests were shaped like oranges in push up bras. \\n\r\nEven in the final, crucial moments, the main characters were poorly drawn and moved stiffly alongside badly placed 3-D. Like many of the behaviors of the characters themselves, one too many varying head sizes in one scene grew ridiculous, especially given how clean cut the opening could get.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in saying the behavior of the characters was ridiculous, I am saying an incredible truth.\\n\r\nFor heroines introduced as strong and unique fighters, they all had a way of crumbling and abandoning their character traits for the sake of catering to the useless showing off the main character exhibited. One moment, Julie could fight to the fullest, take down ten foes at once, and the next, Tor is vowing to protect her as she sits on the ground, confused. Everyone seemed to blend together to try and make Tor spectacular, when he was a protagonist who could not be saved. His tragic flashbacks received little to no explanation, and so I found I could care less about him. The fact that he was pushed to me as a sensitive and likable guy offended me.\\n\\n\r\nBut then again, much of the anime offended me. Everything was handled so haphazardly I couldn't enjoy myself in any other way than making complete fun of it all. 'Oh man they're all about to have a serious showdown, I wonder which girl is going to fall on her face with her ass in the air--I love that battle tactic.' I was offended at the thought that so little care went into managing the basic elements of the story. Should any of you out there chance Absolute Duo yourselves, I expect you shall share in my offense.",

Hes the average main character in a harem. He is very similar to most harems that involve some sort of ability or super power out there. He meets girls, tries to protect them, then fails. Then throughout the anime(like most other stories) he magically(duh, this anime involves magic) gets stronger in less than a week, very awkward tbh. This first few episode got off to a goodish~ start(but in all honesty, I wanted Imari tobe his duo throughout the story, as she seems more lively and overall a fun character to watch, whenever shes in any part of the anime). But ends up throwing in this \"mysterious girl\", who apparently suppose to be the \"main\" female protagonist. After watching the whole anime, I've come to realize that, she has the worst character development(as of Tor as well) I've ever seen for a long time now(been watching anime for 8-9 years now) and this disappoints me on who bad it is. Every character, except for bunny-sensei",

            "content": "Absolute duo is about students who have weapons of the soul called blazes. Blazes can only hurt the soul..... At this point you already wonder how bad the show is going to be with such childish characteristics.\r\nStory:\r\nThe plot is average. It isn't very well developped and it doesn't feel smooth at all, rather it sometimes feels a bit far-fetched. We have a bunch of kids getting involved into dangerous scenarios with adults which are close to non-existant. Moreover, you get a sort of dramatic feel on the first episode since everyone has to sacrifice something but that gets shattered to pieces later on because whynot make it worse? Of course, just as expected there is still a plot line left undevelopped even though you'd have a good idea concerning it at the end.\\n\r\nI haven't got much to say to defend the plot except from the fact that blazes can actually hurt people which is a very little consolation.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis is where this anime lacks the most. The characters are beatifully drawn but the action scenes feel like role battles where each character attacks one at a time. There are a billion errors in every fight and all of them are easily noticeable. If you pay attention you can even see some oddness in the drawings during the fights and the pictures feel off every so often. Overall, I think it doesn't really deserve its Action tag.\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe background music is well-made. It serves to add some tension when everything else fails at doing so. The ED is above average, and the OP is good.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is where this show should have some worth. The character are well-made altough a tad generic and sometimes gullible and weak. The strength of this anime lies within the interactions in between the charactes. Dialogues that feel akward or out of place don't show themselves much unlike in most anime.\\n\r\nThen a character was introduced and we inherited the classical interactions that you would except for a very low tier anime. This anime's qualities weren't numerous but it still managed to destroy most of them.\\n\r\nLastly, let's talk about the boobsy HAREM. As we all know, 90% of boobsy harems are completly crappy animes. Absolute Duo does a good job at hiding the harem aspect of it but it jumps in your face when the previously mentioned character appears.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis show is hard to watch. I think it could have been a good show if there was less drama. It feels out of place. Though the drama isn't the only thing that needs to be fixed I think it'd be a good start.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nThis show isn't half bad but still lacks a lot in term of action and plot. I think most people would be able to watch it but it won't ever be considered good. Maybe if it was focused on them growing and ranking up in the academy with more character developpement it would have been much better. Also, if you are looking for an Action anime Absolute Duo doesn't fit the bill.\\n\r\nOverall, you should probably avoid this show and try to find another one that is not this bad. This has reach the point of non return. If a second season were to be aired which I highly doubt, I would Absolutely watch it just so I could spit some more on it with another review.",

All the exposition dumps and deep mechanics never let me down even once, once I saw the truly incredible and unique setting and wonderfully original powers, I was sold.\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nOnce I was done with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I thought that I had reached the peak of art and design in anime, but this simply blew me out of the water! Never have I ever seen such well designed and well-crafted characters anywhere, truly outstanding. I must also complement the veryextensive use of CGI, it fits wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe audio was really something different from what I was expecting, exotic and beautiful. I must condone the very humble use of royalty-free sound effects, shedding light on how well the animation studio distributes their valuable time and outstanding talent. As if this wasn't enough the ever persistent screams of embarrassment and agony will surely leave you speechless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters were beautifully presented. Every person in this show had overwhelmingly deep and well thought-out personalities and differences. They really managed to make them blossom and develop to new heights, especially during the beach episodes, I would never rate the characters in this show anywhere under a ten.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI could never have predicted how incredibly invested I got, how delicately overjoyed I felt. Countless times I wanted to scream out of excitement or weep out of pure heartbreaking sorrow at the tragic moments where girls bikinis suddenly fly off over a cliff. I must say I'm speechless, never once have I felt so satisfied!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nBut for real though..\\n\r\nThe show was pretty mediocre. It has very bland and shallow characters, very clich\u00e9 setting and plot, an intense focus on fan service and some persistent annoyances (certain characters or plot devices). If your goal is to watch anime to laugh at it, not for it's actual humor but at its obvious lack of quality, then go ahead, that's what I did and I enjoyed it. If you want to watch it seriously, then maybe consider watching the 4000+ anime rated higher first. ~",

I think the show has a lot of potential, but it just didn't make it.\r\nThe story was nice, but the thing is, it's not really that interesting. The concept is original and the art is beautiful, but there is more to a great anime that just this. I liked a lot the plot, until it started to become more of a harem and ecchi show, than an adventure one. Some people maybe liked it, but I wanted some action, not a bunchof girls over one boy who has a special power( if this isn't a clich\u00e9, I don't know what is) I think those two factors are what dragged down this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnd another thing, is the lack of romance between the main protagonist and his duo. Because the anime makes a big deal about how important is for a duo to be together, but these two didn't share a kiss in the end, and there should't be a harem involved.\\n\\n\r\nBut overall, the anime is not THAT bad, but it could have been better.",

Even if the technical part is fine (not amazing but also not bad) the overused plot, the extremely plain characters and the abuse of overacted emotions make this anime deserve a 4/10.\r\nStory (2/10)\r\nAs I said, the story is just painful to see. The typical high school of superpowers and the typical bad guy. The plot is extremely predictable, not surprises at all. Furthermore they tried to add some complexity, making it worse, because things aren't explained at all. Besides, thestory is bad paced, with a lot of bad fanservice (I am not against fanservice, but in this case It was so bad that I wanted to die), and in some cases I had to go back to the previous chapter to see if I had skipped something. But no, I hadn't skipped anything, It's just that the narration is that bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sount (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nVery little to say here. Both of them are good, not impressive, but not bad. In general the art is colourful, but the CG animations aren't very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe very same as with the story. All of them are beyond plain. You can expect what somebody is going to say or do. Furthermore all of them overact (if you can overact in an animation) a lot, and made me feel embarrassed of watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nI had to push myself to end this anime and not to drop it. It was boring and difficult to see, with very bad jokes. I think I didn't laughed at all. I give a 4 here just because the female characters are cute, and I enjoyed that... But for the rest...",

From the synopsis and the opening, you're expecting something awesome then when you watch it after the first episode, you're like: The fuck is this shit?\r\nFirst off, if you don't know by now, Absolute Duo revolves around Kokonoe Tor who is seeking revenge for those he lost to some stranger--who is never named.  He awakens his power as an Exceed (hmm Fairy Tail rip much?) which allows him to manifest his soul into a weapon which turns out to be a shield.  How the hell doesthat happen?  As a result, he goes to an academy that specializes in training these individuals to hone their skills and reach something known as Absolute Duo (which has not been explained AT ALL).\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode lets you know it is going to be a what the fuck moment because right off the bat, the first character Tor meets and forms a bond with almost immediately is forcibly taken out by some bullshit ass opening entrance fight.  Like, why would you introduce a potential friend for the MC then take her out as soon as possible? Anyways, let's get into the details as to why this show is crap.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3\\n\\n\r\nThe concept sounds cool but the fact that your main character has a mission or a goal, you don't get an explanation as to why he has that goal, nor do you get a look into his past or find out why he even has the power he possesses along with elements of explanation of the events that is going on pretty much make it seem like this series was compiled from loose fitting ideas that the author had.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 5\\n\\n\r\nTake the art from Date A Live and breed it with Clannad and you almost got the sister of Unlimited Fafnir.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming quality of this whole series is the soundtrack.  I personally didn't care for the ending themes but the opening and the BG music was pretty good and helped ease my suffering.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 2\\n\\n\r\nFlat characters are love!\\n\\n\r\nTor - Guy who wants vengeance but also wants to protect someone.\\n\r\nJulie - Emotionless loli who also wants revenge but you don't find out shit about her until the tale end\\n\r\nMiyabi - Big titted dumbass who goes yandere then back to dumbass\\n\r\nLilith - Busty dumb fan service\\n\\n\r\nAnd everyone else is just as flat with hardly any development.\\n\\n\r\nOh and by the way, for it to be a harem, it sucks.  The fan service is clumsy and half of it isn't even remotely interesting.  The ecchi is pretty lame too.  Like the only scene worth while is the one in the hot springs...enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Absolute Duo is quite possibly the worst anime I have seen in a long time.  There are two others in 2015 that are just as bad which I will review soon but yeah, don't waste your time people.",

            "content": "I have a policy to always finish the series you start, no matter how awful it is and no matter how much you want to drop it.\r\nBut this series made me seriously consider if I could call it an \"Exception\" just this one time. And I've seen quite a few generic harem series, so for this one to be the first one to make me feel so is actually quite the achievement.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThe story is incredibly generic for a school/harem/action anime.The most predictable plot \"twists\"? Some power that you can develop by attending this specific academy? A protagonist who attends said academy to gain powerafter a childhood incident, then turns out to be special? A \"main\" girl that comes from some foreign country? I could probably name a dozen more series that follow this same, boring pattern in the harem genre.\\n\r\nNow, for the development, it's pretty much nothing but what you'd expect from a harem. Most girls taking a liking to the male protagonist, some going boundaries to make him like her (a clich\u00e9 that I never fully understood why it worked most of the time). Actually, some development is hindered simply because of the term \"Duo\", but I don't want to spoil anything if I don't have to.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nI can't hate on the art, yet I can't praise it either. It's just good enough, yet it doesn't hold anything significant or impressive. But, the one thing I found annoying in the art is the \"boob physics\" and how much it bounces. It doesn't really help either that almost all girl characters that are somewhat significant to the story have their chests big and outlined.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nThis is definitely my bias speaking, but I just can't stand the VA that voices Tooru, because he also voiced Kirito in SAO, which I was constantly reminded of almost every time I dived into a new episode and heard his voice again. His shouting made it all the worse. The other characters don't sound too bad, except the \"ja\" and \"nej\", which, as a Swede, felt like someone was stabbing my gut with a knife every time I heard it.\\n\r\nOther than that, the music for the battle scenes was good. Somewhat generic hard rock, but one of the few things in the series that I could enjoy while watching.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nFirst off, Tooru Kokonoe, the male protagonist. Shy and dense, except when he's confronted by it. Had a tragic incident happen when he was younger, caused by an unknown person, and therefore attends the academy. This also gives him the \"resolve to protect\" that most people have grown tired of seeing. The VA choice just strengthens my lack of \\n\r\nThen, Julia Sigtuna, a Swedish girl, and a clich\u00e9 well fulfilled. Not only is \"Sigtuna\" quite the odd surname for a Swede, but saying \"yes\" and \"no\" in Swedish in a Japanese accent is insufferable. I repeat myself, it's like being stabbed in the gut by a knife, hearing her as a Swede. At the same time, her voice felt a tad too weak whenever she wasn't infuriated, making me even more irritated by her.\\n\r\nAnother foreign girl, Lilith Bristol, this time a Brit. She fulfills the \"joyful and open-minded\" clich\u00e9, but is more toned down than other characters following the clich\u00e9. I always disliked these kinds of characters (unless they got something else going for them, which Lilith doesn't), and this time is no exception. She calls Tooru her \"future spouse\", yet doesn't do a lot later in to gain his attention, which goes off from the clich\u00e9 in a bad way, since now she doesn't manage to hold up a harem properly.\\n\r\nTomoe Tachibana, the \"onee-san\" character. She is the character I had to cling on to keep my calm, because she felt reasonable. Probably the only character that I enjoyed, but even that was shattered mid-way, for reasons I'm obviously not going to mention. Just keep in mind that she's not one to hope in the series, because no one grants that through the entirety of the series.\\n\r\nLastly, Miyabi Hotaka. The lovebird. She is the character you know won't win, and you can tell very quickly in the series that it is indeed the case, so I don't count this as a spoiler. Unfortunately for her, it's another clich\u00e9 I despise thoroughly. Being a shyness overlord, almost any solo screen-time she gets is her thinking about Tooru, which is quite pathetic, honestly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nAlthough I rated story at a 3, the art at 5 and the sound at 4, the 1-rating for the characters should really be less, and would be if I could. The seeming need to make clich\u00e9s happen in an attempt to be different but ends up being  almost as any other of their sort. Especially the \"ja\" and \"nej\", but I don't think I need to emphasize that any more, because it's already dead.\\n\r\nMost generic harem series tend to have some point of comedy, but this series didn't even manage THAT. Instead, by trying to off-set some clich\u00e9s and just having a serious feeling to it the entire time, they made it worse.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\nDefinitely something that I would NOT recommend to anyone, especially not to someone who is familiar with Swedish. It's utter trash, and I highly regret even picking it up.\\n\r\nIf you're currently watching this, do yourself a favor and drop it. I didn't, (because of my \"policy\"), but I wish that I did.",

            "content": "Now many people will disagree with me on my rating of a 9, however I am a very open minded person when it comes to anime and I haven't yet found an anime series I truly hated.\r\nAs this is my first review please bare with me as I am only going to talk about things like the art, sound, characters and story in a non spoiler way. This may make my review useless to certain people still wanting to know if it's truly worth a watch.\r\nAnyway onto my review. I find Absolute Duo to have a very deep story and the characters also have strongpersonality's. Yes it is a typical action/harem series but is that really a bad thing. If you have seen things in the past with the same sort of feel and liked that why not like it again in a different form. Other things I liked about this series is the art style. It's very bright and dark in all the right places giving you a true sense on the atmosphere in all scenes. The sounds are great and fit in everything they are used for not throwing you out of the immersion. The only real gripe I have with the series is that the ending felt a little rushed but I still enjoyed it none the less.",

            "content": "yayy.. another harem ecchi show, could it be any different than the usual? Did you guess 'No'?\r\nStory/ Setting: 5\r\nTo start of first I will begin by talking about the setting which can only be described as a school where students are trained to fight using supernatural powers (Blazes), which you know has been done many times before so don't expect anything different from the usual, with that in respect let's move on the story. The story can also be dumbed down to a standard ecchi harem that has a supernatural twist where the main character wins battles using the power of friendship and similar thingswhile being oblivious to the girls growing feelings around him; the standard stuff, as it follows main character Tooru and main heroine Julie on there quest to become powerful and take revenge upon those that hurt there families which is also left in the dark quite a lot and the reason for that person hurting them is never explained or brought to light in any shape or form. While also on the same note as predictability along the way they'll meet many friends both guys and girls; with the guys barely appearing or having sceentime and the girls becoming part of an ever growing harem, eventually leading to a predictable ending that just screams out: 'Read the Light Novel'. Overall its average and a really predictable harem story and nothing else. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nThe characters well also follow a predictable route with a lot of archetypes found amongst them which does leave quite a varied cast which is a good thing as the designs of the characters are simply wonderful however, there are far too many identifiable anime archetypes that make the show feel less unique and more like 'just another hare', featuring character like the 'the never losing protagonist', the quiet girl with no emotions, the shy girl with he boobs, the tomboy and so on. This overall makes the show predictable and care less for the characters. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7\\n\r\n The animation can be described only in a few words as mediocre, as it wasn't bad but neither anything special, however fight scenes are well animated except for the bits that go into 3D animation which can be somewhat distracting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\n On the other hand, the soundtrack was great and was mixed in well with all scenes, in which the best I must say is the music for fight scenes mixed in with the good animation featuring a mix of tracks; this made them feel exciting and more fun to watch. The opening was pretty good but not amazing featuring some great rock sung by Konomi Suzuki; which also gets you pumped up and ready for the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall if your looking for a fun harem show with some exciting ecchi show purely for some light entertainment and fun comedy, this is the show for you; however expect anything else you'll be disappointed. \\n",

At the school he meets very many beautiful young women who all want to become romantically involved with him. As you might be able to tell this anime really breaks new ground and the possibilities are endless, you are always on the edge of your seat to find out what's going to happen next. Who is he going to make blush next? Will there be some misunderstanding that is really embarrassing for our beloved protagonist? Will he accidentally gropesomeone maybe? Truly remarkable storytelling. Easy ten out of ten.\\n\\n\r\nArt. 10/10\\n\r\nThe 2D animation is impeccable, no other anime stands a chance. Everything is drawn with such care and fidelity. But what truly makes this anime stand out is its use of 3D animation. Pixar will have to step up their game big time because Absolute Duo doesn't mess around. The 3D models are practically lifelike, I'd even say the uncanny valley has officially been crossed.\\n\\n\r\nSound. 10/10\\n\r\nEvery single note really resonated with me. This show deserves every single Grammy from this day forward. I don't really have much more to say, listen to it yourself and you will see. You'll especially like that electric guitar that they play for the bad guy over, and over again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. 10/10\\n\r\nEvery character is 8 dimensional, they are literally perfect. They feel like real people with real motivations and I might have even thought they were unless I had been told that they weren't. I've heard people say that the characters can be summed up to a single trait but this is absolutely not the case. The characters are extremely multifaceted and they are absolute perfection, period.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. 10/10\\n\r\nIf you want a good time, this is the anime to watch. It's truly a roller coaster of emotions and it will have you gripped from beginning to end. It has made me laugh as well as cry on several occasions. This is the peak of film and if you enjoy good anime then this is the show for you, you can thank me later.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10\\n\r\nThis anime is terrible, don't watch it. Best picture 2015.",

            "content": "I started watching the show and expecting it to be the Wapanese Animu Industry's attempt at being as cool as Marvel (since the Avengers sequel is coming out). What I've gotten is more of the same. Notably in these few places:\r\n* Tooru; the shounen lead who, despite his powers, still doesn't know how to handle women. \"Captain (America combined with) Thor?\" Really?\r\n* Basically, nobody in Wapan likes America; as shown with the enemy of the show who goes by the name of \"K.\"\r\nI'll admit that this animu wasn't as brutal towards Tooru as, say, Trinity Seven was towards it's shounen lead. It's still depressing towatch because said shounen lead, after defeating the \"opponent of the arc\" with the help of Julie et al, always manages to get hospitalized. Like there's no such thing as \"defeating an opponent unscathed\" ohwaitaminute... Kantai Collection's Fubuki and friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe bonus panty shots couldn't save the show. The mid-tier animation and the bland (yet symphonic) background music wasn't helping much either.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this show (and it's hidden middle finger to America) is one of the reasons why companies like FUNi should NEVER license a show before / during airing. I don't care how big you are. If a show sucks [at the end], you're gonna be the owner of that \"suck.\"",

            "content": "Absolute Duo, an anime based on a Light Novel series may look like a generic \"battle harem school\" anime with a decent looking guy, and they have some super powers.... Well, thats exactly what it was, sadly. Lets get onto the review:\r\nStory: 5/10 \r\nThough the concept is always interesting and has some promise, there was literally no originality to this story, typical past event that scars the MC for life, and he wants to get revenge. Along the way he meets friends and slowly gathers his harem, meanwhile evil organizations are plotting eeeeviiiillll things. The pacing was also pretty bad, almost nothing of note happeningfor multiple episodes at a time, only really getting down to the story ~7 or 8 episodes in, and even then i wasn't sure what was going on.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\r\nThe art/animation was actually very good, probably the only thing that kept me going with the series, everything just looked so good to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nEverything seemed solid when it came to the sound, voices all fit the characters, music went with the mood, though it seemed like I'd heard VERY similar music in other anime, might be the composer. I absolutely loved the opening song though, same singer that sang NGNL opening!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10 \\n\r\nThe characters were what you would typically find in your \"Battle harem school\" anime, the male MC that wants revenge from a past tragedy, the cute girl that he wants to protect, the shy girl that wants to be strong, etc. I personally loved the bunny teacher, she brought something refreshing to the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed all of the battle scenes, they were all on point, but when the episode came around every week, I found myself thinking \"Oh.. Absolute Duo is on.. Eh... Maybe they will have a good fight this episode\" It wasn't a very enjoyable series outside of the battles basically.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nAbsolute Duo is your typical \"battle harem school\" anime, as I stated a few times already, it was pretty disappointing. I would not recommend this anime to anyone, unless you love this type of anime.",

            "content": "Absolute Duo was my second-favorite anime this winter. However, I recognize its flaws.\r\nStory: 3\r\nThe story and characters were the shallowest I'd seen since Sword Art Online, but the series had some redeeming qualities. The story was simply too generic: A school dedicated to magic ended up being attacked for some reason. Worse, the characters were too idiotic to even question the term \"Absolute Duo\" mentioned by the headmaster, and then their cup sizes ranging from \"A\" to \"F\" were used as fanservice devices for the entirety of episode 8. As if that weren't enough, the series was a harem for five whole episodes. The goodin the story, however, is that after it is ruined by the fanservice, it redeems itself by creating an interesting villain similar to the protagonist in one way, and then finishing it off with good action scenes. What it needed most was an explanation of the protagonist's backstory. At least its open ending made room for a potential second season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\r\nEach character had potential, but none developed. Worse was the fact that they were \"harem\" archetypes. Luckily, they were put in a good setting for their characteristics. To see harem characters in a magical school is like sticking a piece of chocolate in curry.\\n\r\nTor - bland main character, but a nice guy.\\n\r\nJulie - really quiet and kinda cold, but a great partner.\\n\r\nLilith - my favorite alongside their teacher; badass and assertive.\\n\r\nMiyabi - large-breasted harem crush, but brave enough to confess it.\\n\r\nTachibana - shallow, but a great friend.\\n\r\nTora - extremely shallow.\\n\r\nTatsu - shallowest character I've ever seen in an anime.\\n\r\nTsukimi-sensei - The most interesting of the bunch, but really just boobs and a split personality.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nIn several scenes, the CG was well-placed, and in the entire series, the art was good, but the animation and characters could have been more interesting, as they seemed just as generic as their personalities.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending animations are vibrant and colorful, though!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 for sub, 7 for dub\\n\r\nBoth versions had a really good opening and three endings that are worth buying off of a music store. The opening was catchy and upbeat like Sora Iro Days from Gurren Lagann, and the endings were respectively beautiful, happy, and... awesome. The voice acting and cast were great choices, considering their roles, but in the English version, they weren't as great. Imari sounded too old, and Tora (a student) was the teacher from Baka & Test.\\n\r\nIt was a great touch to put the first ending in the end of the series, to symbolize the return to the beginning plot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nSome people hated it, fewer loved it, and in the middle there are the ones who found it to be okay. I am in the third party, as I found it to be very good in some areas, excluding the middle five episodes. It was good, and then it was terrible, but then, it became the second-most underrated series I'd seen. If you're into watching a series with romantic subtext and able to look past shallow themes, it's gonna be okay.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nThe series is worth watching once, but not worth a rewatch for some people. I'd personally rewatch it any day, but a third of it was terrible, so it was several gigabytes short of a hard-drive. It's still okay. I recommend the novels, or the manga instead, as the characters are a lot smarter.\\n\\n\r\nThe verdict:\\n\r\nWatch it, but you might not like it.\\n\r\nI recommend Soul Eater and Highschool of the Dead.",

            "content": "If you're looking for a negative review, keep scrolling. I've got nothing but good things to say. :^)\r\nI don't write reviews. Ever. Quite frankly, I've never really considered writing one up until now, with my reason being how many negative reviews I've read. Maybe I'm the only one, and if so, that's just fine, but I feel like this show caught a lot of undeserved flak. This show's written off as your typical ecchi/harem with, \"no redeeming qualities,\" but I feel like a lot of folk are overlooking what makes this show special, and what sets it apart from the rest in my mind. I'llbe as down to earth as I can get, while keeping it vague so as not to spoil anything. Everything is left to your own interpretation in the end. These are my feelings, enjoy the ride.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story's pretty toasty, I'll have to admit. There's a few grey areas here and there I wish could have been filled, but all in all, I have no qualms. I really wish there were some extra tidbits of information tossed in here or there, or perhaps a little more story in between the last few episodes (which would give us a few more episodes instead of just 12), but I'm more than satisfied with what I got, for sure. The action was balanced well enough with moments of character development, albeit there's an action scene I found to be sort of dry towards the end, but in the end I was happy with what I got. It was kind of like Goldilocks in the battle department in my eyes: Not too boring, not too flashy, but just right. I like the idea of soul-power and manifesting weapons with your soul, and I feel like this is something Absolute Duo did right. There's countless other shows out there that toy with the same idea, but never really follow through on the details, all the while making it look bad-ass. On another note, a lot of people were bothered by the fanservice, which I had no problem with. It wasn't over-the-top, tits are flopping everywhere, \"omg senpai no look plox!!1!!1\" around every corner like I figured it would be going into it. It was tasteful, for lack of a better word, and quite humorous in some instances. All in all, I enjoyed quite a bit it for what it is, and in comparison to other titles like To Love-Ru or Maken-Ki, it could have done A TON worse.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing I thought when I watched the first episode when the protagonists met under the cherry blossoms was, \"Wow... This is absolutely gorgeous.\" Even if you didn't like the show, this is something you've got to admit it had going for it. I'm not going to get super in-depth with my elaboration, but it's fairly plain to see that a lot of work was put into how everything looks. From characters, to scenery, you're sure to enjoy the eye-candy (if you know what I mean ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ). Everywhere you look, you'll notice that they paid significant attention to detail. That being said, if looks could kill...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFirst point of interest: Suzuki Konomi. \\n\r\nNow if we take a look at the sideshow, you'll also find yourself just as impressed. Every song is ultra catchy, especially the second ending track, \"Appuru T\u012b no Aji,\" which I catch myself humming at work all the freaking time now. These moments are few and far between, but sometimes you'll hear a sound affect that sounds like it was off a soundboard from 2003, which is completely atoned for by the epic soundtrack. An easy 10 out of 10, for sure.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI genuinely enjoyed the character development throughout the story. Others would complain they were a bit \"bland,\" but I saw a colorful assortment of characters from happy-go-lucky to strong and steadfast. The relationship between the two main characters Tooru and Julie is heartwarming. Whether you wish to perceive them as not-quite lovers or close friends, you'll feel the deep connection and compassion they share, no doubt. Each character had their quirks, which could have been played on and developed further in my opinion, but they all have unique personalities that set them apart from one another while simultaneously bringing them closer than ever before. The comradery is comfortable, the interaction between the flows quite well. If there had been a little more character development otherwise, it would have been a solid 10 in my book. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed every episode. I'd find myself riding a hype train all day long, super excited to sit down and watch the next episode. It honestly ended up being what I looked forward to most in the day for the five or so days, which should say quite a bit. The show did a lot right, and hooked me from the start. I enjoyed it thoroughly, for sure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom the sweetness between Tooru and Julie, to the cool-ass soul weapons, all the way up to the incredibly catchy soundtrack, it's a solid 10 for me. I went into the show enjoying it for everything it is, not what it wasn't. It's something a lot of us suffer with, and something I found myself slipping into as well. We judge shows by what they're not, spending all our time comparing it to other things we've seen and affirming, \"Yeah, Generic Anime #5609 'Ladies x Butlers' is trash compared to 'Re:Zero.'\" instead of picking out the things we enjoyed about it. It took time for me to realize it, but that's how it was for me, and quite a few people I've met who watch anime. A lot of people are in denial about it, or refuse to change, and that's fine. That's what makes you, you; do what makes you happy. But back on topic, this show's incredibly entertaining, and I see myself re-watching it sometime very soon. I only wish it was a bit longer, and like many others out there, I'm desperately holding out for a season 2! \\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read, honesty. It means more than what these little words on a screen could express, so again, thank you.\\n\\n\r\nTo all of you, I wish you the best! Keep doing what you love; keep watching anime!",

            "content": "After a traumatic accident takes his loved one, Tooru Kokonoe enrolls Kouryou Academy, a school where every student has a weapon that is their soul manifestation. Fueled by his desire for revenge, Tooru is dismayed to discover his soul is not a weapon\u2026 but a shield\r\nStory: Absolute Duo is your same copy and paste clich\u00e9/mediocre  anime  with a bland protagonist with a special power(because this is so fucking original) the story is boring and uninteresting. Nothing in the story is ever explored tooru's past is never clearly explained we don't know the name of the guy who  killed his relative, how theywere all connected , why he killed her in the first place. Hell we don't even know which of his relatives where killed non of this is ever explored. The show try's so hard to be dramatic and serious but It wasn't the dialogue was so cliche and laughable that I couldn't even take it serious. The anime is supposed to be about I guy practicing to get revenge on a guy (that we don't even know) who killed his relative. He never gets his revenge we don't even get to see the guy unless its through a fucking 15second flash back with him repeatedly saying I'm not strong enough or if only I wasn't so weak. No we just see him build his harem with a bunch of girls with overused character stereotypes. Hell I don't even think this should has a fucking antagonist since it was changed at least 5 or 6 times.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is pretty normal I guess its not really good or bad. The art in the opening was amazing I liked the way the protagonist was walking through the desert covered in flames.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was pretty normal to the sound of the explosions where on point and the voice acting was ok.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The shittiest part of the anime besides the repulsive piece of shit \ud83d\udca9 story. I really don't feel like listing all the characters so I'll just write what I think about them as a whole. The characters in the show are 1D asf. They all follow every stereotype there is in anime history. The characters don't w at all and stay bland and boring throughout the whole show. The female characters fall in love with this guy for no fucking reason at all well except miyabi which I can kinda understand why she likes him  but anyway the romance  doesn't go anywhere stays the same throughout the whole show. All the female characters are boring and annoying asf and have shallow / bland personalities . They have breast from D toZ. The main protagonist is bland and Overpowered as hell. He's always whining about how weak he is when he's overpowered as fuck( I know I already said it but I had to say it again). No real bonds are formed hell I wouldn't have even cared if one of the characters died.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Lets get straight to the point I thought this show was boring, I kept on falling asleep during the so called  dramatic moments, the comedy was lame as hell I didn't laugh at any of the childish jokes. The romance didn't go anywhere so the characters never developed any deep \\n\r\nBonds for the viewers to care about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:2/10  don't waste your time watching this sack of shit anime its not worth the time I wonder what the writers were thinking when they wrote this piece of shit \ud83d\udca9 \\n",

            "content": "Absolute Duo has the name states it's about forming THE absolute duo. I had high hopes for this series for the this season.. They had my favorite genres which are romance, action and school life. I gave this series a 8/10 at the beginning but right up to episode 5 or 6 i just couldn't take it seriously.\r\nStory: 6/10... I thought the story was pretty original since i don't remember any anime with that sort of plot. So I had high hopes for it. But everything just did not run smoothly they mainly focused on the harem aspect of the show with every girl wantingthe main male character as a duo at first I actually liked it, but as each episode went by I just found it down right annoying. It does have a little drama though.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10..The art is beautiful.The colours are vibrant and they stand out. this makes it enjoyable to watch. characters are well drawn and animation is up to standards for this day and age.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10... I have to say, I am in love with the opening theme song , which is called Absolute Soul by Konomi Suzuki; One of my favorite singers for anime Op.. I can't really comment on the ending songs since I didn't care enough to listen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10... The characters are likeable. I really like Tor and Julie best. I also like Tomoe since she is like best girl friend to Tor. Julie reminds me of that girl from the anime Sakurasou. She has an innocent and honest personality she is like a little kitten which I love.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10.. It is a fairly good anime it isn't bad but it isn't good either. I watch it for the sake of seeing Julie and Tor together. Oh and the sensei. I love her 2 personalities. she reminds me of me :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10... I would recommend this to the ones who just want to past time and see girls fawn over the main male character.",

            "content": "I hate bashing anime I really do but when push comes to shove you just gotta do what you gotta do when it comes to saving the viewers.\r\nAbsolute Duo is, for lack of better terms, underwhelming and painful to watch. I'm not entirely sure what was going on through the producers' heads when they made this anime but Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt was a better anime and the producers were drunk when they came up with that idea so I sure as hell hope that the producers of Absolute Duo weren't sober and maybe then I'll forgive them.\r\nSTORY 3/10\r\nWhat story? This anime just takesa bunch of overused ideas and slaps them all into a blender, add a little bit of harem cause why not and a 'story' is born. It's a revenge story (but not really) with romance, action, friendship, and unnecessarily naked women. If that isn't the epitome of generic then I don't know what is.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime starts off with Tooru, an average highschool boy going to the opening ceremony on his first day of school where it is revealed that he can actually summon a shield out of his right hand, called a Blaze, and use a comet punch. The school he attends is no ordinary school, it is actually a school that trains other Blaze users in hopes of achieving 'Absolute Duo'. What exactly is a Blaze and what does Absolute Duo even mean anyway? Beats me, the anime hardly touches on the subject and you just kind of have to accept the fact that things are happening whether you like it or not.\\n\\n\r\nART 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's not terrible but it's not good either. More work was put in the opening theme than the actual anime and it is very disappointing. Animation is very lazy and it looks like you're watching an anime at 12 frames per second making for very awkward movements and action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI actually don't hate the voice actors for this anime and the OP isn't half bad at all.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is horrendous. The entire cast remains static throughout the entirety of the series and it's the same thing over and over again. The anime centers more around Tooru than it does any other character to the point where the other characters serve practically no purpose at all. The anime touches on Julie's past a little bit but it is on such a molecular level that it didn't actually make the story or her character progress at all. There's even a character that doesn't say anything, he literally just grunts and, as funny as it is sometimes, it's just....why? Why even give such a useless character so much screen time?\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm literally drooling during each episode cause each episode is the same as the last one. The only thing remotely enjoyable about this anime are the ecchi scenes which appear more than necessary.\\n",

            "content": "(SPOILER FREE REVIEW)\r\nAbsolute duo was a complete disappointment for me. It didn't impress me at all, but we need to give it a fair trial. This anime turned out to be pretty mediocre, but it clearly isn't a 2/10.\r\nStory:\r\nIt started off pretty promising but then suddenly took a turn for the worst. The two main characters have a weird father and daughter bond, but that is all there is to it. It seems they lost interest in the romance aspect between the two main characters after about 3 episodes. It just broke down into this generic harem anime with a boring cast of characters.\r\nCharacters andCharacter Development:\\n\r\nThe characters were interesting at first and had potential, but the producers had something else in mind. For the first few episodes i enjoyed the interaction between Tooru (Main hero) and Julie (Main heroine). After a little while they added more characters but they were so bland. A blonde spoilt girl who gets everything she wants. A weak and clumsy character who just suddenly falls in love with the hero.  Then the most interesting addition, the black haired tomboy (by interesting i mean, \"kind of acceptable\"). Julie seemed to actually have a slightly interesting back story, but then, they revealed it. It was a generic tale of revenge. Boring!\\n\\n\r\nArt and Music:\\n\r\nThis is one of the only reasons why i gave this anime an okay score. The OP sounds pretty good and they don't have many quiet moments in the anime. There is always some interesting track playing in the background. The art style was also nice and polished, there isn't much to say about this. It was pretty good in the technical aspect. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nThe anime has pretty good music. That is all i can say about the positives. In my eyes, the ending is PARAMOUNT. The ending for this anime was pretty horrible. No plot twists, no satisfying ending, no NOTHING. It was just one of those, \"and they lived happily ever after\" endings. The last episode made no sense, and since this is a spoiler free review i can't go to details on it. You will realise when you see it (if you ever decide to watch this anime). \\n\\n\r\nI give it a 6/10, go listen to it's opening song Absolute soul, that is the best this anime has to offer. \\n\\n\r\nSorry if this wasn't a really high quality review, it's my first one, hope you enjoyed reading it!",

            "content": "Welcome to another generic review, made by another random anime lover!\r\nPlease keep in mind that reviews are merely based off of the viewers opinion. Do not take a review seriously. Anime watching is a unique experience for everyone and tastes take time to develop.\r\nSince Absolute Duo is a fairly new anime, reviews that have been made are generally aimed at the episodes that were released at the time. So readers beware! Likewise, newer reviews are now based off the anime as a whole so keep an eye on that date!\r\nAt first glance, Absolute Duo seems too easy to clump with the basic and cliched haremanimes. While it does have a ton of harem elements, it doesn't really get to the point where it can be officially defined as a \"Harem\". As a result, many people see the genre \"Harem\" and feel as though diving into it would be a big mistake. Well, it's not.  The characters never develop an actual lovey-dovey relationship with the MC, and the season is mainly focused on the back story of each character as an individual.\\n\\n\r\nWhile many points in each episode may make a large group of people cringe, the actual story line and development of the characters is enjoyable. Like I said before, the anime focuses mainly on the back story and development of each character's problems and solutions. This perhaps is what makes Absolute Duo stand out among random \"Harem\" shows.\\n\\n\r\nThe story line makes your heart race, the characters make you smile or cringe, and the jokes are either so cliched its hilarious or so funny you can't help but crack a smile. (This is all in my own opinion). Along with the fact that it is only 12 episodes. So if you have the time to go on AnimeList and find an anime, you could probably down these episodes in one sitting (I know I can).\\n\\n\r\nAll the same, I recommend watching at least the first 5 episodes (That was the point I got hooked). If you don't like it, move on. If you do, congratulations! Just realize that you don't really have anything to lose but a chance to watch a good anime.\\n\\n\r\nDon't judge an anime by it's review. It's your own experience.",

            "content": "It's good. No, wait, before you kill me hear me out!\r\n(WARNING: Huge Rant! Also possibly clashing opinions)\r\n(Also, there are some spoilers, but they're rather vague so it shouldn't matter)\r\nThe reason it's good is because it's what i'd call a Junk Food Anime. It's good because it's bad. For example, HoTD was so bad (imo) that I loved it. Same thing for badly made movies. They have a certain charm to it. Now that i've explained that, let's try to actually make this a review.\r\nThe main character, Genericface McEdgelord(Legitimately can't remember his name, because he was just that generic), has a power, same as everyone else,right? NOPE, he has a special power, along with a... dark past? No no no no NO.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm gonna stop you right there, Absolutely Terrible. Making the main character have an edgy past works, but only if you actually go into details and explain it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Nisekoi (Unrelated to the Action Genre, but feel free to watch it, it's decent) had a MC with a edgy backstory, but they did it well because they actually explained it within a small amount of episodes. \\n\\n\\n\r\n(Small Spoiler, vague as all heck though so it should be fine. Skip this text block if you don't want any spoilers!)\\n\r\nII\\n\r\nII\\n\r\n\\/\\n\r\nI'm 10 episodes in to this and i'm still not even sure if that chick was his sister, lover, girlfriend, mother, or whatever. Not only that, but in the small amounts of his past i've seen, they don't even really show the murderer's face enough for you to comprehend it. I understand there's supposed to be a certain level of mystery, but that's just stupid. If it's his memory, he'd remember that face clearly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow then, let's talk about the female MC...\\n\r\nUh, let's see, where is she...\\n\r\nHmm....\\n\r\nOh, whoops, my bad. I mistook her for a piece of cardboard because her voice actor has one tone throughout the entire anime. The voice acting is decent, but I mean, come on.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Sometimes characters with only one or two tones work well (EX: Shiro from No Game No Life, or in the one tone case, Rei from Evangelion) because their character actually acts like that. Julie has a bunch of facial expressions, but only one actual tone and it throws off all the scenes she's in (which is a decent amount, by the way)\\n\\n\\n\r\nReally, there isn't much to say about the actual story. Genericface McEdgeLord is on a mission to... protect those he loves? I'm honestly pretty unclear on the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRomance? I have no clue what you're talking about, all I see is fanservice while the MC is conveniently nearby. The \"Romance\" Between Edgelord and Julie the Cardboard Robot is basically non-existent. Don't get me wrong, I WANT to believe there's romance, but it's just not happening.\\n\\n\r\nThe real question is, did I enjoy it?\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------\\n\r\nWell, yes actually. It was bad, but also good. I feel like if they had made the characters less generic and the plot a bit thicker, this could've been a really good anime, up there with (IMO again, keep in mind that I don't watch too much anime, so this is just my opinion) Kill La Kill, and Toradora!(For the Romance parts, anyways...)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3 (Poor) Not much to say here, it was pretty bad. (Keep in mind I only got 10 episodes in, never finished it)\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 (Very good.) The voice actors were actually pretty decent(Subbed, at least), and the sounds they used were high quality, so they got away with an 8.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4 (Mediocre) They definitely could've been better, as they were extremely generic. Although, they didn't add a mega-tsundere from what I can remember, so at least they didn't go that far into GenericLand.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 (Great) While yes, it was extremely bad, that added to the charm of it all. Would I recommend it for serious anime fans? No, of course not. Would I recommend it for people who enjoy Junk Food Animes? Absolutely!\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL!: 6! (Fair) But wait, I hear you saying, your tears of anger dripping on to your favorite Manga. But it was so bad, how could you give it a six! Well, my Anime Loving comrade, like I said, it was so bad that it was good. That's the same reason I gave HoTD a decently high rating.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this? Short answer, no. If you're serious enough about animes to read reviews before watching it, chances are you want to watch a GOOD anime. So, instead i'm going to recommend you this!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Honestly not sure if recommending things is allowed in reviews, so if it isn't i'll take this down per request by a mod, administrator, or otherwise)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nYou came here for action? Try Black Lagoon. The story is a bit ehhh but the action is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nYou came here for comedy? Well, I actually don't HAVE a recommendation for this, since all anime comedy is basically the same... (in my opinion! Please don't pelt me with hatemail!)\\n\\n\r\nYou came here for romance? Well, if you're into huge cliche'd romance, try Nisekoi. If you dislike Cliche's, then try Toradora! It still has cliche's, but it's a lot less.\\n\\n\r\nYou came here to write a review saying this anime is bad?

            "content": "((Reviewer's Note: This review contains mild spoilers, some profanity, and a Donald Trump reference guaranteed to be dated in about six months. Reader discretion is advised.))\r\nYou know, there comes a point in one's anime hobby where the viewer has to roll their chair back, adjust their glasses or rub their eyes, and wonder exactly what in the hell would possess them to give certain shows any more than a second glance. For me, it was this one.\r\nAbsolute Duo might just be the single worst anime I've ever seen. In fact, I'm almost certain that it is. I've never beheld something that is not only completelydevoid of the slightest trace of originality, but takes its generic ideas and smashes them together into an incoherent Frankenstein rollercoaster of awe-inspiring incompetence. It actually kinda scares me that this got picked up to be adapted. Granted, 8bit has been known to take chances on, shall I say, less-established (read: garbage) source material, but the lack of quality in this just makes me wonder exactly what would possess anyone to think the source material was any good, either, and how it managed to get a high-enough profile that an anime studio felt comfortable putting manhours and their name on adapting it.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I can start with the story. Tor Kokonoe is our main protagonist. He is a completely average looking, inoffensive dude who is off to this bizarre battle school to learn to fight after a tragedy in his past left him feeling unable to protect anything. Immediately, this should be setting off alarm bells. This sounds like every light novel adaptation in the last five years, and with good reason: this show is the distillation of every light novel trope, cliche, and standard that has been floating in the anime toilet bowl since Sword Art Online rose to prominence in 2012. Nonetheless, I will continue.\\n\\n\r\nTor meets Julie, who ends up becoming his \"Duo\", a partner to eat, sleep, and live with throughout his time at Battle Harem School. What's a Duo? Well, besides just an arbitrary pairing, exactly what a Duo is is never really defined by much of anyone. The blackhaired loli school principal implies that the whole point of the school is to find a pairing capable of attaining \"Absolute Duo\", but whatever that means, and why she's after it, is left to the viewer's imagination.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus we get to the next big sticking point I have with LN adaptations in this decade: they are always woefully incomplete, and that has something to do with the way that light novels are written nowadays. See, nowadays any hack writer can attach themselves to a decent character design artist and start his own light novel, or at least a web novel that may eventually find itself published in the light novel format. As long as there are moe girls to be found within the pages (and crucially on the front cover!), it will likely sell, regardless of the quality of the actual writing. And as long as these light novels are continuing to produce an income for their writer, there is no incentive for there to ever be a proper ending. \\n\\n\r\nAs for why I bring this up, well, Absolute Duo is one of the most incomplete adaptations I've ever seen. The 12 episodes produce roughly a dozen plot holes big enough to drive a bus through, and scarce in the way of explaining or elaborating on the very concept they named the show after. What the hell is an Absolute Duo in the context of the show? Why do Julie and Tor have all sorts of unexplained powers that constantly take their enemies by surprise? \\n\\n\r\nThe concepts that propel the show's copious battle scenes are pretty stock: every student at Harem Battle High has a \"Blaze\", a weapon materialized from their soul or some such that somehow can't actually be used to hurt people (unless, of course, you want it to, or something). Instead it inflicts non-lethal wounds that eventually render the enemy unconscious, quite convenient for when you wanna hype up your heroes without actually having any meaningful stakes in the battle. After all, killing is wrong! It defies reason how hard it is to care at all about battles where each blow means nothing, where no one is in danger of being maimed or killed, where the drama is completely subverted in favor of unpleasant fanservice and incompetent, unfunny romantic comedy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yeah, there's harem shenanigans in this show. The best harems, like the girls in Nisekoi and Monogatari, give clear and understandable reasons why each girl likes the harem protagonist. Usually these reasons are tied to his personality, sometimes its his looks, sometimes its his skill and confidence, sometimes its a promise he made them when they were kids. Hell, sometimes its just because he happens to be the only piece of man meat within 10 kilometers! Tor, on the other hand, is just a charmless puppet, a soulless, emotionally bereft clod who couldn't muster up the testosterone to hold a girl's hand, much less deal with the unyielding overt flirtations of the girls at Harem Battle High. The four main girls in the show are all just tripping over his dick to an uncomfortably fanatic degree despite the fact that he acts and looks like he has no interest in the opposite sex whatsoever. He's not particularly competent in battle, or even that attractive. He's a self-insert fantasy, the kind light novel hacks have been flogging onto the willing masses in droves, and he's about as transparent as you can get.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Tor is a perfect match for the girls of Absolute Duo, because they too are bereft of anything resembling a character. Julie, our lead girl, is yet another albino deadpan loli. Now, deadpan lolis can make for great characters: Shiro of No Game, No Life is one of if not my very favorite lolita character, and she's as deadpan and socially inept as it gets. That said, Julie just comes across as creepy and eerily infantilized. She's been through some trauma, sure, I get that that can stunt a person's development and hinder their idea of boundaries, but Julie takes it to an insulting and uncomfortable extreme. She behaves like an infant, incapable of doing anything for herself except when danger is imminent, constantly reliant on Tor. It transcends the cuteness factor of her being a helpless girl and starts to trip into creepy land when she starts invading his bedspace in the nude in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Julie's opposite number, the outsider looking in, Lilith Bristol. Lilith is perhaps the closest we get to a character with something resembling a personality instead of a list of traits stapled to a character design. She's resourceful, intelligent, feisty, and is easily the strongest student that doesn't rely on plot armor or a superpowered darkside. I won't go so far as to say she's a well-written character, but she's the closest the show comes to producing anything of substance, even if her three episode arc in the middle of the show was rather poor. Hell, \"rather poor\" is actually doing pretty well as far as the rest of this travesty goes.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two girls, Tomoe Tachibana and Miyabi Hotaka, are a Duo themselves, which leads to some obligatory yuri-baiting as they shower together, change together, and embrace each other buck-naked in one of the EDs. Absolute Duo knows how to pander to the least common otaku denominator, and it does so with great pleasure and glee. However, these two are also interested in Tor's cock-a-no-way, and thus the harem is completed. Oh, joy. Their personalities are bizarre, like the author was grasping at straws trying to find some original gimmick, and then just settled on:\\n\\n\r\n--Tomoe being really angry at the slightest hint of ungentlemanly conduct from Tor and then apologizing profusely when it's a misunderstanding every fucking time; and\\n\r\n--Miyabi being useless but then turning evil near the show's climax so they can show her in bondage power armor. Oh, and F-cups. Because those are necessary.\\n\\n\r\nHave I given you a glimpse at just how bad this is? I could go on, but I think I've already spent about a thousand words too many eviscerating this turkey. Nonetheless, there is more to cover, but I'll try to be brief from this point on.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is nothing to really write home about. There are some decent stills, and admittedly the OP is very poppy, high-energy stuff. The first ED is also kinda artsy and came very close to striking a chord with me with its visuals highlighting Julie's loneliness and how arriving at Battle Harem High is her first step into overcoming her solitude and obligatory tragic backstory. The animation is dreadful. 8bit have shown that they know not what they do in this department, with an over-reliance on terrible 12 frame-per-second CG effects. The color scheme is all over the place with no real grounding in a fixed aesthetic style. It's just generic. It looks like the basest, most simple visualization of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is functional but doesn't strive for anything more. The voice actors in the original Japanese audio do the best they can with the script they've been given. If you look at their filmography you can tell that they're all relative newcomers to the industry looking to make a big break, with the exception of Tor's voice actor. I don't know if I should praise or condemn Yoshitsugu Matsuoka's performance, because he manages to make Tor sound like the gormless loser he really is. This man is the voice of Soma Yukihira and Sora Nai. He should be lending gravitas to the performance, but it's obvious that he didn't care any more than the director of this fecal festival did.\\n\\n\r\nI think that about exhausts all I have to say about this show. This has quickly become the longest, most rambling review I've ever posted on this site, but this is what this show did to me. It's not just bad, but it's the kind of bad that is all too pervasive in anime today, the ever-present idea that a show shouldn't aim to actually say or do anything meaningful in the medium, the pervasive notion that you can just pander really hard to the worst demons in an otaku's nature and glean some quick bucks out of it. It's sickening, and it's not worth your time. I hope you'll do yourself a favor and not only stay away from Absolute Duo, but make a point to avoid anything that looks like the same kind of show. We can make anime great again, but it starts with building a wall between our wallets and this ocean of half-baked light novel mush.\\n\\n\r\nUntil next time, remember that hugs can cure anything, including post-traumatic stress disorder and violent schizophrenic hallucinations.",

Main character lost someone, and so he continues to grow stronger so he will not lose anyone else. Is the plot okay? Yeah whatever I'm fine with the story. It's the way they executed it that is so poor. You are always left with more questions than answers. Just what exactly is an absolute duo? What kind of power does it instill? What is the deal with the main characters past? And what about Julie's past? Where did the mech suit men even COME from? Too many loose endsare never tied. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI have no complaints with the art. If anything, it was this anime's saving grace that kept me watching till the very end. It could be just a bit smoother, but I can easily look past that.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAh, sound. This is my main problem with the anime. Music and voices aside, it's fine. But when it comes down to an action anime, special effects need to have some type of impact behind them. Absolute duo? It took it's impact and stuffed it into a fucking doll. There is no sense of anything. At all. All the explosions seemed like puffs of air. These characters took MANY long charged heavy blows, yet when it connected it sounded like someone just lightly tapped a damn fruit. What rattled me the most was so many objects hit the ground. ESPECIALLY the weapons. The animation would show marvelous cracks into the floor and dirt and gravel and dust rising up, clouding the area, yet when you hear it... it's just incredibly dissatisfying. It made watching any type of physical scene extremely difficult. There were so many time where if it just actually sounded like what it was supposed to be, the scene would be fantastic. This anime really dropped the ball on sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCharacters are very meh. Copy and paste typical anime characters that you'd see in everything. We got the abused main boy, the tsundere who never listens, the non-caring and fairly out of it girl, the shy un-confident girl, typical harem stuff. There was no real character development at all. Unless you count Juile and Miyabi going on a rampage, only to snap out of it and be THE EXACT SAME WAY AS BEFORE, then, yeah. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nHonestly, I didn't have any enjoyment. I was either very neutral, or I didn't like some parts. The thought I had most in my head was \"It's 12 episodes, lets hurry up and finish this so I can be done with it.\" Or something along those lines. That is never a thought any anime should make you think.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf you're actually looking for ANIME? Don't watch it.",

I couldn't really say there was much of one since it literally never followed anything on their pasts or what they actually had to do, it showed flashbacks but either than that nothing throughout the whole story involving anything about their pasts or any \"Special\" characters.

            "content": "I had a lot of high hopes for this anime when it first started. But by the end of it, I was mostly just disappointed.\r\nA few PROS hooked me from the start:\r\n1.) I liked the opening and ending theme songs.\r\n2.) It had a good cast of voice actors.\r\n3.) The animation was fairly good with adequate effects and nice artwork.\r\n4.) I also enjoyed the general concept of the story...\r\nA school that teaches a duo system for combat, weapons that are manifestations of the soul, a main character whose soul manifests as a shield to protect rather than a weapon to attack with.\r\nThat all seemed fairly interesting.\r\n5.)To top off, the cast of characters was pretty good to start out with...\\n\\n\r\nJulie is adorable, bunny sensei provides comedic relief, you have a brain and brawn duo, and another duo of typical moe characters for fan service and harem aspects. The problem is that this cast never matures into anything else.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSo here's my view of the CONS:\\n\\n\r\n1.) The main characters get very little character development, if any.\\n\\n\r\nJulie and Tor are given back stories that are never fully explained nor used to advance the story. Their back stories also never receive any sort of conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nRomance is foreshadowed at the start of the show but never advanced. I started to question whether it was ever canon to begin with or if I was just imagining things. Tor and Julie don't change much as a duo throughout the course of the show aside from their growing urge to protect one another. The show even reverts them to more of a father-daughter relationship than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters get more plot development than the main characters too. Bunny Sensei goes from trying to murder the students to protecting them, Miyabi struggles to deal with her romantic feelings, and Lilith matures and learns to make friends.\\n\\n\r\n2.) The secondary characters were not utilized to their full potential.\\n\\n\r\nThe little goth principal seemed promising at first. It made it seem like not all of the cards were on the table yet. As the show goes on however, nothing is gained from her character. She seems utterly powerless yet incredibly important for no reason. The show never gives her a back story or a shining moment. At first she reminded be of the \"Witch of the Void\" (Natsuki Minamiya) from \"Strike the Blood\" but that comparison ended at the visual level.\\n\\n\r\nThe moe duo of Tomoe and Miyabi seemed to only exist to create a harem. I was hoping their character designs were going to be used in a more clever way. It's honestly fine to use tropes and cliches as long as the creators are self aware of this and can poke fun at themselves for it. Use them ironically, try not to have them take themselves seriously, or at least have some sort of intelligent humor behind their incorporation. Saekano, Seitokai Yakuindomo, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, No Game No Life, Outbreak Company, and various others are good examples of this tactic.\\n\\n\r\nBrains and Brawn never really do anything important. They don't receive any character development and just seem to be there. \\n\\n\r\n3.) The battle scenes begin to feel repetitive as all of the characters are inexplicably unkillable and the same villain is reused throughout the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter how much a character is injured, they just magically survive for no reason. There's nothing more annoying than when a show overplays the near death experience. I was even annoyed with how Aldnoah.Zero ended season 1 with what appeared to be 4 character deaths just to have every single one of them be just fine in season 2. But unlike Aldnoah.Zero, Absolute Duo seems to do this every single episode, does not retain any of the injuries as permanent, and makes no effort to explain away the damage taken by the characters. The biggest problem with this is that because no one ever dies, the same villain is fought over and over again in the show. At least if they actually fully defeated the villain there would be some sort of forced plot development by having new opponents appear.\\n\\n\r\n4.) Not much plot development.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly the story seems propped up by the introduction of new characters and occasional scene changes. At the end of the show no one gets revenge, there is no romantic progression, the power feud between organizations isn't settled, \"Absolute Duo\" is never really achieved or explained, the loli goth principal never unveils the master plan, no one graduates, and we still have no idea why the government is even bothering to train exceeds. The story has an interesting setting but lacks any sort of purpose.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show seemed like someone had a good idea for a setting and character cast but then never bothered to develop it at all. It just seems like someone wrote an awesome proposal for a series and then sold it off to be turned into filler.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big reason this anime may feel so disappointing to me is that all of its PROS are presented right at the start with all of the CONS showing up one after another until the end of the show. There are other shows with just as many PROS and CONS but because they are mixed together and go back and forth, the viewers tend to feel more like they are enduring the CONS to continue experiencing the PROS. Absolute Duo's PROS are all front loaded though so it's all downhill after you get hooked at the beginning.",

            "content": "I'll tell you right now: if you're expecting an anime with lots of action with a little harem action here and there then you're gonna be sorely disappointed. This is a very harem focused story and while it's not overwhelming, it just makes it seem like there isn't much to this anime.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nTo be honest, don't expect a real, definitive story.. It seemed as though it was just put together as each episode was made. Almost every episode really had a different plot and even with a main group as the antagonists the anime would focus on them for a little while and then divertour attention to something totally unrelated to them usually some harem based stuff. In addition to that, there were many plot holes to the story like the name of the anime. \"Absolute duo\" is mentioned many times throughout the anime, however even though it is sorta explained by Lilith, a main character, the viewers get a very minimal explanation of what it is with even the main character, Tor Kokonoe, saying he was having trouble understanding what it is.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nLoved the art style that was used from the start. The colors are bright and vibrant and it just looked spot on from the cherry blossoms to the character drawings. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nOk, but not great in my opinion. Nothing was wrong with it and each song seemed to work with each setting. It's just that there was nothing that gave me that \"WOW\" factor that would make me want to listen to it over and over again. Sadly the openings and the endings weren't all too special with is something I always look out for.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nWell here's where the most points were lost. Basically this anime had very bland and unmemorable characters. It was just like any other harem anime where many girls (4-5 in this case) fangirl over the overly nice main character who's as clueless as a rock towards it. And the antagonists weren't anything special either. They were just another group of people hoping to become superhumans stopping everyone that opposed them. To be honest, the only person I actually remember is Professor Bun-Bun (lol my favorite character).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nWell this may have been because before this I had been watching many serious violent animes, but I didn't find this too bad in terms of enjoyment. There were many jokes here and there that were funny and since I'm a dude, I can't say that I didn't enjoy the fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nI gave this a four because it seems like an average harem/action anime. Bland characters, some jokes thrown about, fanservice, a main character that loves every single person and is surround by girls like always. There's really nothing all too special about it.",

            "content": "Absolute Duo ~9~\r\nAs the new year of anime starts I can\u2019t help but ask myself \u201cIs it really possible for me to invest even more of my life into animoo?\u201d\r\n~ Unsafeman121 Jan 2015\r\n~Plot~\r\n~9~\r\nThe plot takes a little while to kick off, however each time it does, it bring Absolute Duo to a whole other level even if it does lack consistency in a few areas. For the most part, the anime is fairly open and so is difficult to predict the scenarios which may occur down the line - by no means a negative trait for an anime to have. The protagonist\u2019s unique \u201cBlaze\u201d (thename for the character abilities in this anime) leads you to wonder how the rest is going to progress, especially with regards to combat, which is an interesting variation on lots of the other action-heavy anime. Characters which have been introduced at intervals throughout the anime, such as Lilith, have sped up the plot and made things more engaging again and again.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\r\n~9~\\n\r\nI will start off my saying that Yamamoto Nazomi does an incredible job of voice acting the main female protagonist, Julie. I have to admit that I am not terribly familiar with her work, but if it is anything like in Absolute Duo, then I will be pleased to see her name pop up again in the future. The rest of the voice acting is also done to a high standard. The OP and ED contrast greatly, yet I love them both for their own reasons, the former is fast paced and exciting while the latter is a lot softer and cute. Both compliment the anime nicely, as does the background music throughout it.\\n\\n\r\n~Visuals~\\n\r\n~7~\\n\r\nAbsolute Duo has been nicely drawn. The characters seem, for the most part, well balanced and the more action-packed scenes make it clear what is happening while still adding flair to the scenarios. The contrast between colours is crisp where it needs to be and things are pleasing to the eye. The main negative that I would have to comment on is some of the character models; on occasion I have found some of their faces to be irregularly shaped, especially with some of the side views, there is also the matter with a few scenic scenes being relooped shorter segments (such as with the waves). The action scenes do make up for this a little and so will leave the Visuals section with a 7 rating from me.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\r\n~9~\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Tooru, voiced (of course) by Matsuoka Yoshitsugu, is unique in his abilities, even if his character model and personality is fairly generic. The main interest for a large part however, is Julie. This is an intriguing character which you keep wanting to find out more about, you learn fairly early on that things have happened in her past, though it does not go into as much detail as may have been ideal. The multiple side-characters have their own personalities which all seem to tie nicely in together as of present. Character development really started to blossom after the introduction of Lilith and the proceeding episodes, and it is nice to see that they have dedicated time to that portion of the anime. There is one character which sees significant development and this adds incredibly to the late portion of the anime - making some scenes very moving.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\r\n~9~\\n\r\n(Enjoyment is always difficult to write about so my rating is primarily based off of a scale I have on my profile. I will post the relevant quote for the rating below followed by a brief talk:)\\n\\n\r\n\u201c9 ~ This anime was extremely enjoyable to watch and went above and beyond my expectations.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nOf the anime I have seen from the season in which this was released, this was one of the ones which I followed the closest. I awaited each new episode with eagerness and each week it turned out to be the top priority anime I want to watch out of the ones I was going through at the time.\\n\\n\r\n~Overall: 44/50 (0.86) ~\\n\r\n~9~\\n\\n\r\nAbsolute Duo has a mix of nicely drawn action , along with well voiced parts, awesome OP and ED tracks and is just generally a well rounded anime. The plot becomes incredible and the characters are well nicely developed, adding a great deal to the overall feel of the anime. I would not be able to call the visuals a let-down in any way, though it is the largest constituent as to why Absolute Duo was not able to reach the infamous \u201c10\u201d rating for me.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who are interested ~ Ranking Progression:\\n\r\nThis is where I show the changes (if any) in my overall rating as the anime progressed, I review my ratings every 4 episodes ~ though if one does stand out for me I will also mention it.\\n\\n\r\nE01: 7\\n\r\nE04: 8 (Rated Up 1)\\n\r\nE08: 8\\n\r\nE11: 9 (Rated Up 1)\\n\r\nE12: 9",

            "content": "Man, this anime was a let-down. This could be so good but it's so... bad. Let me explain why.\r\nAnimation was meh. It did not blow me off my seat, it did not make me cry in disbelief at how badly you can mess up. Motion was captured just fine, but the last 2 episodes suffered from the Dragonball Syndrome. Namely - dots for eyes and lines for mouths in combat scenes etc.\r\nWriting 2/10(for effort): This was a pitiful attempt, at most. No backstory explained. I'm trying to keep this spoiler free, so I won't point out the most obvious stuff, I'll just say the storytried so hard to find focus that it ended up all over the place. Detour after detour, failure after failure until you realize that this story is just a random blob of flashbacks, \"mastermind\" plans, motivations, trying to explain how soulpower works and excuses to throw in more fighting in-between your fighting and fan service. Not to mention efforts to make this battle royale with the story progress at times. This story would put any swiss cheese in shame.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 2/10(for effort): Bland, clich\u00e9 and boring when explained(main cast) but most of them aren't even touched, they are just decorations to make you feel this is actually happening in a school, with classmates and all. Length of this anime and its heavy focus on action left no time for character development - which is almost nonexistent, and if it's there it's always circled around the \"development of their soul\"(or how powerful they've become, and even that is inconsistent AND even that focuses on the main cast of like 5 characters). The only character that wasn't like the rest was Imari, and she was mercilessly shoved aside by the creators only to be brought up halfway through the series. And don't even get me started on the MC, a person this stupid and clueless in real life would be deemed as borderline autistic. Not to mention he looks exactly like the MC of Sakurasou(hairstyle, eye color and posture), but I'd like to think that's an accident. It has to be, since the characters are your generic huge boobs/small boobs and hairstyles thrown together to cover up the fact that they all lack any depth.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10: That was bad studio work - voicing was ok, but the way it was edited to somewhat fit into this whole thing... sound effects from battles sounded like they were taken straight from first mortal kombat at times(certain loud thump in 11th or 12th episode or sword clashing sounds when stuff hits a shield...)\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY: If you enjoy anime battles and do not like complicated lore, this is an anime for you. However - if you are on a crusade to point out mishaps and mistakes or you just can't help being pissed off at incompetency - you'd be better off without this stroke you'll be getting from watching this.",

            "content": "I highly suggest you don't watch this anime if you are looking for an anime where the main character who is super op prepare to majorly disappointed. The main character and story line of this plot gives off the idea the the main character as some awesome hidden power.\r\nSound- 4 the voice acting was average and not anything amazing giving I did watch the English dub version, but I will say the theme song is incredible and probably one of the best ones I've heard in fact the only reason why you should watch this anime is to listen to the 2 min and 40sec theme song.\\n\\n\r\nArt-6 The art was pretty nice and it's was your standered art style of characters really not anything special but it wasn't bad. The actions scenes art had great detail. Some art when they are showing off the landscape is beautiful. Though they could have had more attention with the detail of everything.\\n\\n\r\nChracters-2 The characters are your typical characters with the main character always talking about protecting his friends no matter. Considering he is saying the same thing in every episode. He is the typical boy who has all the girls crushing on him and doesn't really care. Then you have the second main character who is the air headed girl who seems not to know anything and seems super op then gets her ass kicked in fight scenes. All the other characters really are just there and don't need any explaining except one character who went all psycho chick cuz the main character rejected her.\\n\\n\r\nStory-5 Basically it takes place at a school where people have these soul weapon things. The main character has a special one though as everyone says, while everyone else has these major cool weapons our main character has shield(talk about a major let down) well the anime starts to give off the vibe that this main character has some amazing hidden power making you just want to watch the anime to see what it is. Well the main character wants to get stronger and stuff like that with his duo. Everyone is paired up in duo's at this school in order to create the absolute duo, which everyone seems to know absolutely nothing about. Ok then comes along these rebel army people and attack the students while they are at an island get away but no one dies. Then the rebel group comes back and challenges the principle to a death game between the soul weapons and these body suits and still no one dies. This only happens in the past couple episodes and I bet your wondering what the main characters op hidden power was, well it was a bigger force field and that's all, I know amazing right? Well they beat the bad guy and end of story. And the duo swears to be together forever. Oh I forgot to mention a crazy teacher who's thinks she's a rabbit tries to kill them and after she tries to kill them the principal still lets her teach there and at the end she ends saving the students she wanted to kill.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-2 at times I did find my self some what entertained but not much I felt like I was going through hell watching this anime. The reason why I watched was to find out the main characters true hidden power then be crushed when I found out it was a bigger force field, I wanted to rage quit the anime but the problem wat I had already finished it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-3 The anime was bad and that's all there is to it.",

            "content": "Lion Tamers, Lion Tamers; gather round!\r\nI take a look at another of many stories dealing with super powers, and school environments. This one with many interesting twists.\r\nI speak of course, about \"Absolute Duo\".\r\nAs some of you know, I begin to tire of the almost absolute nature of Japanese authors, that believe all anime (or manga, for that matter) must begin with a high-school environment. But I'm not going to rant about that. For me, basic story is everything; so the startup environment becomes a small gripe, but a gripe nonetheless.\r\nI have been very late in reviewing this anime, because firstly, I've been very busy writingsome fan fiction. But also, because I wanted to watch the show again, in English Dub. The first time I watched it was in the Japanese with subtitles. I can report that the subtitled version is much better. The chosen English voices (aside from Caitlin Glass) were mostly mediocre to terrible.\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\nTo that end, I wish to speak a little about Caitlin Glass. Ms. Glass was born in D.C., and raised in California. She presently lives in Texas. Caitlin Glass isn't right for every character she plays; but in this case, she was so over the top, that I just had to mention the great outrageous character voice she did for the character Lilith Bristol, supposedly a very English personality.\\n\\n\r\nArrogant, spoiled, patrician; Caitlin Glass faked everything Lilith had to be with charm, grace and fun. Lilith Bristol was so over the top that everything she said and did, had comic overtones that just had me grinning, in every scene she was in. One misses out on Caitlin's voice, for the overall much better subtitled version, but if you want to be charmed by a dubbed voice look for Lilith Bristol. You won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nCaitlin Glass is often caught doing a lot of things one would not expect. She was the ADR Director of this show; and she is heard in other anime. The one that comes to mind is a song she sings, with many other characters in \"Cat Planet Cuties\", where she is the best sounding. Her character sings this song, where her character is an Android that is keeping faith with her previous owner, now dead for more than 900-years. After that, her character travels back to home world, and pitches herself into the ocean, in the commission of suicide. She just couldn't bear to live anymore. Anyone who can't feel pathos about that, has had his/her pathos button burned out.\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\r\nLet's now return to Absolute Duo.\\n\\n\r\nSince most of the characters are quite formulaic, I only wish to speak about one or two, in the main. And that begins with Kevin Wayfair.\\n\\n\r\nKevin Wayfair is a total abomination. His back story does not fit his character. His brother dies, in ways not detailed in the story, so he reacts by believing in nothing and no-one. He becomes the penultimate villain character, with only a one-dimensional face on everything, including his universally single-minded desire to kill anything that becomes a possible threat; in his single-minded drive to become the strongest power center. He doesn't even have an over-arching reason to acquire power, and applies it to nothing but the acquisition of more of it.\\n\\n\r\nLot's of people lose their brothers. They don't become homicidal maniacs. They usually get over it, and live normal lives. Even in the Absolute Duo universe, where several characters have lost loved ones. They didn't become insane monsters. Difficult to handle sometimes, but not irretrievably insane.\\n\\n\r\nNow I want to speak briefly about one of the teachers in our hero's homeroom; Rito Tsukimi. For those of you who have watched part or all of Absolute Duo; you'll already know. Rito is 'bang her head against the wall because it feels good' totally nuts. Couple homicidal rage with latent nymphomania, and you get pretty close to this teacher with the playboy bunny ears and a personality Marquis De Sade would have been proud of. And this is what the head-mistress of the school allows near young teenagers.\\n\\n\r\nThe other side of Rito's equation is that without her, there would have been very little humor in the show, albeit dark sadistic humor. She, with great cheer and aplomb, sometimes decides to include herself in the occasional scheduled combat matches, just to introduce what she thinks is funny. This amounts to converting these matches into death-matches a'la Freddy Kruger. That's reasonably funny too, if you're into that sort of thing.\\n\\n\r\nIt would not have been difficult to edit a few plot-lines, or dialog, to make Rito an 'insider' spy for Kevin Wayfair. But that doesn't happen, she is totally loyal to her head-mistress of the school. No reason I can come up with, and it isn't in the story. Don't look for it, just enjoy that somehow Rito is on the side of 'good and righteousness'.\\n\\n\r\nNow I wish to switch gears and talk about the plot. Because of the single-sided villain in the story, there isn't much for the authors to develop. But they did have some mildly good plot devices in the story that I could enjoy.\\n\\n\r\n1). Did anyone notice that this school has enemies that are not a competing club in the school, or other inside faction? The enemies are all external from the main campus of the school, and thereby produces a story plot that is significantly different from most other high-school 'spice of life' adversarial conflicts.\\n\\n\r\n2). Does anyone notice that the head-mistress of this school is not running a school at all, but a factory for super-humans? This explains why she runs two separate campuses. And because of this developing plot-line, she has absolutely no compassion for her students at all. Sakuya Tsukomo is however, a very good politician, and knows when she must appear compassionate when politic to do so. For this reason, many respect her, but she has almost no friends at all. Is it any wonder her handle is 'Blaze Diabolica'?\\n\\n\r\nSakuya is so dark, that she could almost be classed as a true anti-villain. In the end I had real trouble with her absolute refusal to join forces with the other character that has no back-story. Equipment Smith. I see no reason why not. Exo-suit equipment for augmenting the physical strength of a Blaze Student would in fact produce a pair of 'Absolute Duo', in a much shorter time. The results were all positive, I could not see a negative to this alliance.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Sakuya was a very guarded and secretive individual, for reasons difficult to defend. Equipment Smith's main failings dealt with poor choices for personnel to be augmented. The means of augmentation had few negatives.\\n\\n\r\n3). Did anyone notice that 'Miyabi Hotaka\" was never defeated at the end? She got talked out of her desire to be powerful beyond all imagining. Plain and simple. This produced a very unsatisfying ending. Without that moment in the story, the pairing of Miyabi and Kevin would have been demonstrably stronger than the 'Blaze' alone. And head-mistess Sakuya would have met with defeat. She won because of a weak-minded fool who should never have been augmented in the first place. And Kevin was an equally poor choice for augmentation, for opposite reasons.\\n\\n\r\nIn this way, the authors provide for us a straw-man, that looks like the whole idea of augmentation is a poor one. It isn't. Only the choice of people was flawed. For example, a sane man with a gun does not shoot up his neighborhood, just because he can. Only a flawed one would even consider it.\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nNow I want to talk about the art and sound in the show. The artwork is actually quite good, and even contains some startling parallax artwork and other niceties. But I continue to question the use of eye-colors in the metallic range. It makes the characters look like dead automatons. I wish artists would refrain from this practice. It tarnishes otherwise good artwork.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is quite good, although there isn't a whole bunch of it. The opening and closing title music is mostly very bad j-pop music. The exception is the first end-title track, which is very good, and its harmonies and rhythm is not too egregious.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialog tends towards too much, but not to the point of extreme annoyance; aside from Rito's dialog which tends to say too much, and give away her characteristics too early in the story.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of that, I close a review of a very flawed anime in 'Absolute Duo', which did in fact have some good developmental plot points, and some excellent actions scenes. Oh and don't forget the rare and interesting, although poorly developed characters that bear watching; Like Diabolica and Rito. And the never speaking character 'Ryuutarou Tatsuno' who flexes his muscles to impress the girls, and gets his over-muscled physique stomped into the pavement way more often than he should have.\\n\\n\r\nI give Absolute Duo a weak 7.\\n\\n",

I felt that this whole show could have been better; it had so much potential to be something cool and exciting, which it did for a while. I was going through this show blind & watching it in English dub on Youtube.\r\nSTORY: School, Teenage boys and girls, archaic weapons that no one uses anymore unless your a pro LARPer. As the story progressed onward, I began to enjoy it just a little bit; however, towards the end, it dropped all my excitement. The dubbing did not help either, which was my mistake tobegin with. \\n\\n\r\nART: I don't really know what to say about the art. I guess it was alright.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The english dub to this was much worse than I expected, during fights. During the rest of the episodes, it was a little better. The male protagonist, Tooru, was probably the only voice that fit. Everyone else was either hit or miss. At times, it's pretty cringe worthy. Especially the ecchi, it just feels like they're reading off a script, especially one character.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: The only character I liked was Tooru, he seemed to be the only one focused on what was going on, even though he could have turned this Absolute Duo to an Absolute Threesome. Julie was tolerable, so was Tomoe. Mami came back with her gun, bigger boobs and a British accent. Everyone else felt useless or burnt out, even some of their voice actors felt bored of their roles halfway through the series. Miyabi was the worst of the worst, I know she was supposed to be this shy character, but the voice put me off and it sounded like she's a virgin until like the last few episodes. The only other character I liked was Kevin, I disliked him, and I enjoyed that. I think that as villains go for any movie, you're supposed to hate them because of their bad deeds; he does it right because of how annoying he is.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the show. Its one of those shows where it's really bad, but you enjoy it because its bad.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: It had a potential to be different from all the other shows that have: School, Teenagers, Fantasy fighting, and a protagonist that won't give them the Sweet Hawaiian Sauce. Maybe the ecchi could have been \"presented\" better, or maybe remove the misunderstanding and just do it in a tent. I dunno, I just wish it was better. Personally, I think this is a show you can speed through, talk about how bad it is, then make funny jokes about it.\\n\\n",

I like it a lot but wish there was more than 12 episodes, it has very interesting aspects to it, it is simplistic but has a nice love interest in it so far, and usually when anything bad happens between him and the love interest it's usually blown out of proportion and he ends up looking like a perv. It's not overly done either which is a nice change from what I recently watched (High School DxD), it seems like a bit more storycould be added to it as it doesn't have too much of a flow between the scenes, meaning they don't connect very well. It has \"Blaze's\" which is essentially a manifestation of ones soul into a weapon, where as some people are exceptions and it manifests in other ways (such as the main character's being a shield).\\n\\n\r\nI like: the characters, the art style, the plot, the lore, and just it overall.\\n\\n\r\nI don't like: the length, the somewhat lack of connection between episodes (the flow?), the way the school does things.\\n\\n\r\nVery interesting anime, I don't normally watch when they have below 24 episodes but this is a nice change so far.

If you aren't too keen in mild sexual depictions of high school girls that are near naked, then maybe this anime is not for you. It has its funny and serious moments; ups and downs etc... It can be a bit absurd with these special 'Blaze' weapons and the fact that there is really only 1 male protagonist with a bunch of other supporting female characters. It becomes a lot like a harem where quite a lot of girls want to have this guy and itbecomes a love triangle.. or square... If you don't mind sexual depictions of female characters, then this anime might be just for you. The 'Blaze' thing idea might be a bit absurd but the anime picks itself back up with character development. It absolutely nails character development and I don't think that they left any back-stories or any general knowledge of any characters and one character doesn't seem to have an excessive, overpowered skill that would absolutely obliterate everyone else. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, unless you like a little fan-service, you probably won't like this anime.",

            "content": "Story(5):\r\nAbsolute duo is a very generic and cliche type of story that takes place in some what a high school with some action as well as a harem of girls. Basically, it's nothing outstanding nor interesting, the pacing and stuffs is okay, but because it's so generic and the development is not deep at all, I find it hard to enjoy this show. of course for audience who don't mind just watching girls with decent assets fighting and having fun, then they may find it interesting, but to me, it's became some what a chore to watch this anime as I always finish the seriesthat I started. It's not that bad, really nothing interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7):\\n\r\nThe rendering is possibly one of the best aspect of this show, things are bright and vibrant, easy to see, even for night scenes, it's easy to see what's going on. However, I really don't like the fact that they had quite a bit of CGI used in the show. The buildings and some of the villains in armour are all easily identified as CGI, it just didn't blend in with the characters and the movements are all very mechanical and artificial. Animation wise, generic kind of animation, quite a few derps in the details here and there but it's ok for a budget anime. Fight scenes on the other hand has too many pauses to even make it intense though the addition of perspective makes it look more pleasant. \\n\\n\r\nSound(7):\\n\r\nSound wise, the opening and ending are quite memorable and the voices of the female cast are all good, they leave me with a good impression, however the guys are too generic, everyone kind of overuse Kirito's voice actor as their main cast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(5):\\n\r\nI didn't really enjoy the series in general since it's not a very meaningful show. Things are too cliche and I'm a guy who doesn't really care much about looking at girls once the plot is weak. I'm not too sure what other reviews had said about this series but mediocre is the best word to describe this show\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review contains a summarize version of the review. It does not contain any spoilers that may affect the plot.\r\nStory 3 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSummarizing the story, we get Tooru Kokonoe as the main character, he had a traumatic incident wherein the person he loved was killed, seeking for revenged he enrolled in a school. Tooru has a power called blaze, and this school enhance the potential of his blaze, by the way he wields a shield, and regarded as an irregular due to him having a shield instead a weapon, but in the school you must have a duo, because the school's mission is to find theabsolute duo....\\n\\n\r\nAt first the plot fascinated me and thought \"it might be a good anime\", and I saw this trending so I watched it. I won't sugarcoat things here, it was basically horrible, it seems that it was written by some 17 years old who has a chuunibyou, it was stupid the story had no exact plot, backstory, character developement; any of these wasn't present in the story. Even if you tell me it is a 12-episode-story that's why it isn't enough to add in these, then tell me why \"how did they throw in fan service?\"  \\n\\n\r\nI'm going to spoil you guys now, the main character and his girl go to the mall and suddenly the guy opened the curtain while the girl is changing, There is an episode where they go in the beach because of a field trip and then the bra of the girl got wash up by the sea. Now guys these \"spoilers\" are common in a ecchi/harem story. Almost every harem/ecchi story has these sequences so you could find it in other ecchi/anime stories such as \t\\n\r\n\"Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry\" and \"Trinity Seven\". Asking me what is unique with this story, I can't answer.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nThere was inconsistent, sometimes the art was colorful, sometimes it was dark. In my opinion the art wasn't bad but wasn\u2019t good either, The background was beautiful but the character design seemed childish; it wasn't very fitting for the background. Not much to say in art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nI must praise their efforts on the sound, because the opening and ending changed even though it's just a 12-episode-anime but the reason I gave 6 is because I couldn't feel the battle sequence, the romance part, and etc.. The sound is inaudible in some cases; a battle scene without music is just boring. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actor is a good choice for the characters designs such as Nozomi Yamamoto, who voiced Julie in this anime, you could really tell the anime was aiming for a kuudere character since she was the voice actor.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nThis is what I hate the most in the anime, they introduce characters but they don't give notice to these characters? Some characters lack attention, like that muscle guy, what\u2019s his name? I FORGOT CAUSE WTF, YOU DIDN'T EVEN GIVE HIM ONE DIALOUGE; in one episode he only flexed his muscle. It's not only one guy, all of the major characters had no story; there was no reason why the main character even wanted revenge or whom he wanted to revenge against, the series ended full of mystery, not one major mystery involving the main characters were solved. And even though they couldn't give attention to the other characters they kept adding more and more characters, that\u2019s just stupidity\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nBasically, It wasn't worth my time, it felt like I was just watching other ecchi/harem anime. It was just the same in some points. For an experienced anime watcher it is generic, cliche, and predictable. This anime would surely disappoint you. \\n\\n\r\nFor those who just started watching anime and want to watch anime, this series wouldn't be good for you, there are other harem/anime that may satisfy you (highschool dxd/aesthetic of the rouge hero). This series would just be a disappointment on how you view anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nMore complaints: \\n\r\nIn the review of the story I said the writer was a 17 year-old chunibyou, let me explain it to you. The character's dialogue is something so shitty I had to cover my ears and just read the subtitle. A gothic Lolita said 9 times (9 times is an exaggeration) in the show \"everything is done so we could achieve the absolute duo.\" why would you emphasize this dialogue? This dialogue should have only been said once for in my opinion it would keep the story more mysterious. \\n\\n\r\nAnd also parts of the story were unrealistic, I'm not saying being unrealistic in an anime is bad, but atleast keep it consistent. For an example, there was a part they were falling from a second floor in a mall and it took about 20 seconds just to get down, but when they jump from the second floor(yes, jump because they are strong) it only took a split second. \\n\r\nTL;DR ---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nStory: didn't focus much on the plot but went full fanservice and introduce too many characters that the main characters didn't get enough time for them to unravel their past; and by past, meaning the reason why the story started.\\n\\n\r\nArt: sometimes good, sometimes bad; inconsistent, character design didn't fit too well with the background.\\n\\n\r\nSound: efforts were good, good choice of VA (voice actors too), but it the background soundtracks were inaudible and forgettable too. Imagine Darth Vader walking without the imperial march, seems bland right? That is the feeling on some parts.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: didn't have any developement (by the developements meaning flashbacks or growth of an individual). The characters were not given attention.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: did not enjoy this anime at all, waste of time.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "first of all I'im going to say that this anime is getting bashed more than it deserves.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nwe follow our Male protagonist by the name of Kokonoe Tooru who enrolls in Kouryou Academy. the purpose of the school is to reach absolute duo and that is gained through hard work and dedication. the story isn't completely original but it has a nice take on it. there exist something called blazes and they are simply a representation of the persons soul (not original) but even though the concept is unoriginal i still thought that it was planned and executed nicely\r\nbut there is some plot holes thatdoesn't get explained and therefore it would have been nice to see 24 ep instead of 12.\\n\r\nthere is some ecchi moments and towards the end there is some elements of a harem but that is not that noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nthe art was nice and had a lot of vibrant colors but towards the end of the show you can start to see that the budge became a problem so they had to cut down on the quality of the animation though it isn't super noticeable though.\\n\r\nthe fight scenes where nicely choreographed and well animated.\\n\r\noverall the animation was good but not outstanding,\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nthe sound was quite enjoyable but not to the point that i would remember it thought the openings and the endings where a nice touch to the series and i quite liked them. the background music was nicely put to use but i would have wanted a bit more power in the tracks played during fights. \\n\r\nand they nailed the more \"emotional\" moments and there isn't much to comment on that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nKokonoe Tooru: he is the typical male protagonist that is quite generic, a weak boy that receives OP abilities, he has a troubled past that will return to haunt him. \\n\r\nSigtuna Julie: her purpose to enroll in the school is revealed later in the show but she is a quite girl that is a little bit of an airhead, she makes stupid decisions that ends up causing more problems than it helped (which annoyed me slightly) \\n\r\nBristol Lilith: typical rich girl with an annoying attitude though it improves quite a bit the further the story progresses.  \\n\r\nHotaka Miyabi: for me this it the person that is here only to annoy and be a burden for the rest of the cast. though for me see was a representation of humanity and the feelings of being helpless, confused and weak. but gains power through her friends as she learns to stand up by herself.\\n\r\nTachibana Tomoe: she was a great addition to the cast as you gave a sort of rivalry with the MC so that both got some character development but other than that she is a side character that just feels a role to explain certain things and be more of the shot caller.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\ni enjoyed this anime quite a bit and it had me wanting to watch more and more. \\n\r\nthe animation was as expected and i didn't have a problem with how they structured the story and the ending. it's light-hearted but could be serious when it wanted to which i found to be a major strong point in the anime. the story progresses fairly quickly but not to the point where it felt rushed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  8/10\\n\r\nthis one brought a nice relaxed but enjoyable story with some serious bits but not to major in a sense. the characters, most of them were enjoyable and i liked the interaction between them as it didn't feel pointless. the sound is used well and they nailed the important moments with the right music. for me this was one of those animes were once you finished an episode you wanted more and kept watching, before you know it, it was over and was left with a feeling of wanting even more. \\n\r\nthere is some ecchi moments and some that point to the typical harem anime but for this one that is not the case. those embarrassing moment that the MC faces where there for comic relief which i found quite enjoyable. \\n\r\nwhen considering to watch this anime. don't expect an masterpiece because it won't live up to that but it's a great show none the less.",

            "content": "so this anime was recommended to me by a friend, he said it was good so i checked it out and here's my full review of it : \r\nStory: \r\nThe Story is set in a world where people can summon weapons called blazes , the blazes are one's soul and the people that can summon these weapons are called Exeeds. \r\nThe story follows a boy called Thor Kokonoe as he attends a school where he can get more power to eventueally kill someone that has killed his entire familly/clan or whatever something like that. The school uses a duo system where two people must worktogether and one day maybe achieve \"Absolute Duo\" . In the grand scheme of things All stundents must fight eachother and the victors get to stay in the school. Thor is excepted in to the school and gets as his duo the lovely Julie. These two allong with a few two other groups of duo's are the main cast and shall find themselves in a whole lot of trouble .\\n\r\n( I tried not to give spoilers :p) \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is fine I really don't mind it 8-bit studio did they're best(I had never heard of them until now so i can't really compare)\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe sound is pretty good it might not be as good as lets say Highschool DxD but its pretty good by itself. The OP was pretty catchy not gonna lie so were the first and second ED \\n\r\nThe third ED I didn't really enjoy as much so yeah. \\n\r\nAlso i have the feeling the soundtrack isn't really original can't really tell but I know that I had heard some of the OSTs before.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : \\n\r\nOur main characters are Thor and Julie these two are a duo and their personalities do fit eachother I geuss with a problem of Julie being Bland most of the time yet kindof interesting\\n\r\nAnd Thor who is out for revenge and Power but in the end realizes that he doesn't want that afterall but rather to protect the ones he cares about. Also Thor is VERY Dense and acts like your generic lightnovel character that reacts really weird when a girl sleeps next to him or really with any girl most of the time .\\n\r\nThen we have our second Duo Miyabi and Tomoe which I find a bit more interesting than Thor and Julie . Miyabi starts of interesting but as she falls in love with Thor she gets less ineteresting up until a point where she is just your standard Notice me Senpai character . Tomoe is a whole lot more interesting yet she also falls in love with Thor becoming a bit more Tsundere. \\n\r\nThen we have our final Duo Tora and Tatsu which I find the most interesting yet these two don't do much which is very dissapointing since i really liked Tora. Tora is a friend of Thor and wanted to be his duo partner but as we all know Thor chose Julie. About Tatsu yeah theirs not much going on there.\\n\r\nAfter this we have Lilith she is from the UK and is Royalty and also falls in love with Thor \\n\r\nThe characters don't look that original either. \\n\r\nIrinia looks like IF from Hyperdimension Neptunia\\n\r\nLilith looks like Chitoge from Nisekoi\\n\r\nSarah( Liliths maid/butler) looks like Tsugumi also from Nisekoi\\n\r\nAnd \\n\r\nKei looks like Kiba from Highschool DxD \\n\r\nI don't know if their supposed to be references or their just lazy designs..\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict :\\n\\n\r\nThis is your standard Ecchi/Harem/Action series that really doesn't bring anything new to the table.\\n\\n\r\nNow with that out of the way I'd like to give my rating based off of Story, Sound, Characters, Animation and My personal enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacters: 6 (too many clich\u00e9s)\\n\r\nAnimation: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6 \\n\r\nOverall : 6.3\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked this try Highschool DxD \\n\\n\r\nAnd with this I thank you and Farewell ! \\n",

            "content": "I bet you already know about Persona. it must be easier for me to explain what this Blaze thingy if you are well-known about Persona series, whether you know only the game nor the anime series. While Persona is showing you another form of you in another world with vary skills and power for each individual, Absolute Duo is showing your soul in a form of a weapon according to each person individually. The differences, of course, about the form. Persona nicely recreate that person's image or shadow into something different that I can't tell (it looks so..fantasy), meanwhile Absolute Duojust takes form of a weapon based on the owner itself, the owner holds an unique weapon based on their personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\n   I've got myself to give 1st impression for this anime before. I can say I was captivated enough to prioritize downloading this anime newest eps every week, because it was cool as f*ck in the introduction (1st and 2nd eps). Despite it gets its popularity in the start line, Absolute Duo series started to feel kinda off and somehow only made us wait the bombastic event which mostly came at the end after Lilith, a minor character in the main characters circle showed up and made her debut a lot. However since the Lilith debut in their circle, by being side by side with Lilith, one by one their strengths level-up and also can strengthen the bonds of friendship between them. Not too bad for the battle scenes because we can get a lot from it.\\n\\n\r\n   The characters development was exploring more than before, I thought it is because this Lilith brings the core of problem to the front line for main characters. Her emergence paves the way for us to get bunch of informations of the problem awaits. And of course this problem makes turmoil in their friendship that lead them to make decision maturely (developing). The fact that every characters are often involved in every involving cases makes their development growing up steady. Altho' Miyabi is being a nuisance to overcome her weaknesses mentally, she also develops up-and-down.\\n\r\n[somewhat spoiler] The show is getting its hits on 8th eps. Not only because it was summer training and camp time\u2014including beach and hot springs time\u2014but also the start of God's Destruction Corps / Libers action and the Exceed to meet the \"Selection\" among Blaze user.\\n\r\nThis eps is marked too, because of the change of my perception to Miyabi Hotaka who is so fragile and pessimistic and seems like a bother for me. Her courage to tell out her feelings straight to Tooru and the instant flashback Tooru got at that time are thrilling. Then..suddenly it disappears, the whole new perception after watched 9th eps, Miyabi is the target of Libers association to be special soldier to make Tooru and friends fall off to beat their own friend. and Miyabi itself turns into an annoying being in my sight, because she is so easy to get depressed by her own weakness and she is dancing in enemy's hand.\\n\\n\\n\r\n   From the 10th eps, we are served by more battles, more intense battles which is darker than before but losses its cool. The hidden truth behind all of the problem is not shocking enough and it feels somehow plain than the earlier eps. The meaning of Avenger mentioned about and the truth between the school main purpose and enemy's will, in fact its blast just for entertaining. Only to entertain and less meaning there. [For the theme song aspect, guessed I already speech my impression on the previous post, the post of Absolute Duo's 1st impression]\\n\\n\r\n   I'm sure this show can be more promising later, if it gets its 2nd season by being more complicated in the problems and bluntly tells viewers exactly what's going on. By giving clear informations with outstanding way will help to boost the interest for keep rooting for the show. Let's vote this show 7 as its already entertain me on my summer break.\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nThe time its (characters) on battle. Their movements are awesome, it's beautifully firm looks like so fine martial arts\\n\r\nNice visualization, especially some sceneries\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nStill remains, the exact meaning of \"avenger\", the explanation of scars from Kokonoe and Julie's past, and another association that haunted those Blaze. Not too much explored",

            "content": "[Introduction]\r\n \u2018Absolute Duo\u2019 was made (Not a big surprise) by 8Bit studio, a small studio founded in 2008 that is dedicated to do some Romance-Harem-Ecchi Colorful animes, and it was adapted from a Light Novel written by Takumi Hiiragiboshi (Who isn\u2019t very popular because this is his only work) and transformed into an anime by Atsushi Nakayama.  I would classify this as an 'Ecchi-Harem'anime, so I won't be judging it so hard in the story. However, I'll judge it by how interesting it is, how great character are and how beautiful it's art style-music is.\\n\\n\r\n     Story: [2 Plain Boring]\\n\\n\r\n I'll summarize all the \"story\" in one sentence: 'Middle-schoolers got some guns attached to their soul, so bad people want them in the army...' Maybe I say too much, more than the anime actually does. But it is not only simple and clich\u00e9 as it could be, it is also REALLY boring and so bad implemented in the anime that it drags you out. The idea of having a sword that represented your soul started as cool. Then the main character came with a shield, running all that could seem interesting there making the main character \"special\" and blah, blah, blah... And then a girl with a rifle. Why? Because f*ck the story, right?\\n\\n\r\n     Characters: [2 Bad Clich\u00e9]\\n\\n\r\n Main character? Boring as it could be in a harem anime (Also, as a plus, I never fully understood his name: he was supposed to be named after Thor, a Nordic God, but ended being called Toor or Tooru). Main girl in the anime? Typical white-haired loli kuudere... It's okay if you like that type of girls, but this one is nothing that you haven't seen before, so you are not missing a big thing. Oppai girl? Clumsy and plain, and even her boobs are too big to enjoy. Her friend? Okay, she was nice, I guess. I have to admit that the few times I laughed while watching this was because of her. His friends? Who were them!? I couldn't feel something like 'Oh, they must be important to the story' or 'They must be really good friends!'. Blond girl? Useful for an Anime MLG Recompilation, I guess...\\n\\n\r\n     Aesthetics: [6 Simple but Nice]\\n\\n\r\n Don't get too much excited about it, this is a necessary thing in Ecchi anime: it HAS to look nice. Still, this one manages to do it a bit better. One of the few things that can be said about the anime is that it looks nice. When it needed to look cute, it sure did with big rounded cheeks and bright colors. When it needed to look serious, maybe the colors drag a bit out, but the combination of red and violet sometimes did it\u2019s job and make the mood feel a bit more 'in the story'. Still, it's an obligation for an Ecchi-Harem series to look this way, so don't get too proud. And then the animation was good... until they decided to do fighting scenes, and that it's supposed to be the main part of the anime. They were... not so interesting to look at, and by that I mean really boring to look at.\\n\\n\r\n      Music: [7 Enjoyable the Music]\\n\\n\r\n Finally something that was good! I loved the music in this anime, both the openings and endings. The opening, \"Absolute Soul\" was nothing very impressive by the looks, but it did well his job: it showed you the characters, the way they are and their relation with each other, and was the best animated part of the whole anime. I liked this OP so much that I sang the intro at the beginning of each episode, and I even have it in my anime songs folder. Then, the endings \"BelivexBelive\" and \"Apple Tea no Aji\" are also great, they show you a bit more of the two main girls in the harem and have cool songs and nice direction. The 'worst' song in the anime was the ED \"2/2\", and even though, it was a nice song to listen and okay to watch.\\n\\n\r\n     Enjoyment:  [3 Exciting as Grass]\\n\\n\r\n When the story appeared, it was really slow. When they tried to show character feelings, they were plain and clich\u00e9. When they did some actions scenes, the animation make them look stupid and boring. When they show the main villain, he was also boring. When they show the director, boring. But we are not here for story, right? This is just an Ecchi-Fanservise-Harem anime, so the main reason you would watch this anime is because you want to see some boobs, some buts, nice animations, OP characters and funny jokes so you could have a good time, but even there it fails. Why? Because the boring-as-hell story is there, blocking most of the reasons you could have to watch this show.\\n\\n\r\n     [Personal Opinion]\\n\\n\r\n If you made it this far in this review, I want to thanks you your taking some of your time to read this, it means so much for me! (\u3063\u25d5\u203f\u25d5)\u3063 Okay, let\u2019s go back to the anime. When I started watching \u2018Absolute Duo\u2019, I was with some friends and we wanted to mess around and watch a nice funny anime with great style and, of course, some fanservice for the gentlemen. We were unlucky enough to find this anime and see that the main girl was a white-haired loli, favorite kind of girl for a friend of mine, so we jumped straight into it. We laughed a lot with its incoherence and bad characters, but had a nice time. After that time, we could find any more time to reunite to watch the whole anime, so I had to end it myself, and then I noticed how bad it was. Still, some nice things about this can be said, especially thanks to the presence of Konomi Suzuki, my personal favorite OP singer, in the main song. So, you want my advice? If you are going to watch this, please do it with some close friend so you all could have at least some laughs at this.\\n",

The romance really grinded my gears here also. Miyoby pretty much professed her love for Torr and he outright rejected her, which sucked because I felt no romantic feelings between him and Julie, just a sibling relationship. I did enjoy Lilith's character though. They could have delved more into her relationship with the principal though. I feltlike so much of the story was still missing, which, I wouldn't be mad if they decided to do a season 2. It just felt incomplete. Overall, it was a good time waster of an anime.",

            "content": "My abridged review of Absolute Duo, an ecchi harem that is actually not half-bad.\r\nThe main character, T\u014dru, is a generally likable main protagonist, who is an example of the new harem trend where the main character is neither deathly afraid of female contact nor a lecherous pervert. With that said, T\u014dru is still a typical bland hero.\r\nJulie is a foreign girl with a very direct and non-aggressive attitude. Julie's backstory is equally tragic, and her general lack of shyness around T\u014dru is refreshing. My favorite aspect of T\u014dru and Julie's relationship is that, despite advances by nearly every female supporting character, T\u014dru is unwavering inhis oath of partnership (or rather dou-ship) to Julie. Also, unlike most other harems, T\u014dru and Julie actually need each other in the sense that they are both emotionally damaged characters. Unfortunately, all of this interesting subtext is pushed to the point of almost nonexistence in favor of fanservice, ecchi-ness, and a random bunny costume wearing teacher...\\n\\n\r\nNarratively, Absolute Duo is an Absolute mess (see what I did there?). Many episodes are disjointed and full of poor writing and plot holes. Conceptually, the story is more or less the same thing that we have seen time and time again with a high school for teenagers with magic powers.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the action sequences are a highlight of the series. Each character's Blaze offers a unique fighting style, and the action sequences rarely use CGI. A final mention should go to the opening sequence, which is one of the best of the winter season (you can watch it in the full post). The animation, editing, and choreography are stunning.\\n\\n\r\nWith above average action and surprisingly likable main characters, Absolute Duo could have been great if not plagued by the distracting tropes of the ecchi harem genre. With that said, for an ecchi harem, Absolute Duo is fairy entertaining, albeit nothing special.\\n\r\n_Watch if you like:_ Action, Harems, Ecchi\\n\r\n*-5.1/10*",

The pace of the anime was good and I found that although the anime was not particularly better than all the other anime I've watched, it was very enjoyable. This anime is slightly similar to Sword Art Online in the way that it has some harem things and fantasy elements. Compared to Sword Art Online, this anime had much more fanservice though. \r\nOne thing I did disapprove of was how short and compressed the anime was compared to the light novels. If you haven't readthe light novels, this anime will probably seem just right. However, for me, I got a little frustrated at times when things were cut or events changed. I don't want to go into detail here since some of you might not have read the light novels though.\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow, I overall still liked this anime and would recommend it to people who enjoyed Sword Art Online but would like or be fine with some more fanservice and ecchi-ish things.\\n",

Well, I went to public school, so I am going to assume the exam was similar to this anime. The similarities consist of beating the crap out of another student to complete the exam. \r\n   In Absolute Duo, there is a school called \u201cKoryo Academy High School.\u201d In this school, students have powers called a Blaze. A Blaze seems to be a weapon created by one\u2019s own soul. To get into the school as a student, the group of potential peoplehad to fight one another until they beat somebody with their Blaze.\\n\\n\r\n   The main character is \u201cThor Kokonoe\u201d and he appears to be an average guy. Hopefully, we all know by now that average characters are not so average. \u201cThor,\u201d other than being named after a Norse god, is considered to be an irregular. His irregularity stems from his Blaze. Every Blaze is supposed to be a weapon, but \u201cThor\u201d has a shield for a Blaze.\\n\\n\r\n   It is safe to assume that \u201cThor\u2019s\u201d fighting style is to use his shield to protect himself, and to punch everyone for his offense. I am also hoping that whenever he punches people that he will charge it like a Kamehameha, but yell \u201cTHOR\u2019S HAMMER!\u201d\\n\\n\r\n   Now, lets talk ecchi. If any person watches the OP, the ecchi light bulb should have lit up. There are six to seven distinguishable characters that should be sticking around to give us our fan service episode. In addition, \u201cThor\u201d has to live with a female student named \u201cJulie Sigtuna\u201d thanks to wonderful anime-only school rules, or Duo system.\\n\\n\r\n   I believe this wonderfully scaled simple to ridiculous anime will be a fun one to watch. There is fighting, over the top characters, ecchi, and hints on Absolute Duo being a revenge seeking based plot. I\u2019m a little nervous because I can\u2019t exactly see where the anime is going, but it looks like a fun ride, so I will continue watching Absolute Duo.\\n\\n\r\nOther Rating\\n\r\n\u2022\tAction 4/5 Fists\\n\r\n\u2022\tEcchi - AA\\n\\n",

Also, thankfully they chose unique personalities for the girls instead of the clicheharem themes (tsundere, etc.). \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was very modern (my kind of style). It was obvious that it was a relatively new anime at first sight. I think the highlight was the scenery for me, with the unique terrain they created.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: A harem, with unique girl supporting characters, and a main character who's weapon is used to protect people.

However, this is only slightly above average, and is still probably the best thing about this anime. While it has a certain charm to it and maintains a slight level of comedy, the characters and  plot fall short. The main cast is bland and predictable, and some characters only seem to have value as another member of the harem. The main character himself is terribly dry and has such a cliche mindset, and mindlessly acts to \"protecthis friends\". This is very predictable, repetitive, and makes me generally loath the character. Still, it was an entertaining story to witness. The characters would probably satisfy most ecchi/harem audiences despite the lack of actual character depth. Some minor characters do give this anime some life, but overall, the main cast falls short. \\n",

            "content": "Let me start off with that I do reviews more based on my enjoyment of the show and how much I got into it and things of that nature opposed to very technical aspects though i'll get into that a bit as well.\r\nI knew nothing about Duo other than about a two sentence description going in. Honestly the story is a bit weak. The general idea is pretty good but there alot of sort of oddness and things that don't get touched on. In other words some plot holes. I wasn't really in Duo for the story though.\r\nThe place where Duo shines I think arethe charries. As with alot of anime especially in this genre today I think are alot more character powered and centered than plot/story. Which is fine by me for the most part. There is nothing really special about any of them in terms of being something new or different. They can all fit different tropes but they are very likable and done well for the most part especially the female mc Julie. The male mc however is probably in my opinion the dullest/boring of the cast. The sound and music is pretty good and as with most new anime the art is good as well and my preferred style.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't a whole lot to say about this anime in terms of story and things of that nature it's what I would call just one of those guilt pleasure anime. Not a very good plot/story and nothing really special about it but still enjoyable. However one thing I liked that you don't see with alot of anime of this type was the little thing they threw in of having the male and female mcs be roomed together at the school for the entire anime. I have thought about this many times before in anime and wondered why they don't take advantage of the chances to do this considering how many more options and choices it gives them for different scenes and relationship building among other things. Seems every time the few times i've seen that they do it it's more the \"angry raging or oh you perv *slap*\" type girls and it's not really taken serious and is more there just to be a joke and cause corny humor. It was nice to see the male and female mcs be roomed the whole show and it be done more normal and less comedic. You see male and female charries and mcs roomed together alot in normal rooms or houses living together but not roomed alone together in a school/academy setting.\\n\\n\r\nOther than this not much to say really. If your looking for a deep intellectual masterpiece or great story then skip Duo. If your looking for a fun show with good charries,art,sound then give it a try. Overall I give it a 7 and probably should even be lower but I give it an 8 for enjoyment and that's what I like to go by :p.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Absolute Duo is another of those anime that aims to capture people with cute art, to make a good first impression but it then fails to deliver in the development of the cast, the story and in keeping quality in check.\r\nDespite being generic I could see some potential in the cast and in the story, it is a pity they failed to bring it together here. Starting the anime hinting to the ending, and then having a weak generic conclusion doesnt cames in favor.\r\nI mentionated I liked the designs for the female cast, I like them cute, and they were for the most part cute,Julie, Tomoe and Lilith definitly had some really enjoyable cute designs, so I really wanted to like the anime way more. The OP and ED were even decent, better than what I expected for your usual generic harem. Though it was weird to have that Torou going berserk scene on the OP, getting a bit of hype to it, and then nothing of that sorts does occur. \\n\r\nI cited quality check because despite its dullest moments, maratooning it provide to be fun to watch at diverse occasions, and there is where I see the potential it had, just to see it crushed with an extremely predictable moment soon after, yes I m expecting most anime to use a certain handfull of cliches and tropes, but this one does use more than your average! Some where enjoyable, most were okay, and some were \"really, are you seriously going that road?!\"\\n\\n\r\nThe characters felt very empty inside, Torou and Julie where the only ones with backstory to it, but its use was so bland and not impactfull, that not having it wouldnt had made any difference. One dimensional characters can be enjoyable but, these lack the deep needed to make me care for them just a little bit, so I never felt anything was really at stake or was emotionaly invested, \"the MC is full of wounds, so what?!\", that kinda of thing. The revenge theme is overused in anime, but well pulled out it can be something to look forward, but again its use here was just to conect Julie and Torou a bit more, and the overall execution failed, so it was more wasted potential, and again the anime hints to stuff that happened in the past but never ever explains it, I understand it was adapted from the LN, and it maybe like that in the LN, but you never get a resolution of these, you just know something happened, and get stucked it with, it felt like something you just paste to add to it, without any care. \\n\r\nIf this was a 2 cour anime, and the second half was to came later, and adapt more material that would be a nice way to built up the plot to something more meaningfull, but this is not the occasion.\\n\\n\r\nI still enjoyed it, but that is me, I manage to even like generic harem, if it doesnt suck too much, and has cute girls!!  The action could be better thought, but it wasnt like I was forcing myself to watch it just to finish the anime, if I had seen this while airing, I would possible had found it less enjoyable, but seeing it whenever you want makes some of its faults more easy to tolerate.\\n\\n\r\nSo it was a fine anime, it is nothing I would really reccomend to people with something to watch, or newcomers to the medium, but if you have some dead time and are bored, you will be way less bored watching the anime.\\n\r\nThere are alot generic harems outhere, but almost all of them I have enjoyed more than Absolute Duo, and this had hidden potential to reach to the quality of those others (which for themselves isnt such a great one, for starters).\\n\r\nIt was almost your good-to-watch average show, but it couldnt be more than a pleasant to-watch-and-conclude anime. Unremarkeable. But it is not like you get cancer watching it, just turn your brain a bit more than you do for the usual harem stuff.\\n\r\nSo overall 6.4.",

            "content": "This is the classic bate and switch. When I first saw the OP I was intrigued. Not that every great OP belongs to a  great series, but it made me want to watch more. I watched the first few episodes with excitement, finding myself excited every monday for a new episode. Then it all just started fading away. Episode after episode became boring and uninspired.  By the end, it became a chore I wasn't looking forward to anymore. I returned hoping it would redeem itself but I was just happy it was over by the final episode.\r\nStory:\r\nI don't really know what to sayabout the story, because I can't really remember what it was. You have your typical unique MC and his harem tag along to random fights. The purpose of the school and training is to find the \"absolute duo\". What exactly that is and why they seek it out are never fully answered. There is a main antagonist but he is forgettable. I guess I'll leave this section short because the quick summary is, students at a school training deal with random stuff. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI'll say again, the OP is awesome. Its music and animation are intense. The fights in it are fun to watch. When you get to the main piece though......it's decent. I can't really say anything bad about the animation. I like the character designs and the locations. The few fights throughout were well done. Often times, anime resorts to still images or flashes on screen to represent battles. Here they showed the fights pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAlways important in a anime is having interesting characters. I found these characters somewhat interesting. If they had put in more time and effort into developing each character they could had been really interesting. Then again you can say that about any character. \\n\\n\r\nTooru, the main character in this story is your typical character that has a unique power or ability in his school setting him apart. That isn't a bad thing, it's not the first or last time you will see that in anime. Due to a traumatic event in his past, he now wants to do all he can to protect the people around him. \\n\\n\r\nJulie, I don't know the proper term to describe her character. Silent, serious but very moe. I myself am getting tired of these types of rigid, quiet characters so I didn't find her too favorable. \\n\\n\r\nLilith on the other hand is a character I did enjoy. She has a unique weapon as well which sets her apart and she es feisty which I like as well. \\n\r\nMiyabi and Tomoe round up the rest of the main cast. I actually like them as well. Lack of character development just makes them unimportant though. Miyabi's character is better handled but like the entire anime, there could had been much more\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment on this anime started out strong. It then gradually decreased and finally went for a dive in the final episodes. \\n\\n\r\nDid I set my expectations too high? Perhaps I did, though I'd say it wasn't just me who did. I expected great team battles where each team worked in perfect sync with each other. I expected the visions of the past to have a larger impact on the story. By seasons end this was the bigger disappointment. It reminded me of and made me appreciate Akame ga Kill more. Its final half was mediocre as well, but at least it still has its impactful moments with good fights. This however just ended with a whimper. Unanswered questions, lack of a story and characters that go nowhere. I'm probably being too generous but I'll say its decent.",

I mean it started out with him forming a duo which was i guess suppose to be \"the girl\" for him but it turns out there are alot of those girls for him. So it turns into quite a harem from that point out. The concept is pretty cool in this anime tho. Granted they could of gone alot deeper into the whole plot and not as much of the lovey dovey stuff. The shield manifestation hehas is pretty good to what his personality is. All of the manifestations of the people in this show are quite on point with how their personality is. All in all if you watch this anime it will be your average harem kinds of things nothing to life changing about this anime.",

Hmm sounds cliche yes, but i recall high school i was friends with every female and they all at least liked me because I treated them like a human being not like an alien with sex organs. Nogirlfriend of course but I was very thick and naive.\\n\\n\r\nThis type of anime is something teenage boys should watch, to learn the basics. want people to like you? be likeable.  \\n\\n\r\nTHis is anime is likeable, its about as deep as a puddle from a three second sunshower, and as predictable as a ball, a steep incline and gravity.

The whole concept of Blazes as soul powers and Exceeds and Units and whatever doesn't quite make sense to me. But they try to explain it so it basically just depends on how much attention you're paying to Wikipedian speeches throughout the anime when you know you're sittingthere to watch some real ecchi scenes that's all.\\n\\n\r\nIf the concept was interesting, of course you would listen. But it's not. There's nothing special in fights. Swords. Rifle. Guns. Shield.

However it veered away from this and absolute duo became the stereotypical predictable harem/ecchi anime which lacked a good plot and good ending. \r\nArt (6/10):\r\nNot much to say here, the art itself was okay, nothing exceptional but it wasn't bad.\r\nSound (5/10): \r\nSound is basically the same story as the art, it was okay, nothing exceptional but it wasn't bad. Absolute Duo had 1 opening song and 3 different songs for the ending. \r\nCharacter (4/10):\r\nAt the beginningeach character especially the MC's had great potential to be interesting characters with hidden secrets and different pasts, which I assumed would be explored as the story and plot developed but this was not the case (it did explore to a certain degree) as the story itself was rushed there wasn't really enough time for each character to develop, so by the end of the last episode each character was the same as they were when they first appeared with just more power.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpecific genre overview:\\n\\n\r\nAs an ecchi/harem anime it wasn't anything special it was just the standard.\\n\\n\r\nAs and action anime it did okay it had its fair share of fight scenes, (with good fluidity) and power developments.\\n\\n\r\nAs a supernatural anime I thought it did quite poorly, mainly because of the story however... I say this because I think if the story had more chance to develop it could of been quite interesting, the concept behind the abilities of the characters (blazes) but as the story fell short so did the supernatural element of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nAs my expectations were high going into this anime, I was quite disappointed when I was watching it, however it wasn't completely terrible, and it had some redeeming qualities, that kept me watching till then end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nI had high hopes going into the anime so when it fell short it fell really short of my expectations. If your going to watch this anime I would lower your initial expectations, as the anime wasn't unbearable, but I would only watch this anime as pass time if there was nothing else you have to watch or other options.\\n\\n",

Sure, it was your kind of typical school setting with magical powers and such (*ahem* angel beats *ahem*), but I thought I could get over it. The twist making students fight each other got me too, admittedly. I didn't think it would be too bad.\r\nWrong.\r\nBeyond episode 2, everything just spirals into a pitfall. There was close to 0 character development, and the existing bit was overly-cliched. WAY over-cliched. And story? Don't get me started on story.Random plot jumps, overly-used tropes, there were holes just everywhere. You could feel the harem. The absolutely useless harem. Don't get me wrong, I think there are some good harem animes out there and it doesn't get a lot of credit. But the one in this show served no purpose and just tried to make the main character look better.\\n\\n\r\nSo an overall judgement is this: if you can get past the first 4 episodes without feeling too many issues, or you're just into harem and action scenes rather than story, feel free to watch. Otherwise, not reccomended.",

            "content": "Who wouldn't want to attend a school where all living expenses are paid, and they hand out credit cards for the students to use? Is that not enough to convince you? How about adding a few trips to tropical islands and luxurious cruises with a class full of bishoujo classmates? Ok... so there is a catch, you have to be injected with a mysterious serum and agree to train for battles with and against your classmates and teachers. Welcome to the world of Absolute Duo.\r\nOnce more, we find ourselves with a series where a male protagonist enters a school seeking power, only to be overwhelmedby a room full of already powerful girls. Absolute Duo feels very similar to oh so many action-centric harems such as Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance and Trinity Seven. The lightly-ecchi show centers around Tooru, a typical harem protagonist with some guts and a lot of spare niceness, who is tormented by a tragedy that he blames on his own weakness. He, as well as many other students, is able to harness the power of his soul through a means called blaze. The school is set up by the loli devil er... chairwoman for achieving \"absolute duo\", something that isn't terribly fleshed out in the school.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're into action-based harems know that this is one of the weaker ones. Some annoyances include a protagonist who is often just a meat shield, extremely generic antagonists, and weak character development. Not to say that the show doesn't have any redeemable value, but the show and its protagonist have low ratings here for a reason.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe show itself is well animated with vivid, saturated coloring and an overall modern look. Backgrounds are adequately detailed and some effects, such as falling sakura petals, are particularly well done. Character styling is fairly nice overall with a nicely rounded (no pun intended) group of heroines. Emotions are a bit stunted in this show, though perhaps a bit intentional as the main heroine isn't very expressive.\\n\\n\r\nThere is substantial action in this show, ranging from sword battles to ranged projectiles. Expect plenty of blood and some pretty serious wounds. That being said, I think that serum somehow impacts recoveries as well as people seem to recover as fast as the protagonist in Unbreakable Machine Doll does. The action is on par with that found in other action-based harems though CGI is grossly abused. The ecchi is rather on the light side. There are substantial amounts of boing and upskirts but clothing actually stays on mostly and the protagonist isn't an overt pervert. A lot of the ecchi material is due to misunderstandings caused by the primary heroine, Julie.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show starts with an energetic, action-centric light rock piece that fits despite not having much of a central melody. The EDs are much nicer in my opinion with lightly electronic touches and more palatable melodies, on top of being performed by the VAs. The BGM is present with a variety of tunes but not particularly memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe primary heroine VAs all haven't really had breakout roles, most have just done a lot of supporting roles. Haruka Yamazaki probably gets the standout award though her character by nature has a bit more of a distinguishable personality. Yui Horie makes an appearance, though limited to a supporting role. Overall, not bad but nothing particularly great either.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe show follows our protagonist Tooru as he learns to harness his blaze along with his foreigner duo partner, Julie, and their classmate friends. Our protagonist is unusual in that his blaze takes on the physical shape of a shield, rather than an offensive weapon, thus giving \"meat shield\" a whole new meaning. The gang is repeatedly challenged by the school as well as external antagonists who use Crysis-inspired suits rather than harnessing the \"power of the soul\".\\n\\n\r\nAbsolute Duo has a rather simple plot with very few branches. There are sub arcs that span various episodes and culminate in minor climaxes. Though moderately entertaining, the show suffers from an unambitious, shallow plot and poor explanation of the overall setting and its mechanics. It is apparent that this is a harem first and an action show second. Unfortunately, the harem aspect is likewise weak, as I'll get to next.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nSupposedly, this is one of the simpler harems, with only five-ish candidates vying for the protagonist. The protagonist, obviously dull when it comes to relationships, can barely fend off the girl's attempts for his attention. However, the show manages to undermine even this simple harem by forcing the Duo pairing system. Tooru is almost immediately paired with Julie (and apparently is the only cross-gender Duo in the class), and you pretty much can guess how that will affect the rest of the \"candidates.\" Don't expect much competition from the rest of the crew except for a few instances of horrifically bad plot exploiting a character's jealousy.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationships are very shallow and basically can be summarized by Tooru saving a girl who then joins the bandwagon. Despite their being other insignificant male characters in the show, our protagonist mysteriously gets all the attention. As for actual personalities, don't expect much from the show. Lilith is probably the strongest in that regard, and by strong I mean average for a show. Julie is emotionally stunted and is only marginally entertaining when she mispronounces things or accidentally says something that causes misunderstandings. The other girls just aren't even worth mentioning. Furthermore, the antagonists are as plain as can be, often spewing out generic nonsense with virtually no background or explanation of motives.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was the most disappointing aspect of the show. The cookie-cutter heroines lacked development and depth and no one was really relatable.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis is a generic action-based harem with a weak plot and even weaker characters and relationships. Absolute Duo is a shining achievement in how wrong a harem can get. The entertainment value is present but greatly diminished by the events in the show, and given how simplistic the plot is there isn't much re-watch value. I would absolutely avoid this unless you are a masochist and like watching painfully bad works.",

The backstories would lead you to believe there is going to be some amazing plot twists and move the characters forward, then it does nothing with them. I still have no clue what absolute duo is and the character interaction verbally, leaves a lot to be desired, its almost like a child wrote the lines. As for the plot....what plot? it seems whoever created it didn't know where they wanted to go and just made a side arc into the main storyline. There are few funny lines and okay battlesequences that are ruined by poor writing and dialogue and you are left with more questions than answers throughout the whole series. If you have nothing else to watch and want to be entertained, you can watch it but don't get your hopes up.",

            "content": "I might not be the only one, but... I still have no idea what this \"Absolute Duo\" thing is. For a show that repeatedly uses that tagline and dozens of exposition. One would imagine that I would know what the most important aspect of the anime is. However, Absolute Duo is absolutely garbage.\r\nI'm someone who is very keen on Romantic-Comedy, Battle-Harems because I grew up around the harem genre, and love how cliche it can be. Absolute Duo literally checks all the boxes: Beach Episode, Battling Girlfriends, Non-Dense MC, Mall Episode. There literally is nothing more that I could want, but the anime is horrendous.\r\nThestory takes place in an unknown universe where people get injected with various \"serums\" (?) chemicals (?)... I don't even know. Nevertheless, they gain superhuman capabilities to crystallize their soul into equipment called \"Blazes\". It's nearly as bad as Hundred's naming for various pieces of equipment.\\n\\n\r\nNothing really happens in this beyond the first couple of episodes. There is a bad guy that appears way too much after the 4 episode, and isn't given a proper backstory until he's unfortunately gutted. The story lacks any sort of build up or character motivations. The writers seem to have forgotten that motivations aren't only created through memories. The MCs get their melancholic, deeply rooted motivations from traumatizing events as a child. This would be a common vehicle to build motivations, but it doesn't work because IT'S ONLY A FLASHBACK. No explanations beyond what can be seen in the flashback because that would make too much sense.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the lack of storytelling, it severely degrades the characters and world-building (just kidding there is no world-building) within the show. Everything about the world and its people are just cookie-cutter afterthoughts. The only love and care that was put into this show was lillith, but that's only because she showed some fire and tenacity to try to acheive things that she wanted. She was reactive. She felt like a human being I could meet. Unfortunate that she wasn't given a lot of screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art are nothing to write home about either. The piano interludes while cutesy aren't special. It's the basic A-B-A movements that can be heard in every single anime created in the 2014-2016 of the same genre. It can be very repetitive and disheartening. The OPs and EDs aren't stellar either. The animation quality is interesting to say the least, but get old after the 2nd and 3rd watch. The only thing I cannot dismiss in this anime art-wise is K's character in the last episode of the show. That CG was mindblowingly horrific. It was only there for 6 seconds, but it looks like a clay monster that was painted with watercolors was in the frames. NOPE. Not good enough.\\n\\n\r\nAbsolute Duo is a shallow, mixed bag of emotions. Most of those emotions being quite negative. There really isn't much to say. It started off like almost every battle harem between 2012-2016, and it ended very poorly like many of them did as well. Shallow characters. Poor writing. Middling execution make for a show that is absolute garbage. SKIP please.",

            "content": "After having perused the generally negative reviews for this anime, I must conclude that I have very different tastes than everyone.  I've spent the last couple weeks watching a half dozen anime, all generally of the same genre, from Sekirei and Hagure Yuusha to Hundred and World Breaker.  I was so let down by them I had to go I and rewatch Campione! and Kaze no Stigma again to get their taste out of my mouth.  Blade Dance was the worst of the lot.  I stopped in the middle.  Having put too much faith in the other reviewers, I hadput off watching Absolutute Duo.  Never again!  This anime was good!  Yes, it's derivative.  But what it does do, it does well.  The terrible sex-humor that's so common in the harem genre, the stuff that normally makes me cringe and takes you out of the moment?  Made me laugh!  It was done well.  The main heroine isn't constantly complaining or beating up the protagonist.  Heck!  Was it the second or third episode when it became clear the Duo oath was essentially a wedding vow!  It's a sweet anime.  It has it's problems, and they tended to become worse as the series progressed, which is a shame.  But I do not understand the dismissiveness of the other reviewers.  There's a lot worse out there.  Like many anime, the ending was unsatisfying.\\n\\n\r\nIf you'd like a sweet action-harem, you should watch Absolute Duo.  I never skip the opening.  Though I didn't research it, I felt the character animations of the opening were done with someone who had done idol anime, and done very prettily.  I'm going to have to go check on the manga to compare.",

            "content": "Alright, time for another review. This time for Absolute Duo. Let's get right to it.\r\nArt/Animation- \r\nProbably the best thing about this show (which means alot, not in a good way), the art and animation were beautiful. Nothing realistic, just beautiful. If you pay close attention you will notice really good small details as well. Not to mention the animation for the opening is incredible. \r\nSound- \r\nI didn't notice much, and I don't really remember any of the soundtracks. Didn't notice anything bad nor good here. As for the Opening/Endings, I never really judge songs in my reviews, though I really liked them. There are 3endings, unfortunately none get the attention they deserve because of less attention to the animation. This is present in many shows.\\n\\n\r\nStory- \\n\r\nNow for the important but not so interesting part. The story is pretty normal. You won't find anything too interesting or original in it. It tried to make some things interesting and make you say \"I didn't expect that, wow!\", but ultimately failed. Most of the twists were not that surprising, some may even say they were not twists at all. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- \\n\r\nNot very different from the story, you have a completely normal cast of characters. A main character who is a bit different then others with his power (Thankfully he is not TOO overpowered), a kuudere deuteragonist who doesn't understand some things a \"normal person\" would, the shy girl who things she is a burden to everyone and the one who cheers her up and, how can I not mention the overused blonde haired, blue eyed transfer student who is not from Japan. Something pretty annoying as well is that a lot of the characters get changed all of a sudden when no real development happened. This is a small detail I noticed but it happens so often it's hard to ignore. The antagonists are pretty bad for the most part as well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall/Personal Opinion- \\n\r\nThere is not much here honestly. The good things which are above average are balanced by the bad things which are below average for a 5/10, Absolute Balance. It doesn't lie to you and you can understand that pretty quickly, so I can safely say you can start watching it and decide for yourself if you want to continue or not. I would understand a 4/10 or even a 6/10, but I know most people would dislike the lack of originality for the most part, which is very noticable if you have watched even 1 anime show. \\n",

            "content": "Summary: This anime is a jack of all trades master of none. It is an ecchi but has little to no nudity. It is a fighting anime set in a school setting but it doesn't do a single thing that is exceptional... this is your typical guy white nights main loli girl. On top of that add in the \"I want revenge but realize later that it makes me like the enemies so I become merciful\" toss in a deep and ominous underpinning that is never resolved and sprinkle in a bit of harem but not really because MC only loves his Duo partner andyou're almost there. Of course you need an ominous council of people whose purpose is never explained, a teacher who seems evil but turns out to be good in the end, a girl who loves MC and has her love go unrequited so she becomes evil, for a minute. I almost forgot new girl to school who is OP as hell but then somehow gets bested by the MC and becomes weak and useless later in the story... guess she didn't \"level up with maximum friendship\" like MC and his Duo partner. Last but not least you have the \"love conquers all\" and the \"things go back to normal\" ending. All in all this is painfully average. I will add that the girls are cute, the art is done well and the music is exceptional. The intro credits are one of the best I've seen in an anime, the song and dance number is excellent. \\n\\n\r\nQuestions you'll still have: \\n\r\nWonder who the person MC is trying to get revenge on? Doesn't matter you'll never know.\\n\r\nWant to know what an Absolute Duo is... nope, no chance of that.\\n\r\nCurious why the scientist guy called the headmaster a Doll? Me too... oh well.\\n\r\nWonder what ever happened to the second school? Who knows!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all... if you're looking for a mediocre anime with some interesting concepts look no further. My suggestion... watch the intro and outro of the show and get the OST and keep on moving.",

Again I want to reinstate that this is my opinion and you may not agree.\r\nReview:\r\nAt first the show was real surprise they went away from the cliche of the MC being some huge badass that can take everyone down if they decided to try. But as I continue to watch some of the things the MC does pissed me off. And the fact that the MC can't hold his own in some of the fights irritated me. But eventually everything kinda worked outand got it's groove back but then we get to know even more about the other side characters and man, have I never disliked side characters than some of these characers. It's not even that I disliked them but they are full of typical cliches that you would think we could get by. Granite this was released in 2012 so some of these ecchi, haremish cliches were awesome but still they didn't feel needed. All in all this was an average harem anime but as an anime itself it felt mediocre. Now after reading my review I want to say one more time this is my opinion so have at it if you wish.",

It wasn't bad by any means, but if all it's good ideas are done better somewhere else, is that much better?\r\nStory:3\r\nThe story is a copy paste of the formula we have seen in many action/ecchi settings, although the very beginning gave me hope it might be more. To be honest, I don't have high hopes for the stories of these types of shows (although a few have actually been really good), but even for that absolute duo feels uninspired. Similar to a story written by someone who loves the genre, but has no ideasthemselves. \\n\\n\r\nArt:6\\n\r\nThe animation is ok. Nothing bad about it, but nothing stood out. Besides in this genre only two things matter in the art. Ecchi and fight scenes. The ecchi shots have been done before and better. There is nothing really interesting about it. The fight scenes are pretty, but poorly choreographed. \\n\\n\r\nSound:5\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were much the same style as anything that came before this show. The voice acting wasn't bad for the most part. You can't fault the seiyu for poorly written dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:5\\n\r\nI was really torn by this, because there are two characters I really liked, one of whom is almost original. But then the watered down, bland, rip-offs of other characters really put out any affection I had for the other two.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:4\\n\r\nAs I stated earlier, the show isn't bad. However, when nothing is really good about it, you tend to pick up on the little annoyances. I never thought \"I should stop watching this.\" but I did think \"why am I watching this?\" If you don't think about it, or just love the genre, it may be a lot of fun. But for me it was just mind-numbing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:5\\n\r\nThe show is exactly like this review: repetitive, unoriginal, boring, and long winded without saying anything.",

If they had spent more time focusing on what Absolute Duo is, it might have been a little better. Most of the characters seemed like they were just thrown in for kicks. They also should have focused more on the backstory of the school and why absolute duo is necessaryin the first place.",

Don't be fooled though. The show gets worse and worse with every episode. The only thing this anime did well was the art. The story is just so boring. The characters are so boring. The fanservice is not worth it at all. The music is nothing special. It really feels like this anime jumped on the ecchi train with no real ideas. In the end, it's so hard to say anything good about this. Just please passon this one.",

This is my first ever review post, because this anime offended me so much with how boring it was that I just had to write something. I could predict everything that was going to happen. It's so formulaic that it hurts me. The \"surprise twist\" at the end is what we pretty much knew since episode one, while things we actually want to know are never revealed. None of my questions were answered. I found myself to be both disappointed and dissatisfiedwith it. For a slightly more interesting anime with basically the same premise, look at Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, it at least has a better opening theme than this one.",

            "content": "Absolute Duo, or as I like to call it, \u201cabsolutely generic\u201d, is just that, average incarnate. While not quite the worst of the worst, it\u2019s just as far from being the best of the best, putting itself directly in the middle. This series is more like a product, but under the guise of art. It takes no chances, does the bare minimum needed to make a profit, appealing to those who prefer quantity over quality. Every aspect of this series feels average, from the characters all the way to the plot and more. \r\nAs you know, Absolute Duo follows our \u201chero\u201d, Tooru Kokonoe, a highschool student attending generic magic academy, a school for those who use a weapon that materializes from their soul, which is called a blazer. The reason he\u2019s attending is to make it easier on the writer, I mean, to strengthen his abilities, that way he can take revenge for the generic sad backstory deaths of his sister and friends. He\u2019s not like everyone else though, I mean, why else would he be the protagonist? Instead of getting a weapon, his blazer comes in the form of a shield, making him an irregular. He also has a special move, but again, he\u2019s the protagonist. The only reason you\u2019ll know he\u2019s important is because he\u2019s the main character, rather than making him interesting enough to care on your own. Also, in the series, two characters partner up in hopes of reaching absolute duo, but his partner ends up being a girl, because how else would there be any romance that goes nowhere?\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of 12 episodes, the plot was never really fleshed out too well, but that\u2019s because they want you to read the source material, as the show isn\u2019t an ideal way to experience it. This isn\u2019t anything new though, it\u2019s something too many series do nowadays. Obviously, an anime doesn\u2019t need to follow the source material exactly to be good, but when you put in only enough effort to make it not bad, yet not good either, what\u2019s the point? \\n\\n\r\nEven though Tooru is the character you\u2019re with the most, he\u2019s no more memorable than the other characters. They\u2019re essentially vessels for their stereotypical personality traits, so they\u2019re not that interesting. When it comes to the fight scenes, or lack thereof, they aren\u2019t at all memorable either. The character designs? Generic. There\u2019s also some scenes with CGI, which of course, doesn\u2019t look too good either.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does this series do nothing new, but, to me, it\u2019s simply repeating things we\u2019ve already seen over and over. This fact makes it feel more like a clone, rather than a new experience. It\u2019s as if, when they were making this series, all they did was check off boxes on the list of anime stereotypes, just to ensure it would appeal to enough people.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who takes time to watch this series will eventually forget they ever watched it, but if they do happen to remember it somehow, they\u2019ll just mistake it for another series. Absolute Duo does nothing to separate itself from similar shows, so it doesn\u2019t have much of an identity of its own. The impact this anime will have is so minuscule, that it might as well not even exist. After watching it, I ended up feeling absolutely nothing, as if nothing happened. There was 4 hours of content, but none of it really mattered to me. The only thing this series did was make my completed list go up by one, but that\u2019s it\u2019s only accomplishment.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I honestly could\u2019ve made this review about a multitude of series, but I just happened to choose this one. It\u2019s sad that there\u2019s so many mediocre titles out there to choose from, but there\u2019ll always be people out there who just accept it as well. As with all series similar to Absolute Duo, most likely the only reason this was created was to sell a product, whether it be the light novel, the manga or the DVD\u2019s, while doing the least possible to make sure it\u2019ll make a profit. It\u2019s as if a computer following an algorithm made this series, putting little to no passion or emotion into it. If those who worked on this series seem like they didn\u2019t care, why should they expect those who watch it to care either? All this series amounts to is just another run-of-the-mill, middle-of-the-road light novel adaptation and it\u2019ll soon fade away from your mind, as if it was never even there to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAlso, did anybody notice that the plot of this series and Chivalry of a Failed Knight are the same? They both involve weapons that materialize from their souls, they both take place at a special school, they both call their weapons blazers, both main characters have something different about them than the rest, both main characters meet a girl who\u2019s very powerful, both girls are foreign, both girls are princesses, I mean, what? They even came out in the same year.\\n\\n\r\nChivalry of a Failed Knight: \u201cCan I copy your homework?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAbsolute Duo: \u201cSure, just change it up a little so nobody notices\u201d",

            "content": "This series can be summed up in one word: mediocore.  From the very beginning you get the feeling that this won't be more than a 3 and a half star show at best, but it really falls apart.  Almost every character fits neatly into the standard tropes and the show never tries to grow them in a different direction.\r\nThis is a school combat anime that gets more ecchi as the show goes on.  Every man enjoys a little fan service, but it shouldn't take you out of the story.  The story itself shows signs of becoming interesting, but it never becomescompelling.  This is partially due to poor explanation of the world and organizations, as well as shoddy character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe show consistently does one of the things I hate the most, in depth talking while fighting.  Talking before a fight, or a mid fight break to reveal something is fine, but too often it's a conversation while they are attacking.  Further, there is plenty of \"you forgot to look behind you\" or \"too late!\" stuff.  By this I mean the characters give away their attack by talking before actually attacking, but the show maintains things as if it was a surprise.  The fghters have super speed and yet a sentence before an attack isn't enough time for their opponent to make an adjustment?\\n\\n\r\nThere is no reason that anyone should watch this show.",
