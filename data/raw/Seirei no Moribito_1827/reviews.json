            "content": "Seriei no Moribito (or Guardian of the Sacred Spirit), is not your normal anime. It began life as the first in the ten volume Moribito series of fantasy novel written by Uehashi Nahoko, and although these novels were intended for children, they gained many adult fans. In fact, the novels proved to be so popular that they the first volume was adapted into a manga, an anime (directed by Kamiyama Kenji, who directed Ghost in the Shell SAC and 2nd Gig), and even a radio drama. The novel is also scheduled for release in english in mid 2008 because of the immense popularity of theanime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\\n\r\nSeirei no Moribito has some of the smoothest and most fluid animation of any anime produced over the last few years. Production I.G. managed to produce one of the best looking anime of 2007, and with it, managed to introduce one of the most unique and interesting female leads in anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe colour palette is very \"Ghibli-esque\" as it mainly uses greens, browns, blues, etc, but Production I.G. has made good use of them for the characters and environements, and the overall effect gives the show a feeling more reminiscent of \"Monoke Hime\" or \"Gedo Senki\" than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are exceptional throughout the show, most especially the main and immediate supporting characters. Balsa is exceptionally well designed, and far more realistic than many other fantasy female leads. Her character is fairly muscular and stocky, yet without the extremely toned muscles shown in most other fantasies. Facially too, the designers went for realism more than anything else. Balsa is not beautiful, but not ugly either. She's plain (in a sense), and is most definitely a woman, not a girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are also designed very much with realism in mind, and this actually helps to pull the viewer into the show in a big way. It's also nice to see that attention was paid to the animals in the show as well, and it makes a nice change to see a horse in anime that actually looks like a real horse.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that should be mentioned here is the design influences. Many people relate thise series to China and Japan because of the very obvious visual references to those countries (i.e. the palace, the emperor, the ninjas, etc), however this is really only a small part of the whole. In truth, Seirei no Moribito isn't simply based on China and Japan, but is actually based on the greater Indo-Chinese region. This is reflected in the differing facial structures, customs, practices, etc, that are seen in the show. Balsa and Jiguro are originally from Kanbal, a country that shows a number of elements of Northern India/ Kashmir, Nepal and Tibet. This influence also extends to Balsa and Jiguro's fighting style, which is very different to that of the stories other combatants. The backgounds, still scenes, the rural settings, even the mountainous regions and jungles, are very clearly based on a region of South-East Asia stretching from India to Japan,  and it's a rarity to find this kind of scope or depth of detail in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality throughout the show never really lets up, and the action sequences are especially impressive. The fights are swift and well executed, and the movements of the combatants is especially impressive during the action scenes. Production I.G. have also paid attention to the different combat styles used in the show as well, and have managed to include these in the animation, which gives the fights a far more \"authentic\" feel.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nEach episode opens with a very nice, and rather catchy, J-rock/pop ballad called \"Shine\", which was performed by L'Arc-en-Ciel but never released as a single. The rest of the music in the show (composed by the famous Kawai Kenji), adds to the atmosphere and overall feel of the show. The dramatic moments, fights, and even the slow-paced scenes are all emphasized with some great background music.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are exceptional in this show, especially as this is more of a \"historical\" fantasy. The background noises, the grunts, clucks, whinnies, and other noises of the various animals, the clash of steel on steel, etc, breathe life into the series, and makes the setting that much more \"real\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that the star of the show is Balsa, the spear wielding warrior woman, and Balsa, as a character, is one of the strongest and most unique female leads in any anime. She is muscular and stocky, possess many skills (not the least of which is her formidable fighting ability), has a strong sense of right and wrong, is very rarely indecisive, and is sensible in many ways. As I've said earlier, Balsa is no beauty, and this again sets her apart from many other female leads, as the designers generally try to make lead women in anime \"attractive\" to male audiences.\\n\\n\r\nChagum, on the other hand, is exactly how you would expect a young prince to be, but without the arrogance (which makes a nice change). What makes this series really work though, is the attention to character development that both Balsa and Chagum receive, and how, as each of them develops, their relationship with each other changes. \\n\\n\r\nThere are several other characters who appear throughout the series (Tanda, Touya, Saya, Jiguro, etc), all of whom receive a certain amount of development because of their association with Balsa. The nice thing about the development of the supporting characters is that it is often directly linked to the development of either Balsa or Chagum, or both in some cases. This is most especially true in the case of Jiguro, who was Balsa's guardian and mentor as a child, and is the one who taught her how to fight with a spear. The various references and flashbacks to this character slowly begin to make sense as the series progresses, and with this clarity it is possible to understand Balsa's character even more.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a downside to the characters though, in that there are other characters who receive little to no development. In addition to that, the characters who do receive development rarely get it continuously. Strangely enough though, this does very little to impact on the story or the viewers enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe story is actually a nice role reversal of the typical \"rescue the princess\" scenario and, although it's meant to be a serious fantasy action drama, there are some genuinely humourous moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe story flows at a nice steady pace throughout the series, and although it does slow down from time to time, these are effectively the times when the majority of the character development happens. The premise was good on the whole, and although the story at times seems more like stock fantasy, there are enough differences, as well as some great character development, sound and animation, to make watching this a worthwhile experience.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a light-hearted series, but it also doesn't become overly dramatic. It doesn't focus so much on action that it gives up areas of the story, and it never lets the story become so bland that you get bored of watching. It's an interesting show to watch and the pacing of the show, as well as the slow delve into Balsa's past, serve to ensure that you keep watching. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the plot may be simplistic at times, this isn't really a show that suffers from it, especially as the show itself is more character driven than anything else. The main focus of the show, from beginning to end, are the characters. This is emphasized by the fact that the action and drama clearly take second place to each of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd recommend this show to any Ghibli fan, and also to anyone who like shows like Claymore, Slayers, or even Rurouni Kenshin or Sword of the Stranger. It's an extremely enjoyable example of how good a fantasy series can get if you do it right, and because of it's characters, it will appeal to fans of many different genres.",

            "content": "Seirei no Moribito was one of those rare anime that I commenced with an unshakeable sense of anticipation and with high expectations. I can never resist the urge to assume a show will be spectacular based on the staff or studio involved, even if my hopes have all-too-often been crushed (as was the case with Darker than Black). So, when I heard that Kenji Kamiyama, who is largely responsible for some of the finer creative inputs for both seasons of Gits SAC, was going to be heading this show with Production I.G, it instantly became my single most anticipated series of the year. By thetime the trailer came along I was well and truly brimming with excitement. However, the show that I got was both different to what I had hoped, and also not as memorable or entertaining. On some levels, the show is a resounding achievement, and there are moments dispersed throughout when it reaches remarkable heights of excitement, emotion and splendour. Yet, when looked at as a whole, the show has failings that can not be ignored; most notably, flaws in the pacing and the build-up of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe element of Seirei no Moribito that most screams for attention is its stunning production, and here is where my faith in Kamiyama is affirmed. The entire series has maintained an unprecedented quality of art and animation. It has the look and feel of a (good) movie, with a sweeping cinematic mode of directing that befits the stories&rsquo; expansive fantasy world, and stunningly realised landscapes that bring the show to life. More so than in any other anime I can recall, the background art in Seirei no Moribito left a profound impression on me - this could well be the finest example of background art in anime, not just for its level of detail, but for the way it is used to enhance the atmosphere of the show and draw the viewer in to its vibrant and striking settings. On top of this, the cel animation, while it could quite easily have been blessed with a higher level of detail to match its surroundings, is amazingly fluid and vital when it needs to be. The use of cel-shaded CG has been popularised among IG&rsquo;s producers it seems, and it&rsquo;s generally put to good use in Seirei, to animate hordes of extras in scenes such as in the towns, or when the palace assembles its army. This means that these scenes are bought to life in a way that would otherwise not be possible with a tv anime budget, successfully avoiding the common anime trap of either having a surprising absence of people in the background, or have large crowds of people inexplicably still. Unfortunately, it sticks out a bit too much on a number of occasions, providing a nagging distraction.\\n\\n\r\nI think this show&rsquo;s production also excels in a way that people generally don&rsquo;t give credit for, and that is the expertise with which it is directed - Kenji Kamiyama&rsquo;s style of directing is a subtle yet effective one. Unlike the in-your-face stylistic shots of Akiyuki Shinbo&rsquo;s work (Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, Tsukuyomi MoonPhase, Petite Cossette), Kamiyama has presented this series in a conventional yet fresh manner. The fight sequences, particularly those in the third episode, exemplify this, where the use of camera angles serves to make the fight more engaging while not drawing from the choreography. The wide and distant shots used in and around the palace are excellent at creating its cold, detached atmosphere, and the overall choice of shots is amazingly good at highlighting the show&rsquo;s beautiful scenery. As he did with his directing work on Gits SAC, Kamiyama has created a visually captivating series.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was a surprising achievement from the veteran, Kenji Kawai, whose scores I generally find bland and uninspired. I&rsquo;m not sure why this anime marked such a great deviation from his usual standards, but the music in Seirei no Moribito is a really crucial contributor to its dramatic impact - from the urgent and threatening battle theme, to the quiet and hauntingly evocative tracks, the music delivers in every respect. I&rsquo;m shocked to say that his work here was more compelling than much of Yoko Kanno&rsquo;s recent work, and he wasn&rsquo;t even creating music with real instruments. Fitting with the visual style of the show, the score music is very much produced in a traditional cinematic way, which does this show justice.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the show&rsquo;s content fails to live up to its gloss, and I think this is mainly a failure of the pacing of the script rather than of the story itself (which comes from a novel series). The bare plot is an accomplished exploration of life and adulthood, and of the connection between humanity and nature. It is set in a fantasy world, but at its core it depicts a very down-to-earth, human ordeal. Fortunately, the intricacies and depth to the characters and their relationships is well incorporated into the show - the connection formed between Balsa and Chagum gives the show most of its emotional weight. The other thing that I found to be well written is the development of Chagum himself, as he is torn from his palace life and forced to experience life and shoulder responsibility. It is satisfying to see him grow as a person as the show progresses. Perhaps the egg inside of him is a parallel to his rearing into adulthood. The problem lies in the amount of time the show takes to achieve this development, and in the unsatisfying climax.\\n\\n\r\nMy appreciation of a good story stems from its sense of direction toward a climax that brings together all of the crucial plot threads from throughout the show and culminates them in a burst of excitement of drama that pays off the time the viewer has spent watching it develop. Instead, the big event that the show had supposedly been leading up to was a rushed affair with a surprising lack of tension or emotional potency. The show did not have any filler per se, but by the time the conclusion was wrapped up I felt that a lot of the show&rsquo;s time was poorly spent on redundant subtleties of its character development. The trailer gave a very different impression to what was delivered. Balsa and Chagum living together was nice a pleasant affair, but it lacked a sense of tension or danger that ultimately dragged down the middle of the show. The exploration of Balsa&rsquo;s character was far too spontaneous and vague for my liking. I did get a strong sense of her character from her actions throughout the show, but I really think she had a lot more potential and that we were never given the kind of insight into her that was frequently hinted at.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show left me feeling unsatisfied, like being left hungry after a serving of fine food. The show is of undeniable quality; however the writers behind it failed to capitalise on its full potential, through sloppy pacing that made its stand-out moments seem like a tease, and through its inability to deliver a conclusion that sends off the show at its peak. I recommend this show to anyone with an ounce of patience, as the subtle development of the characters and their companionship is ultimately its most rewarding component. I think this show also succeeds in its fantasy elements - its portrayal of two intersecting worlds is fascinating. Don&rsquo;t go into this series expecting non-stop, heart-pounding action, because it&rsquo;s a laidback show about the endearing strength of the human spirit with only intermittent bursts of excitement.\\n",

            "content": "My favourite anime of 2007.  I decided to check this out solely on Production I.G's involvement, those nice guys behind one of the best anime in the world: Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex.\r\nThe animation for this show was superb all the way through, which is nice for a TV anime.  Each episode looked gorgeous, so I liked the consistency.  The unique alternate fantasy setting and protagonist of this series were a nice departure from anime convention.\r\nThe main character is a wandering thirty year old spear-wielding woman who bodyguards people for a living.  She basically ends up as a guardianof a prince who's possessed by a water spirit.  His father, the emperor, orders his death to save the land from a drought, and thus the being-on-the-run-from-awesome-assassins template begins.\\n\\n\r\nThe assassins are awesome in this case simply because they get time to develop as characters.  Not as much as the main characters, but still depicted as a cohesive unit of honourable and professional men, as opposed to remaining faceless goons who obey orders like automatons.  Balsa is usually one step ahead of them but they're hot on her heels for most of the anime and this is due to their skill and cunning, not stupid errors on Balsa's behalf.\\n\\n\r\nThis characterization extends to the land most of the story is set in, so you are actually concerned about the impending doom, as opposed to many other generic anime where you really couldn't care less.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is laden with feeling.  Episode 17 for example has one of the most touching moments I've ever seen in anime, its a very brief sequence but it really put a lump in my throat.  But what follows is even more emotional, with Balsa's back story and the inevitable climax...there are really amazing moments spread out through the story, where in any other anime they would be mishandled, but in this production they hit all the right beats.  I was teary eyed many a time I'm not ashamed to admit.\\n\\n\r\nSeirei no Moribito has a very well written story, great direction and fantastic fight scenes, while bravely eschewing most anime narrative clich&eacute;s as best as it can for 26 episodes.  It does this because its adapted from a fantasy novel, and I hope they adapt the rest of the books in the series.\\n\\n\r\nIts a testament to everyone involved in this production, from the writer to the animators, that a story can be so epic and yet not even have a typical antagonist.  In fact it wouldnt be too far off to say that we dont really see a villain in Seirei no Moribito.  Yet the conflict and drama is monumental, which makes it all the more remarkable.  Sure there are characters you wouldnt want to have tea with, but the anime steers clear of generic cliches, there's no black and white good versus bad plot, no easy resolution to everyone's troubles.\\n\\n\r\nSeirei no Moribito charts a rites of passage, a life-altering journey, the symbiotic relationship between man and nature.  The characters struggle, they run and ultimately have to face their destiny head on.  It's inspiring.  Why?  Because the anime never talks down to the viewer, because it retains its dignity, it doesnt follow the trends of today, it sticks to the source material as best as it can.\\n\\n\r\nThe only bad thing I can say about this show is that the beginning credits sequence is bland and the song is too, but then I don't like L'arc-en-ciel at all. The short sequence halfway through each episode signalling an advert break is very cool though, it slowly charts the birth of the water spirit.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like the medium of anime at all, you must watch this.  If you're looking for tons of action, you'll be disappointed because this has a story to tell, and it will tell it in its own pace designed to develop characters, and yet it still has some of the best action scenes I've ever seen in my life.  If you have any taste at all, you'll enjoy this masterful example of Production I.G's contribution to anime.",

            "content": "Seirei no Moribito is a Fantasy, Action, Adventure about the journey faced by a female warrior and prince and their growing platonic relationship. It is undeniably a great series offering a well-written adventurous experience however this isn&rsquo;t as action-packed or spectacular as some may hope to be.\r\nThe story follows a female warrior (Balsa) who has been hired to protect the Prince of Yogo (Chagum), whose life is in constant danger. The main story is nicely crafted in the first 6 episodes, where a lot of developments occur and some back story is given on the characters. From then on the pacing of the story changesdramatically, as it moves onto slow character building and plot filling. Sure there are some fairly pointless or dull episodes but they all have a purpose in the progression of the storyline. Later on, when the foundations the for the ending has been laid and everything has been explained, the series reaches it&rsquo;s climax and is able to bring things to a reasonable ending that many anime series fail to do. \\n\\n\r\nThe series has a satisfying batch of important characters that cannot be simply described as people on the side of good or evil, but rather be described as people on the polar opposites of society that are striving for what they believe in. Balsa and Chagum are the central roles, which the story revolves around and both of them develop equally well throughout their adventure. Balsa, a sort of affectionate Lara Croft (Tomb Raider), is one that will leave a huge impression on you even after finishing. The rest of the characters aren&rsquo;t as well developed but they all bring something to the story and their voice actors do a good job on them as well.\\n\\n\r\nWith Production I.G. behind the making of this series you&rsquo;d know to expect great things in the animation &amp; sound department. The visuals are splendid; with lush greenery environments, incredibly detailed buildings and well implemented CG effects. The character designs are also very realistic and the characters themselves move so fluidly.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sounds, due to the historical setting this anime utilizes a variety of ambient sounds perfectly and the SFX are great as well. The music is also impressive and exciting to listen to when there&rsquo;s some action, and not to forget the adorable, traditional insert song later on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this adventure anime managed to fulfill its purpose in creating a fantasy world for us to observe its characters experience it. Certainly this is an experience I greatly enjoyed and even with a few dull moments, here and there, I was pretty satisfied with what I got. Sadly once the journey is over and the series ended it does leave one with; to some extent feeling empty inside, after the anti-climatic ending. Nevertheless that shouldn&rsquo;t deter anyone from watching this superb fantasy adventure.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "\"If you are in a position to act, it would be a sin not to, even if you had nothing to gain from doing so.\"\r\nHere we have a Production IG fantasy series, directed and written by Kenji Kamiyama, who has previously worked on Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, which just so happens to be possibly my favorite anime series ever, and all of it based on a successful novel series. All of that already sounds hella promising. Here\u2019s my review explaining why I think this series is good stuff and deserves more recognition.  \r\nStory: \r\nSeirei no Moribito is the story of Balsa,bodyguard, skilled spear-fighter and total dreamboat, who is tasked by a Queen with the protection of her son prince Chagum who has a dangerous supernatural entity living inside of him and is being pursued by the assassins of his own father, the king, or the Mikado in this case. All of this is set in the fantasy land of faux-Asia, which is close enough to the real world to be vaguely familiar, but just different enough to be its own interesting fantasy land. \\n\r\nThis initial set-up serves as the first act of the story, which has us following Balsa as she outmaneuvers the king\u2019s forces both by using her wits and her incredible fighting ability. All of this is fairly exciting with satisfying amounts of action and is an excellent introduction to Balsa and the large cast of side-characters. \\n\r\nAfter this cat-and-mouse game, the pacing of the show slows down considerably in the second act and the entire series switches into an almost slice-of-life fantasy series with a semi-episodic presentation, which are used to further develop Chagum\u2019s character, his relationship with Balsa and her allies and some world-building. It is this switch in pacing between the two acts that may come across as jarring to some viewers. Personally, I was surprised by it, but it didn't bother me a lot. Even with a lack of action, it\u2019s still very much worth watching and seeing the characters grow and live together. \\n\r\nOnce the series closes into its finale it all moves along a bit faster and the scale grows more epic again. Overall, the story behind Moribito might not be the most original one and the switches in pacing may throw off some, but I still found it to be executed quite well. It takes it\u2019s time to properly develop the main cast, has some interesting twists along the line, is exciting when it needs to be and hell, it even manages to make flashbacks interesting.\\n\\n\r\nWorld building:\\n\r\nI have a special little boner in my heart for some good, detailed world building and Moribito delivers in that regard, which is why I will make this short section to comment on it. \\n\r\nMoribito has its own version of everything from funeral ceremonies, regional superstitions over smaller gadgets, mechanisms and weapons to wildlife. There is a lot of attention to detail here, but the thing that really makes it shine is the completely seamless and natural integration into the series. The world in Seirei no Moribito really feels coherent, alive and like it\u2019s been around long before the main plot of the series started.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOkay, let me first heap some praise on Balsa, who is exactly the type of female main characters I\u2019d like to see more often in my chinese cartoons. She competent, confident, intelligent, mature and I totally don\u2019t have a crush on her. She\u2019s also 29 years old at the beginning of the series. If any of you reading this know more anime with close-to-30 female leads, feel free to recommend them to me. You may keep all the lolis, moeblobs and tsunderes. Seriously though, the best thing about Balsa is how, despite the fact that she always has a plan for everything and is a capable enough spear fighter to hold her own against four elite soldiers, she never comes across as mary-sue-ish.  This is a very delicate balance to hold for a main character, yet this series makes it look effortless. Aside from being excellent at her job as badass bodyguard, Balsa also has a softer side, which is evident by her interactions with Chagum and other allies. As the series progresses she becomes more and more of a mother figure to Chagum. \\n\r\nChagum himself deserves a lot of praise for being a child character amongst a mostly adult cast, who despite his age and status never comes across as annoying or spoiled. The prince is intelligent, polite and willing to learn about the ways of the common people, despite being holed up in a palace for his entire life prior to the events of the series. The entire series I was expecting him to do something stupid or act spoiled and it never happened. So congratulations Seirei no Moribito, you managed to make me like a child character. Both Balsa and Chagum are the focus of the series and are developed extremely well. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s the secondary cast that could\u2019ve used a bit more time in the limelight. While absolutely no one in the shows sizable cast is completely unlikable, which is an impressive feat in and of itself, I wouldn't have minded for the side characters to get some more attention, but that\u2019s only a minor gripe in an otherwise fantastic show. \\n\r\nAlso notable is how this series doesn't seem to have a clear villain, the antagonists are mostly just misguided or misinformed. Even the supernatural ones aren't evil so much as they are simply following their nature. A surprising amount of conflict in the series gets resolved by characters simply talking to each other and explaining their situation rather than through fighting, which is certainly a breath of fresh air and a mature way to resolve conflict (don\u2019t worry, there are still cool fights in there). \\n\r\nOh yeah, special shout-out to the character Torogai, who is one badass old granny that doesn't take shit from anyone.  Welp, I guess this series made me like a granny character too, so there you go. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nAll you really need to know about Seirei no Moribito\u2019s visuals is that it\u2019s Production IG at its best. Kenji Kamiyama\u2019s signature realistic artstyle is one I really enjoy, the backgrounds are stunningly beautiful, the color palette is vibrant and it\u2019s all held together by good cinematography. \\n\r\nA special mention goes to the fight scenes, which are almost movie budget-smooth and have incredibly satisfying to watch choreography. Also, all the outfits the characters wear are really well-designed without being overblown or unrealistic. I especially like the ones worn by the hunters which initially pursue Balsa and Chagum. \\n\r\nAs for negative aspects of the visuals, there is the cg, which admittedly is still better justified/used more tastefully than in most more recent shows. It\u2019s occasionally utilized to animate part of a crowd and in those cases it\u2019s barely noticeable, but towards the very end of the series they use cg to animate a certain group of monsters and it doesn't look great unfortunately. It\u2019s particularly bothersome cause the monsters are actually hand-drawn in other scenes and look great there. \\n\r\nOverall however, the show has excellent visuals, and aside from the occasional cg, is about as good as an anime show can look with a tv budget. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nMan, composer Kenji Kawai really outdid himself with this soundtrack. And that guy is already a well-known, incredibly competent composer, so that\u2019s saying something. The background music does such an excellent job of enhancing every scene, no matter if it needs to be sad and emotional, creepy or fast paced for an action scene. It\u2019s tasteful and fits perfectly and that\u2019s all a good soundtrack needs to be. In fact, I\u2019m listening to it as I\u2019m writing this review and probably will for a while after I\u2019m done. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s a shame the Op and Ed can\u2019t live up to this. The opening is a rather cheesy pop/rock song, which L'Arc-en-Ciel fans will undoubtedly enjoy, but simply isn\u2019t my thing nor do I think it fits the series very well. The ending is better, but not remarkable either. \\n\r\nAs for the voice acting everyone on the cast does a good job bringing their characters to life, especially Balsa\u2019s voice actor, who has a nice deep female voice that fits the character perfectly. \\n\r\nOf special note is the fact that Chagum was actually voiced by a young boy, instead of a woman, as is usually the case for young male characters in anime. This lends some really nice authenticity to the character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nSeirei no Moribito is an excellent series with only a couple of minor shortcomings, which thankfully don\u2019t sour the experience much at all. \\n\r\nIf you want a classy, good fantasy anime that has all the feel of an old historical saga and you don\u2019t mind a bit of slower pacing, then please do yourself a favor and give this often overlooked series a watch. \\n\\n\r\nAs usual, thank you for taking the time to read this review, please excuse any grammatical mistakes as English is not my first language and please feel free to leave me some feedback, as I want to improve. \\n",

            "content": "They say 95% of all anime is complete and utter shit, with the remaining five representing those titles even relatively good. And among that 5%, Seirei no Moribito belongs into whatever number of shows it is which are not just relatively, but genuinely good.\r\nSeirei no Moribito is a fantasy adventure story which mostly focuses on the characters of Balsa and Chagum, a prince of a powerful Empire whose forced to exile due to the continued assassination attempts on him conducted by his own father, and their journey together. Those who prefer complex storylines with intricate twists and turns may look elsewhere; the travels of Balsaand Chagum, their struggle to dispel the pursuit sent after them, and how they deal with the water spirit's egg that's laid within Chagum are indeed the plot's most prominent elements.\\n\\n\r\nNot to say the story's simplicity is a shortcoming, quite the contrary in fact. It is for once pleasing to see a storyline you can actually understand at first glance instead of having to take guesses or be completely lost in the mock artistry of the show's creators. Not to say simplicity would be the story's main attraction either, for the careful and thorough way Balsa's and Chagum's life together on the run is depicted, Chagum's transformation from a sweet and pampered prince to a smart street kid, and how the relationships between the main characters develop and deepen is plenty to keep the viewer entertained.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are another of the show's strong points, especially, with the way how they seem to shatter almost almost all of the major clich\u00e9s and all. Balsa is without a doubt one of the strongest female characters in anime of all time, she being pretty much the most capable warrior in the whole show and able to handle everything short of magic on her own. To top it off, she's noble-minded (yet not naive) and lack's arrogance (yet not confidence). Perhaps, by putting all of this together, one might notice themselves watching also one of the most shameless mary sues as of late, but amidst Balsa's pure coolness, one is also easily bound not to care.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this saying almost not a word about Chagum, the boy prince of Yogo Empire who's forced to flee his home with Balsa. He carries the water spirit's egg that's said to keep the lands from drying over within him, but unlike almost all the other young male characters in anime shouldered with a heavy burden, he's not constantly whining about his fate. In fact most of the time he deals with his lot, of leaving behind his comfy life as a prince and carrying a capricious spirit egg within him with easy enough acceptance and even enthusiasm.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters deviating from the norm are Tanda, a doctor who's actually the one to tend to the reckless female warrior's wounds instead of the other way around, and the prophets at the Imperial Court who, although proud, aren't arrogant and conservative enough not to learn from their mistakes nor ignore good advice.\\n\\n\r\nProduction I.G, a quality anime studio responsible for such acclaimed titles as the Ghost in the Shell movies and TV-serieses, makes sure that the art and animation in Seirei no Moribito earn their place among the other aspects that make this show so great. Even the most intense battle scenes flow fluently, the beautiful sceneries clearly depict a world untouched any industrial revolution, and the character designs are as much a treat to the eye as any of the aforementioned.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite being a show remarkable in it's quality, Seirei no Moribito does leave a few lingering regrets in its wake. A fantasy show as this is, we could've learned a bit more about those elements in this one. We hear of \"star diviners\", of other worlds that seemingly exist paraller to that which is mostly shown in the series, we see some magic, and so on. But all in all the fantasy elements in Seirei leave me more confused than fascinated, for all the supernatural stuff is either explained too briefly or not at all. A bit deeper thoroughness in this department would've been in order.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point of some chagrin in Seirei no Moribito is what I'd like to call beating around the bush with the characters' relationships. From the early episodes on we see that there's something going on between Balsa the fighter and Tanda the healer, with the two being childhood friends of opposite sex and all. The romantic tint in their relationship is obvious, yet _NOTHING_ concrete happens between the two in the show. An honest, full blown romance between them could've done much in the way of bringing some good extra drama and maturity to the show, for the platonic nature of their relationship despite the obvious hint at a love story-setting gave the series an ever so slightly childish look at times. Later in the show Chagum also becomes friendly with a girl his age in a village just happening to be on the path of his and Balsa's (and Tanda's) journey, and the crazy shipper in me says they shouldda hooked up as well ;P.\\n\\n\r\nThough not necessarily much of a gripe, since anime music failing to impress me is more of a rule rather than the exception, a bit more ambitious musical investment from the creators wouldn't have hurt the show either.\\n\\n\r\nPutting side to side the good and the bad, the end conclusion is what I've (hopefully) let you readers understand throughout the review; that this is one damn great of a show worth chalking up to your to watch-list no matter what genre of anime you'd usually prefer. Because even though an action-adventure-fantasy wouldn't sound like the killer combo just for you, Seirei no Moribito holds such a cast of characters and story to it that it is sure to reach the hearts of many viewers regardless of their usual appetite.",

            "content": "\u2018Seirei no Moribito\u2019 (\u2018Moribito, for short) is a very polarizing series. Many praise it for its stellar production values, great atmosphere and layered, believable characters. Others find the show relentlessly boring and slow-paced, disparagingly referring to it as \u2018Boribito\u2019.\r\nI believe the truth is somewhere in the middle.\r\nThe basic story is the typical tale of a seasoned warrior seeking to atone for a checkered past by protecting a child who\u2019s being hunted by powerful forces both human and inhuman. Moribito\u2019s narrative, however, manages to distinguish itself through 2 things: excellent character development and meticulous world-building.\r\n Protagonist Balsa in particular is a great example of the former.Her strong, dignified personality, captivating backstory (subtly alluded to initially) and multi-faceted interactions with other characters make her one of the most well written anime protagonists around. The hunted child in question, Prince Chagum, doesn\u2019t fare quite as well. He goes through a fairly predictable character arc that boils down to learning to live like a commoner and growing up. There\u2019s also a handful of moments where he displays unusually keen insight that feel rather forced. Though it must be said that the conclusion to his story has a surprising turn that\u2019s both surprising and very poignant. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as supporting characters go the biggest standout is Tanda, Balsa\u2019s dogged love interest whose difficulty reaching out to her makes for an interesting if pitiable character. Others aren\u2019t quite so interesting: there\u2019s 2 kids who hero-worship her who mainly serve to run errands for Balsa and provide some humorous moments as well as an old lady who\u2019s mainly there to provide exposition and snide remarks. The latter sticks out like a sore thumb by feeling like an archetype in a series filled with fully fleshed out characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I really do mean that last part, even a good deal of antagonists are developed and given (somewhat) sympathetic motives rather than being raving psychotics who can\u2019t go 2 minutes without strangling a puppy. Moribito\u2019s willingness to avert this easy, manipulative sort of characterization is yet another strength of its storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, not all of its storytelling is as stellar. While the series also goes to great lengths to expand on its world, it also becomes a weakness. Many a times the series devotes an entire episode to fleshing out one particular section of Moribito\u2019s world. And while it certainly helps to make the series\u2019 world feel more alive one can\u2019t help but feel that a more deft storyteller could reduce the content to a subplot without losing any relevance or impact. As it is Moribito has a stretch of episodes in the middle that have very little to do with the conflict that kicked off the story which, when combined with the glacial pacing, makes for a somewhat frustrating viewing experience at times.\\n\\n\r\nAnother fault with the storytelling that it contains a number of contrivances and other moments that feel all too convenient for the main characters. This is particularly jarring in regards to Balsa, whose vow to never again take another life should be rather cumbersome when being hunted by highly skilled assassins. In the series, however, it is mostly a slight inconvenience. There\u2019s an episode around the halfway point that takes it to its most absurd extreme, ending what should have been a grave no-win situation in a big copout. Moribito certainly isn\u2019t the only series to be guilty of such things nor is it the worst example but it\u2019s jarring nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals and audio of this series has been the subject of much praise, and for good reason. The animation, from characters doing chores to the lightning fast action sequences, is consistently stunning and the amount of detail is simply staggering. This is easily one of the best-looking TV-anime ever produced and a worthy part of Production I.G.\u2019s legacy in that regard. In terms of character designs Moribito opts for a more realistic style which perfectly fits the serious tone. The audio is of similar quality. Sound effects are believable and the music always does a good job complementing what\u2019s happening on-screen even if it\u2019s not very memorable in and of itself. The astounding presentation manages to make even the slowest episodes more enjoyable than they have any right to be.  \\n\\n\r\nMoribito is, without a doubt, a very ambitious project. It boldly stands out stylistically and in a narrative sense. Providing multi-faceted, believable characters and captivating situations all set in a gorgeously rendered word. It also deserved accolades for refusing to use its female protagonist for fanservice-oriented jokes which would only undermine her character. There\u2019s a maturity to the way the overall product presents and carries itself that most anime series wouldn\u2019t even consider. All of this makes \u2018Seirei no Moribito\u2019 a series that, in spite of some missteps, is worth checking out by anyone open to a more serious style of anime.\\n",

            "content": "That's right, for my first review I gave all tens. Actually, I belive that it's the best way to show you that this review is worth nothing, but this time I just couldn't help it.\r\nSeirei no Moribito. It's been a year since this anime raced through the world, and now I can see exactly why it did so.\r\nBut, let's get to the point.\r\nStory - 10\r\nSeirei no Moribito is fantasy down to the core. You'll find warriors and assasins, shamans and herbalists, emperors and diviners, two worlds overlaping themselves, is there anything more you need? Even if, you'll find it here. \r\nThe story is very wellpaced. It starts slowly, but comes unstoppable to the point where these slow episodes disappears in blink of an eye. It's well thought, and I didn't find even one unnesesary filler episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nYou definitely need to get used to it. I mean, after the first episode my eyes hurt from the number of details and amazing backgrounds. For heaven's sake, this anime has real grass, not green smudges, and skies i would spent my life looking for, mountains and forests, all brought to perfection. Even if heroes are in a cave, walls behind them looks the best it possibly could. If you still don't get what I mean, just watch the opening, and imagine that it's not only for show, that this art style continues and is getting better. The animation is smooth, and the CG that appears rarely is well-rounded.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are fitting the story and the overall feel of this series. Not too fast and not too slow, just like they should be in this case. In fact, they alone would not make me give a ten, but together with background music they plays up the mood in outstanding way. It's well matched, can calm you down or make you sit on the edge of the chair, I found myself completly mesmerized by it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nAnd here comes the biggest suprise, at least for me. I was expecting nothing much, especially after seeing some of the newest fantasy series in which you can tell when the hero level-up. Characters in Seirei no Moribito are almost alive, they speak and act according to their own character that slightly changes along the way, but it absolutely don't mean that they turn predictible. They develops in their own way, especially Shuga and Chagum, but the rest of them are not left behind. The seiyuu are matching the characters and doing amazingly well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWhy did I enjoyed it so much? This question seemed absurd to me, but after giving it some consideration I just don't know what to say. I don't know if I should talk about the feast for your eyes, the feast for your ears or the feast for your mind. I just know that it was pure joy for me, and I belive it's the effect of combining all this parts together.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nYou know, I'm not good at maths, but this one is evident even for me.\\n\r\nSo, what more can I say? If you enjoy fantasy, or if you enjoy beautiful art, or if you just enjoy well-made series in both visuals and the story, try it out. I hope you won't be dissapointed with this one, and find it as enjoyable as I did.",

( And I have watcheda lot of anime) \\n\\n\r\n Production I.G one of the KINGS of high budget animation along side with 'BONES' and 'MADHOUSE', did an absolutely amazing job with the execution of fight scenes, background art, interaction between animated objects ( i.e, reflections on water, light from fire, shadows etc;) .\\n\\n\r\nThe overall flow in art-style( background scenery) within the series compliments and enhances the impact of the plot ESPECIALLY since this anime emphasises metaphysical existences ----( the title is guardian of the spirit/seirei no moribito ---- go figure). \\n\\n\r\nArt- Animation>> 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: This area within the entire series was definitely the weakest, not saying it was   \\n\r\n          bad BUT in comparison to every other aspect it didn't really stand a chance. \\n\r\n          Essentially --- Balsa (the main female protagonist of the series)   \\n\r\n          protects chagum from assassination until the conundrum with the water spirit is \\n\r\n          dealt with.\\n\\n\r\n          It definitely sounds like an easily predictable and saturated mix, however the  \\n\r\n          truth could not be further. This series presents the viewer with emotional-ties (  \\n\r\n          i.e Platonic love ) , moral and ethical dilemmas, social structures within the era \\n\r\n          and plot twists ( somewhat predictable).\\n\\n\r\n          Story: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing much to say.   10/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: In this series you are introduced with a vast diversity of personalities, notable characters that stand out are BY FAR the main protagonist 'Balsa' and the Prince himself . Balsa, a spear-master whom seeks the unquenchable thirst for redemption due to the sins SHE burdened herself with due to self- guilt of her past life and interaction with a certain person. \\n\\n\r\nThis character is what you want from a female protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nPrince Chagum also undergoes an evolutionary process adapting to a non-prince life and eventually falls to the guilt of being useless and eventually coughs up the courage to ask Balsa to teach him how to defend himself. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nThis series is A MUST WATCH to anyone who's a fan of.... good quality media. It's unfortunate that this series is so fucking underrated BUT that's life for ya.  \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion it's an insult to the amount of effort the animation staff put into this series by not watching it. \\n\\n\r\nSO EVEN IF you don't like the genre, you should at least watch it for the jaw dropping animation. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 9/10 must watch.       \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Title: Seirei no Moribito\r\nNovel, Anime: Seirei no Moribito is adapted from the first volume of the ten-volume Guardian series of the same name, and was written by Nahoko Uehashi and released in Japan in July of 1996.  Scholastic has translated it as Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit and released the translated novel in June of 2008.  The translation of the novel was honored with the Batchelder Award for outstanding translated work at the 2008 midwinter conference of the American Library Association.\r\nSeirei no Moribito is a twenty-six episode anime directed by Kenji Kamiyama (who also directed everything in the Ghost in the Shell: StandAlone Complex series, including the TV show, OAV, and movies) and produced by Production IG (known for their work on the Ghost in the Shell series and xxxHOLIC).  Moribito aired on Japanese TV from April 7th to September 29th of 2007.  It was originally licensed almost immediately after the production announcement by Geneon, who soon after went defunct.  The license was picked up by Media Blasters, and was translated as Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit, with the third volume due to be released on February 24th of this year.  It also aired on Adult Swim in a fairly convoluted run, starting in the 12:30 AM (central time) slot starting on August 24th of 2008, but was then switched to the 4:30 AM (central time) slot in early September, with the first ten episodes being aired twice before being pulled from the schedule on January 16th of this year.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Balsa, a spear-wielding wandering female bodyguard, is passing through the New Yogo Empire, and happens to save the second prince, Chagum, from drowning in the river.  As she is saving him, she notices a bright blue light surrounding them both.  That night, in the middle of the night, she is called to the palace by the Second Empress, who wishes for her to flee with and protect the life of Chagum, who the Emperor, his father, believes is possessed by a water demon that threatens to destroy the Empire, and is determined to kill at all costs.  Balsa, who works as a bodyguard to atone for a past sin, agrees, and takes Chagum and flees.  However, all is not what it seems...\\n\\n\r\nProbably the most interesting thing about this show is the characters themselves.  None of the characters are simply good or evil, even those who would pursue and kill Chagum; they're all fleshed out as human beings, with reasons behind their decisions.  What's even more interesting is that when these characters make their decisions, they actually make sense, and are even smart, given the situation, which is something that is lacking among most main characters of anime these days.  Take Balsa, for instance; none of her actions or decisions are superfluous or over the top or done to point out the fact that she is a woman and a bodyguard - she simply does her job, nothing more, nothing less.  It's wonderful to see a female character of this sort.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also an incredibly well-built world. Various aspects of how the empire runs, culture, history, different ethnic groups, religion, city and country life, just about everything that could be thought of is fleshed over the course of this series.  The level of detail in general is amazingly intricate, and it's here that it's very evident that the source material for this show was originally a novel.\\n\\n\r\nSeirei no Moribito is one of the most solid stories I've seen of this type in a good long time.  It has one of the most common threads of sci-fi and fantasy anime at the core of its story - protect the special child! - but the way that it actually executes the plot is well done.  And, by my standards, I should really like this series.  \\n\\n\r\nBut, here's the thing.  I assumed, from the first episode on, that Seirei no Moribito would be a show of high standards; when it lived up to that, I wasn't that surprised.  To some degree, though, I hoped that it would go beyond my expectations for it.  And it didn't, which is probably why I'm not all that into this show.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's a solid series with good plot, characters and a well-built world, yes, it just leaves me with a meh feeling.  It probably works better as a novel, honestly.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for this series is extremely high-quality.  Backgrounds are intricately detailed, animation is well-done, and character designs aren't incongruous with who the characters actually are - Balsa looks like she's a bodyguard, Chagum looks like a prince in hiding, etc.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, where this series really shines is in the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThink of any animated action series you might've watched recently, or one you know really well, doesn't even have to be anime.  Keep that series in your head, and go and look up Moribito fight scenes on YouTube.  You will notice the differences instantly.  There is no skimping on the details, or shortcuts; every moment of the fight is animated, from beginning to end.  This series is probably going the standard on which I base all fight scenes on; there's no excuse for other shows not being able to get this level of detail in their fights.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The music was very unobtrusive for the most part; I really only noticed it if it was going out of its way to be heard.  There's a folk song towards the end of the series that ends up becoming integral to the resolution of the plot, and is a nice little song that I'll go out of my way to listen to here and there.  The OP (done by L'Arc en Ciel) and ED (done by Chagum's VA) are nothing too special. Overall, decent music, but nothing outstanding or anything.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: There aren't any names I really know from any other productions in this series, but overall, the seiyuu do a wonderful job.\\n\\n\r\nLength: I never felt that this series was too long or too short, in the end.  It might've had more impact on me if it had been shortened by a few episodes, but, at the same time, we wouldn't have gotten information that we did otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall, this is a solid series with good plot and characters, a well-built world, beautiful art, and wonderfully done fight scenes, but, in the end, it doesn't leave you with anything more than a \"meh\" feeling.  Maybe try looking at the novel instead?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 8/10\\n\r\nLength: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n[b]Overall[/b]: 40/50; 80% (B-)",

From the first episode I have greatly admired Balsa, a woman with determination and skills. And unlike most women in anime, she is not 16, nor teacher. \r\nEven if the story is simple by itself, the anime tells it well and every episode (I've seen till 19) is interesting and the story progresses well. No fillers, no unnecessary stuff, but still no feeling of haste, rather the pace is telling is really well thought. Every episode reveals new facts to the plot, develops the characters and their relationships. \r\nNot only Balsa,but also other characters are interesting, and add well to the tale. There is not really bad and good guys, just people with different opinions or different knowledge on matters, they are acting from different, understandable reasons. So it's easy to see why someone is doing something.\\n\r\nThe elements of fantasy and history are woven well together, the voice acting, music and animation are all enjoyable. Also the balance between action and talking works well for me.This is one of the best anime series I've watched.",

The major flaws of this anime are the characters and their lack of progression. The main character is a woman whom serves no purpose other than to be a bodyguard for a prince and the prince as young as he is, never matures despite all the hardships they are forced up against. The problem is none of the characters act outside their roles which leads to a dull, predictable series of episodes. This show is largely plot driven, and the tool they use to progress theplot is pathetic. What they use is readings from an ancient scroll text that someone magically is able to translate just enough to advance the plot. Sorry, but this show was amateurish in its characterization development and plot advancement. The show and excellent audio and visual presentation with average voice acting, but other than that i consider this show a major flop.",

            "content": "Scoring Preconditions: While I rate all parts, the overall score takes in most consideration from story, character, and enjoyment. Art and sound are not factors in the overall, although they can slightly enhance or detract from enjoyment portion. I score from as unbiased a view as possible and I view it in a critical sense, not in a simple enjoyment sense. Thus I give at most a one point overall bonus for enjoyment. Story and characters matter most. I will state if exceptions to this rule depending on the anime.\r\nSummary: From my knowledge, this isn't a well known anime. The only reason I found thiswas while looking through the top anime list and found it way back. But I consider this to be one of the most underrated anime I've ever seen. Details to follow.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10): The story started kind of slow and really picked up steam about half way through. I think the best part of this story was the originality. It was way cool having a female protecting the male. Second, the intricacies of the plot were well worth the score. The way characters were forced into change was really great. I also liked how they weaved two worlds together. Perhaps the only problems I had were the slow start and questions on how Jiguro had anything to do with Chagum. But the story was well worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): The art is in a similar mold to Claymore. It's a different style that you could say makes it look more realistic. I didn't have a problem with it. Enhanced the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): Opening theme and closing theme were both great to hear. Background music enhanced the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10): First of all, I thought Balsa was a great main character. She fights well, makes intelligent decisions, and as time went on gained a very nice maternal instinct. I think the whole save eight lives part got muddled in the plot, but she was a good character with nice development all the same. Chagum also had some nice development as well. Start off as a bratty prince and learn to actually live life. While it may not be the first time I've seen it, the development from prince to outcast was well done. As for the herbologist, I kind of lost the point in his character. The half romance/unrequited love with Balsa was unnecessary and really only served to distract from the main plot. Other side characters played their part. No comments on them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): Perfect marks here starts off with the second half of the anime. The plot really took off and I enjoyed the ride all the way. Providing closure to the story also gained good marks from me. Beyond that, the fight scenes weren't drawn out unnecessarily and were good. Also the use of spears gained bonus points here. It was a nice change from swords or guns. Finally, perfect marks come because I simply like Balsa as a character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10): I saw a couple flaws that don't make it a perfect 10, but this was really well worth watching. The plot isn't Code Geass intricate, but it was enthralling all the same. If for nothing else, watching Balsa and Chagum grow as characters together really made it worth my while.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this. I'm open for discussion so if you have anything to add, message me and I will get back to you.",

            "content": "\"Seirei no Moribito\" is a beautiful anime, that introduces an amazing world that is full of life and adventure. It is a blend of amazing art and animation with great story telling. If you would like to experience a new world with a nice story then you should definitely give this anime a chance.\r\nStory\r\nBefore I started to watch the anime, I had very low expectations. I was expecting a cliche a story with decent characters, however, that wasn't the case. What seemed like a cliche story at first glace turned into a new adventure. From the point I started watching, I was eager to knowwhat would happen next and with each episode my thirst to learn more about the setting and the story grew.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, the pace of the story was fast and than slowed down in the middle to get us more into the setting and character development. Skipping these episodes would hurt the experience. For people who would rather go on with the story and don't care about the setting and the character build up, they don't contain anything critical but I wouldn't skip over them and I'm glad I didn't. I was able to learn more about the characters and the growing bond between them.\\n\\n\r\nTen or so episodes before the end, the pace picks up again, slowing down only in 2 or so episodes. I believe the pacing was perfect, not rushed and no snail. In the end, everything was wrapped up very well. Many times I have been disappointed by the way animes end but this time I wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art is amazing. I have never seen such detail and life in anime before other than Ghost In The Shell. Everything had detail, the people, the grass, the trees, the buildings, the animals and so on.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is even better. The movements, speaking and all is good. \\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are just intense. Even though there isn't a lot of fighting compared to other action animes, when they are shown, they are quite a treat. The moves must have been carefully choreographed because I've only seen such detail in Jackie Chan and Jet Lii movies which involve real people. There are no invisible slashes and there are no &quot;I'm gone, you can't see me.&quot; moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters aren't what I expected at all. I couldn't predict most of the character's actions or thoughts. At first, I thought that the characters were going to be cliche and have the same old feeling but no. They are totally different than most anime characters, specially Balsa and Chagum.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, of course there are some of the usual characters. The funny granny for one but she is still one of the best characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI deeply enjoyed this anime. I liked ever part of it. The story, the art and the characters. Everything was balanced and well served.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 10/10.",

            "content": "This was honestly one of the dullest anime's I've ever seen.\r\nDespite an awesome setup and a lot of potential, the series failed to amaze me at every turn, mainly because of it's dull and generic cast of characters. Despite having a wide array of characters, none of them really stood out to me, and made me care about what happens to them. The only exception is the grumpy old lady Madame Torogai, who was the ONLY character in the entire show who made me care in the slightest about the story.\r\nAlthough the main character Balsa isn't really such a BAD character, she is by nomeans a good one either, as she doesn't stand out at all from the \"overly serious badass woman\" stereotype. Aside from Balsa, her love interest Tanda has to be the dullest character to ever appear in an anime, with little to no personality whatsoever. The worst of the bunch though, is the crybaby prince Chagum, who seems to spend 90% of the show whining and acting like a spoiled little shit, which is only made worse by the fact that is voice actor, Naoto Adachi, does a terrible job portraying him. Not that Chagum has any redeeming qualities to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself isn't much better. without spoiling the plot (not that it really matters), the story is weird, yet unimaginative, long, yet simple, and more than anything, it's boring. Yes, this series is so very boring that it will feel like a chore to watch it. This is not at all helped by the standard animation, and extremely poor 3D effects. The 3D effects are so bad they look like something out of an 80's cartoon more than a modern anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite all that I've said, I still don't consider Moribito a BAD anime, as much as a boring one. The series isn't even remotely funny, even when it tries to be, it's characters are amongst the dullest and unimaginative i've ever seen in an anime, and the story isn't interesting or original enough to be engaging. However, the series does manage to stay realistic throughout it's course. Sure, there is some magic and spirits and whatnot, but as far as the world itself goes, it always keeps it's feet on the ground and doesn't lose focus. If you want an anime that really catches the style of ancient Japan without all the fanservice, and overly dramatic anime fights you see in most anime today, then you MAY be able to enjoy Moribito. However, this is really all that the series has to offer, so if that's not enough (it certainly wasn't for me), I would steer clear of Moribito.",

It's the overall story, terrific animation, and strong character designs, that make Seirei an interesting anime.\r\nWith a fictional, historical setting, the story takes place in a time when Emperors rule the people, and mythical beings rule the lands.Through a twist of faith, Balsa -the protagonist - is approached to protect the life of a young prince whose life is in danger. Nothing new right? That's true. However, the reason for the young prince's fate is not because of a struggle for the throne as we see quite often, and it is not because he is hated...it is actually quite the opposite. And at first, the job, though one with many obstacles in sight, seems fairly simple enough...but it later becomes quite complex as Balsa and her crew learn that the Emperor is not the only one after the boy's life. I won't go into any more details and ruin it, but will say that storyline is fascinating.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is Outstanding. It is sharp, colorful, detailed where it needs to be, and a pleasure to watch. There is always better out there, but for this series I truly believe it was more than sufficient. I especially liked the creator's different sketches of Balsa that is shown at the start of each episode, as it gives a glimpse of  his work &quot;in progress&quot;.\\n\r\nMy absolute FAVORITE thing, is the way the fights are drawn and animated. It's nothing short of awesome. The combat moves, spear and sword manipulations, and other maneuvers, are VERY FAST, but...you can see every single movement. Every single one. There is no blur, and no &quot;what the hell just happened&quot; moments that usually spring up when you can't visually follow along, Everything is seen in detail, as fast as it does go by, and it really pulled me in. There are so many shows out there, that should take a page from this.\\n\r\nLoved it!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe music is  good. I am not particularly fond of the opening song as it just sounds like 99.9% screaming. There are not that many varying scores within, and you probably won't walk away humming anything, but those heard are very fitting and suitable.\\n\\n\r\nThe Character design and development is Great.\\n\r\nBalsa is not your typical beautiful heroine who just happens to be talented with a spear. She's strong, and she looks it. In all honesty, there is nothing very special about her personality or attitude, but she still carries the story well.\\n\r\nMy interest lies in the other supporting actors, such as Shuga - the young star diviner who owns a look that is not typical for white haired anime guys. He is an intriguing character to watch out for as a guy who pushes himself to do his best, despite his position.\\n\r\nThen there are the emperors assassins who surprised me with their unique talents and characteristics. It's not often that these type of characters are usually shown to be more than &quot;muscle&quot;. It was good to see how unique they each were, despite not being main characters.\\n\r\nThen there is Touya with his bucked teeth, the Shaman who is a bottle of sake away from being a true alcoholic, Sagum the older prince who you WILL NOT be able to dislike, and many more.\\n\r\nTheir designs are all nicely created, and together they &quot;do good&quot;\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series immensely. Don't pick it up if you're only hungry for fighting scenes, nor expect it to be very deep with twists at ever turn...because it's not like that. It's just a nice series to kick back and relax to, where the few fights are pretty intense, and there is a great deal of emphasis on how characters interact and associate with each other.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]:\r\nBalsa (Shindo, Naomi), a spear-wielding woman who has taken it upon herself to save 8 lives in an act of atonement, is tasked by the Emperor\u2019s wife to save her son Chagum (Adachi, Naoto) who is suspected to have been possessed by a water spirit out of legend. As the story unfolds, we learn more about the potentially catastrophic implications of the water spirit as well as Balsa\u2019s past and her motivations for helping the young prince.\r\n[Characters]:\r\nSeirei no Moribibito is very much a character-story.The story takes place in a vast and complicated world however because of howthe tale is told and how each episode progresses it becomes pretty clear that the show cares first and foremost about its characters.\\n\\n\r\nBalsa is probably the most recognizable character of the show \u2013 she is thirty years of age and as warrior who has mastered the art of the spear, is fairly muscular and stocky. Both these traits are somewhat uncommon in anime for women and so I think Balsa\u2019s design speaks a good deal to the intent of the show \u2013 it approaches the story realistically despite the supernatural elements of the show such as the water spirit and characters like Torogai. Balsa herself is pragmatic and a fierce warrior in combat; she gets along well with Chagum and their relationship develops and becomes more intricate as they spend more time with one another.\\n\\n\r\nChagum, the young prince Balsa spirits away from the Emperor\u2019s hunters a the desperate request of his mother, is where a lot of developmental time is spent from episode to episode. As he is a child born of privilege the first hurdle he must overcome is introduction to the common life and like many other coming of age stories (and I believe Moribito to be one of these stories in Chagum\u2019s case) he develops from there. A quick note about Chagum \u2013 most stories would start with a snobby, entitled prince who is at odds with his predicament and complains incessantly (which can be a turn off to a viewer) however Chagum is actually quite kind and takes to each situation as it comes. He has plenty of room for growth within the story but he does not start at so low a point to annoy everyone via his archetype.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are interesting enough, the most notable of which are Tanda (Tsujitani, Kouji) and Torogai (Mayama, Ako). Tanda  has some history with Balsa and their relationship is quite realistically written while Torogai is an elderly shaman possessing supernatural abilities and serves as the mouthpiece of the story in order to explain and introduce the more magical elements of the show. Lastly is Shuga (Nojima, Hirofumi) who serves at the Emperor\u2019s palace as a star diviner (in a way, a parallel to Torogai). He is an interesting character and acts as our eyes at the palace so that we can have context for the events that unfold independent of Balsa and Chagam.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is quite good in Moribito and despite its length of 26 episodes there is no marked drop in quality at any point. Production I.G. went all out in order to provide enticing and fluid combat scenes as well as a genuinely beautiful world. The fight scenes are, in the same way the characters are designed, very realistically choreographed and maintain the tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nYou won\u2019t see Balsa stand her ground and take on countless enemies while whirling her spear about her head at ungodly speeds \u2013 she will kite back, dodge, parry, and use her environment to her advantage. So for people drawn to this \u2018authentic\u2019 style of fighting there are a good handful of scenes throughout the show to keep you interested as the broader tale unfolds.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is where I think the show takes a few hits. We start off with an introduction to Balsa, a bodyguard by trade, who saves Chagum after he falls into the river. She meets with the second queen (Chagum\u2019s mother) and is asked to take him away from the emperor who feels obligated to kill his son due to his suspected possession by the water spirit. After halfheartedly agreeing to the task Balsa begins her journey in order to escape the emperor\u2019s hunters and the machinations of the palace.\\n\\n\r\nWhere I think the story goes wrong is when Balsa and Chagum attain some degree of temporary comfort the pacing slows down tremendously and the episodes become very character driven for a good while. This is not problematic in and of itself however there are shows that can get away with it and there are those that cannot. I think Moribito didn\u2019t have enough going on outside of its characters to keep me either interested or invested in the actual story. The primary plot can be summed up as the investigation of the water spirit by both Balsa\u2019s group and the palace and thereafter acting upon the information they each glean.\\n\\n\r\nThe story does pick up after a slump midway pacing-wise but I never felt it returned to what I originally felt interested in when the show began. The world is large and there is even a supernatural dimension of sorts\u2019 that nearly overlaps theirs however the show does little to investigate this despite it being integral to the story. Lastly, I felt the ending was lacking \u2013 it was wholly believable but for a story that involved water spirits, a fierce warrior from a distant land, and an empire with a mysterious past, it felt anticlimactic. I think perhaps the biggest problem concerning the story of Moribito is that, try as you might, you probably can\u2019t find a very interesting antagonist. Balsa and her friends are certainly at odds with the emperor and his hunters however because the characters are so explored its hard to find anyone truly at fault or furthermore with malicious in intent. The story fizzles for me at the end because of this.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music, while not central to the show in my opinion, did what it needed to. It lent itself well to the style of the show and was appropriately selected for each scene with no glaring disconnects. All in all, it was background music and didn\u2019t capture my attention as much as some other shows might have.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nSeirei no Moribibito is a show I don\u2019t regret watching however I feel that other shows have simply taken the genre farther and had more pleasing conclusions. It most definitely had more than a few good scenes worth remembering and some of the story elements are quite interesting. Additionally it is a decent coming of age story via Chagum\u2019s character so whether the plot of the show is worth your time or not, Chagum\u2019s journey is at least worthy of note for those who enjoy that dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 6\\n\\n\r\nI gave the show a 6 because, while the characters were excessively (in every definition of the word) well written, the story that surrounded them and gave their interactions context was lackluster. It scores high as far as characterization and art goes however falls short in other fields that may ultimately have mattered more to the show. Uehashi Nahoko, the original writer of Moribito as well as Kemono no Souja Erin does a fantastic job with her characters however, as opposed to Erin, this show couldn\u2019t stand to take the slow route\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this show to people who enjoy the more niche sub-genre within the action/adventure category that is sometimes referred to as \u2018historical\u2019. People that like shows liked Arslan Senki (TV), Akatsuki no Yona, or the aforementioned Kemono no Souja Erin will likely enjoy this show as well however I myself believe them to be ultimately better shows. I think the most surefire recommendation I can give is for someone who has seen Erin as the characterization is extremely similar and even if the story itself isn\u2019t as good, it is character-centric enough for them to enjoy. In the same vein that i recommend those prior shows, someone who enjoys coming of age stories will likely enjoy this show as well.",

            "content": "Story: 8 - An enthralling fantasy epic that unfortunately loses focus and drags in the middle.\r\nCharacters: 7 - An admirable lead heroine and fun supporting cast, but much less interesting as individuals beyond their roles in the story. \r\nArt: 8 - Fluid combat sequences, lush backgrounds, with diverse and appealing character designs. \r\nSound: 9 - Gorgeous musical score and sound design. Strong Opener by L'arc en Ciel.\r\nEnjoyment: 8 - Moribito has lot of good ideas, but also too many noticeable stumbles prevent the series from living up to its full potential. \r\nFull Review:\r\nMoribito is very reminiscent of Hayao Miyazaki's early work, with a strong femalelead, themes of humanity's place in the natural order, and uniquely eastern fantasy elements. It's very Princess Mononoke-ish. And Moribito stands as probably one of the most exceptional attempts at a Ghibli knock-off. This is due largely in part to the collective talent assembled on the project. Production IG is a studio with a history of gorgeous animation work, and Moribito is no exception. The action is fluid, the characters never stray off-model, and the backgrounds are lush and colorful. Sitting in the director's chair is Kenji Kamiyama, the man largely responsible for the Ghost in the Shell TV series. He sets sweeping fantasy adventure alongside beautifully choreographed action. Composing the score is the legendary Kenji Kawai, also responsible for some of the Ghost in the Shell franchise. Almost to the point of being overpowering, the music in Moribito is haunting and intense. The combined effort results in an atmospheric and enthralling fantasy. Unfortunately, Moribito's characters lack the twinge of humanity necessary to carry the larger-than-life story. They aren't bad characters by any stretch, Balsa is easily one of the best-written female characters anime has to offer, but they feel a little too much like pieces being shuffled around by the plot. This makes Moribito's focus on its characters in the middle episodes seem far more dull than it should be. I've never really seen another show that I felt was overly character-focused. Moribito's characters are interesting collectively, but on an individual basis they're easily the least interesting thing about it. \\n\\n\r\nMoribito does have plenty of interesting things to say, though. Particularly about legacy, and how it pertains to both family, and the natural order. The old must always make way for the new, and the new exists only on the foundation laid by that which came before. The show is also built heavily on parallels. The parallel between Balsa's group and the agents of the Mikado. The parallel between the spirit world and the natural world. The dual parallels of Balsa's relationship to her foster father and Chagum, and the rebirth cycle of the Water Spirit. It's a pretty compelling thematic hook. Which is to say nothing of the coming-of-age and parenting themes that comprise most of the surface elements of the story, which are both handled poignantly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would call Moribito the poster-child for a solid 8/10 anime. There's a lot of good in this show, but the ambition and nuance of the story just proves too much of a burden for the show to carry, causing some all too noticeable stumbles along the way. \\n",

The animation is remarkably crisp, the plot is interesting and easy to follow, with real good character development and interaction.  Balsa is about as big of a badass without super powers that you'll find and her actions are driven by an intriguing past. She takes on 4 or 5 badass hunters (Emperor's version of ANBU) (awesome cosplay idea).  I don't want to spoil anything for people who haven't seen it, but this anime should definitely be on everyone's to watch list.  \r\n-Smokyo",

            "content": "Themes such as heroic brave man rescuing and protecting feeble woman from harm is a common topic in novels and anime. However, in the case of Seirei no Moribito, or Moribito - Guardian of the Spirit, the roles are reversed: a woman saves and protect the prince. Having a setting in a feudal fantasy world, this anime provides both action and adventure, with satisfactory character development.\r\n~Story~\r\nThe story of Serei no Moribito is simple: a female bodyguard, Balsa, is asked to protect the prince Chagum from the assassins the emperor send after him. This is not without a reason, and as society knows, feudal times areknown for its superstitious beliefs, and it is so that the prince is possessed by an evil spirit, the water spirit. This ethereal being is considered to be the source of draught, besides being an unacceptable occurrence for someone of royal blood. As the plot unfolds, the spectator may observe how Balsa confronts the different situations she and her companion encounters.\\n\\n\r\nThis situation can't last long in any way, if this anime aims to convey it a somewhat realistic way, without going to deep in the \"shonenque\" genre. This was done well: after a few intriguing and intense, well paced episodes, the story settles itself in an arc more focused upon character development and exploring ways to free Chagum from the water spirit. The story is displayed through both sides: the emperor's subordinates, the astrologers, and Balsa and Chagum, allowing the audience to observe the different situations and beliefs from both parties.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a negative aspect on the aftermath of the first few episodes: the slow pacing of the story. While it certainly contributed to character development and revealing the various mysteries that surrounded the anime, it felt as if time was not fully taken advantage of, leaving somewhat empty and lackluster episodes. With a fairly weak conclusion, Serei Moribito's universe could have been expanded much more, thus not reaching its full potential.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in Serei no Moribito is not big. The main focus of the story lies in Balsa and Chagum, though the audience may observe people from both parties. There is the emperors party, whose main characters are the two top astrologers, the queen, and the emperor himself. The other party is composed of a shaman, Torogai, who is an expert in the mystical arts: then there is Tanda, who supports Balsa. Supernatural being are not be excluded: fire spirits, water people and \"egg\" devourers.\\n\\n\r\nThe spectator may observe the biggest character development in Balsa and Chagum. The audience observes how the prince has to adapt himself to the low-class lifestyle, which has one positive aspect: love and social interactions that would not have been possible as a royal family member. As the narrative progresses, Balsa's struggle and background story is revealed, which is a great addition to the anime. The remainder cast of the anime undergo certain character development to an extend, but nothing drastic.\\n\\n\r\nOne refreshing aspect of the characters was the fact that in this anime, there is a powerful, rational and strong willed female lead character, the opposite of the \"damsel in mistress\" characters in other anime. Not outstandingly beautiful and has its own flaws, leading to a more likeable and realistic female lead character.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Serei no Moribito is outstanding: spectacular backgrounds, well coloured and detailed; the same applies for the skies. The animated battle scenes are one of the best, if not very best, comparing with other anime: very fluid and realistic movements, leading to an overall very enjoyable experience. At times CG is present in the anime, though this was done only in certain occasions, and didn't interfere too much in the art style.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound used matches well with the different atmospheres it tried to portray, as well as giving an emotional touch to certain themes, making it easier for the spectator to perceive th characters emotions. The voice actors fulfilled their role well, though the variety in voices was not big, leading to a less unique touch to the characters.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nSeirei no Moribito was overall an enjoyable experience with fantastic animation and a non exaggerated story. Though the pacing of the story was slow and the potential of it not fully explored, I can recommend this anime to anyone with an interest in the fantasy genre or just wants to see something different. Be warned though, patience is a key factor in this anime to fully enjoy it, so if you are not the patient type, this may not be for you.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Seriei no Moribito (or Guardian of the Sacred Spirit), is not your normal anime. It began life as the first in the ten volume Moribito series of fantasy novel written by Uehashi Nahoko, and although these novels were intended for children, they gained many adult fans. In fact, the novels proved to be so popular that they the first volume was adapted into a manga, an anime (directed by Kamiyama Kenji, who directed Ghost in the Shell SAC and 2nd Gig), and even a radio drama. The novel is also scheduled for release in english in mid 2008 because of the immense popularity of theanime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\\n\r\nSeirei no Moribito has some of the smoothest and most fluid animation of any anime produced over the last few years. Production I.G. managed to produce one of the best looking anime of 2007, and with it, managed to introduce one of the most unique and interesting female leads in anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe colour palette is very \"Ghibli-esque\" as it mainly uses greens, browns, blues, etc, but Production I.G. has made good use of them for the characters and environements, and the overall effect gives the show a feeling more reminiscent of \"Monoke Hime\" or \"Gedo Senki\" than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are exceptional throughout the show, most especially the main and immediate supporting characters. Balsa is exceptionally well designed, and far more realistic than many other fantasy female leads. Her character is fairly muscular and stocky, yet without the extremely toned muscles shown in most other fantasies. Facially too, the designers went for realism more than anything else. Balsa is not beautiful, but not ugly either. She's plain (in a sense), and is most definitely a woman, not a girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are also designed very much with realism in mind, and this actually helps to pull the viewer into the show in a big way. It's also nice to see that attention was paid to the animals in the show as well, and it makes a nice change to see a horse in anime that actually looks like a real horse.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that should be mentioned here is the design influences. Many people relate thise series to China and Japan because of the very obvious visual references to those countries (i.e. the palace, the emperor, the ninjas, etc), however this is really only a small part of the whole. In truth, Seirei no Moribito isn't simply based on China and Japan, but is actually based on the greater Indo-Chinese region. This is reflected in the differing facial structures, customs, practices, etc, that are seen in the show. Balsa and Jiguro are originally from Kanbal, a country that shows a number of elements of Northern India/ Kashmir, Nepal and Tibet. This influence also extends to Balsa and Jiguro's fighting style, which is very different to that of the stories other combatants. The backgounds, still scenes, the rural settings, even the mountainous regions and jungles, are very clearly based on a region of South-East Asia stretching from India to Japan,  and it's a rarity to find this kind of scope or depth of detail in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality throughout the show never really lets up, and the action sequences are especially impressive. The fights are swift and well executed, and the movements of the combatants is especially impressive during the action scenes. Production I.G. have also paid attention to the different combat styles used in the show as well, and have managed to include these in the animation, which gives the fights a far more \"authentic\" feel.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nEach episode opens with a very nice, and rather catchy, J-rock/pop ballad called \"Shine\", which was performed by L'Arc-en-Ciel but never released as a single. The rest of the music in the show (composed by the famous Kawai Kenji), adds to the atmosphere and overall feel of the show. The dramatic moments, fights, and even the slow-paced scenes are all emphasized with some great background music.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are exceptional in this show, especially as this is more of a \"historical\" fantasy. The background noises, the grunts, clucks, whinnies, and other noises of the various animals, the clash of steel on steel, etc, breathe life into the series, and makes the setting that much more \"real\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that the star of the show is Balsa, the spear wielding warrior woman, and Balsa, as a character, is one of the strongest and most unique female leads in any anime. She is muscular and stocky, possess many skills (not the least of which is her formidable fighting ability), has a strong sense of right and wrong, is very rarely indecisive, and is sensible in many ways. As I've said earlier, Balsa is no beauty, and this again sets her apart from many other female leads, as the designers generally try to make lead women in anime \"attractive\" to male audiences.\\n\\n\r\nChagum, on the other hand, is exactly how you would expect a young prince to be, but without the arrogance (which makes a nice change). What makes this series really work though, is the attention to character development that both Balsa and Chagum receive, and how, as each of them develops, their relationship with each other changes. \\n\\n\r\nThere are several other characters who appear throughout the series (Tanda, Touya, Saya, Jiguro, etc), all of whom receive a certain amount of development because of their association with Balsa. The nice thing about the development of the supporting characters is that it is often directly linked to the development of either Balsa or Chagum, or both in some cases. This is most especially true in the case of Jiguro, who was Balsa's guardian and mentor as a child, and is the one who taught her how to fight with a spear. The various references and flashbacks to this character slowly begin to make sense as the series progresses, and with this clarity it is possible to understand Balsa's character even more.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a downside to the characters though, in that there are other characters who receive little to no development. In addition to that, the characters who do receive development rarely get it continuously. Strangely enough though, this does very little to impact on the story or the viewers enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe story is actually a nice role reversal of the typical \"rescue the princess\" scenario and, although it's meant to be a serious fantasy action drama, there are some genuinely humourous moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe story flows at a nice steady pace throughout the series, and although it does slow down from time to time, these are effectively the times when the majority of the character development happens. The premise was good on the whole, and although the story at times seems more like stock fantasy, there are enough differences, as well as some great character development, sound and animation, to make watching this a worthwhile experience.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a light-hearted series, but it also doesn't become overly dramatic. It doesn't focus so much on action that it gives up areas of the story, and it never lets the story become so bland that you get bored of watching. It's an interesting show to watch and the pacing of the show, as well as the slow delve into Balsa's past, serve to ensure that you keep watching. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the plot may be simplistic at times, this isn't really a show that suffers from it, especially as the show itself is more character driven than anything else. The main focus of the show, from beginning to end, are the characters. This is emphasized by the fact that the action and drama clearly take second place to each of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd recommend this show to any Ghibli fan, and also to anyone who like shows like Claymore, Slayers, or even Rurouni Kenshin or Sword of the Stranger. It's an extremely enjoyable example of how good a fantasy series can get if you do it right, and because of it's characters, it will appeal to fans of many different genres.",

            "content": "Seirei no Moribito was one of those rare anime that I commenced with an unshakeable sense of anticipation and with high expectations. I can never resist the urge to assume a show will be spectacular based on the staff or studio involved, even if my hopes have all-too-often been crushed (as was the case with Darker than Black). So, when I heard that Kenji Kamiyama, who is largely responsible for some of the finer creative inputs for both seasons of Gits SAC, was going to be heading this show with Production I.G, it instantly became my single most anticipated series of the year. By thetime the trailer came along I was well and truly brimming with excitement. However, the show that I got was both different to what I had hoped, and also not as memorable or entertaining. On some levels, the show is a resounding achievement, and there are moments dispersed throughout when it reaches remarkable heights of excitement, emotion and splendour. Yet, when looked at as a whole, the show has failings that can not be ignored; most notably, flaws in the pacing and the build-up of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe element of Seirei no Moribito that most screams for attention is its stunning production, and here is where my faith in Kamiyama is affirmed. The entire series has maintained an unprecedented quality of art and animation. It has the look and feel of a (good) movie, with a sweeping cinematic mode of directing that befits the stories&rsquo; expansive fantasy world, and stunningly realised landscapes that bring the show to life. More so than in any other anime I can recall, the background art in Seirei no Moribito left a profound impression on me - this could well be the finest example of background art in anime, not just for its level of detail, but for the way it is used to enhance the atmosphere of the show and draw the viewer in to its vibrant and striking settings. On top of this, the cel animation, while it could quite easily have been blessed with a higher level of detail to match its surroundings, is amazingly fluid and vital when it needs to be. The use of cel-shaded CG has been popularised among IG&rsquo;s producers it seems, and it&rsquo;s generally put to good use in Seirei, to animate hordes of extras in scenes such as in the towns, or when the palace assembles its army. This means that these scenes are bought to life in a way that would otherwise not be possible with a tv anime budget, successfully avoiding the common anime trap of either having a surprising absence of people in the background, or have large crowds of people inexplicably still. Unfortunately, it sticks out a bit too much on a number of occasions, providing a nagging distraction.\\n\\n\r\nI think this show&rsquo;s production also excels in a way that people generally don&rsquo;t give credit for, and that is the expertise with which it is directed - Kenji Kamiyama&rsquo;s style of directing is a subtle yet effective one. Unlike the in-your-face stylistic shots of Akiyuki Shinbo&rsquo;s work (Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, Tsukuyomi MoonPhase, Petite Cossette), Kamiyama has presented this series in a conventional yet fresh manner. The fight sequences, particularly those in the third episode, exemplify this, where the use of camera angles serves to make the fight more engaging while not drawing from the choreography. The wide and distant shots used in and around the palace are excellent at creating its cold, detached atmosphere, and the overall choice of shots is amazingly good at highlighting the show&rsquo;s beautiful scenery. As he did with his directing work on Gits SAC, Kamiyama has created a visually captivating series.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was a surprising achievement from the veteran, Kenji Kawai, whose scores I generally find bland and uninspired. I&rsquo;m not sure why this anime marked such a great deviation from his usual standards, but the music in Seirei no Moribito is a really crucial contributor to its dramatic impact - from the urgent and threatening battle theme, to the quiet and hauntingly evocative tracks, the music delivers in every respect. I&rsquo;m shocked to say that his work here was more compelling than much of Yoko Kanno&rsquo;s recent work, and he wasn&rsquo;t even creating music with real instruments. Fitting with the visual style of the show, the score music is very much produced in a traditional cinematic way, which does this show justice.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the show&rsquo;s content fails to live up to its gloss, and I think this is mainly a failure of the pacing of the script rather than of the story itself (which comes from a novel series). The bare plot is an accomplished exploration of life and adulthood, and of the connection between humanity and nature. It is set in a fantasy world, but at its core it depicts a very down-to-earth, human ordeal. Fortunately, the intricacies and depth to the characters and their relationships is well incorporated into the show - the connection formed between Balsa and Chagum gives the show most of its emotional weight. The other thing that I found to be well written is the development of Chagum himself, as he is torn from his palace life and forced to experience life and shoulder responsibility. It is satisfying to see him grow as a person as the show progresses. Perhaps the egg inside of him is a parallel to his rearing into adulthood. The problem lies in the amount of time the show takes to achieve this development, and in the unsatisfying climax.\\n\\n\r\nMy appreciation of a good story stems from its sense of direction toward a climax that brings together all of the crucial plot threads from throughout the show and culminates them in a burst of excitement of drama that pays off the time the viewer has spent watching it develop. Instead, the big event that the show had supposedly been leading up to was a rushed affair with a surprising lack of tension or emotional potency. The show did not have any filler per se, but by the time the conclusion was wrapped up I felt that a lot of the show&rsquo;s time was poorly spent on redundant subtleties of its character development. The trailer gave a very different impression to what was delivered. Balsa and Chagum living together was nice a pleasant affair, but it lacked a sense of tension or danger that ultimately dragged down the middle of the show. The exploration of Balsa&rsquo;s character was far too spontaneous and vague for my liking. I did get a strong sense of her character from her actions throughout the show, but I really think she had a lot more potential and that we were never given the kind of insight into her that was frequently hinted at.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show left me feeling unsatisfied, like being left hungry after a serving of fine food. The show is of undeniable quality; however the writers behind it failed to capitalise on its full potential, through sloppy pacing that made its stand-out moments seem like a tease, and through its inability to deliver a conclusion that sends off the show at its peak. I recommend this show to anyone with an ounce of patience, as the subtle development of the characters and their companionship is ultimately its most rewarding component. I think this show also succeeds in its fantasy elements - its portrayal of two intersecting worlds is fascinating. Don&rsquo;t go into this series expecting non-stop, heart-pounding action, because it&rsquo;s a laidback show about the endearing strength of the human spirit with only intermittent bursts of excitement.\\n",

            "content": "My favourite anime of 2007.  I decided to check this out solely on Production I.G's involvement, those nice guys behind one of the best anime in the world: Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex.\r\nThe animation for this show was superb all the way through, which is nice for a TV anime.  Each episode looked gorgeous, so I liked the consistency.  The unique alternate fantasy setting and protagonist of this series were a nice departure from anime convention.\r\nThe main character is a wandering thirty year old spear-wielding woman who bodyguards people for a living.  She basically ends up as a guardianof a prince who's possessed by a water spirit.  His father, the emperor, orders his death to save the land from a drought, and thus the being-on-the-run-from-awesome-assassins template begins.\\n\\n\r\nThe assassins are awesome in this case simply because they get time to develop as characters.  Not as much as the main characters, but still depicted as a cohesive unit of honourable and professional men, as opposed to remaining faceless goons who obey orders like automatons.  Balsa is usually one step ahead of them but they're hot on her heels for most of the anime and this is due to their skill and cunning, not stupid errors on Balsa's behalf.\\n\\n\r\nThis characterization extends to the land most of the story is set in, so you are actually concerned about the impending doom, as opposed to many other generic anime where you really couldn't care less.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is laden with feeling.  Episode 17 for example has one of the most touching moments I've ever seen in anime, its a very brief sequence but it really put a lump in my throat.  But what follows is even more emotional, with Balsa's back story and the inevitable climax...there are really amazing moments spread out through the story, where in any other anime they would be mishandled, but in this production they hit all the right beats.  I was teary eyed many a time I'm not ashamed to admit.\\n\\n\r\nSeirei no Moribito has a very well written story, great direction and fantastic fight scenes, while bravely eschewing most anime narrative clich&eacute;s as best as it can for 26 episodes.  It does this because its adapted from a fantasy novel, and I hope they adapt the rest of the books in the series.\\n\\n\r\nIts a testament to everyone involved in this production, from the writer to the animators, that a story can be so epic and yet not even have a typical antagonist.  In fact it wouldnt be too far off to say that we dont really see a villain in Seirei no Moribito.  Yet the conflict and drama is monumental, which makes it all the more remarkable.  Sure there are characters you wouldnt want to have tea with, but the anime steers clear of generic cliches, there's no black and white good versus bad plot, no easy resolution to everyone's troubles.\\n\\n\r\nSeirei no Moribito charts a rites of passage, a life-altering journey, the symbiotic relationship between man and nature.  The characters struggle, they run and ultimately have to face their destiny head on.  It's inspiring.  Why?  Because the anime never talks down to the viewer, because it retains its dignity, it doesnt follow the trends of today, it sticks to the source material as best as it can.\\n\\n\r\nThe only bad thing I can say about this show is that the beginning credits sequence is bland and the song is too, but then I don't like L'arc-en-ciel at all. The short sequence halfway through each episode signalling an advert break is very cool though, it slowly charts the birth of the water spirit.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like the medium of anime at all, you must watch this.  If you're looking for tons of action, you'll be disappointed because this has a story to tell, and it will tell it in its own pace designed to develop characters, and yet it still has some of the best action scenes I've ever seen in my life.  If you have any taste at all, you'll enjoy this masterful example of Production I.G's contribution to anime.",

            "content": "Seirei no Moribito is a Fantasy, Action, Adventure about the journey faced by a female warrior and prince and their growing platonic relationship. It is undeniably a great series offering a well-written adventurous experience however this isn&rsquo;t as action-packed or spectacular as some may hope to be.\r\nThe story follows a female warrior (Balsa) who has been hired to protect the Prince of Yogo (Chagum), whose life is in constant danger. The main story is nicely crafted in the first 6 episodes, where a lot of developments occur and some back story is given on the characters. From then on the pacing of the story changesdramatically, as it moves onto slow character building and plot filling. Sure there are some fairly pointless or dull episodes but they all have a purpose in the progression of the storyline. Later on, when the foundations the for the ending has been laid and everything has been explained, the series reaches it&rsquo;s climax and is able to bring things to a reasonable ending that many anime series fail to do. \\n\\n\r\nThe series has a satisfying batch of important characters that cannot be simply described as people on the side of good or evil, but rather be described as people on the polar opposites of society that are striving for what they believe in. Balsa and Chagum are the central roles, which the story revolves around and both of them develop equally well throughout their adventure. Balsa, a sort of affectionate Lara Croft (Tomb Raider), is one that will leave a huge impression on you even after finishing. The rest of the characters aren&rsquo;t as well developed but they all bring something to the story and their voice actors do a good job on them as well.\\n\\n\r\nWith Production I.G. behind the making of this series you&rsquo;d know to expect great things in the animation &amp; sound department. The visuals are splendid; with lush greenery environments, incredibly detailed buildings and well implemented CG effects. The character designs are also very realistic and the characters themselves move so fluidly.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sounds, due to the historical setting this anime utilizes a variety of ambient sounds perfectly and the SFX are great as well. The music is also impressive and exciting to listen to when there&rsquo;s some action, and not to forget the adorable, traditional insert song later on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this adventure anime managed to fulfill its purpose in creating a fantasy world for us to observe its characters experience it. Certainly this is an experience I greatly enjoyed and even with a few dull moments, here and there, I was pretty satisfied with what I got. Sadly once the journey is over and the series ended it does leave one with; to some extent feeling empty inside, after the anti-climatic ending. Nevertheless that shouldn&rsquo;t deter anyone from watching this superb fantasy adventure.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "\"If you are in a position to act, it would be a sin not to, even if you had nothing to gain from doing so.\"\r\nHere we have a Production IG fantasy series, directed and written by Kenji Kamiyama, who has previously worked on Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, which just so happens to be possibly my favorite anime series ever, and all of it based on a successful novel series. All of that already sounds hella promising. Here\u2019s my review explaining why I think this series is good stuff and deserves more recognition.  \r\nStory: \r\nSeirei no Moribito is the story of Balsa,bodyguard, skilled spear-fighter and total dreamboat, who is tasked by a Queen with the protection of her son prince Chagum who has a dangerous supernatural entity living inside of him and is being pursued by the assassins of his own father, the king, or the Mikado in this case. All of this is set in the fantasy land of faux-Asia, which is close enough to the real world to be vaguely familiar, but just different enough to be its own interesting fantasy land. \\n\r\nThis initial set-up serves as the first act of the story, which has us following Balsa as she outmaneuvers the king\u2019s forces both by using her wits and her incredible fighting ability. All of this is fairly exciting with satisfying amounts of action and is an excellent introduction to Balsa and the large cast of side-characters. \\n\r\nAfter this cat-and-mouse game, the pacing of the show slows down considerably in the second act and the entire series switches into an almost slice-of-life fantasy series with a semi-episodic presentation, which are used to further develop Chagum\u2019s character, his relationship with Balsa and her allies and some world-building. It is this switch in pacing between the two acts that may come across as jarring to some viewers. Personally, I was surprised by it, but it didn't bother me a lot. Even with a lack of action, it\u2019s still very much worth watching and seeing the characters grow and live together. \\n\r\nOnce the series closes into its finale it all moves along a bit faster and the scale grows more epic again. Overall, the story behind Moribito might not be the most original one and the switches in pacing may throw off some, but I still found it to be executed quite well. It takes it\u2019s time to properly develop the main cast, has some interesting twists along the line, is exciting when it needs to be and hell, it even manages to make flashbacks interesting.\\n\\n\r\nWorld building:\\n\r\nI have a special little boner in my heart for some good, detailed world building and Moribito delivers in that regard, which is why I will make this short section to comment on it. \\n\r\nMoribito has its own version of everything from funeral ceremonies, regional superstitions over smaller gadgets, mechanisms and weapons to wildlife. There is a lot of attention to detail here, but the thing that really makes it shine is the completely seamless and natural integration into the series. The world in Seirei no Moribito really feels coherent, alive and like it\u2019s been around long before the main plot of the series started.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOkay, let me first heap some praise on Balsa, who is exactly the type of female main characters I\u2019d like to see more often in my chinese cartoons. She competent, confident, intelligent, mature and I totally don\u2019t have a crush on her. She\u2019s also 29 years old at the beginning of the series. If any of you reading this know more anime with close-to-30 female leads, feel free to recommend them to me. You may keep all the lolis, moeblobs and tsunderes. Seriously though, the best thing about Balsa is how, despite the fact that she always has a plan for everything and is a capable enough spear fighter to hold her own against four elite soldiers, she never comes across as mary-sue-ish.  This is a very delicate balance to hold for a main character, yet this series makes it look effortless. Aside from being excellent at her job as badass bodyguard, Balsa also has a softer side, which is evident by her interactions with Chagum and other allies. As the series progresses she becomes more and more of a mother figure to Chagum. \\n\r\nChagum himself deserves a lot of praise for being a child character amongst a mostly adult cast, who despite his age and status never comes across as annoying or spoiled. The prince is intelligent, polite and willing to learn about the ways of the common people, despite being holed up in a palace for his entire life prior to the events of the series. The entire series I was expecting him to do something stupid or act spoiled and it never happened. So congratulations Seirei no Moribito, you managed to make me like a child character. Both Balsa and Chagum are the focus of the series and are developed extremely well. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s the secondary cast that could\u2019ve used a bit more time in the limelight. While absolutely no one in the shows sizable cast is completely unlikable, which is an impressive feat in and of itself, I wouldn't have minded for the side characters to get some more attention, but that\u2019s only a minor gripe in an otherwise fantastic show. \\n\r\nAlso notable is how this series doesn't seem to have a clear villain, the antagonists are mostly just misguided or misinformed. Even the supernatural ones aren't evil so much as they are simply following their nature. A surprising amount of conflict in the series gets resolved by characters simply talking to each other and explaining their situation rather than through fighting, which is certainly a breath of fresh air and a mature way to resolve conflict (don\u2019t worry, there are still cool fights in there). \\n\r\nOh yeah, special shout-out to the character Torogai, who is one badass old granny that doesn't take shit from anyone.  Welp, I guess this series made me like a granny character too, so there you go. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nAll you really need to know about Seirei no Moribito\u2019s visuals is that it\u2019s Production IG at its best. Kenji Kamiyama\u2019s signature realistic artstyle is one I really enjoy, the backgrounds are stunningly beautiful, the color palette is vibrant and it\u2019s all held together by good cinematography. \\n\r\nA special mention goes to the fight scenes, which are almost movie budget-smooth and have incredibly satisfying to watch choreography. Also, all the outfits the characters wear are really well-designed without being overblown or unrealistic. I especially like the ones worn by the hunters which initially pursue Balsa and Chagum. \\n\r\nAs for negative aspects of the visuals, there is the cg, which admittedly is still better justified/used more tastefully than in most more recent shows. It\u2019s occasionally utilized to animate part of a crowd and in those cases it\u2019s barely noticeable, but towards the very end of the series they use cg to animate a certain group of monsters and it doesn't look great unfortunately. It\u2019s particularly bothersome cause the monsters are actually hand-drawn in other scenes and look great there. \\n\r\nOverall however, the show has excellent visuals, and aside from the occasional cg, is about as good as an anime show can look with a tv budget. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nMan, composer Kenji Kawai really outdid himself with this soundtrack. And that guy is already a well-known, incredibly competent composer, so that\u2019s saying something. The background music does such an excellent job of enhancing every scene, no matter if it needs to be sad and emotional, creepy or fast paced for an action scene. It\u2019s tasteful and fits perfectly and that\u2019s all a good soundtrack needs to be. In fact, I\u2019m listening to it as I\u2019m writing this review and probably will for a while after I\u2019m done. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s a shame the Op and Ed can\u2019t live up to this. The opening is a rather cheesy pop/rock song, which L'Arc-en-Ciel fans will undoubtedly enjoy, but simply isn\u2019t my thing nor do I think it fits the series very well. The ending is better, but not remarkable either. \\n\r\nAs for the voice acting everyone on the cast does a good job bringing their characters to life, especially Balsa\u2019s voice actor, who has a nice deep female voice that fits the character perfectly. \\n\r\nOf special note is the fact that Chagum was actually voiced by a young boy, instead of a woman, as is usually the case for young male characters in anime. This lends some really nice authenticity to the character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nSeirei no Moribito is an excellent series with only a couple of minor shortcomings, which thankfully don\u2019t sour the experience much at all. \\n\r\nIf you want a classy, good fantasy anime that has all the feel of an old historical saga and you don\u2019t mind a bit of slower pacing, then please do yourself a favor and give this often overlooked series a watch. \\n\\n\r\nAs usual, thank you for taking the time to read this review, please excuse any grammatical mistakes as English is not my first language and please feel free to leave me some feedback, as I want to improve. \\n",

            "content": "They say 95% of all anime is complete and utter shit, with the remaining five representing those titles even relatively good. And among that 5%, Seirei no Moribito belongs into whatever number of shows it is which are not just relatively, but genuinely good.\r\nSeirei no Moribito is a fantasy adventure story which mostly focuses on the characters of Balsa and Chagum, a prince of a powerful Empire whose forced to exile due to the continued assassination attempts on him conducted by his own father, and their journey together. Those who prefer complex storylines with intricate twists and turns may look elsewhere; the travels of Balsaand Chagum, their struggle to dispel the pursuit sent after them, and how they deal with the water spirit's egg that's laid within Chagum are indeed the plot's most prominent elements.\\n\\n\r\nNot to say the story's simplicity is a shortcoming, quite the contrary in fact. It is for once pleasing to see a storyline you can actually understand at first glance instead of having to take guesses or be completely lost in the mock artistry of the show's creators. Not to say simplicity would be the story's main attraction either, for the careful and thorough way Balsa's and Chagum's life together on the run is depicted, Chagum's transformation from a sweet and pampered prince to a smart street kid, and how the relationships between the main characters develop and deepen is plenty to keep the viewer entertained.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are another of the show's strong points, especially, with the way how they seem to shatter almost almost all of the major clich\u00e9s and all. Balsa is without a doubt one of the strongest female characters in anime of all time, she being pretty much the most capable warrior in the whole show and able to handle everything short of magic on her own. To top it off, she's noble-minded (yet not naive) and lack's arrogance (yet not confidence). Perhaps, by putting all of this together, one might notice themselves watching also one of the most shameless mary sues as of late, but amidst Balsa's pure coolness, one is also easily bound not to care.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this saying almost not a word about Chagum, the boy prince of Yogo Empire who's forced to flee his home with Balsa. He carries the water spirit's egg that's said to keep the lands from drying over within him, but unlike almost all the other young male characters in anime shouldered with a heavy burden, he's not constantly whining about his fate. In fact most of the time he deals with his lot, of leaving behind his comfy life as a prince and carrying a capricious spirit egg within him with easy enough acceptance and even enthusiasm.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters deviating from the norm are Tanda, a doctor who's actually the one to tend to the reckless female warrior's wounds instead of the other way around, and the prophets at the Imperial Court who, although proud, aren't arrogant and conservative enough not to learn from their mistakes nor ignore good advice.\\n\\n\r\nProduction I.G, a quality anime studio responsible for such acclaimed titles as the Ghost in the Shell movies and TV-serieses, makes sure that the art and animation in Seirei no Moribito earn their place among the other aspects that make this show so great. Even the most intense battle scenes flow fluently, the beautiful sceneries clearly depict a world untouched any industrial revolution, and the character designs are as much a treat to the eye as any of the aforementioned.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite being a show remarkable in it's quality, Seirei no Moribito does leave a few lingering regrets in its wake. A fantasy show as this is, we could've learned a bit more about those elements in this one. We hear of \"star diviners\", of other worlds that seemingly exist paraller to that which is mostly shown in the series, we see some magic, and so on. But all in all the fantasy elements in Seirei leave me more confused than fascinated, for all the supernatural stuff is either explained too briefly or not at all. A bit deeper thoroughness in this department would've been in order.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point of some chagrin in Seirei no Moribito is what I'd like to call beating around the bush with the characters' relationships. From the early episodes on we see that there's something going on between Balsa the fighter and Tanda the healer, with the two being childhood friends of opposite sex and all. The romantic tint in their relationship is obvious, yet _NOTHING_ concrete happens between the two in the show. An honest, full blown romance between them could've done much in the way of bringing some good extra drama and maturity to the show, for the platonic nature of their relationship despite the obvious hint at a love story-setting gave the series an ever so slightly childish look at times. Later in the show Chagum also becomes friendly with a girl his age in a village just happening to be on the path of his and Balsa's (and Tanda's) journey, and the crazy shipper in me says they shouldda hooked up as well ;P.\\n\\n\r\nThough not necessarily much of a gripe, since anime music failing to impress me is more of a rule rather than the exception, a bit more ambitious musical investment from the creators wouldn't have hurt the show either.\\n\\n\r\nPutting side to side the good and the bad, the end conclusion is what I've (hopefully) let you readers understand throughout the review; that this is one damn great of a show worth chalking up to your to watch-list no matter what genre of anime you'd usually prefer. Because even though an action-adventure-fantasy wouldn't sound like the killer combo just for you, Seirei no Moribito holds such a cast of characters and story to it that it is sure to reach the hearts of many viewers regardless of their usual appetite.",

            "content": "\u2018Seirei no Moribito\u2019 (\u2018Moribito, for short) is a very polarizing series. Many praise it for its stellar production values, great atmosphere and layered, believable characters. Others find the show relentlessly boring and slow-paced, disparagingly referring to it as \u2018Boribito\u2019.\r\nI believe the truth is somewhere in the middle.\r\nThe basic story is the typical tale of a seasoned warrior seeking to atone for a checkered past by protecting a child who\u2019s being hunted by powerful forces both human and inhuman. Moribito\u2019s narrative, however, manages to distinguish itself through 2 things: excellent character development and meticulous world-building.\r\n Protagonist Balsa in particular is a great example of the former.Her strong, dignified personality, captivating backstory (subtly alluded to initially) and multi-faceted interactions with other characters make her one of the most well written anime protagonists around. The hunted child in question, Prince Chagum, doesn\u2019t fare quite as well. He goes through a fairly predictable character arc that boils down to learning to live like a commoner and growing up. There\u2019s also a handful of moments where he displays unusually keen insight that feel rather forced. Though it must be said that the conclusion to his story has a surprising turn that\u2019s both surprising and very poignant. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as supporting characters go the biggest standout is Tanda, Balsa\u2019s dogged love interest whose difficulty reaching out to her makes for an interesting if pitiable character. Others aren\u2019t quite so interesting: there\u2019s 2 kids who hero-worship her who mainly serve to run errands for Balsa and provide some humorous moments as well as an old lady who\u2019s mainly there to provide exposition and snide remarks. The latter sticks out like a sore thumb by feeling like an archetype in a series filled with fully fleshed out characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I really do mean that last part, even a good deal of antagonists are developed and given (somewhat) sympathetic motives rather than being raving psychotics who can\u2019t go 2 minutes without strangling a puppy. Moribito\u2019s willingness to avert this easy, manipulative sort of characterization is yet another strength of its storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, not all of its storytelling is as stellar. While the series also goes to great lengths to expand on its world, it also becomes a weakness. Many a times the series devotes an entire episode to fleshing out one particular section of Moribito\u2019s world. And while it certainly helps to make the series\u2019 world feel more alive one can\u2019t help but feel that a more deft storyteller could reduce the content to a subplot without losing any relevance or impact. As it is Moribito has a stretch of episodes in the middle that have very little to do with the conflict that kicked off the story which, when combined with the glacial pacing, makes for a somewhat frustrating viewing experience at times.\\n\\n\r\nAnother fault with the storytelling that it contains a number of contrivances and other moments that feel all too convenient for the main characters. This is particularly jarring in regards to Balsa, whose vow to never again take another life should be rather cumbersome when being hunted by highly skilled assassins. In the series, however, it is mostly a slight inconvenience. There\u2019s an episode around the halfway point that takes it to its most absurd extreme, ending what should have been a grave no-win situation in a big copout. Moribito certainly isn\u2019t the only series to be guilty of such things nor is it the worst example but it\u2019s jarring nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals and audio of this series has been the subject of much praise, and for good reason. The animation, from characters doing chores to the lightning fast action sequences, is consistently stunning and the amount of detail is simply staggering. This is easily one of the best-looking TV-anime ever produced and a worthy part of Production I.G.\u2019s legacy in that regard. In terms of character designs Moribito opts for a more realistic style which perfectly fits the serious tone. The audio is of similar quality. Sound effects are believable and the music always does a good job complementing what\u2019s happening on-screen even if it\u2019s not very memorable in and of itself. The astounding presentation manages to make even the slowest episodes more enjoyable than they have any right to be.  \\n\\n\r\nMoribito is, without a doubt, a very ambitious project. It boldly stands out stylistically and in a narrative sense. Providing multi-faceted, believable characters and captivating situations all set in a gorgeously rendered word. It also deserved accolades for refusing to use its female protagonist for fanservice-oriented jokes which would only undermine her character. There\u2019s a maturity to the way the overall product presents and carries itself that most anime series wouldn\u2019t even consider. All of this makes \u2018Seirei no Moribito\u2019 a series that, in spite of some missteps, is worth checking out by anyone open to a more serious style of anime.\\n",

            "content": "That's right, for my first review I gave all tens. Actually, I belive that it's the best way to show you that this review is worth nothing, but this time I just couldn't help it.\r\nSeirei no Moribito. It's been a year since this anime raced through the world, and now I can see exactly why it did so.\r\nBut, let's get to the point.\r\nStory - 10\r\nSeirei no Moribito is fantasy down to the core. You'll find warriors and assasins, shamans and herbalists, emperors and diviners, two worlds overlaping themselves, is there anything more you need? Even if, you'll find it here. \r\nThe story is very wellpaced. It starts slowly, but comes unstoppable to the point where these slow episodes disappears in blink of an eye. It's well thought, and I didn't find even one unnesesary filler episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nYou definitely need to get used to it. I mean, after the first episode my eyes hurt from the number of details and amazing backgrounds. For heaven's sake, this anime has real grass, not green smudges, and skies i would spent my life looking for, mountains and forests, all brought to perfection. Even if heroes are in a cave, walls behind them looks the best it possibly could. If you still don't get what I mean, just watch the opening, and imagine that it's not only for show, that this art style continues and is getting better. The animation is smooth, and the CG that appears rarely is well-rounded.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are fitting the story and the overall feel of this series. Not too fast and not too slow, just like they should be in this case. In fact, they alone would not make me give a ten, but together with background music they plays up the mood in outstanding way. It's well matched, can calm you down or make you sit on the edge of the chair, I found myself completly mesmerized by it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nAnd here comes the biggest suprise, at least for me. I was expecting nothing much, especially after seeing some of the newest fantasy series in which you can tell when the hero level-up. Characters in Seirei no Moribito are almost alive, they speak and act according to their own character that slightly changes along the way, but it absolutely don't mean that they turn predictible. They develops in their own way, especially Shuga and Chagum, but the rest of them are not left behind. The seiyuu are matching the characters and doing amazingly well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWhy did I enjoyed it so much? This question seemed absurd to me, but after giving it some consideration I just don't know what to say. I don't know if I should talk about the feast for your eyes, the feast for your ears or the feast for your mind. I just know that it was pure joy for me, and I belive it's the effect of combining all this parts together.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nYou know, I'm not good at maths, but this one is evident even for me.\\n\r\nSo, what more can I say? If you enjoy fantasy, or if you enjoy beautiful art, or if you just enjoy well-made series in both visuals and the story, try it out. I hope you won't be dissapointed with this one, and find it as enjoyable as I did.",

( And I have watcheda lot of anime) \\n\\n\r\n Production I.G one of the KINGS of high budget animation along side with 'BONES' and 'MADHOUSE', did an absolutely amazing job with the execution of fight scenes, background art, interaction between animated objects ( i.e, reflections on water, light from fire, shadows etc;) .\\n\\n\r\nThe overall flow in art-style( background scenery) within the series compliments and enhances the impact of the plot ESPECIALLY since this anime emphasises metaphysical existences ----( the title is guardian of the spirit/seirei no moribito ---- go figure). \\n\\n\r\nArt- Animation>> 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: This area within the entire series was definitely the weakest, not saying it was   \\n\r\n          bad BUT in comparison to every other aspect it didn't really stand a chance. \\n\r\n          Essentially --- Balsa (the main female protagonist of the series)   \\n\r\n          protects chagum from assassination until the conundrum with the water spirit is \\n\r\n          dealt with.\\n\\n\r\n          It definitely sounds like an easily predictable and saturated mix, however the  \\n\r\n          truth could not be further. This series presents the viewer with emotional-ties (  \\n\r\n          i.e Platonic love ) , moral and ethical dilemmas, social structures within the era \\n\r\n          and plot twists ( somewhat predictable).\\n\\n\r\n          Story: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing much to say.   10/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: In this series you are introduced with a vast diversity of personalities, notable characters that stand out are BY FAR the main protagonist 'Balsa' and the Prince himself . Balsa, a spear-master whom seeks the unquenchable thirst for redemption due to the sins SHE burdened herself with due to self- guilt of her past life and interaction with a certain person. \\n\\n\r\nThis character is what you want from a female protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nPrince Chagum also undergoes an evolutionary process adapting to a non-prince life and eventually falls to the guilt of being useless and eventually coughs up the courage to ask Balsa to teach him how to defend himself. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nThis series is A MUST WATCH to anyone who's a fan of.... good quality media. It's unfortunate that this series is so fucking underrated BUT that's life for ya.  \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion it's an insult to the amount of effort the animation staff put into this series by not watching it. \\n\\n\r\nSO EVEN IF you don't like the genre, you should at least watch it for the jaw dropping animation. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 9/10 must watch.       \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Title: Seirei no Moribito\r\nNovel, Anime: Seirei no Moribito is adapted from the first volume of the ten-volume Guardian series of the same name, and was written by Nahoko Uehashi and released in Japan in July of 1996.  Scholastic has translated it as Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit and released the translated novel in June of 2008.  The translation of the novel was honored with the Batchelder Award for outstanding translated work at the 2008 midwinter conference of the American Library Association.\r\nSeirei no Moribito is a twenty-six episode anime directed by Kenji Kamiyama (who also directed everything in the Ghost in the Shell: StandAlone Complex series, including the TV show, OAV, and movies) and produced by Production IG (known for their work on the Ghost in the Shell series and xxxHOLIC).  Moribito aired on Japanese TV from April 7th to September 29th of 2007.  It was originally licensed almost immediately after the production announcement by Geneon, who soon after went defunct.  The license was picked up by Media Blasters, and was translated as Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit, with the third volume due to be released on February 24th of this year.  It also aired on Adult Swim in a fairly convoluted run, starting in the 12:30 AM (central time) slot starting on August 24th of 2008, but was then switched to the 4:30 AM (central time) slot in early September, with the first ten episodes being aired twice before being pulled from the schedule on January 16th of this year.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Balsa, a spear-wielding wandering female bodyguard, is passing through the New Yogo Empire, and happens to save the second prince, Chagum, from drowning in the river.  As she is saving him, she notices a bright blue light surrounding them both.  That night, in the middle of the night, she is called to the palace by the Second Empress, who wishes for her to flee with and protect the life of Chagum, who the Emperor, his father, believes is possessed by a water demon that threatens to destroy the Empire, and is determined to kill at all costs.  Balsa, who works as a bodyguard to atone for a past sin, agrees, and takes Chagum and flees.  However, all is not what it seems...\\n\\n\r\nProbably the most interesting thing about this show is the characters themselves.  None of the characters are simply good or evil, even those who would pursue and kill Chagum; they're all fleshed out as human beings, with reasons behind their decisions.  What's even more interesting is that when these characters make their decisions, they actually make sense, and are even smart, given the situation, which is something that is lacking among most main characters of anime these days.  Take Balsa, for instance; none of her actions or decisions are superfluous or over the top or done to point out the fact that she is a woman and a bodyguard - she simply does her job, nothing more, nothing less.  It's wonderful to see a female character of this sort.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also an incredibly well-built world. Various aspects of how the empire runs, culture, history, different ethnic groups, religion, city and country life, just about everything that could be thought of is fleshed over the course of this series.  The level of detail in general is amazingly intricate, and it's here that it's very evident that the source material for this show was originally a novel.\\n\\n\r\nSeirei no Moribito is one of the most solid stories I've seen of this type in a good long time.  It has one of the most common threads of sci-fi and fantasy anime at the core of its story - protect the special child! - but the way that it actually executes the plot is well done.  And, by my standards, I should really like this series.  \\n\\n\r\nBut, here's the thing.  I assumed, from the first episode on, that Seirei no Moribito would be a show of high standards; when it lived up to that, I wasn't that surprised.  To some degree, though, I hoped that it would go beyond my expectations for it.  And it didn't, which is probably why I'm not all that into this show.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's a solid series with good plot, characters and a well-built world, yes, it just leaves me with a meh feeling.  It probably works better as a novel, honestly.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for this series is extremely high-quality.  Backgrounds are intricately detailed, animation is well-done, and character designs aren't incongruous with who the characters actually are - Balsa looks like she's a bodyguard, Chagum looks like a prince in hiding, etc.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, where this series really shines is in the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThink of any animated action series you might've watched recently, or one you know really well, doesn't even have to be anime.  Keep that series in your head, and go and look up Moribito fight scenes on YouTube.  You will notice the differences instantly.  There is no skimping on the details, or shortcuts; every moment of the fight is animated, from beginning to end.  This series is probably going the standard on which I base all fight scenes on; there's no excuse for other shows not being able to get this level of detail in their fights.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The music was very unobtrusive for the most part; I really only noticed it if it was going out of its way to be heard.  There's a folk song towards the end of the series that ends up becoming integral to the resolution of the plot, and is a nice little song that I'll go out of my way to listen to here and there.  The OP (done by L'Arc en Ciel) and ED (done by Chagum's VA) are nothing too special. Overall, decent music, but nothing outstanding or anything.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: There aren't any names I really know from any other productions in this series, but overall, the seiyuu do a wonderful job.\\n\\n\r\nLength: I never felt that this series was too long or too short, in the end.  It might've had more impact on me if it had been shortened by a few episodes, but, at the same time, we wouldn't have gotten information that we did otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall, this is a solid series with good plot and characters, a well-built world, beautiful art, and wonderfully done fight scenes, but, in the end, it doesn't leave you with anything more than a \"meh\" feeling.  Maybe try looking at the novel instead?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 8/10\\n\r\nLength: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n[b]Overall[/b]: 40/50; 80% (B-)",

From the first episode I have greatly admired Balsa, a woman with determination and skills. And unlike most women in anime, she is not 16, nor teacher. \r\nEven if the story is simple by itself, the anime tells it well and every episode (I've seen till 19) is interesting and the story progresses well. No fillers, no unnecessary stuff, but still no feeling of haste, rather the pace is telling is really well thought. Every episode reveals new facts to the plot, develops the characters and their relationships. \r\nNot only Balsa,but also other characters are interesting, and add well to the tale. There is not really bad and good guys, just people with different opinions or different knowledge on matters, they are acting from different, understandable reasons. So it's easy to see why someone is doing something.\\n\r\nThe elements of fantasy and history are woven well together, the voice acting, music and animation are all enjoyable. Also the balance between action and talking works well for me.This is one of the best anime series I've watched.",

The major flaws of this anime are the characters and their lack of progression. The main character is a woman whom serves no purpose other than to be a bodyguard for a prince and the prince as young as he is, never matures despite all the hardships they are forced up against. The problem is none of the characters act outside their roles which leads to a dull, predictable series of episodes. This show is largely plot driven, and the tool they use to progress theplot is pathetic. What they use is readings from an ancient scroll text that someone magically is able to translate just enough to advance the plot. Sorry, but this show was amateurish in its characterization development and plot advancement. The show and excellent audio and visual presentation with average voice acting, but other than that i consider this show a major flop.",

            "content": "Scoring Preconditions: While I rate all parts, the overall score takes in most consideration from story, character, and enjoyment. Art and sound are not factors in the overall, although they can slightly enhance or detract from enjoyment portion. I score from as unbiased a view as possible and I view it in a critical sense, not in a simple enjoyment sense. Thus I give at most a one point overall bonus for enjoyment. Story and characters matter most. I will state if exceptions to this rule depending on the anime.\r\nSummary: From my knowledge, this isn't a well known anime. The only reason I found thiswas while looking through the top anime list and found it way back. But I consider this to be one of the most underrated anime I've ever seen. Details to follow.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10): The story started kind of slow and really picked up steam about half way through. I think the best part of this story was the originality. It was way cool having a female protecting the male. Second, the intricacies of the plot were well worth the score. The way characters were forced into change was really great. I also liked how they weaved two worlds together. Perhaps the only problems I had were the slow start and questions on how Jiguro had anything to do with Chagum. But the story was well worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): The art is in a similar mold to Claymore. It's a different style that you could say makes it look more realistic. I didn't have a problem with it. Enhanced the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): Opening theme and closing theme were both great to hear. Background music enhanced the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10): First of all, I thought Balsa was a great main character. She fights well, makes intelligent decisions, and as time went on gained a very nice maternal instinct. I think the whole save eight lives part got muddled in the plot, but she was a good character with nice development all the same. Chagum also had some nice development as well. Start off as a bratty prince and learn to actually live life. While it may not be the first time I've seen it, the development from prince to outcast was well done. As for the herbologist, I kind of lost the point in his character. The half romance/unrequited love with Balsa was unnecessary and really only served to distract from the main plot. Other side characters played their part. No comments on them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): Perfect marks here starts off with the second half of the anime. The plot really took off and I enjoyed the ride all the way. Providing closure to the story also gained good marks from me. Beyond that, the fight scenes weren't drawn out unnecessarily and were good. Also the use of spears gained bonus points here. It was a nice change from swords or guns. Finally, perfect marks come because I simply like Balsa as a character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10): I saw a couple flaws that don't make it a perfect 10, but this was really well worth watching. The plot isn't Code Geass intricate, but it was enthralling all the same. If for nothing else, watching Balsa and Chagum grow as characters together really made it worth my while.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this. I'm open for discussion so if you have anything to add, message me and I will get back to you.",

            "content": "\"Seirei no Moribito\" is a beautiful anime, that introduces an amazing world that is full of life and adventure. It is a blend of amazing art and animation with great story telling. If you would like to experience a new world with a nice story then you should definitely give this anime a chance.\r\nStory\r\nBefore I started to watch the anime, I had very low expectations. I was expecting a cliche a story with decent characters, however, that wasn't the case. What seemed like a cliche story at first glace turned into a new adventure. From the point I started watching, I was eager to knowwhat would happen next and with each episode my thirst to learn more about the setting and the story grew.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, the pace of the story was fast and than slowed down in the middle to get us more into the setting and character development. Skipping these episodes would hurt the experience. For people who would rather go on with the story and don't care about the setting and the character build up, they don't contain anything critical but I wouldn't skip over them and I'm glad I didn't. I was able to learn more about the characters and the growing bond between them.\\n\\n\r\nTen or so episodes before the end, the pace picks up again, slowing down only in 2 or so episodes. I believe the pacing was perfect, not rushed and no snail. In the end, everything was wrapped up very well. Many times I have been disappointed by the way animes end but this time I wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art is amazing. I have never seen such detail and life in anime before other than Ghost In The Shell. Everything had detail, the people, the grass, the trees, the buildings, the animals and so on.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is even better. The movements, speaking and all is good. \\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are just intense. Even though there isn't a lot of fighting compared to other action animes, when they are shown, they are quite a treat. The moves must have been carefully choreographed because I've only seen such detail in Jackie Chan and Jet Lii movies which involve real people. There are no invisible slashes and there are no &quot;I'm gone, you can't see me.&quot; moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters aren't what I expected at all. I couldn't predict most of the character's actions or thoughts. At first, I thought that the characters were going to be cliche and have the same old feeling but no. They are totally different than most anime characters, specially Balsa and Chagum.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, of course there are some of the usual characters. The funny granny for one but she is still one of the best characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI deeply enjoyed this anime. I liked ever part of it. The story, the art and the characters. Everything was balanced and well served.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 10/10.",

            "content": "This was honestly one of the dullest anime's I've ever seen.\r\nDespite an awesome setup and a lot of potential, the series failed to amaze me at every turn, mainly because of it's dull and generic cast of characters. Despite having a wide array of characters, none of them really stood out to me, and made me care about what happens to them. The only exception is the grumpy old lady Madame Torogai, who was the ONLY character in the entire show who made me care in the slightest about the story.\r\nAlthough the main character Balsa isn't really such a BAD character, she is by nomeans a good one either, as she doesn't stand out at all from the \"overly serious badass woman\" stereotype. Aside from Balsa, her love interest Tanda has to be the dullest character to ever appear in an anime, with little to no personality whatsoever. The worst of the bunch though, is the crybaby prince Chagum, who seems to spend 90% of the show whining and acting like a spoiled little shit, which is only made worse by the fact that is voice actor, Naoto Adachi, does a terrible job portraying him. Not that Chagum has any redeeming qualities to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself isn't much better. without spoiling the plot (not that it really matters), the story is weird, yet unimaginative, long, yet simple, and more than anything, it's boring. Yes, this series is so very boring that it will feel like a chore to watch it. This is not at all helped by the standard animation, and extremely poor 3D effects. The 3D effects are so bad they look like something out of an 80's cartoon more than a modern anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite all that I've said, I still don't consider Moribito a BAD anime, as much as a boring one. The series isn't even remotely funny, even when it tries to be, it's characters are amongst the dullest and unimaginative i've ever seen in an anime, and the story isn't interesting or original enough to be engaging. However, the series does manage to stay realistic throughout it's course. Sure, there is some magic and spirits and whatnot, but as far as the world itself goes, it always keeps it's feet on the ground and doesn't lose focus. If you want an anime that really catches the style of ancient Japan without all the fanservice, and overly dramatic anime fights you see in most anime today, then you MAY be able to enjoy Moribito. However, this is really all that the series has to offer, so if that's not enough (it certainly wasn't for me), I would steer clear of Moribito.",

            "content": "At first look, Seirei no Morbito may seem like a repeat of a story that has been told over and over and over...but it is not. Yes, there a million + one stories out there where the lead protagonist is rescuing and saving the life of others, and half of such characters may end up being women, so in this respect the series is not very unique. It's the overall story, terrific animation, and strong character designs, that make Seirei an interesting anime.\r\nWith a fictional, historical setting, the story takes place in a time when Emperors rule the people, and mythical beings rule the lands.Through a twist of faith, Balsa -the protagonist - is approached to protect the life of a young prince whose life is in danger. Nothing new right? That's true. However, the reason for the young prince's fate is not because of a struggle for the throne as we see quite often, and it is not because he is hated...it is actually quite the opposite. And at first, the job, though one with many obstacles in sight, seems fairly simple enough...but it later becomes quite complex as Balsa and her crew learn that the Emperor is not the only one after the boy's life. I won't go into any more details and ruin it, but will say that storyline is fascinating.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is Outstanding. It is sharp, colorful, detailed where it needs to be, and a pleasure to watch. There is always better out there, but for this series I truly believe it was more than sufficient. I especially liked the creator's different sketches of Balsa that is shown at the start of each episode, as it gives a glimpse of  his work &quot;in progress&quot;.\\n\r\nMy absolute FAVORITE thing, is the way the fights are drawn and animated. It's nothing short of awesome. The combat moves, spear and sword manipulations, and other maneuvers, are VERY FAST, but...you can see every single movement. Every single one. There is no blur, and no &quot;what the hell just happened&quot; moments that usually spring up when you can't visually follow along, Everything is seen in detail, as fast as it does go by, and it really pulled me in. There are so many shows out there, that should take a page from this.\\n\r\nLoved it!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe music is  good. I am not particularly fond of the opening song as it just sounds like 99.9% screaming. There are not that many varying scores within, and you probably won't walk away humming anything, but those heard are very fitting and suitable.\\n\\n\r\nThe Character design and development is Great.\\n\r\nBalsa is not your typical beautiful heroine who just happens to be talented with a spear. She's strong, and she looks it. In all honesty, there is nothing very special about her personality or attitude, but she still carries the story well.\\n\r\nMy interest lies in the other supporting actors, such as Shuga - the young star diviner who owns a look that is not typical for white haired anime guys. He is an intriguing character to watch out for as a guy who pushes himself to do his best, despite his position.\\n\r\nThen there are the emperors assassins who surprised me with their unique talents and characteristics. It's not often that these type of characters are usually shown to be more than &quot;muscle&quot;. It was good to see how unique they each were, despite not being main characters.\\n\r\nThen there is Touya with his bucked teeth, the Shaman who is a bottle of sake away from being a true alcoholic, Sagum the older prince who you WILL NOT be able to dislike, and many more.\\n\r\nTheir designs are all nicely created, and together they &quot;do good&quot;\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series immensely. Don't pick it up if you're only hungry for fighting scenes, nor expect it to be very deep with twists at ever turn...because it's not like that. It's just a nice series to kick back and relax to, where the few fights are pretty intense, and there is a great deal of emphasis on how characters interact and associate with each other.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]:\r\nBalsa (Shindo, Naomi), a spear-wielding woman who has taken it upon herself to save 8 lives in an act of atonement, is tasked by the Emperor\u2019s wife to save her son Chagum (Adachi, Naoto) who is suspected to have been possessed by a water spirit out of legend. As the story unfolds, we learn more about the potentially catastrophic implications of the water spirit as well as Balsa\u2019s past and her motivations for helping the young prince.\r\n[Characters]:\r\nSeirei no Moribibito is very much a character-story.The story takes place in a vast and complicated world however because of howthe tale is told and how each episode progresses it becomes pretty clear that the show cares first and foremost about its characters.\\n\\n\r\nBalsa is probably the most recognizable character of the show \u2013 she is thirty years of age and as warrior who has mastered the art of the spear, is fairly muscular and stocky. Both these traits are somewhat uncommon in anime for women and so I think Balsa\u2019s design speaks a good deal to the intent of the show \u2013 it approaches the story realistically despite the supernatural elements of the show such as the water spirit and characters like Torogai. Balsa herself is pragmatic and a fierce warrior in combat; she gets along well with Chagum and their relationship develops and becomes more intricate as they spend more time with one another.\\n\\n\r\nChagum, the young prince Balsa spirits away from the Emperor\u2019s hunters a the desperate request of his mother, is where a lot of developmental time is spent from episode to episode. As he is a child born of privilege the first hurdle he must overcome is introduction to the common life and like many other coming of age stories (and I believe Moribito to be one of these stories in Chagum\u2019s case) he develops from there. A quick note about Chagum \u2013 most stories would start with a snobby, entitled prince who is at odds with his predicament and complains incessantly (which can be a turn off to a viewer) however Chagum is actually quite kind and takes to each situation as it comes. He has plenty of room for growth within the story but he does not start at so low a point to annoy everyone via his archetype.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are interesting enough, the most notable of which are Tanda (Tsujitani, Kouji) and Torogai (Mayama, Ako). Tanda  has some history with Balsa and their relationship is quite realistically written while Torogai is an elderly shaman possessing supernatural abilities and serves as the mouthpiece of the story in order to explain and introduce the more magical elements of the show. Lastly is Shuga (Nojima, Hirofumi) who serves at the Emperor\u2019s palace as a star diviner (in a way, a parallel to Torogai). He is an interesting character and acts as our eyes at the palace so that we can have context for the events that unfold independent of Balsa and Chagam.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is quite good in Moribito and despite its length of 26 episodes there is no marked drop in quality at any point. Production I.G. went all out in order to provide enticing and fluid combat scenes as well as a genuinely beautiful world. The fight scenes are, in the same way the characters are designed, very realistically choreographed and maintain the tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nYou won\u2019t see Balsa stand her ground and take on countless enemies while whirling her spear about her head at ungodly speeds \u2013 she will kite back, dodge, parry, and use her environment to her advantage. So for people drawn to this \u2018authentic\u2019 style of fighting there are a good handful of scenes throughout the show to keep you interested as the broader tale unfolds.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is where I think the show takes a few hits. We start off with an introduction to Balsa, a bodyguard by trade, who saves Chagum after he falls into the river. She meets with the second queen (Chagum\u2019s mother) and is asked to take him away from the emperor who feels obligated to kill his son due to his suspected possession by the water spirit. After halfheartedly agreeing to the task Balsa begins her journey in order to escape the emperor\u2019s hunters and the machinations of the palace.\\n\\n\r\nWhere I think the story goes wrong is when Balsa and Chagum attain some degree of temporary comfort the pacing slows down tremendously and the episodes become very character driven for a good while. This is not problematic in and of itself however there are shows that can get away with it and there are those that cannot. I think Moribito didn\u2019t have enough going on outside of its characters to keep me either interested or invested in the actual story. The primary plot can be summed up as the investigation of the water spirit by both Balsa\u2019s group and the palace and thereafter acting upon the information they each glean.\\n\\n\r\nThe story does pick up after a slump midway pacing-wise but I never felt it returned to what I originally felt interested in when the show began. The world is large and there is even a supernatural dimension of sorts\u2019 that nearly overlaps theirs however the show does little to investigate this despite it being integral to the story. Lastly, I felt the ending was lacking \u2013 it was wholly believable but for a story that involved water spirits, a fierce warrior from a distant land, and an empire with a mysterious past, it felt anticlimactic. I think perhaps the biggest problem concerning the story of Moribito is that, try as you might, you probably can\u2019t find a very interesting antagonist. Balsa and her friends are certainly at odds with the emperor and his hunters however because the characters are so explored its hard to find anyone truly at fault or furthermore with malicious in intent. The story fizzles for me at the end because of this.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music, while not central to the show in my opinion, did what it needed to. It lent itself well to the style of the show and was appropriately selected for each scene with no glaring disconnects. All in all, it was background music and didn\u2019t capture my attention as much as some other shows might have.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nSeirei no Moribibito is a show I don\u2019t regret watching however I feel that other shows have simply taken the genre farther and had more pleasing conclusions. It most definitely had more than a few good scenes worth remembering and some of the story elements are quite interesting. Additionally it is a decent coming of age story via Chagum\u2019s character so whether the plot of the show is worth your time or not, Chagum\u2019s journey is at least worthy of note for those who enjoy that dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 6\\n\\n\r\nI gave the show a 6 because, while the characters were excessively (in every definition of the word) well written, the story that surrounded them and gave their interactions context was lackluster. It scores high as far as characterization and art goes however falls short in other fields that may ultimately have mattered more to the show. Uehashi Nahoko, the original writer of Moribito as well as Kemono no Souja Erin does a fantastic job with her characters however, as opposed to Erin, this show couldn\u2019t stand to take the slow route\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this show to people who enjoy the more niche sub-genre within the action/adventure category that is sometimes referred to as \u2018historical\u2019. People that like shows liked Arslan Senki (TV), Akatsuki no Yona, or the aforementioned Kemono no Souja Erin will likely enjoy this show as well however I myself believe them to be ultimately better shows. I think the most surefire recommendation I can give is for someone who has seen Erin as the characterization is extremely similar and even if the story itself isn\u2019t as good, it is character-centric enough for them to enjoy. In the same vein that i recommend those prior shows, someone who enjoys coming of age stories will likely enjoy this show as well.",

            "content": "Story: 8 - An enthralling fantasy epic that unfortunately loses focus and drags in the middle.\r\nCharacters: 7 - An admirable lead heroine and fun supporting cast, but much less interesting as individuals beyond their roles in the story. \r\nArt: 8 - Fluid combat sequences, lush backgrounds, with diverse and appealing character designs. \r\nSound: 9 - Gorgeous musical score and sound design. Strong Opener by L'arc en Ciel.\r\nEnjoyment: 8 - Moribito has lot of good ideas, but also too many noticeable stumbles prevent the series from living up to its full potential. \r\nFull Review:\r\nMoribito is very reminiscent of Hayao Miyazaki's early work, with a strong femalelead, themes of humanity's place in the natural order, and uniquely eastern fantasy elements. It's very Princess Mononoke-ish. And Moribito stands as probably one of the most exceptional attempts at a Ghibli knock-off. This is due largely in part to the collective talent assembled on the project. Production IG is a studio with a history of gorgeous animation work, and Moribito is no exception. The action is fluid, the characters never stray off-model, and the backgrounds are lush and colorful. Sitting in the director's chair is Kenji Kamiyama, the man largely responsible for the Ghost in the Shell TV series. He sets sweeping fantasy adventure alongside beautifully choreographed action. Composing the score is the legendary Kenji Kawai, also responsible for some of the Ghost in the Shell franchise. Almost to the point of being overpowering, the music in Moribito is haunting and intense. The combined effort results in an atmospheric and enthralling fantasy. Unfortunately, Moribito's characters lack the twinge of humanity necessary to carry the larger-than-life story. They aren't bad characters by any stretch, Balsa is easily one of the best-written female characters anime has to offer, but they feel a little too much like pieces being shuffled around by the plot. This makes Moribito's focus on its characters in the middle episodes seem far more dull than it should be. I've never really seen another show that I felt was overly character-focused. Moribito's characters are interesting collectively, but on an individual basis they're easily the least interesting thing about it. \\n\\n\r\nMoribito does have plenty of interesting things to say, though. Particularly about legacy, and how it pertains to both family, and the natural order. The old must always make way for the new, and the new exists only on the foundation laid by that which came before. The show is also built heavily on parallels. The parallel between Balsa's group and the agents of the Mikado. The parallel between the spirit world and the natural world. The dual parallels of Balsa's relationship to her foster father and Chagum, and the rebirth cycle of the Water Spirit. It's a pretty compelling thematic hook. Which is to say nothing of the coming-of-age and parenting themes that comprise most of the surface elements of the story, which are both handled poignantly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would call Moribito the poster-child for a solid 8/10 anime. There's a lot of good in this show, but the ambition and nuance of the story just proves too much of a burden for the show to carry, causing some all too noticeable stumbles along the way. \\n",

The animation is remarkably crisp, the plot is interesting and easy to follow, with real good character development and interaction.  Balsa is about as big of a badass without super powers that you'll find and her actions are driven by an intriguing past. She takes on 4 or 5 badass hunters (Emperor's version of ANBU) (awesome cosplay idea).  I don't want to spoil anything for people who haven't seen it, but this anime should definitely be on everyone's to watch list.  \r\n-Smokyo",

            "content": "Themes such as heroic brave man rescuing and protecting feeble woman from harm is a common topic in novels and anime. However, in the case of Seirei no Moribito, or Moribito - Guardian of the Spirit, the roles are reversed: a woman saves and protect the prince. Having a setting in a feudal fantasy world, this anime provides both action and adventure, with satisfactory character development.\r\n~Story~\r\nThe story of Serei no Moribito is simple: a female bodyguard, Balsa, is asked to protect the prince Chagum from the assassins the emperor send after him. This is not without a reason, and as society knows, feudal times areknown for its superstitious beliefs, and it is so that the prince is possessed by an evil spirit, the water spirit. This ethereal being is considered to be the source of draught, besides being an unacceptable occurrence for someone of royal blood. As the plot unfolds, the spectator may observe how Balsa confronts the different situations she and her companion encounters.\\n\\n\r\nThis situation can't last long in any way, if this anime aims to convey it a somewhat realistic way, without going to deep in the \"shonenque\" genre. This was done well: after a few intriguing and intense, well paced episodes, the story settles itself in an arc more focused upon character development and exploring ways to free Chagum from the water spirit. The story is displayed through both sides: the emperor's subordinates, the astrologers, and Balsa and Chagum, allowing the audience to observe the different situations and beliefs from both parties.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a negative aspect on the aftermath of the first few episodes: the slow pacing of the story. While it certainly contributed to character development and revealing the various mysteries that surrounded the anime, it felt as if time was not fully taken advantage of, leaving somewhat empty and lackluster episodes. With a fairly weak conclusion, Serei Moribito's universe could have been expanded much more, thus not reaching its full potential.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in Serei no Moribito is not big. The main focus of the story lies in Balsa and Chagum, though the audience may observe people from both parties. There is the emperors party, whose main characters are the two top astrologers, the queen, and the emperor himself. The other party is composed of a shaman, Torogai, who is an expert in the mystical arts: then there is Tanda, who supports Balsa. Supernatural being are not be excluded: fire spirits, water people and \"egg\" devourers.\\n\\n\r\nThe spectator may observe the biggest character development in Balsa and Chagum. The audience observes how the prince has to adapt himself to the low-class lifestyle, which has one positive aspect: love and social interactions that would not have been possible as a royal family member. As the narrative progresses, Balsa's struggle and background story is revealed, which is a great addition to the anime. The remainder cast of the anime undergo certain character development to an extend, but nothing drastic.\\n\\n\r\nOne refreshing aspect of the characters was the fact that in this anime, there is a powerful, rational and strong willed female lead character, the opposite of the \"damsel in mistress\" characters in other anime. Not outstandingly beautiful and has its own flaws, leading to a more likeable and realistic female lead character.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Serei no Moribito is outstanding: spectacular backgrounds, well coloured and detailed; the same applies for the skies. The animated battle scenes are one of the best, if not very best, comparing with other anime: very fluid and realistic movements, leading to an overall very enjoyable experience. At times CG is present in the anime, though this was done only in certain occasions, and didn't interfere too much in the art style.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound used matches well with the different atmospheres it tried to portray, as well as giving an emotional touch to certain themes, making it easier for the spectator to perceive th characters emotions. The voice actors fulfilled their role well, though the variety in voices was not big, leading to a less unique touch to the characters.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nSeirei no Moribito was overall an enjoyable experience with fantastic animation and a non exaggerated story. Though the pacing of the story was slow and the potential of it not fully explored, I can recommend this anime to anyone with an interest in the fantasy genre or just wants to see something different. Be warned though, patience is a key factor in this anime to fully enjoy it, so if you are not the patient type, this may not be for you.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Moribito is one of those animes that would seem to be gender-neutral in regards to audience: too much action to be just for the girls, and not enough ecchi to be just for the guys.  But at the end of the day, I think this is one for the ladies.  While guys might be able to enjoy the (excellent) action scenes, sympathize with Chagum's plight, or appreciate Balsa's strength of character, they will probably not be able to understand the most important theme in the story: Motherhood.\r\nThis story is really about mothers, and what it means to be a mother.  And ifyou're a guy....I don't think you will be able to have that \"gut instinct\" that will help you understand and empathize with the roles of the characters.  First is the queen, the mother who gives up her beloved son.  Then Balsa, who becomes an adoptive mother.  Finally Chagum, who, though a boy, must take on the role of a surrogate mother (more on that later). \\n\\n\r\nAnd neither would you as the audience be able to share that fear related to a child in peril.  Wasn't your mother always telling you to not do something dangerous?  Probably all women share the same instinct to protect a child in danger, whether or not it is their own.  And most of the story revolves around a young boy who is in constant danger of being killed.  Balsa feels this instinct.  And female viewers will probably feel it too.  We'll probably have a strong attraction to this boy who we feel must be protected at all costs.\\n\\n\r\nThe world of the story mostly seems like it's set someplace in historical Asia, but some fantasy elements pop up now and then (nymphs, demons, parallel worlds).  Balsa is a seemingly emotionless woman who carries a short spear wherever she goes--and she knows how to use it.  After saving the life of a local prince when he nearly drowns, his mother the queen requests that she become Prince Chagum's bodyguard, and take him away from the palace.  Within the prince's body is what is believed to be the egg of a water demon, and if the egg should hatch, it would bring disaster on the kingdom.  Since the egg cannot be removed, the only way to prevent calamity on the nation is to kill the boy.  Of course, as a mother, she cannot leave her son to that fate.\\n\\n\r\nBalsa takes the job, saying that it will be her way to pay back a debt she has to save the lives of eight people, and flees the palace with the prince in tow.  The story continues from there, with Balsa and Chagum on the run from palace warriors sent out to kill the boy.  On their way, they seek the truth about the egg within his chest, and Balsa tries to turn the spoiled palace brat into \"real man.\"  \\n\\n\r\nThe action in the story is excellent.  The sword and spear fights are quite thrilling.  But they do not happen often.  If you start watching and get the idea that there is tons of great action, you will be disappointed during the middle of the series when there are long quiet stretches full of drama.  But in my opinion, it is better to have just a few excellently animated action sequences, then to have a pathetic action scene in every episode.  When they show up, they are really worth watching.  If you look at the story overall, the pacing is rather slow.  There is lots of talking, and long discussions at the palace, and dramatic parts (though they're good).  Maybe that helped make the ending all the more climactic.  Because the last few episodes were pretty thrilling, and they had me on edge.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't gotten the clue already, there is a fair amount of gender bending.  This is a fantasy world, so maybe that's why the men in the story are not very shocked at the idea of a woman warrior--though she is the only one we come across in the story.  Balsa's personality and carriage also seems rather mannish.  She has a deep voice, and usually seems heartless and emotionless.  But at a few times she betrays her feminine instinct and true feelings, usually as they relate to Chagum (though even he thinks that she doesn't care about him).  Chagum is a boy, but he carries an egg.  It may sound a little weird, but Chagum develops an affection for the egg, and pets his chest much like a pregnant woman pets her belly, and speaks of the egg fondly.  Tanda, Balsa's long-time friend, is our one and only love interest.  The poor fellow keeps dropping hints to Balsa that he wants to go deeper than their current platonic relationship, but they seem to all go over her head.  Tanda is a medicine-maker, and generally takes a passive roles in events, particularly when it comes to fighting.  It is he who stays at home like a worried wife, and frets when Balsa goes out with her spear to battle enemies.\\n\\n\r\nChagum has to go through the most character development.  He has lived his whole life as a pampered prince, with a loving mother and older brother.  Suddenly, his life is in danger from his cold father, and he is sent off in the night with a strange woman who is strict and never shows him any sort of affection.  It is only in the times he \"sasses\" or disobeys her that we see just how Balsa feels: That she really wants to do what is best for the prince, and help him grow.  He is put under particular stress when he discovers his frightening fate in regards to the egg, and turns on Balsa.  Only then, in the heat of the moment, does Balsa reveal her true affection for him.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the fantasy does not overbear on the story.  In certain respects, it resembles one of those fantasy animes with \"RPG worlds,\" full of clich\u00e9s.  Fortunately, it does not really fall into that category, and we are spared from magic battles with mages and hulking warriors who hurl spells and swing their swords while shooting  fire.  For a long period I even forgot that we were in a fantasy realm, it seemed so close to a historical world.  That makes the supernatural all the more mysterious, such as when we get a few brief glimpses into an almost eden-like parallel world.   And while it may have some clich\u00e9 \"magical\" characters, such as the medicine-woman or the star-reader, overall it does not feel stereotypical.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and character design is good, though perhaps a little unusual.  While the character design style is overall realistic, it is a little on the \"cute\" side, even for the male characters.  The eyes are small, looking realistic, but the rest of the features are softened and rounded.  With an overwhelmingly male cast, I think that again, it will appeal more to a female audience.  There is even a \"long-haired bishounen\" type character (the star-reader) who at least beats that sterotype by being plump-faced like everyone else, instead of pointy-chinned.  The prince and Tanda are pretty cute, as well as some of the dreaded warriors out to kill Balsa.  What female characters we have betray no ecchiness.  Unlike many female-warrior characters, she does not reveal much skin, and we almost never see any cleavage on her.  Even the one bathing scene in the show is not exploited for fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it: a fantasy-historical series about a woman who almost doesn't seem like one, but who in her own way discovers what it means to be a mother, and support her child who carries a heavy destiny.  Well-animated, with lovely music to boot, it is an engaging story alternating between action and drama, that has left me with that very satisfied feeling deep down inside.  And one I'd want to watch again.",

            "content": "Finishing Seirei no Moribito, or Guardian of the Sacred Spirit is much like finishing a good book that you just couldn\u2019t put down.  Once the journey is over, you realize how good the trip was and both enjoy what you watched, and feel sad that it\u2019s finally over.\r\nThe characters are the real draw of this particular show.  The main character Balsa is quite possibly the quintessentially perfect heroine.  The beautiful, middle aged spear wielder comes across as powerful and skilled right off the bat.  By the time the final episode comes to a close, Balsa has proven that she\u2019s more thanjust a powerfully skilled warrior though.  Her skill and strength with the spear are tempered by her level headedness, her intelligence and wit.  Add to that a deep sense of right, and a motherly instinct towards the young, and the whole package is undeniably one of the best new characters to grace anime in a long while, as well as perhaps one of the best anime female role-models ever in my opinion.  Some fans could argue that she\u2019s too good, as she really doesn\u2019t have any character flaws that I can think of.  But that\u2019s the way the cast is in this show.  Chagum and Tanda are very similar characters.  They may not have the same skills with a weapon and fighting that Balsa has, but they each have deep inner strength.  If you were to have to surmise the general theme of this particular show, it\u2019d be selflessness, as that\u2019s the trait that comes to be associated with so many of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe only downside to the show is the real lack of an antagonist.  Balsa is a truly masterful warrior, and while we get to see a few glimpses of how great she is, the series doesn\u2019t fall back on fighting to keep the viewers entertained, which means there aren\u2019t a great deal of fight scenes.  That\u2019s a shame, because the ones that you are given are incredible.  Production I.G. really made the fights with the spear a thing of beauty.  The fights are pure art, and one of the few complaints against this show is that there just aren\u2019t enough of them.  But that again falls back to the lack of an antagonist in the show.  Much of the series revolves around fighting fate, growing to accept ones responsibilities and maturing.  Those battles aren\u2019t ones that can be won in a fight.  Some might complain that it\u2019s a rather slow series, and in the middle it\u2019s hard to argue against that.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with a more intellectual series at all, but when your main character is one like Balsa, you really crave more fighting, just to see her in action.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the characters, the presentation of the show is top notch.  Beautiful and scenic views are presented a lot in the early and later episodes, when you\u2019re introduced to new places.  The middle struggles with this a bit as well, as the show hunkers down in one location for a bit.  But the animation of the characters is smooth and quality throughout.  The music is good, but doesn\u2019t stick with you after you\u2019ve finished watching the show.  Sweeping musical and orchestra portions do well to highlight a lot of the development going on and fit the time and location well, but this isn\u2019t a show that really lends itself to having a lot of catchy music that people will be singing afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Seirei no Moribito is a truly fantastic show.  The story is a solid one, although it tends to lag a bit in the middle, and lacks an antagonist that the viewers will want to see the heroes overcome.  As a more coming of age/fighting your destiny type of story, this show works great.  It\u2019s a shame we didn\u2019t get more scenes of Balsa fighting with her spear, as they rank amongst some of the best anime fights I\u2019ve ever seen.  When it\u2019s all said and done, Moribito leaves you with a good feeling, and a sadness that the journey is over.  Hopefully, as it\u2019s based on a series of novels, we\u2019ll see Balsa again in the future for more travels.",

            "content": "Going into this anime, I was expecting a lot from it. The director made GitS:SAC and that show is one of my favorite anime series of all time. This anime, however, was actually a bit of a let-down. The initial start of the series isn't too horrible, the first episode has quite a few significant plot elements introduced and many characters are discussed and introduced. However, one problem that was particularly persistent throughout the series was the lack of proper time management. \r\nYou see, every week I would watch 1 episode of this show because that was all that was available for me. That episodewould end, and I would have to wait for the next new episode. That generally isn't a problem with most series. However, Moribito has a problem with getting things accomplished in 1 episode that is of significance. For example, I remember the main protagonist being bed-ridden for about 2 episodes, which is quite a long time considering of the weekly break between each episode. Another example would be extremely long intro scenes for scenes that weren't very important overall. That made my enjoyment factor of this review very low, because I just couldn't get myself to enjoy this show with it's incredibly slow pace. This also lowered the &quot;story&quot; score, for it seemed as though the director didn't put enough emphasis on significant story events and put a lot in events with little importance.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great. However, the CG or 3d implementation was not. Frame rates of 3d animation were choppy and looked out of date. Also had a grainy texture to it. Sometimes deemed inconsistent with the 2d artwork. Background art was great as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound was pretty good, no real memorable melodies but it definitely added and didn't subtract from the experience. Was not a fan of opening cred or end cred songs however.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design was pretty good though there were some characters I felt that were almost ignored and seemed insignificant. However, that does not mean that the character design was at all flawed! In fact, it was probably it's strongest suit. \\n\\n\r\nI won't say it is a horrible show, but it is very slow paced and for me that is a BAD thing. Some people may enjoy that style, but I was very irritated by it. Maybe if I watched the series back after back without the week break it would feel like things were accomplished, however that would just mean that the director did not properly use his time.",

Albeit the beggining and the second half of the show are very well done and the pacing is good, the pacing throughout the middle is somewhat slow and the story seems more like an slice-of-life than an action show.\r\nArt (8/10): Overall the art was pretty good, specially the backgrounds and the fight scenes. \r\nSound (8/10): The OP and ED songs are very good,and most of the soundtracks used during  the episodes were also satisfying and matched with the scenes, but sometimes some of them felt misused or were not very pleasant to hear.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10): Most of the cast was charismatic and had a really good development.\\n\\n\r\nBalsa was a nice character, she's very well constructed and she is algo pretty strong and independent. It's also very nice how her relationship with Chagum is portrayed and the flashbacks about her childhood and adolescence (2 or 3 episodes) were not only important to show more about her past and to construct her character, but they also were very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nChagum, otherwise you may think at first, is not an arrogant and weak prince that we usually see on feudal stories, actually he's pretty strong and considerate to the others, and his character probably is the most developed of the cast. I find that it's very interesting how he learns to deal with the egg and the burden that he must carry.\\n\\n\r\nTanda, is a nice character and he was pretty useful to the story, specially towards the end. The romance between he and Balsa is nice and does not seems forced, but it is neither too developed nor constant during the show, so it may please those who do not seek romance and just want to watch an action show.\\n\\n\r\nTorogai was as interesting as Tanda and sometime delivered some kind of comic relief to the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(8/10): The more episodes I watched the more anxious I got to watch the next ones. Most of the episodes were pretty good, the action sequences were very nice, however they were rare.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10): I give this show a solid 8/10. Despite some flaws it had, it's very well done and may appeal to all kind of publics. If you are looking for an action show, go for it! And, if not, give it a chance!",

            "content": "Seirei no Moribito aka Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit, is like a calm mother preparing her child for the dark world around them. Calm, nurturing, but serious when it has to be. This show is definitely much more calming and peaceful than say, brutal and cynical shows like Fate/Zero and Attack on Titan, and melodramatic shows like Tokyo Ghoul and Gundam SEED. This show is not all sunshine and rainbows either like say, Haruhi. Many reviewers here give this series critical acclaim as a truly nice and well done 2007 series that deserved more attention than it got. So, did it really deserve the attentionthat many good '06 and '07 shows got, or did it deserve to be drowned out by its brethren? Let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIn feudal Japan, the young prince Chagum has seemingly been possessed by this \"water demon\" that is said to be responsible for droughts, and knowing what will happen to her son, the queen begs a humble traveling spear wielder named Balsa to take the child prince away until they find a way to banish the demon. She accepts, and the temple where they talked was burnt to a crisp, making the royals call her a criminal, so now both people have to accept their new circumstances while on the run from the Mikado's forces. It's interesting to note that this journey probably could've been finished in about 14-16 episodes. However, if they did, they wouldn't have time to do any world-building or flesh out the characters, which would've made the series far less impressive than it is, but even then, with the 26 episode slot, there are times where things get a bit dull and fillery for the sake of world-building, and as such meanders. Luckily, we get some nice in depth looks at Balsa's past and why she decided to take up the spear without killing anyone. Unfortunately, for an alarming period of time, there seems to be no clear end goal or true antagonist, minus the Mikado's forces getting in the way a few times here and there. However, the final act rolls around, and you can see what they were methodically building up to, and while it is an interesting reveal and sequence of events that DOSEN'T go the whole \"it was just some narcissistic douchebag pulling the strings all along\" route, it definitely sets itself up in a way that it almost feels like either a sequel bait, or a \"they live to go on a new journey/and they live to fight another day\" thing. You can pick either or, but I like to go with the latter.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with Balsa. Balsa...is amazing. This show gives a more realistic look to its characters, like back in the '90's, and she is beautiful. As for her character, she is a total badass, but at the same time, she is merciful, sorta like Batman. Her father died when she was like 6, so she was forced to travel with an equally awesome and badass spear-wielder maned Jiguro that way the people behind her father's death don't end up killing her too. Both of them bond over the years, and we can definitely see how Jiguro rubbed off on her, as both characters are wonderful people. Chagum, is a homesick kid who manages to adapt to his new environment surprisingly well, even if his homesickness eventually overtakes him. The other side characters are nice as well. There is one issue though. We never actually see much development. The actions are a direct response from a character's backstory, but these characters never actually develop into slightly improved or different people. Even some of the royals, Warriors, and star-readers never really develop, but instead have pure consistancy with their actions due to their background, only changing tasks as a response to the bigger picture unfolding.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLet's get this out of the way. The CGI in this show varies in quality. Sometimes, it can look fine and complement the scene. Sometimes, it can be downright jarring. As for the character models, they look like a more polished version of the more realistic look used in many '90's anime films, and this style is actually rather rare Sith very few popular examples aside from Ghost in The Shell or Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress for an example more akin to this artstyle. The fight scenes look gorgeous. The choreography and fluidity of the fights is astounding, and at points, can be breath-taking just to see how well done these spear and sword clashes are done. Even some of the spirits and creatures look rather good as well. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP done by L'arc en ciel, is a nice and calming OP, fitting considering the nature of this show, ableit, the opening isn't truly amazing, but is nice nonetheless. The ED is just plain forgettable and meh. The OST, dosen't have anything truly memorable, but the pieces do go well with the situations and atmospheres present in the show. Now, the dub, is also good. Balsa's portrayed brilliantly, and everyone else does so a mostly good job, even if it is weird seeing Yuri Lowenthal and Johny Yong Bosch playing a teenager and Chagum's brother respectively. Nothing groundbreaking in either part of sound, but it's pleasant nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThat's a good way to describe this show: pleasant. Normally with this type of series, you'd see far more angst and bloodshed than what's being presented here. However, some episodes do get a bit boring, and a bit on the simple-minded and childish side, but overall, the great fight scenes really made up for that. I can at least say that I was mostly entertained and lulled. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10   RAW SCORE: 8.33/10\\n\\n\r\nYou can't help but wonder how a show like this never really got talked about much in the anime community. It is definitely a calming series, and at times, a slow burn [(props to anyone who understands this term before I explain it) (slow burn is when some scenes are deliberately boring in order to slow things down and break up the more intense moments of a story)], but this is definitely a series I can recommend to anyone looking for something a bit different, or something in a more feudal era. With that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "Based on a novel of the same name: Guardian of the Sacred Spirit is definitely a pearl of Adventure/Fantasy Anime genre.  Its beauty lies in top-notch art and animation, attention to detail and amazingly absorbing story. This review is mostly a recommendation so I\u2019ll avoid spoilers and instead try to convince you to give it a chance as the serie NEEDS to become more popular.\r\nThe journey begins in a fantasy world, where two co-existing \u2018sub-worlds\u2018 hold nature in balance. It\u2019s the time of sword and spear, where conspiracy and assassination attempts happen on daily basis. It\u2019s a setting like no other (even though familiarto some in the long run, like Princess Mononoke) , at times it can seem like an old tale about warriors, kings and guardians, but then soon after it turns to a man versus nature battleground. There are many faces to the story, it\u2019s complex and unique. The landscapes are colorful, full of life and beauty: Many times it felt similar to the great serie Mushishi when it came to the aspect of nature and the whole second world that only some people are able to see and try to bring balance to.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a tale about magic though. If anything, there\u2019s slight druidism and ever so popular in Japanese culture: Spirits. It all belongs to nature, so there are no wands and casting random spells with them to defeat foes. It all goes down to communication with the hidden world and obtaining knowledge. The fighting scenes make sense, there aren\u2019t random power-ups because it\u2019s not a shounen. It\u2019s all about talent and experience with the weapon.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I explained the setting, let\u2019s move on to the plot. The story shows a harsh reality, the young prince has a strange creature\u2019s egg laid inside his soul and the only people capable of even grasping the concept of spirits in the Empire are Star Diviners who are pretty much the priests that spend their time exploring the world\u2019s lore. They don\u2019t seek knowledge from other nations and so there\u2019s a lot of misunderstanding coming out of their ignorance. They easily came to the conclusion that prince has been possessed with a demon that\u2019s supposed to bring drought to the land and since the the commoners mostly rely on rice as the food supply, lack of water would kill millions of people. That\u2019s a risk that the emperor can\u2019t take and therefore orders the assassination of the prince. That\u2019s where the Spearwielding female warrior comes in. Balsa is a traveling guardian for hire, as she made an oath to save eight souls and as it turns out, saving the young prince would be the final. Why would she make a promise like that? That\u2019s for you to find out. I can only say that even though the first episodes make the Anime seem gloomy: it really isn\u2019t. Just look at the images, there\u2019s A LOT of beautiful scenery involved that you won't see even in the most of the modern shows.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is wonderful for many reasons: It shifts the atmosphere and turns around many times, while staying action-packed and interesting all the way through. Even in the most calm episodes of the serie there\u2019s always something major happening. It\u2019s a one, long, thoughtful chain of events that leads to a greatly satisfying ending. The other thing I really enjoyed were the little side-plots. A good example would be the Blacksmith and the ultimate sword, the Anime needs your full attention so you can actually see that these small parts of the story don\u2019t disappear, that\u2019s the attention to detail. Some of the mysteries stayed as mysteries, but others were subtly ended in such a soft manner that you might not even notice \u2013 and if you ask me, that\u2019s one huge reason to rewatch the serie at some point.\\n\\n\r\nFinally I\u2019d like to tell you that Seirei no Moribito mainly focuses on the moral dilenmas (like taking human's life), conflict with nature, fate and people\u2019s ignorance. So it\u2019s definitely a journey worth attending for everyone who likes great storytelling together with unique fantasy setting and beautifully developping characters. I wish I could say more, but to avoid ruining the experience I will stop here.. That pearl is for you to take,  you just need to be open-minded enough to try.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Boribito is the most overrated anime here.\r\nNo interesting characters. Boring fights. Retarded shounen-like plot: there is a crying pussy prince and there is his bodyguard. Actually, most good shounens have much more interesting stories. Typical \"ancient Asia\" atmosphere: rice fields, tea ceremonies and all that crap we have seen thousands of times (ofc ordinary villagers have brand new clothes and modern age houses). Omg, nobody gives a shit about this \"ancient Asia\" culture; medieval Europe, for example, is much more interesting. \r\nApparently, this anime tries to be \"deep\". But it's not. All characters seem to be emotionless robots, include the main hero. If you likestaring at rice fields and tea ceremonies all the time go for it. Just don't expect to find something \"deep\" or philosophical because this anime is just another shitty samurai action animation. We don't see here drama, we don't see here comedy, we don't see here tragedy. Actually, we don't see any strong emotions at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt is pretty good. Music is fine.\\n\\n",

            "content": "While the series had moments of brilliance and some superb fight scenes, Moribito as an overall anime fell flat for a number of reasons. Probably the main one was that I never really got into the characters, which never led to the \"addiction\" phase that you get with many animes. Truth be told, I struggled to finish the series despite how much I liked the choreography of the fight scenes and the setting. And despite the effort they put into building Balsa, she just didn't feel believable to me.\r\n**spoilers\r\nThe story of Moribito is strange in that it starts off with an intense series of eventswhich leads to a very prolonged lull in the action in the middle of the series, where Balsa and Chagum are living in Yogo and while other characters are trying to figure out whether the prince is actually dead (from the palace side) and what the deal is with the egg. While there were some interesting moments introduced through this arc of the story, I felt that it was much longer than necessary. For example, I think that pretty much all the content on Saya and Touya (the orphan twins) could have been cut, because they added nothing to the main story. They could have cut 2-3 episodes of Chagum sidestory content without any consequence to the plot. If they really wanted to cut the fat, they also could have cut down some of the lengthy scenes involving Torogai (the old lady).\\n\\n\r\nI often say that shows are too short for their ambitions, but in this case I really feel that this show could have done fine with 13 episodes. The filler didn't add anything to the story, and just made it harder to trudge along the slowest parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt was phenomenal, especially the spear-dueling scenes. The scenery was very solid, the characters looked distinct and interesting, and honestly I can't find anything to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nSound... Nothing really stuck out to me in the sound department this time. I don't recall any moments where I even took notice of the soundtrack. I will note that Balsa's Japanese voice actor (I watched subs) did a good job doing a deep and threatening female voice. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters -- definitely not something this show did particularly well. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, Balsa didn't feel believable to me in that her motivations were far too one-dimensional and simplistic, and even at the end of the series we see almost no development/change in her despite all the events of the show. She was just TOO stoic, showing literally no moments of weakness throughout the entire show or any wants or desires outside of her mission to save Chagum.\\n\\n\r\nChagum had some growth that didn't surmount to anything in the final episodes, or even in the epilogue really.\\n\\n\r\nTanda was an incredibly passive character that actually felt sort of like a real person, because of how badly he got friendzoned by Balsa throughout the entire show. I'm glad that he didn't get a backstory episode because even the producer knew it would be too boring. Same for Shuga.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the weird pacing of the show, the superfluous content, and the uninteresting nature of the characters I feel that the show really bombed in the enjoyment category during my run-through. \"Boribito\" indeed",

            "content": "'Moribito - Guardian of the Spirit' is gorgeous, through and through, and just a wonderful experience. It is a show that gave me a warm fuzzy feeling that only those types of fantasy stories can deliver, its production value and characters are outstanding and create something that is just pure enjoyment. \r\nHowever, one thing that 'Guardian of the Spirit' is not is an action show. People claim it is one for some weird reason, but if you watch it with those expectations you will probably be disappointed. Fight scenes are few and far between, and everything is surprisingly non-violent. No, this is a show aboutcharacters growing and getting closer to each other, and those scenes are wonderfully drawn and set to fantastic music. The Anime is simply so good because it is just so very beautiful, it's really something to get immersed in. It gets dramatic in parts, but is also peaceful and calm, it is basically a nine hour Studio Ghibli movie, especially reminiscent of 'Princess Mononoke'.\\n\r\nSadly it's not quiet as good as that, and there are a few factors that keep it from being a masterpiece.     \\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10\\n\\n\r\nGuardian of the Spirit has a story that lives through its characters. And the characters are really awesome, but the plot, ehh, not so much. It's the weak point of the Anime, it's good, but not great and kind of pales in the comparison to everything else.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is about Balsa, the female bodyguard, who one day rescues Chagum, the prince of the royal family, from an assassination attempt and gets tasked by his mother to protect him by taking him far away from the royal palace. So the both of them set off on their eventful journey. Now this plot is really just a frame for the characters, because what this story is really about is Chagum growing up and about Balsa starting to act like a mother towards him. The characters are highly enjoyable and the last episode, which acts more like an epilogue than a final, is a great conclusion to their change and relationship and is bittersweet and tear-jerking in that really good way long stories are when they're finished and you realize it's time to say goodbye.\\n\\n\r\nNow while the characters have a nice resolution, the biggest problem of the show is that the plot, meaning the things that actually happen, doesn't. The show had its quality peak at episode 22, and than episodes 23-25 came, and they were kind of a disappointment. See, those episodes are the conclusion to the plot, while episode 26 is a conclusion to the characters. It's like in the third 'Lord of the Rings' movie, the ring getting destroyed and Sauron getting defeated is the conclusion to the plot, while all the stuff that happens afterwards (that idiots might call boring) is the conclusion to the characters. So what's the problem?\\n\\n\r\nLet me explain, there is a great danger for the characters in 'Guardian of the Spirit', it is what drives them forward, and than these final episodes come around, and the conflict just kind of ends. Just like that. This problem was build up for the entirety of the show, but the resolution wasn't. It just gets resolved. It seemed like the characters just found the solution lying around somewhere. All that build up was wasted. The final seemed rushed and underwhelming, and is not worthy being called a climax, and not worthy of the rest of this great show, it was just bad writing. It's like when you masturbate and your catholic foster parents come home and you have to quickly stop and can't even ejaculate.\\n\\n\r\nWhat will you remember most about a show? Obviously the last couple of episodes, because they are the last thing you watched. So if those are not as good as the rest (and I'm not saying they are bad), it just leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I would rather have the beginning be not as good but then have the ending be fantastic. Again, the epilogue episode kind of made up for it, but a great final like in 'Fullmetal Alchemist' or 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' would have been the icing on the cake here, it would have made this a masterpiece, but sadly it was not to be. It was like the writers didn't even use all the potential they had, and when I re-watch the show sadly it's just not gonna be as exciting because I know the plot is kinda hollow.\\n\\n\r\nNow obviously it's not all bad though, to the show's credit there is some nice foreshadowing (especially a scene concerning a certain bird that ate to many stones), and until the climax happens the plot is kinda good, but also a bit simplistic and bland. The story doesn't have a real villain, which is actually a nice change from standard fantasy cliches, but it is also kind of frustrating how this show really goes out of its way to avoid conflicts ending in violence, and how literally almost every human acts to the best of his knowledge and abilities. I dunno, maybe today's grim media has just made me cynical, but sometimes things felt a bit contrived, like everything worked out just by talking and a bit to well to be believable. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is very relaxed, things happen slowly, and I like that. However, when an action scene actually does happen it is very tense, and people don't just shrug off their injuries. But again, it's not a show about fighting, it's a laid-back show that's mostly about nice Asian countrysides and people growing closer to each other, and if you like that sort of thing, and I do, it's pretty easy to look over the fact that the plot is not the most original.  \\n\\n\r\nThe fantasy world this story takes place in is a nice mix of a bunch of East Asian cultures, it's not just China and Japan, which is the usual Far Eastern setting, but there are also a lot of Tibetan influences which is something you don't see all that much. Like the rest of the show, the world building is also pretty \u201crelaxed\u201d, meaning there aren't giant wars or dragons or wizards that throw fireballs at each other, it's understated which is something you don't see all that often in fantasy and makes it all the more enjoyable, it isn't some cliched garbage. The world does feel incredibly alive which can mostly be attributed to the fantastic animation that makes it seem so very vibrant. It is also filled with some incredibly fun details, like the fact that commoners believe they die when they look into the eyes of a royal, which is something that perfectly fits the egocentric real life emperors of ancient East Asia.   \\n\\n\r\nArt 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is gorgeous! So, so gorgeous. Among the best animation I have ever seen. \\n\r\nThe backgrounds look fantastic, each one of them is basically an awesome landscape painting by itself, looking like it has been drawn with an actual paintbrush. They capture autumn forests, peaceful villages, ragged mountains and rolling hills just perfectly, with vibrant colors and unmatched detail. Trees have individual leafs, the night sky reflects in the water of the rice fields, grass are actual blades of grass instead of a plain of green smudges, clouds look incredibly realistic and come in so many different shapes and forms, sometimes the stars twinkle instead of being a static background image, every single frame is filled with a love and care that I have rarely seen elsewhere. \\n\\n\r\nSpecial mention goes to the fighting choreography, which is also among the best that ever was. Fight scenes are very costly to animate, because there is a lot of movement, so most animators just cheapen out, which means that they do things like: draw lines instead of a background to imply movement, just show a moving fist instead of the whole body, show multiple still frames like in a comic or a combination of the above. It makes most action scenes in Anime kind of lame to me. But not in 'Guardian of the Spirit', instead they present us fight scenes that are smooth as silk and get your blood pumping. These scenes are a rare treat, I think there are only three or four of them in the show, but man did they make my jaw drop. They don't cut away from anything, when the characters move we see every part of their bodies actually move, no cheap tricks, and they move so fast and smooth that it leaves you breathless. They jump around, duck, stab, dodge, punch and all of it is fully animated, they don't skip frames, it looks like it would in a live action Wuxia movie, like something straight out of  'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', and it's just fucking awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one slight downer though. Sometimes they use CGI. Now I'm not a fan of CGI in general, but I do get why it had to be used in this show sometimes. Like, when you have a thousand soldiers doing a parade and each one carries a spear, that might be a bit to costly to draw. Most of the time the CGI is tasteful enough, meaning it doesn't stand out, but sometimes it just does, and that's frustrating, because the rest of the animation is so wonderful. A bunch of monsters in the final episodes looked especially bad, and they kept switching between a drawn and CGI version which makes it ever more noticeable(made the final episodes even more disappointing). That's a small distraction though, the rest of the time the animation is utterly fantastic.     \\n\\n\r\nThe food looks delicious, people actually leave tracks in mud or snow, the wind blows in their hair and tugs at their clothing, movements looks realistic, animals look great, the art is simply the star of the show, it turns it into a sensory experience where you just want to soak in the wonderful images that are being presented to you. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music is terrific. Combined with the great animation it creates moments of exceptional beauty, it makes \u201cmundane\u201d scenes like walking through a rice field or spending winter in a cave become wonderful with its atmospheric and peaceful East Asian sound and it makes the real emotional moments carry an even bigger punch. My favorite piece of the soundtrack would be the beautiful \u201cNahji no Uta\u201d.  The only thing I disliked about the music is the intro theme, like, maybe I just don't get it, but who thought that bland J-Pop somehow fits this medieval fantasy world? It's not my type of music anyway, so maybe I'm biased, but it just seems stupid. I mean I can skip it, so it isn't a big deal, but that could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial mention has to go to the voice actress of Balsa (in the Japanese version), because she's magnificent. Her deep voice perfectly fits the character, and when she gets loud or screams at someone in anger it sounds actually threatening. All the voice acting is pretty top-notch, screaming, crying, it all sounds convincing and no line stood out as being bad. \\n\\n\r\nCombine that with great realistic sound effects and you have a feast for the ears, combine that with the great animation and you have a show with unmatched production value.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBalsa, the main character of this show, is pretty unique in the world of Anime, and it makes me very happy that not every animated woman has to be some 10 year old cute girl. The best way to describe her would be: \u201cfucking awesome\u201d. She's quiet hardened and a great fighter, she isn't some hotheaded rash caricature, but instead smart and mature, but she isn't a super badass in some horrible exaggerated way either, she's just real. She feels incredibly relatable. That's also because her design is so great. She's actually muscular, you know, like a warrior would be. And she isn't some beautiful woman either, she just looks normal and she's 29 years old, which in a medium populated by teenager characters is a godsend. Seriously one of the strongest and best female characters that this medium has ever produced, I consider the episodes where we learn about her past to be the high point of the series.\\n\\n\r\nChagum could have easily been stock character type 12B: \u201cThe Spoiled and Annoying Prince\u201d, but he isn't. He's lived in his palace his entire live and because of that has no idea of the outside world, but he's actually willing to learn and he does, and changes over the course of the show. The relationship between Balsa and Chagum is absolutely wonderful as she starts acting more and more motherly towards him. Some of the scenes between the two have some real great emotional weight behind them and are really where the heart of the show lies. It actually gets tear-jerking sometimes,  especially the ending is wonderful in that regard. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I really like is the \u201cromance\u201d, because of how subtle it was and that it ended unconventionally but in a way that totally fit the characters. The assassins that get send after Chagum in the beginning are also pretty great because they act like real humans and aren't even really the \u201cbad guys\u201d in a traditional sense. Even the comic relive character (the grandma) wasn't annoying, and normally I'm really allergic against those. In fact, the few comedic moments that are in the show made me chuckle and not role my eyes, which is a nice change. Now of course those side characters are not as well developed as the two protagonists, because those two make this show what it is, and you really do get so attached to them that it's just sad when it's over.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part this show is just the shit. Great characters, great emotional moments, outstanding production, it rises above the murky sea of trash that is most anime, it's just a beautiful adventure. Watch it!\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI'll protect you no matter what. [\u2026] Even if it costs me my life, I won't let you die!\u201d",

            "content": "This review will mention spoilers. Do not read if you have not yet seen the show.\r\nThe story of Moribito centers around Balsa, a female bodyguard who is tasked with the protection of Chagum, a young prince who is being hunted down by his own people. Together, they must evade the elite hunters chasing after them, learn to live as peasants, while also investigating the secrets of the mysterious water spirit whose egg resides within Chagum.\r\nFrom start to finish, this 24 episode series adapts only a single novel from the Moribito books. Thus, it\u2019s no surprise that the pacing of the show can appear as beingquite slow. The central plot is spread quite thinly over the 2 cour run, and even then a fair number of episodes need to be dedicated to filler content. Fortunately, Moribito is somehow able to turn its length into an advantage. The slow pacing allows increased time to develop the characters and flesh out the world in which the series takes place. The many slice-of-life style episodes near the middle of the series may not advance the plot, but they do play a part in the overall experience. For example, the episode where Chagum takes on some roadside gamblers gives us insight into the lives of the peasants, while also building up Chagum as a prince who is willing to stand up for others and fight against opposition using his own personal strengths. In other episodes, the show humbly presents further details, such as the minimalist splendor of the palace, the bustle of the marketplace, and the lively festivals of the farmers. Together, these small things manage to create an engrossing setting that truly feels real.\\n\\n\r\nThe central plot is, well, not particularly impressive. Balsa and Chagum\u2019s initial escape from the manhunt is exciting, but the subsequent developments and revelations involving the water spirit are not particularly engaging. The reason for this fault lies in the fact that these developments are often delivered through very utilitarian and flat dialogue. Torogai talks to the water people and they happily tell her what she wants to know. The group travels to a Yaku village where a girl tells them about the egg-eater. When Shuga appears, Torogai tell Shuga what she knows and sends him off to do research. When they meet again, Shuga shares what he has learned by, yup, straight up telling the others. The show may be trying to emphasize a tradition of storytelling and passing of culture through generations, but it\u2019s not worth it. This sort of overly effective communication causes the story to completely avoid conflict at times, making those particular scenes anticlimactic, and possibly even boring at times. (the master star reader\u2019s confrontation with Shuga, Torogai and Shuga at the village)\\n\\n\r\nDespite the weakness of the overarching plot, the show manages to redeem itself through its characters. The two main protagonists in particular, Balsa and Chagum, really managed to shine throughout the show. Balsa is a mature woman, a sort of character that rarely takes the spotlight in an anime. She is strong willed, dedicated, and her commitment to save 8 lives gives her a very convincing reason for protecting Chagum. This becomes even more apparent when we are given her back-story with Jiguro, and see that Balsa once held Chagum\u2019s same position. Clearly, she understands very well what it\u2019s like to be the one being protected, giving her character a dimension beyond a mere bodyguard.\\n\\n\r\nChagum himself is also a very likeable character. Though he may be a prince, he is humble enough that he takes to like life of a peasant without complaint. As the series progresses, we see him develop as he opens up to the other characters and faces internal conflicts due to his destiny as guardian of the spirit. When he tries to run away he shows his childish side, acting as if he has given up on Balsa\u2019s protection and conceded to the prospect of his own death. However Balsa has not yet given upon him and makes it very clear when she chases after him. When Chagum learns of Balsa\u2019s past, he becomes much more willing to fight for both his own life, and the life of the egg within him. His final moments with Balsa were both satisfyingly bittersweet while showing how much he had matured.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values of the show were quite strong throughout. Visually, the show is a pleasure to look at. The art design takes great care in detailing the nature of the land and culture of many different types of people. Fight scenes are scarce but the few battles the show does include are very well executed. Actions are carefully choreographed and smoothly animated. Outside of these action scenes, the animation isn\u2019t particularly noteworthy. The music is pleasant to listen to, and its clear East Asian inspirations further enhance the setting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while I thought some plot elements were developed blandly, the immersive setting and characters still drew me in, and gave me overall a very enjoyable experience that I would gladly recommend to others.\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nSeirei no Moribito is regarded by many as a classic and i understand why it is so highly praised. However, i seem to not enjoy these so-called \"classics\" as much as everyone else. Cowboy Beebop, NGE, Berserk, Seirei no Moribito are all considered masterpieces of their time, but they all have flaws that apparently didn't bother most of their viewers. However, they did bother me, so in this review i'll mostly be talking about the aspects that i didn't enjoy about Seirei no Moribito, since the strong points of this anime have already been talked about plenty of times.\r\nFirst of all, iwill briefly go over what i liked about this anime. The story was very well written and interesting. I liked the fact that it was fairly simple and didn't try to overcomplicate itself by introducing unnecessary characters and plot points. I also like how fantasy elements were slowly introduced into the story, even though at first it seemed like a realistic historical anime. The characters, while being few in numbers, were all memorable and recieved fair ammounts of development (most notably Chagum). Animation was solid all the way and the art style was fitting for the tone of the show. And finally, the music is by far the strongest point of this anime, it really gave me the impression that the story takes place during a mythical age that is beyond time itself. Traditional instruments combined with children voices were the perfect choice for this anime and they truly defined the whole atmosphere of the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow that i've got those out of the way, i will elaborate on the aspects that i didn't enjoy.\\n\\n\r\n1. The action was underwhelming. Maybe it's just me, but i expected a lot more action in an anime that is tagged action/adventute and features a skilled spear wielder as its main character. However, there were only 3 memorable action scenes in all 26 episodes, 2 of which were only flashbacks and din't involve Balsa. This was very disappointing for me because of one reason: i really like Balsa's character. She is a true badass when it comes to fighting, but her fighting prowess was never explored to its fullest. I really wanted to see more from the female bodyguard and i think this anime would've been much better if it was about Balsa's past, when she killed many people while working as a bodyguard. The climax of the series was also disappointing, as i was expecting it to end with an intense battle of life and death.\\n\\n\r\n2. I never felt any suspense. Troughout the entirety of this anime i never felt like any character was in any real danger. Most human to human conflicts were solved without violence, which ties in to my previous problem, the lack of action. And when an entire army being sent to fight supernatural beings, you expect at least a few people to die, but in the end everyone was perfectly safe. the only significant character death (which i'm not gonna spoil) was very lame and didn't make much sense. This lack of death and tension in a series with such a mature premise made me feel like it wasn't taking itself seriously enough.\\n\\n\r\n3. The pacing. I'm not gonna criticize the pacing for being slow, because that would be silly, but in an action/adventure anime, slow pacing is normally used to prepare the viewer for an intense climax that is paced slightly faster than the rest of the show, \"the calm before the storm\" as one might say. This wasn't the case with Seirei no Moribito. It started off strong but slowed down significantly in the middle and disappointingly didn't pick up the pace towards the end. It took  me quite a while to finish the whole series, as i was watching 1 or 2 episodes before losing interest and coming back to it the next week. Considering that the story is fairly simple and the characters are few, i think it could've easily been pulled off in 13 episodes, by removing the filler episodes and speeding up the dialogue and character movements.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, this is more of a nitpick, but i felt like Chagum's behaviour was unnatural and hard to believe. Given his circumstances, i expected him to whine and complain about every little thing because he was raised in a palace and wasn't used to this new lifestyle. Instead, he was surprisingly calm and well behaved the whole time. It might seem counter-intuitive, but i wish he was more annoying.\\n\\n\r\nIs it worth watching? Of course it is. However, don't expect to be blown away if you're one of those people with short attention spans that prefer intense and dramatic action. I recommend it for more experienced viewers.",

            "content": "I don't think I've ever come across a series--anime or otherwise--as beautifully written, well organized, and emotionally captivating as Seirei no Moribito. Like anything, it has its flaws, but they are minor when compared to the strong characterization, stunning animation, and intricate plot. This series was, without a doubt, created with love and devotion, and it certainly shows. \r\nThe writing is fantastic, with small details brought up throughout the series, addressed briefly, and dismissed--only to become main elements later on. For example, a bird mentioned in a story told to flesh out a pivotal side character becomes final key to fulfilling the characters' mission, etc.The use of foreshadowing is beautiful, and there was absolutely no \"Deus Ex Machina\" in terms of how the setting and world, or how the plot moves forward. \\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist, too, was a breath of fresh air. Far removed from the trend in most animes to objectify female characters, Seirei no Moribito was realistic and empowering right up to the very last scene. The protagonist is a strong, female warrior whose gender rarely, if ever, has any bearing on her actions or the story itself. Opponents didn't seek her out for revenge because they lost to a woman, but because they were spared by someone so strong. Clients didn't shy a way from hiring her because of who she is, but rather flock to her services because of her skills. Even the one brief scene in a hot springs is handled exceptionally well, with the women wrapped in towels so the viewers focus is pulled exclusively to the emotional dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nEven the pacing is done well. The series takes places over a long period of time, so naturally there will be moments of peace in the characters lives. But even these \"slice-of-life\" moments move the plot forward, offering the writers a unique opportunity to build the characters' relationships, characterizations, and personal strengths. And episodes that in any other series would be plot-irrelevant fillers play key roles is driving the action. For example, the oft-used anime \"festival\" filler becomes a pivotal moment in the characters' lives, bringing about an urgent need to abandon their home and move forward to find the next answer to the series' overarching questions. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself is absolutely stunning. Every landscape is beautiful, and the series as a whole is an aesthetic masterpiece. The fight scenes, too, are unparalleled. Unlike many action series, there is no \"movement blur\" used to make battles more \"intense\" without animating the fight itself. In Seirei no Moribito, each individual movement is animated and realistic, each character has a unique fighting style that is seen rather that \"told\", and each battle is still as emotionally-charged as any high-intensity overpowered shounen showdown--perhaps even more so. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is unmatched. I have never watched anything like it in terms of overall quality, and I doubt I will in the near future.",

            "content": "I feel foolish even trying to write down how good this series actually is.  Nothing I can write will truely adhere to the beauty, and awesome splendor that this series is.  This is the first review I am writing for a series that I consider to be a genuine masterpiece.\r\nThe first aspect I fell in love with is the crystal-like and pure animation style.  The minute detail in every cel draws the viewer into a world unlike any seen before.  Each blade of grass dances with ten thousand others during a spring breeze.  The clouds slowly thicken, shreaded with dozensof shades of whites and greys, threatening rain.  The mountains, towns, forests, and rivers are given a life of their own.  It was drawn so vividly that the viewer is brought back in time, to feudal Japan, and gets to experiance it first hand.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themself are another addition to this series' wonderfulness.  The beautifully clean, crisps lines detailing their original costumes, faces, and expressions are only strenghten by perhaps the best voice acting in anime history.  Each individual character has strenghts and weaknesses that the viewer can relate to and empathize with.  They are surrounded with difficult situations and deal with each in a calm and well-thought-out manner.\\n\\n\r\nBalsa (our heroine), was so beautiful, strong and kind, with a thoughness usually found in the stronger sex.  Her love interest (though not specificlly so) Tanda, was a perfect counterbalance to her.  Intellegent, submissive and knowlegable, he was the only one who could talk Balsa down from bad decisions.  The child prince left in Balsa's care, Chagum, was portrayed perfectly.  Slowly growing up and into a new world he knows nothing about.  And finally Torogai, a spell-weidling old hag, skilled in both magic and fighting.  She added the perfect amount of humor, and was a little too fond of the drink.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, in my opinion, is where this anime stands in a league all of its own.  Each epiosde furthers the plot slowly, ensuring the viewer can take in all the events that are occuring while still leaving the slight hint of whats to come next.  Characters are introduced at a comfortable rate, never overwhelming the viewer with new faces and names, and many secondary and tirtiary characters continue the adventure throughout the entire series.  On top of that, the originallity of the series was a welcome bonus too.  Rarely do we have a heroine, a skilled martial-arts expert, who refuses to kill an enemy, dispite being put in dire situations.  Her conviction to her cause, saving lives instead of taking them, was a interesting take, especially during a time where death and murder was almost commonplace.\\n\\n\r\nMy absolute favorite thing about this series was it's fight scenes, and this series had many.  The fluidity of the art obviously inhanced the experiance, but what I liked was the unique weapons that were utilized.  The spear is an under-rated weapon.  However, when used by someone who has mastered every technique, the enjoyment of watching it is signifitantly increased.\\n\\n\r\nI love this series too much to find even one flaw in its unblemished quality.  The series has interesting and unique characters, an art style second to none, fight scenes worth rewinding, and a plot unlike any other.  If these are what you look for in a series, then this one is for you.",

            "content": "Seirei no Moribito tells the story of Balsa is hired by Chagum\u00b4s mother of Yogo kingdom to protect his son. That's because a spirit that lays egg every 100 years kept the egg inside the prince. Now, the two will go through many adventures and obstacles.\r\nSTORY: (8.5/10)\r\nPrinciple, the story is a little strange based on a novel, but then you watch, you realize that in fact some events have meaning. The actions of the characters are consistent and there is no nonsense. At the beginning the story is a little slow, but then it accelerates as things are happening.\r\nIf the first half of the scriptis slow in the second half it is balanced. Thanks also to the development of the characters (Balsa and Chagum) and secondary characters (the army of Yogo and Tanda)\\n\\n\r\nThe direction of the Seirei Moribito is very good, since the action scenes until the scenes of slice of life. The direction also knew enough to explore the environment from the city until the borders.\\n\\n\r\nART: (7/10)\\n\r\nAbout art and animation: the animation is average, but nothing to erase the brightness of the work. The animation isn\u00b4t a highlight in Seirei no Moribito, but it's not bad.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: (8/10)\\n\r\nThe work of art has a good opening and a good ending. If you hear or read the words to the opening, you will feel that it is the interpretation of the story talking about freedom represented by the eagle's wings. The sound track sounds good too.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: (10/10)\\n\r\nThat's the best part. Balsa does not fit the stereotype of the female characters. Balsa is charismatic, decisive, determined and does not need man to protect her. At the beginning of the anime, the character hesitates a little to protect the boy. But then she feels affection and treats him as a son. Throughout the story, you will see the Balsa\u00b4s past. We will see that from childhood, she is accustomed to fighting alone since her parents died. Who taught Balsa to defend was the her father\u00b4s friend . The ending was satisfying and I was happy for her to seek a different and unconventional way. It is not necessary to have children and get married.\\n\\n\r\nChagum was a character who at first was not so catchy. But we must consider that he was a spoiled child and he was raised in the kingdom. His parents have always been protectionist. However, that changes when Chagum knows the world and begins to experience the kingdom\u00b4s  culture that until then he did not know. The prince learned a lot from Balsa, including to defend. In the end, it was a great life lesson. If the egg had never entered it?\\n\\n\r\nEven the king's army and Shuga are developed At first they were only thinking of the kingdom and obeying the king. Then go on to consider the feelings of Chagum and help him what it takes. Torogai was a very useful and important character.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Seirei in Moribito despite not getting much in the secondary characters, there are good characters and their actions are consistent\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: (7.5/10)\\n\r\nOn the issue of entertainment, Seirei no Moribito was more or less. There are some slow episodes, but I understand that were episodes that were the basis for a consistent plot.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: (9/10)\\n\r\nIt was gratifying to watch 26 episodes. If you like adventure, action, fantasy, surely enjoy anime. I also recommend for those who like characters out of the standard and who wish to animes with older characters, making the more mature storyline.",

            "content": "Now that I think about it, this may be the first anime series I've seen. Albeit I only saw a handful of episodes at the time, and given that it's been nearly a decade since then, I figured it was about time I give this series another watch.\r\nI remembered Guardian of the Spirit for its intense action scenes. Although on my re-watch I find them far and few between, they are certainly welcome when they happen. The fight scenes are fast and well-choreographed. While I wouldn't call them over-the-top, they have a surprising flare you might not expect in an otherwise mellow anime. I shouldprobably comment on the spear as well: I adore the implementation of the spear as a primary weapon in this anime. As a trope, it is not the conventional weapon you would expect of a lone warrior. However, Balsa brings a level of expertise to her profession that far exceed most of the cast, giving the spear something of a status symbol for any character who wields it.\\n\\n\r\nArt is not my forte, but I will say this series looks good. I can't recall any particularly awkward animation, and I've already gone over the action. The backdrops and the architecture are gorgeous. The character models are very well done too. For the most part the wardrobe never feels out of the place, with the arguable the exception of Shuga, who would look at home in the Final Fantasy franchise.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters that take up most the screen time are well written. I think their motivations and behaviors are believable. While I can't say most of the characters have a proper character arc, aside from the prince, it is clear they all have a history. This gives the impression that the characters are capable of growth, and just overall makes them more fleshed out. I.e. when Balsa acts a certain way it is clear how it ties to her backstory.\\n\\n\r\nMy complaints start when we talk about the characters that do not see much focus, despite having a significant impact on the plot. While I can maybe forgive the Emperor for being out of the loop, it seems ridiculous to me how eager the sages were to shut down their subordinate in an almost conspiratorial fashion. It was so ridiculous I was almost expecting an imperial conspiracy to eventually be revealed, but no. Experts in their field are just incompetent apparently and can't follow up on history that isn't even that old. I think this would be fine if there were an overarching theme of complacency, but I don't see any of that here. I think this is apparent in the fact that the character who so mismanaged the crisis saw no consequences, or at least show any sign of remorse. This is where you would put in the subversion of the old-sage archetype, but no. The story takes the most boring route. I think this is where a lot of the complaints towards this series can be found. The series suffers largely from poorly defined stakes. Most of the characters themselves have no idea what's going on. That is excusable. They are not omnipotent, after all. However, when the audience has no idea what's going on, how can you expect them to be engaged when the character's actions are entirely detached from any foreseeable consequences for most of the series? Remember how I said Balsa's actions are clearly tied to her backstory? Is that ever going to be a problem? If you have an imagination, you would think so, but it's amazing how far the series will go to avoid any character growing moments for her. I swear, there is a episode in this series where Balsa is forced to tear down her core worldview, but this moment was completely reversed in the next episode (technically by the end of the same episode).\\n\\n\r\nWhat is my overall evaluation of this series? Good production value. Good animation. The characters themselves are likeable enough, at least the ones you care about, but the lackluster story drags them down a bit. I rate the series; 5/7.\\n",

I came to be obsessed with the relationships between characters and how close everyone seemed to be, just like a family. Another thing that I really loved is how charming the art and soundtrack are together, nothing short of perfect for an anime like this regarding the setting and themes. The creator of this anime also has another amazing anime \"Kemono no Souja Erin\" which is a masterpiece as well. When I look for other anime, I always try tofind an anime like Moribito, its uniqueness is unparalleled however. This was both a journey and adventure that I will never ever forget.",

            "content": "Production I.G. gives us a simple story well-delivered in this absolutely gorgeous anime.\r\n-Story-\r\nUnlike numerous anime adaptations that only cover a portion of their source material and give an inconclusive ending as a result ('Claymore', 'Ookami-San', and 'Attack On Titan', just to name a few), 'Moribito' provides a cohesive, complete story that needs no further material to feel satisfying. I can't say it's totally original (the plot of 'protect a royal incorrectly accused of being a great danger' is very near to 'Scrapped Princess' from 2003, and the setting is a pretty standard fictional medieval East Asian country) but it executes on this relatively basic set-upwell. The driving force of the central plot is that each character and faction is working for the common good to the best of their knowledge, with no clearly evil antagonist who's out to ruin everyone's day for kicks and giggles (although there are a couple minor antagonists who are decidedly villainous). Once or twice the misunderstandings that create conflict seem a bit forced, but overall the series makes the confrontations believable. \\n\\n\r\nThe Pacing of this show is a factor often mentioned, and while I wouldn't recommend pacing a series much more slowly than this, it never grinds to a halt. There are a few episodes near the halfway point that are mostly filler as 'Moribito' works transition between major arcs, but the characters and world-building we get make them passable. And while the series does tend to move at a more sedate pace than average, this allows the viewer to have a clear understanding of the situation in more intense moments - I'm sure we've all watched at least one series where new plot developments and critical information are thrown on the screen so quickly that it can be hard to keep up ( a nearly contemporaneous Production I.G. series named 'Le Chevalier D'Eon' suffered from this problem even in its best moments). So yes, pacing could have been a bit tighter and moved things along with a bit more pep, but it's not slow to the point of being a significant problem. So sit back and relax.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\\n\r\nI said in my 'Le Chevalier D'Eon' review that the show's art could have been a 9 or 10 if production quality could have been maintained consistently at its best level. 'Moribito' took that advice and Production I.G. delivered a stunning visual treat. 'Moribito' is a feast for the eyes in both aesthetic and animation quality. The backgrounds and settings are particularly amazing, with blues, greens, and white used in abundance to create a verdant backdrop that looks like an excellent watercolor painting. Lighting and shading are dynamic and of excellent quality. And when the fight scenes get started... just brace yourself and don't blink. In terms of quality 'Moribito' could easily pass for several years newer than it actually is- even if it was running right now I'd be impressed. Character designs are realistic and of solid quality, giving me no real reason to complain (although I think Balsa looked perhaps a little too beautiful for a woman who's spent nearly her entire life running, fighting, or both). They even kept fan-service to effectively nil, greatly helping maintain the serious tone of the series. CGI is a times a bit noticeable, but it's never blatantly obvious and immersion breaking - and given that 'Moribitio' is nearly a decade old that's a forgivable fault.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\\n\r\nThe OP has some pretty convincing English considering it's a Japanese song, the ED is calming and serviceable. The OST relies on a traditional East Asian sound, using lots of flutes and big drums. Like the pacing of the show, most tracks are serene, although though the show does have couple heavy guns it can pull out during more intense moments. A particular high point is a tribal choir song that is used twice in the final episodes ( I'm sucker for both ethnic music and choirs). The Dub is fine, but not without faults. I compared Sub and Dub, and found Balsa's Japanese voice to be a bit too mannish, which might fit her character in the story but not her 'look' (as mentioned, she's portrayed as a pretty attractive woman for all her tomboy traits). Her English voice is good, but Colleen Clinkenbeard's title as queen of Action Girls is under no major threat. Mona Marshall did a good job with Prince Chagum, younger characters are known to be tough to pull-off and she kept him from ever being annoying. Barbara Goodson delivers the top performance with Madame Torogai, a no-nonsense old 'Magic Weaver' who speaks her mind and doesn't care what anyone else thinks. There is however, a significant problem in that the English Dub badly overuses Johnny Yong Bosch. He plays a major supporting character, and a number of small roles, and despite his efforts you can clearly detect 'The Johnny Yong Bosch Voice'- he's too well known for his 'standard' voice to be reused multiples times by different characters in a 26 episode show.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nThe cast functions on straightforward archetypes done well. Balsa is a highly-skilled warrior looking to protect others to atone for deaths caused by her in the past (so basically, Rurouni KenSHE). Chagum can come across as a bit of a god-child from time to time, being able to catch on and learn things rather quickly, but it never goes too far. The series also takes advantage of the fact that he's a male character going through something that's very similar to a woman giving birth, although they don't overdo it just for 'shock factor'. Madame Torogai is an entertaining, sarcastic mentor. The most interesting character is The Mikado, who is a poster boy for Machiavellian government- willing to do whatever is necessary to secure the peace and prosperity of the country regardless of whether those actions would be considered good or evil. His every action is guided by the principle that a Mikado must be cold, calculating, and distant in order to work for the overall benefit, operating out of neither spite or passion. We never see his personal desires and motivations and that's the POINT. He certainly does or attempts to do some rather nasty things to ensure the stability of the government, but he always has a pragmatic reason behind it. He's hardly likable, but the audience can at least understand where he's coming from.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nI picked up this series on a whim, hearing some good things overall but also some caveats concerning the pacing. I found the pace to be a refreshing change even if it wasn't perfect, was dazzled by the art, and found myself always looking forward to the next episode, completing 'Moribito' in just a few days.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\\n\r\nA simple story well told is perfectly fine in my book. Add in some truly elite visuals and you have an excellent viewing experience awaiting you. While those expecting constant action won't be fully satisfied, there is a certain charm to the more serene speed of this anime that still picks up the pace when it needs to.",

            "content": "Seirei no moribito is one of the anime's that comes in a rare occassion and those who have seen it is somewhat blessed to experience such an anime. It really is that good.\r\nAt first the story really is at a slow pace however it captivates you as every episode goes by. I would picture this anime as a \"Mountain full of wonders which is yet to be discovered.\". Let's begin the review.\r\nStory - The story is at a slow yet strong pace. This anime portrays a story of someone who's burden is too much for him to handle, that person is Chagum. With the helpof a strong and composed woman or should I call her a guardian, named Balsa, everything comes to light as this woman is an epitome of hope for him. As the story goes by you would feel the despair that the anime tries to portray. The feeling of bearing an extraordinary ordeal, as if theres nothing more that you can do about it, the heavy feeling of despair. Even though this anime is labeled as an adventure, I'd say that you should not expect that much hack'n'slashing in this anime for it is very limited yet, some of the best fighting scenes of our age.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The animation is well polished. The background art is what this anime is notable for. I really like the setting of this anime which is set in a native land. It feels so good just to look at the background. I'd say that it has the best background on par with 5 centimeters per second. The characters are well drawn. You wouldn't be disappointed with the animation of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound - It matches really well with the setting of this anime. Lots of tribal instruments were used here and it is indeed perfect for the background. \\n\r\nThe opening song by L'Arc~en~Ciel is decent and is my personal favorite and the  \\n\r\nending song is decent also therefore this anime receives a decent score in this category.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The characters here in this anime is awesome. They may seem lame at first but as you look on their past It would grow on you. The character development is what sucked me into while I'm watching this anime. Probably the latter reason why I stayed and followed this anime up to the end of it. I longed to know what would happen to the characters next as I finish an episode.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I enjoyed it thoroughly but I have this thought in mind wherein only few would like it for most of those who have seen this were rather bored and dropped it at an earlier stage. I would not like to become a bias  therefore I gave it this score even though I'm holding back the desire to give it at least 9 or 10 on this category.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - It is indeed worth watching. I'm so glad I watched this anime to its end. The reason why I'm coining this a lot is because that most of my friends dropped it because they disliked it, some of their reasons were that they don't understand it or either became bored for the anime is realllyyyy slow. But is worth the wait. Thanks for reading.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overall:\r\nYou know when you watch something great that you couldnt wait to finish, but once it finished you were mad at yourself for being so impatient? Well, I'm currently in that state because of this series T_T--I don't want there to be more, Ii just wish Ii hadnt finished it so quickly!!\r\nWeaving traditional folklore story-telling, masterful character development and gorgeous animation, Seirei no Moribito has the power to capture all audiences in an epic adventure told like none other. If you loved Miyazaki's whimsical movies (Howl's moving castle, Princess Mononoke) (or even if you dont), you will enjoy every second of this 26 episode masterpiece.\r\nThestory recalls the journey tradition often seen in videogames--Balsa, a female spearwielder, takes a journey to save 8 lives. The eighth life happens to be the second prince who has a demon egg trapped inside him and faces assassination at the hands of his father. After they escape from the palace, they embark on a journey to find out more about this demon, but along the way they learn more about themselves. While it does harken back to the convoluted, complex legend type stories, Moribito succeeds with just the right amount of complexity to fully develop the storyline in 26 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the series starts off slow--I watched until episode 6 and then stopped for half a year before starting again--it is really fantastically told. The purpose of the first ten episodes seems to be character development, although it leaves many questions unanswered, mainly about Balsa's past. Fortunately, the end ties up loose knots neatly and I am quite satisfied with the way the show ended--I even cried a little. I hate to say this for my first review, but I can't think of any flaws in the plot execution.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are developed masterfully--there's no other way to describe it. Most series, when they attempt to delve into the past, they do so in a very superficial and unrealistic way, but each and every character in Moribito you will come to love and care for. I think the primary strength of this series is its wonderfully subtle storytelling that illustrates rather than tells the unique personality of each character and how their interpersonal relationships develop with each other. The result is a richly textured, epically entertaining anime that should not be missed!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe closest thing I can compare the art to is Mushishi--wonderfully rendered backgrounds with very average character designs. So dont expect loads of beautiful characters like Code Geass or the like. While I do understand why the creators decided on such character designs, I would have liked more close attention paid to some of the characters. I keep thinking along the lines of Kurenai... but anyways, onto the fun part.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the GORGEOUS background renders, Moribito boasts some spectacularly THRILLING fight scenes. While there isn't fighting in every episode, the lack thereof only builds for a stunning performance every time something interesting does happen. Think the fast-paced, heart-pumping choreography of Samurai Champloo refined with mindblowing fluidity, and you get something close to what Moribito is. I cannot say enough about how realistic and AWESOME the action scenes are!\\n\\n\r\nso minus some points for average character design and plus 5890284392 points for general animation :D\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nIn this type of show where character development and story-telling is so intricately important to its execution, the right voice actors and director is key. While none of the voices specifically stand out to me, the actors really did work together well to deliver the right amount of emotion/lack thereof for the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the voice acting seems more \"realistic\"--there isnt too much inflection in the voice and they speak slowly. I loved how the lack of exaggeration in inflection seemed to contribute to the complex texture of the storyline. But, this type of thing is hard to explain, so just watch it and you'll know :D.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\r\nI always like to do this when I tell people what to watch. Moribito is most like Sword of a Stranger which also features a warrior who must take care of a child who the emperor wants to kill--complete with AMAZING animation and beautiful bgs. But since most people havent seen that (go. see. it. NOW. if you havent :D--or if you decide you enjoy moribito and want something else) i would say that Moribito is like Princess Mononoke textured with the intricacy of Mushishi, dashed with more action-genre flavor :D (and a cute little boy who I will kidnap!!!--ahem i tried to avoid saying that throughout this review).\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion: if you want to watch something unique, beautiful and subtly uplifting, watch Moribito now :D.",

I understand that it's based on a very popular manga series, but what works on the page doesn't always work on the screen.  The story moves very slowly, and for one about a spear welding bodyguard, there is surprisingly little action.  If they condensed the 26 meandering episodes into 13 concise ones then I think this would be a contender up there with Samurai Champloo or Trigun.  As it stands the more wishy washy aspects of this series, along with it's snail like pace, and too close attentionto the more mundane details of the fantasy world it creates holds it back from true greatness.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a bad series by any stretch of the imagination, and the production values are high.  If you are looking for a leisurely series because you have nothing else to do and have watched all the real great stuff, then this is a fine time killer, but there are plenty other better stories and series you can devote your time to first.",

            "content": "There's a lot of different subjects anime can tackle. From the mundane lives of children and their parents to heroes following prophecies long forgotten in order to save the world. There is certainly no shortage of anime tackling the modern day every-family with all its trials and tribulations. But what would happen if you replaced the family in those anime with a facsimile of the Chinese imperial family and you added a heroic prophecy to the mix? Well you might get something similar to Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit. Part adventure anime, part parenting slice of life anime and part chinese fantasy Moribito manages tomix these elements into an interesting, if at times a little rushed, story that places more focus on its characters and world than on the actual story being told.\\n\\n\r\nMoribito describes the journey of Balsa and Prince Chagum as they run away from the empire who would seek to harm the prince. The anime is split into three somewhat distinct parts which each have their strong points and weak points.\\n\r\nThe first part is the introduction and the flight from imperial capture. Here we get to meet most of the important cast of the show and a great deal of time is spent laying the groundwork for the way the empire functions and the way the magic and world function. This part is more focused on action and movement than the others with our pair needing to be on the move to escape captors. Because of this it manages to create a lot of tension and very early on it also gives us what I think is the best action sequence in the entire show with the duel in the rice paddies.\\n\r\nNow while the first part describes most of the world quite well it moves at a break-neck pace, thrusting a lot of information into your face and expecting you to just take it in. Some things also just never get explained. For example, we are shown a few examples of the magics that one character, Torogai, can perform but we are never given more explanation than \"she's a magicweaver\". And that is true for basically all of the mysticism in the show. It lacks explanation. Now being that these are powers that the characters themselves cannot comprehend at times maybe it's better this way, and it certainly does preserve the air of mystery around the supernatural that the show wants to have, I just would've liked a little bit more than a handwave. Same goes for the imperial star reader faction, we never actually get to see any star reading we're just supposed to believe what the anime tells us.\\n\\n\r\nThe second part of the show slows down considerably and takes on an almost slice of life feeling. It is generally calm with not much action going on and even when there is the occasional problem it's generally nothing life-threatning. This arc is devoted to having Chagum and Balsa grow close, not unlike a mother and her child. This is where the parenting aspect of the anime comes into play. The two main characters get ample time to bond and to establish their feelings towards each other. Some may find this part rather dull compared to the previous one, I for one welcomed the reprieve. This part is truly where we get to experience more of the characters rather than the world or the story which is put on the backburner. While I do like this part, it feels kind of empty now looking back considering that some of the characters featured in here have no real impact on the bigger picture. And that brings up a problem I have with the show, it tries to introduce and keep as many characters relevant as it possibly can but it doesn't manage to do that. It only manages to keep a relatively small core cast and quietly gets rid of seemingly still important characters, like the emperor here called the mikado, after they have exhausted their usefulness to the story. Some of these keep getting passing mentions or small roles after their story is over, but it just leaves and empty feeling regardless. Near the beginning of the series we spend some time out of an episode getting to know one of Chagum's pursuers in particular, a man named Jin who even gets his own flashback sequence and everything. He gets built up to be some sort of antagonist that will hamper the group out of a false sense of loyalty but all the build-up ultimately leads to nothing. He becomes an extra, a footnote that we for some reason spent some time getting to know.\\n\\n\r\nThe third and final part of the show delves into the mysticism and magic of the world more than any of the other parts and also brings the overarching plot to a head. We see our characters trying to decipher and bring to a close a prophecy and we even get a heel-turn from the mikado who realises his earlier mistakes in trying to kill his child. The build-up towards the finale all points to a happy ending, with even former enemies becoming friends. This, whether the anime actually wants it or not, creates a very tense atmosphere where main cast feels like it could be backstabbed by the imperial army at any point. This is also where the aforementioned Jin could have actually done some sort of betrayal and the anime certainly hints at this, but it all gets defalted in one scene in the final few episodes. It feels very anti-climactic. The entire finale does. Up until the very end the story is very tense and suspensful but it somehow manages to deflate at the end leaving an empty feeling. Writing this now I feel like all I've said about the anime is that it keeps leaving an empty feeling, yet why do I like it so much?\\n\\n\r\nI like it because of the atmosphere, worlds and characters it presents. It's an anime that barring its finale knows when to be calm, knows when to have action and knows when to have some drama. It creates a world full of hidden mysteries and magic that we sadly do not get to explore all that much. It has beautiful environments, from rocky mountains to lush forests and rich ricefields the anime is gorgeous to look at all throughout. The character designs also look great and complement the chinese inspired world. All in all Moribito is a beautiful anime and manages to do almost everything it sets out to do quite well. The animation looks great, especially the occasional fight or action sequence is a feast for the eyes. Not to mention the two main characters; Balsa giving an example of how to create a strong female character both physically and mentally while also keeping her from turning into a woman-shaped man. Balsa is a woman through and through and it the show reminds us by showing her at times motherly interactions with Chagum. Chagum, is a child character that is also quite well done. He behaves as you would expect a noble child to behave in the beginning but grows into his own person by the end of the anime and the journey is a joy to observe.\\n\r\nThe overall atmosphere of the anime is superb and it is only aided by the wonderful soundtrack by Kenji Kawai.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, would I recommend you watch Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit? Yes. Definitely yes. If you let it take you and pull you into its world you will get to experience one of anime's finest fantasies. While it does have some glaring faults, like not being able to reach a climax no matter what, it can all be overlooked when looking at all it does well. I'd say that everyone should at one point or another get to experience Moribito, but I would say that if you are a fan of medieval or historical fantasy worlds and want a break from all the Tolkien inspired worlds full of elves and evil lords then you should drop everything now and watch this immediately.",

            "content": "Seirei No Moribito is a peculiar anime that made me feel genuinely elated. For a long time as an anime fan, I have not seen any fantasy anime capture a raw sense of realism and tranquility as Seirei did. The opening theme is quite memorable and uplifting, putting you in the mood to watch the latest episode in its 26-episode run. The characters are extremely well-fleshed out as the interactions in everyday situations between Chagum, Tonda, and Balsa is always a treat to witness. The 3D animated background interspersed with the 2D drawn out characters makes for great contrast (i.e. it worked well in thiscase unlike a full-on trainwreck of a 3D-anime, Berserk 2016). The fight scenes were beautifully rendered with actually some variety in the sounds of weapons clashing if you're careful enough to notice. The story had a bit of a slow start in the first half, but got very compelling throughout the second half, which was pivotal to how well the show ended. The ending was very satisfying and well-executed, leaving us contented and hopeful for the coming of a second season as Balsa embarks on another journey. Sadly, no second season was announced, which is a shame as this setting, characters, and story all deserve high-quality animation as it got for one season. The spiritualism in this anime was a breath of fresh air from traditional fantasy anime as the characters interacting with and comprehending the unknown, coexisting \"spirit world\" was more the focus rather than having some random \"spirit/other world\" characters show up as a cheap plot device or fanservice (e.g. InuYasha). Moreover, watching the relationship between Chagum, Tonda, and Balsa evolve and grow in both mundane and intense situations was beautiful and stirring. I would recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys more mature fantasy anime that is more self-reflective of life overall than focused on fanservice.",

This is an amazing series and is a must to watch, especially if you're tired of the typical anime. I recently watched the entire series marathon style with two friends who were as equally engrossed as I (myself watching it for the second time). This series has a very realistic feel to it in this ancient time and the animation, music, characters, and story are beyond excellent. Even the fantasy elements are believable and seamlessly portrayed in the series. Sometimes it carries a bit of slice-of-lifefeel, but always in a way that really brings the series, story, and characters to life. There's plenty of conflict to keep things interesting and a climax you couldn't imagine. The relationship between Balsa and the young boy-prince Chagum is extremely heartwarming. Balsa is an admirable and strong female warrior and Chagum the epitone of a little boy with too much responsibility on his shoulders. I can't even begin to describe Chagum's character though my heart went out to him so often and I loved seeing him mature. If you liked series such as the Twelve Kingdoms, you will definitely love this one. If you're looking for anime fluff, romantic anime, extreme action, or comedy, look elsewhere... If you're interested in sitting back and watching an extremely well developed story told with beautiful backgrounds and believable characters, do yourself a favor and check out this series!",

            "content": "So this is an anime that I have no idea how its managed to take me so long to get around to watching. I think I learned about this show only because it was listed under anime recommendations for 12 kingdoms, which was really good, but incomplete (at least until they finish it starting in the spring of 2011 according to info I got from gg).\r\nI knew there was something very familiar about this fantastic looking show right from episode 1, I hadn't even looked up any information and I could tell it was done by the same director as the ghost in the shellseries. I was completely blown away by this fantasy tale, because albeit having spirits and magic and other typical elements of fantasy it was also believable. It really feels more like a historical tale turned epic then it does purely a fantastical journey.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes in this are awesome, and I was reminded of a certain female spear wielding assassin from samurai champloo (who was my favorite non main character in the entire series), however, I was also quite conscious as to the fact that this is not a series that depends on action sequences and long drawn out fights. There is little that occurs in this show that seems or feels completely beyond the scope of possible when it comes to the action, and it is nice that they actually show the fights instead of the typical flashes of light or \"flying through space in cool poses\" due to the difficulty of animating the complex motions of martial arts.\\n\\n\r\nI only write reviews for shows that I don't think have enough publicity and deserve some more attention, since any of the more popular shows usually get plenty of reviews, and I feel it a waste to write more of the same on these series. I hope that this review will inspire some people to watch this great series, for any fans of ghost in the shell who are writing in anticipation for the third season, you may want to check out this show while you wait :P",

You follow the journey of Balsa and this child, seeing both characters blossom and by the end of the series, you are satisfied with the magnificent ending, one of which most animes do a poor job of doing and it really does make you feel like you have wasted your time watching it.\r\nThe art and animation are good, unlike animes such as 'Kingdom' it does actually show animation ofthe fights rather than use suggestive lines and close ups to cheat there way out of it. The sound was satisfactory but hearing it only in dolby digital may reduce its impact on me, as for the score, whilst it worked well, other than the weird broken English opening, it doesn't have the same impact as some other animes and could be considered quite generic but still serves its purpose well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters is truly where this anime shines, as said previously, you follow this forced relationship where it slowly blossoms and in the end, you can tell the two have truly bonded like mother and child. I would give it 2-3 episodes to truly understand what this anime is like, it did feel somewhat reminiscent of Avatar: the legend of aang due to the presence of another 'world' but it is only briefly explored. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the ending is truly what set it up for me, I would probably have given this a 8 or possibly 9 but the ending just felt complete. Another anime I enjoyed was Attack on titans but I was so disappointed in where it got up to that I marked it down and whilst this doesn't have much to go on, it is a great journey which I hope more people watch and enjoy.",

            "content": "Seirei no Moribito is a simple and straightforward story of Balsa protecting a young prince bestowed of the water spirit from a kingdom and father out to kill him in fear of the water spirit being born. Seirei no Moribito was not afraid of making you sit down in front of your screen and making you read 24 minutes of extremely well written dialogue. On the other end, Seirei no Moribito was not holding back when it came to its action sequences either. These were some of the most intense battle choreography I have seen in a long time. The early chase/fight scene between Balsaand the King\u2019s hunters come to mind immediately. Coupled with an excellent, I do mean excellent soundtrack, these scenes were keeping those eyeballs glued to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation on a weekly basis did not falter; on the contrary you were always asking yourself how the hell the show looked so good on a consistent level every week! I cannot forget the single lone reason that made Seirei no Moribito as good as it is. Balsa, the main heroin lead is such an amazing character. From bad-ass spear master to a motherly figure to a child (not her own) destined for doom she was the perfect character for this show. I find no fault with her. She wasn\u2019t a typical stock-character, that and she looked god damn sexy all the time and had a very sexy voice actor, in a matured woman kind of way. The supporting characters were just as good. Chagum, carrier of the water spirit is a kid. If I hate anything in anime shows it\u2019s when kids are the main characters. Most of the time they are whiny, follow no logic, and flat-out show killers. But you know what? Chagum grew on me. He had a lot of smarts in that noggin of his. He was smart, didn\u2019t whine like a little bitch, and stood up for himself and showed those lowly scamming peasants their place in life in one episode. Tanda was cool also, but you just have to feel sorry for the guy, he never got any action with Balsa, which just makes you wish every time the show had even a small hint of romance.\\n\\n\r\nA complaint to some, enjoyed by me personally, the slice of life / filler episodes did slow down the story considerably during most of the shows run. Coming to a close, Seirei no Moribito was a show I will not forget for some time. It had a gripping start, slowed downed in the middle for a bit, and finished absolutely perfectly. Very little flaws with the show on a whole, great characters, visually stunning animations, well choreographed fight sequences, suspenseful music, well written dialogue and well-developed characters, Seirei no Moribito simply had it all.",

            "content": "This series was recommended to me by an online friend with high praise and it sure delivered. I won't blindly say it was the best thing since my tastes do differ though it was much better then I expected.\r\nStory - I give it an 8 based on my own taste. I place the genre half way between superstition and fantasy in a sense. The story explains everything provided you're paying attention like a fantasy without the doom and gloom of superstition. However it's also a lot of superstitious genre because the elements of fantasy begin to blend in to what feels like elements FROM asuperstitious source. The monsters don't feel like they are from a fantasy...they look more like they belong in a series where nothing is explained and we're all doomed! Some elements of the story also fit the superstitious genre. It's important for me to feel the need to say that the series HAS fantasy elements but is NOT a fantasy in and of itself. I define fantasy as unicorns, elves, fireballs, and wizards and I'd define scifi as ships blowing up other ships in space...so LOTR would at best be a very light fantasy and stuff like Crysis (the game) would be a futuristic fiction. So this is an old time time-frame of Japan with fantasy elements if you're one to debate the feel of such things.\\n\\n\r\nThe storytelling itself is well done and the few battle scenes are done nicely. The story has a fullness to it, I felt like the world as explained in the stories told had the believability element necessary for the story to have the effects you desire when watching a series, especially one that takes itself seriously. I do enjoy serious series but they have to be executed in a certain way and this one does it wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nArt - This is without a doubt one of the best animated series I've seen. I'm not in to gore though can tolerate blood however this series gracefully executed violence without the excess. I would have younger kids watch this before Bleach if you have a family who'd you like something to watch with. Many things from the first to the last episode impressed me and they didn't cheap out at all. Even in the last episode when you saw a hundred servants kneel at the same time I could see them animate it at least well enough so it looked realistic, it wasn't a solid line of a repeated animation that simple animated perfectly the same all at the same time. You'd actually see a few people slightly out of sequence which is one of the signs of really good animation (as this is what would happen in real life).\\n\\n\r\nSound - I didn't get to view this on DVD though I don't think the sound blew me away it wasn't bad either. I didn't really notice anything above and beyond though the quality was good enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - The characters were mostly well balanced out though there are some small things that bothered me. I enjoyed the fact that most of the main characters actually had valuable roles and skills so there was no waiting for dead beats who existed simply for the purpose of humor. The second prince and the girl from the far off village seemed to be vaguely explained in the ending sequences when you last see them though I won't give off any of the story for those who have seen it. However this series had some really great characters and again I can't speak highly enough about how each of the major characters brings a balance in role and skill.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I'm not in to old style / old time Japanese settings (a couple hundred years ago)...I'm more in to current or future time frames however this series was enjoyable regardless. I do wish there were more battle scenes however I will reiterate that there was no excessive blood and no gore. This series focused a lot on traveling and storytelling. It was reasonably forward moving and wasn't stagnant much if at all. The most progressive storyline I've seen thus far goes to Tengen Toppa where they went from living underground having never seen the sky to going to the far reaches of space...and I'm sure most people have seen a series or two that absolutely dragged on and on...this progresses nicely.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - The animation was outstanding, the story original, though I would have liked to have seen the potential love interest work out between two younger characters. It's difficult for me to express if I'd watch it with more interest over other shows of genres I prefer more because the world setting while being somewhat fantasy isn't fantasy enough to really gain my interest though the series really negates that by having a good story, awesome artwork, great characters, and in general being enjoyable for a serious series. Even if it doesn't look like a series you'd want to watch I recommend giving it a chance. I did and I enjoyed it thoroughly. ^.^",

            "content": "This is a vastly overrated show that doesn't deserve it's high ratings.  The story progresses only through the plot that came straight out of Ghibli movies.  It's funny how many described this show as believable/realistic when the story's foundation is a mess of fantasy, incorporating the other world where we get talking sea-men, talking fire spirit, and eventually, tentacled alien invasion to wrap up the show.  To add insult to the injury, over half the characters in the show can turn around from participating in a manhunt to turning completely around without batting a single eye.  Said victim and bodyguard whowere subject to this doesn't seem to mind this either, even when she gets targeted over and over again by the very people she is working with.  It's like they've almost turned assassination attempts into a running joke that is just thrown in randomly throughout the show, even until near the end, so much so that you wonder half the time when that backstab is going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nTo talk about the characters, I came to this show after watching Akatsuki no Yona due to recommendations, but was severely disappointed.  While Balsa is a strong protagonist, she ends up being a generic bodyguard character.  In fact, she could have been a male character without the story or plot changing too much.  I feel like they had a female protagonist just because, rather than to show an actual strong female protagonist.  Yona on the other hand, fits more into a typical pampered princess in some of her behavior but we get to see another side of her that is a strong, willful person who is willing to move forward despite her fear.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to other characters, ignoring the other side kicks Balsa has that are mostly there to move the plot, the other protagonist is Chagum.  I have never seen a character so inconsistent in a show before.  In the beginning of the story, he seems to be an obedient but willful boy who excels in certain stuff.  By the mid-near end of the story, he has regressed to a crybaby who throws tantrums and shows great immaturity, something that isn't really seen previously.  However, by the end of the story, he somehow overcomes this, although he still remains the obedient and mindless kid he ever was since the beginning.  He lives on being his father's puppet for the good of the empire, happy ending, the end....right?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while the show can be enjoyable if you turn off your brain and ignore common sense, there are far too many things lacking in this show.  My advice if you really want to watch this is, do so if you enjoy fantasy.  I picked up this show thinking I would get a mix of character development between a strong female bodyguard and a budding prince who has to adjust to the commoner's way and what I got instead was a mix of action and a story written by someone who was under the influence of many drugs.",

            "content": "Normally when I talk about older anime, I have to remember that they came out a couple years ago, back when they didn't have the technology to make something to the level of quality that we\u2019re at today. But then you have shows like this that seriously make me question if I\u2019m actually watching something that is 8 years old. Because they could\u2019ve released this around this time today, and it\u2019d still be better than most of the shows that are coming out every season.\r\nThe Short Version:\r\n(+)The story is original and unique.\r\n(+)I love the lead character.\r\n(+)The music is great.\r\n(+)The art is better than most animecoming out today.\\n\r\n(+)It only took the first scene to capture my attention.\\n\r\n(-)Takes a while for the story to get moving.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story (8/10): The story starts out with us meeting the lead character who, after some circumstances, is hired to protect a Prince from his own father. I won\u2019t say why cause spoilers, but the reason is clear cut by episode 4. That\u2019s where the story just kinda stops for a little bit, since we get a bit of a cat and mouse game between the main characters and their pursuers which makes the story grind to a halt. Normally this would be a bad thing, but it\u2019s at this point that the show takes the opportunity to develop the living hell out of its characters, while sprinkling some plot points here and there for good measure.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I love about the story is that it shows off a world that\u2019s kinda like ours, but not really. There\u2019s an element of the supernatural in the background (There\u2019re two moons for some reason), and there\u2019re all these different creatures that live in this world that we don\u2019t really see. Little details like this made me interested in the world, instead of it shoving the details in my face with my response being, \u201cOkay, now let's get a move on.\u201d It was more along the lines of, \u201cDamn, this world is pretty cool.\u201d As for the ending, I feel like the entire last stretch of the show was a little bit dragged. Not to the point that I hated it, but enough to make me notice. The actual conclusion though, I was perfectly fine with.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (8/10): The characters\u2026. What to say about the characters. Most of them are really good. There\u2019s only one or two that I don\u2019t find interesting or noteworthy, and that's including the entire cast. Two out of nine are pretty good odds. One thing about the characters that I noticed was that the show spent time on people it didn\u2019t really need to. For example, one of the characters that was chasing the leads at one point, gets his own scene worth about 5 minutes of screen time; those 5 minutes gave me everything I needed to understand why he was doing what he was doing. The characterization of all of the important characters is excellent. Speaking of main characters,\\n\\n\r\nBalsa Yonsa: The best female lead I\u2019ve ever seen in anime and one hell of a spear wielder.\\n\\n\r\nChagum: The entire reason this show is happening and manages to be a prince without being a little shit as well.\\n\\n\r\nTanda: Childhood friend to Balsa and saves the show on multiple occasions (Prevents key people from dying).\\n\\n\r\nTorogai: Shaman and abuser of rabbits.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in the short version of this review, I absolutely love Balsa because, where most other anime would\u2019ve made her psychically attractive, this show choose instead to make her appealing through her actions. Balsa is rarely indecisive, a badass when it comes to fighting, and always keeps a cool head and always has a plan in mind for when shit hits the fan. In short, Balsa is just fucking great. Chagum as well is a really well done character. Being a prince, I expected him to be a whining little shit for most of the show since the kid understands the situation he\u2019s in (at least enough not to be a little shit) and, I\u2019m going to come out and say it, Chagum is probably one of my favourite little kid characters in all of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art & Sound (9/10) & (8/10): The art is done by production I.G. and with it, you get exactly the quality you expect with that name. The art is fucking unbelievably well done; everything is in motion is fluid and the lighting is on point and then some. The first scene was so beautiful that I was almost tricked into thinking I was watching a movie, and the animation just shines when it comes to the fight scenes, like...fuck me it\u2019s so good.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is, again, great; not a single speaking person sounds like they\u2019ve phoned it in. The OST isn\u2019t exactly the sort that makes you pay attention to it. Instead, it kinda plants itself into your brain and sits there accompanying the visuals with astounding effect. The only real part of the OST I didn\u2019t like was the opening, but then again, I don\u2019t really enjoy J-pop that much so it\u2019s probably just me. The best thing about the sound is all the effects they give for each scene.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you think of this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m desperately trying to find a blu-ray for my Holy Grail Collection.\\n\\n\r\nWould you recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYes. Watch it. Please watch this show.",

            "content": "Summary:\r\nSeirei no moribito is an excellent action, fantasy/historical period type anime which is well worth the time and attention of anyone interested in this genre. It has great character development, beautiful animation, a gripping story and above all real emotion and heart. It is a more classic and dramatic style of anime, with no ecchi, overpowered characters or overt slapstick type comedy elements. I would certainly rank this anime in any top 10 list for historical action and I am sure any viewer would enjoy this series.\r\nIntroduction:\r\nIf you are looking for overpowered characters battling it out with magic and swords flashing, ecchi, simple romance andlots of comedy, then this is not the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nHowever if you are interested in an anime which is predominantly a relationship drama interspersed with some great action sequences set in a well realised historical world with elements of magic, then I would highly recommend this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAt it's core, this anime is about the relationship between Balsa (our heroine) and her young charge Chagum who happens to be the prince of the country. By some mystical  happenstance, Chagum has to go into hiding because he is thought to be the cause of potential drought and desolation since he is possessed by a water spirit. The story then revolves around Balsa's vow to protect and save an eighth soul and the revelation behind the water spirit possessing Chagum. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\r\nI loved the character design. All the characters are drawn true to life with no moe elements or over dramatised colours, hair or disproportionately large eyes. The animation and colours are varied and fluid with some excellent fight scenes. I thought the OP and ED songs were great and truly fit the story well. The music was also suitably poignant and dramatic and I cannot fault the technical side of this anime, particularly given the age.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters is what makes this anime great. All of them behave in a consistent and realistic manner, with their motivations clearly expressed and conveyed. The relationship between the leads and the supporting cast is also well played out with some genuine heartfelt moments. By the end, you will no doubt be rooting for our heroes and you'll feel their joy and their sacrifice. If anything, the only slight downside is the lack of significant romance, although there is a minor element. My personal feeling is that the best stories have to contain all parts of the human experience, parental love, romantic love, friendship, joy, loss, sadness, comedy and growth. This anime certainly covers nearly all these elements.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nNeedless to say if you have read this far, you can see that I truly enjoyed this anime. The story moves at a solid steady pace with no real dips in quality or boring filler. Above all, it finishes of well, a rarity in this day and age. The loose ends are essentially tied up and you will feel satisfied watching it to the end. What more can a viewer ask for?",

You know, if something gets me that emotionally invested, it always inches up the scale a point or two.  \r\nPlot - The plot wasn't anything new.  It was a protector plot.  Balsa has to protect the prince.  Bad guys come after them.  However, there is a twist, and perhaps the bad guys aren't so bad.  Perhaps there is more to this possession.  The plot was not linear, there were layers and twists, though not that intricate, but they added great depth to the show.  I wasn't bored.\r\nAnimation -SO Pretty.  SSOOO PRETTY!  And the actions/movements were flawless.  In that cry scene I talked about, Balsa sprints across some ledge and throws something into the air, and you can see the details of the strain in her face, the bunching of her muscles.  Fabulous! \\n\\n\r\nMusic - Opening song by L'Arc en ciel, which is the perfect inspirational song to set the air for the story.  And then there was the 'rice planting' song, Nihji no Uta.  OMG.  I loved that song and the scene from that second to the last episode.  That entire moment was captured perfectly.  The emotions of the story slipped right into your heart.\\n\\n\r\nSome find the story a bit slow, but that didn't bother me.  I felt it was a good balance of plot and action.",

            "content": "This was an immensely enjoyable fantasy show. Unlike \"traditional\" anime fantasy shows which tend to incorporate a large number of iconic elements and tropes from JRPG's this show was clearly its own thing. This unity and uniqueness of vision gives it an initial boost above the general herd. What keeps it there is an enjoyable story with intriguing three dimensional characters (I spent the first half of the show trying to figure out who was the bad guy, only to end up being wrong - which isn't usually the case with standard formulaic anime).\r\nThe animation quality is excellent and the choreography of the fight sequencesis well done. It actually made me think that spears could be cool weapons too (though I'm now unsure, is the spear more of a phallic object than a sword or not?). Actually even if fantasy adventures aren't your thing I'd recommend it just for the spear action.\\n\\n\r\nWhen watching the end you should probably keep in mind that the series is an adaptation of one book in a series. When I first saw the ending I was a little disappointed, but when you realise the ending isn't the end per se then the fates of the various characters involved makes more sense. I haven't read the book but it\u2019s been said that the anime has expanded coverage of a number of characters and their background relationships, while the book itself is aimed at a somewhat younger audience. The series of books is currently been translated into English so I think I may pick up the first volume and see.",

So it would have been much better with just 12 episodes. It would then be not so boring. \r\nThe animation is great. the fighting scene's is not good and few.\r\nThe shaman grandmother character is cool, the rest of them not so much.\r\nThe story is just ok, no underlying meanig or deep thoughts.  Perhaps its just for children?\r\nTo all you fans : sorry! But It's just my opinion.\r\nThumbs down",

            "content": "Moribito is fantastical. The story unfolds as if it is a lore or a fairy tale passed down for generations. It is full of magic and mystery, yet unlike any Western fairy tale. For instance, the supernatural of Moribito is supervened upon its natural world: i.e., whereas the supernatural hides from the ordinary in the West, the supernatural in Moribito's world occupies an invisible layer of reality. It appears that the world of Moribito is composed of many grids stacked up on each other \u2013similar to Michel Foucault's view of knowledge. Interestingly, the nature of this world's knowledge and history accords to Foucault's view ofeach as well: history and knowledge are shaped by the powerful. \\n\\n\r\nDespite some of its gloomy undertones, Moribito is, at heart, a moving tale of courage and compassion. Each character musters up the courage to sacrifice their lives to protect the ones they love. This seems typical of Japanese anime, but I disagree. If one watches the show, one finds that their bravery comes from humanity rather than inhuman fearlessness or courage; it is full of weakness and doubt. This is evident from its focus on maternal love, nurture, loyalty, family, and friendship. Moribito is not simply a story about a hero fighting monsters to protect their friends and lovers. Much of the show's conflicts come from human beings. \\n\\n\r\nAnother critical difference between Moribito and other supernatural shows is that the main character is a strong, female warrior. Balsa is stoic and courageous, yet kind and altruistic. She has an unwavering sense of duty and morality. Her stoic personality is complemented by the sensitive men around her \u2013 Tanda and Chagum. I believe that Chagum especially brings out the best of her, as she act as both his martial arts teacher, mother, and roel model.\\n\\n\r\nNot every character in this show is flushed out and the animation can be quite strange sometimes due to its use of 3D animatino. Nevertheless, the actions scenes are exquisitely animated, and the way it sketches the world's landscapes and supernatural entities is a treat to the eyes. Hence, these minor flaws do not detract much from the overall quality of this show. I really wish there will be a second series that delves deeper into the mysteries of this world. Moribito did an excellent job at not giving too much information, thereby keeping the supernatural ever more mysterious. Although this leaves the audience begging for some answers, it doesn't ultimately disappoint us because the show gave the major characters' relationships a satisfying closure. In other words, a perfect starting point for a new season!",

            "content": "It's been a while since I've seen [u]Seirei no Moribito[/u], but I must say that it's one of the few shows that have stuck with me for a long time.\r\nAgain, it has been a while since I've seen this show, but I just noticed it on a different site for the first time and I thought it only seemed fair to give praise to such an amazing work.\r\nThe storyline, all though probably not entirely unique due to it's Asian heritage, is laid out for the viewer in such a manner as to feel quite unique. Although this series is pretty much your standard 25-ish episodeslong, I felt like I got WAY more out of this show than I would have gotten out of many shows twice its length. Pacing in the show was great from what I can remember. No major waits between important story developments, whilst still maintaining the ability to tell quality side-stories (almost all of which add something important back to the main storyline). And probably the best part of all (at least for me), is that all of the plot twists and side stories that are presented are at some point wrapped up and tied off nicely with a pretty bow, rather than being left in some discarded heap because the development team didn't have the time/funds/desire to finish them.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show might have been it's \"weak point\" in that it lacked any kind of super memorable OP or ED, but the music played during the show itself was always fitting, and never over-bearing. Subtly with background music is always important, and as with most everything else in this show, it was done amazingly well. I also might add that the sound quality of the show itself was amazing. The weapon sounds and such were quite authentic sounding, and this really added to the experience. The voice acting is also fantastic and very well cast.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really made this show special though is without a doubt the characters. I found very few, if any, of the main characters to be two-dimensional, something almost unheard of these days. Chagum may have started out a little cliche, but his development over the course of the show made him a very interesting character. But the super star of the show and our main heroine is Balsa. Easily one of the best characters I've ever come across in an anime, Balsa is amazing. Instead of pulling the classic \"pretty woman with overly large assets that's either perfect or totally useless\"... they made her real. She's a woman with what one might consider \"mild\" traits in the anime world (I put that in quotes because I find her quite beautiful). She wasn't drawn to be some kind of moe-nightmare or knockout beauty, infact they don't even try to portray her as young. She's drawn to be exactly what she is-- a middle-age woman that has spent a large portion of her life as a spear-for-higher. And she acts like it too. Balsa is a tough-mother, and is absolutely the best at what she does. But what makes her real, and thus fantastic, is what the viewer slowly learns of her past. They also do not make her unrealistically invincible, which I think is vital to this story. Balsa will forever be one of my most loved characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation for this show was also amazing. A fantastic job was done by the artists to make all of the movement animation not only fluid in general, but especially during fights. They also took great care in accurately portray the different warrior styles. Many of the different warriors through out the show actually wielded and used their weapons correctly. Spear wielders actually fought like spear wielders, sword fighters fought like sword fighters, etc. It's obvious that this studio put a lot of time and effort into researching and getting the different stances and weapons correct. The background art and characters designs were also all beautifully done. And one last time I'll mention that they did a good job of making the characters in this show feel much more real by portraying them more accurately, rather than taking the standard anime route and making them feel extremely over the top.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, this is one of my personal all-time favorite shows, and I absolutely recommend it to anyone and everyone. There are very few weaknesses in this show, and none of them detract from the show in any way. Except you might want to physically harm Chagum from time to time. No biggie. Haha.",

It was a really pleasant journey .\r\nCharacters: 10/10\r\nIs just amazing that I finally found an anime which the main character is a strong woman,I mean there are many where are basically teen girls who have magical powers, in other words only Bish\u014djo, is not that I\u2019m telling Balsa is not beautiful, is just like I have notice that in some many animes  the girls tent to be strong but empathized in their external beauty, and in the end they depend of male characters to save the day. This one is as matter of fact the firs in which woman external beauty is not a big deal, instead we have this extremely skilled and smart woman who has the most powerful sense of right.  Love Balsa!  (if you know any other animes with strong females characters please message me cuz I would love to watch them ) \\n\\n\r\nWe also have the prince, which is just adorable, is a strong little man with a huge gold hearth, he actually learn and is a grateful kid, the way that he grows of the history is the best.  The Shaman torogai or tanda, and every single warrior/ninja were also perfect, evry single character has it own magic, its something really difficult to find in nowadays animes which have a one or 2 characters and the rest are simple as hell xD. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe design is different, but good different, its mature, characters look strong, backgrounds are so magical and perfect, the color palate is very comfy and comfortable, didn\u2019t like the 3D sequences. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nBackground music as well as OP and Ed are very catchy to the anime sequence, they make the fight even better or the sad parts more emotional :D\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nLove every single episode, but only a few feel kind of slow, anyway everyting make sense and I higly recommend this anime is you\u2019re a looking for a solid strong plot and magical adventure not predictable at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 -- my advice it\u2019s to not let this awesome anime passed by, start to watch it right away. \\n\\n\r\nEnglish is not my native language please ignore my grammatical errors ;) \\n\\n",

While the series is more diffused in development than KSNE, this is more of an action story that focuses on the given plotline.\r\nSome things that I have noticed is that the author appears to have a thing for surrogate mothers, as both Balsa andErin have that kind of role.  I cannot help laughing when imagining Tanda and Balsa having female-prejudiced and male-associated lifestyles/roles.\\n\\n\r\nI think this is more of a brain-farting rant, but in short:\\n\r\nTHIS SERIES IS A NICE, FAST-PACED ADVENTURE W/ A VERY SLIGHT SPIRITED-AWAY FEEL.  IF YOU LIKE THE FIRST EPISODE, YOU WILL LIKE THE REST.  THOSE WHO LIKE PRETTY-MACHO WOMEN WILL LIKE THIS~\\n\\n\r\nMy one complaint is that the ending seemed a little rushed, but whatever.

            "content": "In 2007, I had just started getting serious about watching anime, particularly those that have just aired during that year, while following some others as well. One title happened to slip my grasp: Seirei no Moribito. I knew of it's existence, but I thought it was one of those political fantasies that seemed really hard to understand, like Guin Saga, which I haven't watched. After feeling rather bored one day, I decided to try out Moribito...and boy, am I glad I did! I can't believe I overlooked this show back in 2007! How could I be so insensitive?! But now I've finished it and I'mglad to say that this anime is on my top 30!\\n\\n\r\nThe story's about a young woman named Balsa who's traveling from her native town working as a bodyguard. She saves the life of the royal family's youngest son, the second prince Chagum, from falling into a river. The second queen, Chagum's mother, asks her to take care of her son and protect him because he has some kind of water demon in him, and because the water demon is said to bring torrid droughts every few hundred years, his father, the Mikado, wants him assassinated because he feels that Chagum's death will stop the drought. Balsa takes Chagum under her wing and protects him while finding a way to bring the water demon out of him. Assisting them on their journey are Tanda, Balsa's childhood friend and a herbatologist, the eccentric magic weaver Torogai, and two friendly street urchins named Toya and Saya. But despite their efforts, the Mikado's assassins want Chagum dead at all costs, and they'll stop at nothing to bring them down.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing I LOVE about the show the most, it's the animation! BY GOD, the animation and art on this show is just absolutely impeccable and amazing, and I mean that in the highest respect possible! From the epic fights to the smallest details in the most irrelevant things (like scratches on Balsa's spear, grass leaves swaying in the wind, footprints, etc.), the animators surely brought everything to life! But what impressed me the most about the animation is how the characters are animated. Nowhere in the show do you see super deformed faces or chibiness or anything like that. The characters move, act, and display both emotions and actions in a very normal and human way, which is VERY refreshing in most anime nowadays. And speaking of human, I'm surprised with how actually HUMAN these characters are! Nobody has special powers, nobody can move faster than the naked eye can follow, no super fast healing powers, NOTHING!! When I see characters that move too fast for the naked eye to follow, I just feel it's lazy animating and too shounen anime-esque. Thank God, Moribito avoided this flaw awesomely and with aplomb (you'll notice if you watch the fight scenes, which there are only about four or five in the entire show)! Well, I guess part of this is due to the fact that it's adapted from a popular novel series, and I don't think novels can describe super speed that good, and the animators surely made use of this! And guess which company produced this? Production I.G! The people behind Ghost In The Shell, Blood-C, Bunny Drop, and currently, Guilty Crown. Some people say Guilty Crown's animation is awesome, but for me, pretty animation is nothing unless you've made good use of it and have some meaning in the plot. GC doesn't have that, and I'm gonna be bold and say that in my personal opinion, Moribito has WAY better animation than GC by a long shot!\\n\\n\r\nThe music...isn't really all that memorable or groundbreaking. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I hate it or anything. On the contrary, I like it. It's nice and subtle, and knows when it wants to be calm and nice and go all out, and does so at the right times. But it's not one of my favorites. I did, however, love the opening theme! I'm not really a fan of L'Arc en Ciel (again, not saying I hate them), but I personally think this is their best song so far, and the animation certainly did it justice!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters...let me tell you this: in this show, there are absolutely NO flat or bland characters here. None. Zilch. Zippo. Nada. Nothing! Every single character, even the relatively minor ones, are complex and well rounded and far away from any stereotype we know. Balsa's the best and strongest female anime character I've seen, Chagum is the best damsel in distress I've seen, the supporting characters know that they're supporting characters, and best of all, they're all perfectly realistic and human characters without anything special to them. They all think like normal human beings and are quite intelligent. Don't expect any random stupidity or silliness or goofiness or anything like that. Nobody's mind-numbingly retarded in this series! Yay! I won't go into too much detail about why. You'll have to watch and see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to point out a flaw, it's that I think there should've been more conflict in the middle parts of the show and that I wish some of the supporting characters had more screen time. But in all honesty, that's about it. What I love is how misleading the show is. It looks like your political thriller, but it's actually a heartwarming tale about a mother's love for a child. I'd love to go into detail about this, but the love a mother has for a child is just too indescribable, so I'll leave it at that. I also love how the show develops its setting, by giving it traditions and rituals and some very well done back story. Heck, one of the episodes that had me on the edge of my seat, and got me excited the most, is one about gambling of all things! Gambling! But I think it was because I love the way they presented it. Also, I watched this whole thing in English on Hulu, and from what I hear, it aired on Adult Swim at some point. Man! If I had known about it, I would've DVRed it and watched it as it aired! Oh well, I watched it and I'm glad to say I love it! Also, the final two episodes are great as well.\\n\\n\r\nSeirei no Moribito is awesome in the best of ways. If you're tired of all the anime tropes in this industry, then watch this. It's clean and wonderful! A great anime to watch if you want to get away from all cliches.",

            "content": "First thing first, this anime needs to be more well notice and needs to have more episodes. This anime could have extreme potential: a physical world (sagu) that surrounds itself with the spirit world (Nayug), a female bodyguard with a dark past and a prince who's \"possess by a water demon\", follow by the whole state is after their necks! But, this adventure in terms of action was a let-down. Don't get me wrong I do enjoy the characters interaction and development like how Balsa shows her maternity instincts despite her rough treatment of Chagum, and Madame Torogai's harsh treatment was just for show. Itsjust I was expecting more great fighting sequence. The hunters look like an awesome worthy opponent of Balsa and I admit the fighting in the second to third episode was thrilling but thats all we're getting. Well, in spite of the let down, I still say this was a commendable anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis is because as aforementioned, the character development. Yet, there leaves more room for improvement like communication. Most of the communication is through body language, (so mad props to the animators cause the facial expressions and the scenes are just breathtaking) I want the characters to express more of their feelings. Its just that at times, they can appear a bit cold. But in the end you get used to it as you do grow an attachment to them and even can recognized the characters feelings through the actions and facial expressions.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, it was so-so. The opening and closing are the same for all the 26 episodes but they were great. I rather have a song repeated than get it replace by something far worse. But the background songs aren't memorable though.\\n\\n\r\nFor this anime it could have been so much more. I wanted more in depth background on Balsa or the hunters or even on Shuga. But you could only do so much on 26 episodes. Despite its drawbacks I still had a great time watching this. If your looking forward to anime that has that historical fantasy feel or don't mind the somewhat slow-pace, then this is for you. I rated this around a 7.9 since it does have its charms and there's nothing like this. So give it a try.",

            "content": "Serei no Moribito is simply beautiful. It is hands down, one of the best anime I have ever seen.\r\nSet in a region similar to medieval Japan, it has one of the best examples of world-building ever. It is low fantasy by genre and eminently believable. While it has \"magic\" it is more in terms of folk witchcraft and misunderstood natural phenomena rather than wizards and bolts of lightning or anything like that.\r\nThe story itself is superb. It would easily translate into an excellent fantasy book series. I'd describe it best as an \"adult fairytale\". Something that could also easily be told with the words \"Onceupon a time...\" at the beginning.But it is also so much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nThe emotional impact is at times powerfully uplifting and at times heartbreaking, but what really makes it shine however is the fact that the characters are wonderfully complex. There are no cardboard cutouts. Even the \"bad guys\" are not evil, they are only doing what they believe is right. \\n\r\nDon't make the mistake of thinking this is one of those artsy anime however where all they do is talk and nothing really happens. It's an action-packed adventure. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, the art. From start to finish, the art is gorgeous. No lazy fillers or repeat tiles. Everything is beautifully animated and painstakingly detailed. Almost straight out of a painting. Its like that for Every. Single. Tile.",

You can't get better than Seirei no Moribito for artwork in my opinion. The background looks like paintings. The story is a interesting but the story is much about the ending as it is about the journey. The character development is really superb. The experience is a wonderful one. One of my favorite anime masterpieces that is actually very underrated. \r\nThis anime works for all ages and it is truly very mature meaning that it escapes the frilly casual anime and it is inevery sense a masterpiece. In a sense, I believe that a person with much worldly experience and it is wise will tell you this is how they see the world...coincidentally how I want to see the world. That is how I felt about this anime. This anime is about courage, learning to love, friendship, caring about others, living through hardship... everything life is about to me. I highly recommend this to anyone. I believe anyone can watch this anime and get something useful out of it.",

It meanders around the middle, the plot does not feel urgent, and a couple brief CGI scenes look bad, but everything else is superb.\r\nWhat is it rated: G, with no language and no fanservice.\r\nWhere to watch: All 26 episodes are on Netflix instant watch.\r\nNotes: Don't judge a book by it's cover; despite the premise, there is actually very little action in this series. Instead, the plot follows the lives of the characters as they try to stayout of the hands of the Shogun and try to find out what is going on. Notable in that there are no actual antagonists in the series; everyone just wants to live happily ever after but a lack of information means they go about achieving that goals in different ways.",

            "content": "Moribito tells the story of the journey Bulsa and Chagum take as Chagum fulfills his duty as the Guardian of the Spirit and the prince of the Shin Yogo Empire. \r\nStory 9/10\r\nIn the opening credits of each episode it says how the anime was based off of a book and the anime really shows it. Usually in anime you can get a general idea of who this character is pretty quickly, but in this anime I feel like the characters develop a bit more naturally, much like they would in a book. \r\nA lot of episodes just focus on Chagum and Bulsa getting closer andadjusting to their new life together. For example, there's one episode where a friend of Bulsas, Touya, takes Chagum to the market, but Chagum has no concept of what money is because he's never had to buy anything before. As Chagum adapts to his new life, he learns more about life in the village and makes friends with other kids in the village. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is still some good action and fight scenes; I love watching Bulsa fight because she maintains this steely focus while fighting and never lets her guard down for a moment. Furthermore, Bulsa never kills anyone which makes it even more impressive she can beat her opponents without killing them. \\n\\n\r\nBesides Bulsa and Chagum, occasionally the focus would change to Shuga whose a star reader (basically this worlds version of a priest) at the palace and who continually looks for Chagum and Bulsa while also questioning whether the emperor's decision to kill Chagum is right.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nChagum: Chagum is my favorite character in the anime because I love how much growth he goes through and, again, it seems so natural too. For example, when Bulsa first meets Chagum he's this bratty rich kid that gets mad when Bulsa looks his mother in the eye, but then after Chagum leaves with Bulsa he become so quiet and timid which makes sense since he's in a new place with a strange woman he's never met. \\n\\n\r\nBy time the story reaches the climax, Chagum has grown to care deeply for Bulsa and now understands his responsibility as the Guardian of the Spirit. \\n\\n\r\nBulsa: A lot of people I know call Bulsa their favorite female anime character and, after watching the anime myself, I love Bulsa too. I love how tough and strong Bulsa is while, also, there are times when Bulsa lets down her guard and shows some emotion. If Chagums in trouble, Bulsa rescues him, but then starts crying because the thought of something bad happening to him terrifies her and she gets angry at him for not listening to her. This also shows how much Bulsa cares for Chagum and there connection. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, when you learn Bulsa's origins and why she became a body guard you understand why she keeps her emotions hidden and why she tries not to get attached to people. \\n\\n\r\nShuga: Shuga may be more of a minor character, but I still really enjoyed him. I like how inquisitive and smart Shuga is and how he asks questions no one else thinks of, which in the end is an immense help to Bulsa and Chagum. Furthermore, I like how loyal Shuga is to Chagum and it shows how the thought of having to kill Chagum breaks his heart. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nSomething you always hear other people say about this anime is how plain Bulsa looks as in she doesn't have big boobs, big eyes, or colored in cheeks that make it look like she's always blushing like some other female anime characters have. I like Bulsas more simple and realistic design because it allows me to see her more as a real person and makes me take her more seriously. \\n\\n\r\nThere some other more serious female characters in other anime like Hawkeye from Full Metal Alchemist or Tsunade from Naruto, but I think what sets Bulsa apart from them is how she doesn't have some goofy quirk or a chibi form. Bulsa both looks and acts very realistically and naturally. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I want to point out is the design of the spirit world, Nayug, is really amazing and creative looking with all the giant animals and how it's so surreal looking in general. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nAt its center, Moribito is about the relationship between Chagum and Bulsa and how they both grow as people from the journey they take together. It may be set in a fantasy world with magic and monsters, but it's very down to Earth with a story with plenty of twists and some fantastic characters. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This show features an adventure of a female spear-wielding bodyguard got hired to protect one of the Prince of the New Yogo Empire from being killed for possessing a demon within himself by escaping the Palace together. It also features how this spearwielder seeks to atone for the people who died for her to let her become who she is today.\r\nThe story was told rather consistent but there was one point where I felt a bit confused on whether it was a flashback. I had to rewatch a second or third time for those episodes to confirm so I guess it would be good tohave more obvious distinction from a flashback or the present time. The pacing, however was slow and steady which I rather liked, it had a good mix of filler episodes whereby we were shown to the memories of one of the character. I actually liked the ending due to the fact that it wasn't rushed at all and a satisfying conclusion. A proper farewell was done as well. Last but not least, I liked the fact that not all the information was given to the characters and this made the story a bit more interesting as they would rely on what happens and then they act upon it. This gives the show a bit of unknown on what happen next and the excitement which ensused.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was fair and simple to be honest, not the high resolution ones that you expect but the action scenes for the fights were rather intense. However, I would have loved it if there were more battle scenes but I guess this would mean more resources needed.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds for the show was okay, the theme music did fit for various and different kind of moods and it did set the mood right.\\n\\n\r\nThe number of characters were all right, not too much and not too little. I extremely liked Balsa the spearwielder's story and background, especially her memories with Jiguro. It shaped Balsa for who she was in the show and how she relates it to her encounter with Chagum. Chagum, which can be said to be one of the main characters has also grown up rather well with all his experiences with Balsa and all his encounters with either the Egg, Hunters and etcetra. One specific character I would dislike is the present Emperor due to his self-contradictory words towards Chagum at the beginning and the end of the show. Last but not least, I also liked the honor-bound personalities this show had as well.\\n\\n\r\nThis show made me feel rather heartwarming for its story while it may seem a bit sad at times. I feel it's pretty well-written and could appreciate how it was protrayed from the beginning till the end. Lastly, I really enjoyed the ending as it was complete and not rushed like some shows.\\n\\n\\n",

The art is more realistic, anddone in softer colors than the standard show of the day, the characters are flush and polot points are all covered in the show's entirety. Besides which, the show itself was just fun to watch! Always important.\\n\\n\r\nIf getting into something that lulls, at its' center, rather than being action all the through, is an issue, this may be a difficult show for you, but I encourage you to give it a try, regardless.",

I told my brother about it and he finished the series in one sitting (with a nap partway through).\r\nThe characters and story are great. There aren't a whole lot of characters but they really get into the backstory and flesh each of them out very well. The prince going from little brat to cool guy happens very naturally and believably. The overall story is great, the different factions, with their differing opinions on how to deal with the impending crisis, is very believable. It isn't justgood guys vs bad guys. It's people trying to do their best with the information they have. \\n\\n\r\nThe art fits the series perfectly. No cartoony goofy stuff here. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is perfect, traditional Japanese folk songs, drums for the intense parts, and orchestral stuff. I've watched the dub and sub, even the dub is good. In both the voices fit the characters well. \\n\\n\r\nThe action is great. There aren't a whole lot of fights in this series, but the ones there are, are some of the best I've seen. They are very well animated, the music is intense and fits perfectly. The build up is there, and they are gritty. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it comes together so well. You'll laugh, you'll cry, the fights will have you totally pumped. A must see. \\n\\n\r\nI wish they would continue with the series, the original novels span 12 volumes, that could be 11 more seasons.",
