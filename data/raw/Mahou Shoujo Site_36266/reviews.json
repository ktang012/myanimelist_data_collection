            "content": "The term \u201cedgy\u201d gets thrown around as some sort of criticism by people who like to sound smart and mature, because they engage with a medium for people half their age. Personally, I don\u2019t use the word as a criticism, because I often enjoy edge a lot. I think there\u2019s a level of edge that gets enjoyable, because it passes so many levels of believability that I don\u2019t believe it was meant to be taken seriously in the first place. That\u2019s where Mahou Shoujo Site comes in.\r\nA more accurate term to describe this anime would be \u201ccampy\u201d, but fucking nobody uses that term so I\u2019mnot gonna bother. This anime has knives so therefore it is edgy ha ha ha never saw that joke coming did you.\\n\\n\r\nYou may be thinking that this is a matter of \u201cturning your brain off\u201d to enjoy something--ignoring the flaws to indulge in the positives. This is also false. I don\u2019t believe in such a concept. In fact, I present the opposite: you should keep an open mind and keep your brain turned on to understand why a creator would make such a thing in such a way. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cMahou Site is sooooo edgy!!! It\u2019s just a bunch of shock value!!!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWow, it\u2019s almost like that was the fucking point or something. Some people like edgy schlock like this. Why? Who knows. Maybe I\u2019m just some sick fuck looking to get off. Or maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t always need a compelling narrative to pick my brain. Look, I\u2019m mentally challenged enough. I don\u2019t need my damn cartoons to enforce that. Sometimes, I like to keep it nice and simple. There are girls in this anime, and they get hurt a lot. It\u2019s not real, so I don\u2019t need to take it seriously. And that\u2019s about it. At no point did I ever get the impression that Mahou Site was supposed to be taken seriously. It wasn\u2019t even trying to take itself seriously half the time, and I can explain this just by looking at the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nAsagiri, the main character, thinks about throwing herself in front of an oncoming train, but hesitates at the last minute. As she sits on the ground in her despair, office men on their way to work mutter to themselves how it\u2019s too early in the day to deal with this kind of bullshit, that they were slightly inconvenienced by her attempted suicide. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the best thing that happens to her on this day.\\n\\n\r\nShe goes to school and gets thrashed around by some bullies. Then she goes home and gets thrashed around by her brother. Her only salvation is taking care of a stray cat, which the bullies kill on the next day, right before they send in a JoJo character to come rape her.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in fifteen minutes, we\u2019ve already covered suicide, bullying, rape, animal murder, and domestic abuse. Some would tell you this is all an act to make you pity the main character, and while you\u2019re free to do that, I don\u2019t feel that any attempt was made at making Asagiri a likable character, and here\u2019s why: \\n\\n\r\nAya Asagiri is not a character at all.\\n\\n\r\nYou see her in an ordinary day, where she lives through incredible amounts of horrifying things, but at no point do you ever get a sense of who this person really is. Her entire character is defined by the things that happen to her. And, at the expense of making my most callous remarks to date, there is simply no logic behind her survival. She hesitates to end her life, but why? She doesn\u2019t have anything to live for. No friends, no dreams, not even a conviction that \u201cit gets better\u201d. Aya Asagiri walks this fictional Earth only to suffer. Anyone who\u2019s depressed, suicidal, victims of bullying, etc. all put up with it for some clear, emotional reason. Aya does not, which is what separates her from being an actual character you are meant to take seriously, as opposed to an avatar for projecting suffering onto.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the graphic loli suffering plastered on the screen, it\u2019s all there just for you to gawk at. Maybe you have some weird fetish, or this kind of thing is just amusing you. You do you. Personally, I find it funny. Mahou Site is cute. It\u2019s a level of edge that comes around to being endearing, because it passes so many levels of believability. Even disregarding my argument about Asagiri not being a real character, the things that happen to her are so extreme that I can only see the thinnest lines of logic. Knives in her locker, that\u2019s believable. Glue on the chair in the class, that\u2019s believable--the recent season of 3-gatsu kinda covered that. But setting up a rape in the back room and watching it? Look, I\u2019ve already proven that I\u2019m not the greatest person, but this is crossing a few lines of sanity here. Not to mention that the older brother beats the shit out of Asagiri right in her bedroom. What the hell kind of soundproofing did they do to their house to keep the parents from not hearing all of the screaming and gasping and thumping? I just moved into a new basement with a thin roof, so it\u2019s very creaky and I can hear everyone talking and having sex, so I\u2019d like to get in on this.\\n\\n\r\nShit, I\u2019m already 900 words into this review for a website I don\u2019t even like using and I still haven\u2019t even scratched the surface of how silly this anime is. How about the fact that one of the magical girls is some fuckin\u2019 bizarre fetish idol group that wears dog costumes and calls their fans their \u201cmasters\u201d? Or the magical girl that has some weird, old-ass, masochistic butler who praises her existence so much that he lives to be stepped on? How about the scene where the brother\u2026 you know what, no. I can\u2019t spoil that episode. It\u2019s too good to be sullied by this review. \\n\\n\r\nAll that I\u2019m trying to say is that Mahou Site is fucking wacky. And if you have a problem with that, then that lies with you alone. If you\u2019re disappointed that this author isn\u2019t making high art, that\u2019s fine. And although I can\u2019t speak on behalf of this person, I don\u2019t believe they were trying to make high art in the first place. To dismiss Mahou Site as worthless simply because it is not to your standard is not a weakness of the anime or the creators, it\u2019s a weakness of your own for not being able to accept things outside of your comfort zone. Look, I\u2019m not trying to sound pretentious. I\u2019m not perfect. I dropped Tada-kun after one episode because it bored me to tears. I don\u2019t like anime that have natural characters in a natural setting, and they don\u2019t do anything in particular, but it\u2019s a romance because of course it is. There\u2019s no real reason for that, I just don\u2019t like them. But, I never got the impression that Tada-kun was a bad anime. It was just an anime that wasn\u2019t for me.\\n\\n\r\nIf you wanna see something from Spring 2018 that\u2019s super edgy and DOES try taking itself seriously, go look at Devils Line. However, I won't go into detail about that because this is a review for Mahou Shoujo Site and not Devils Line. You can ask me about it if you want. That\u2019s all I have left to say on the matter.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're interested in the story itself, it's not much on paper. Girls get magical items called Sticks, and they use them to do things, and they have to prevent some sort of doomsday. Some people, aka dumbasses, will tell you that this is a Madoka ripoff, but it's really not a unique formula to begin with, as many action series, anime or otherwise, have some sort of doomsday plot. Overall, I don't really have anything to say about the story itself because it's not anything special, but the way it's told is very fun, and that's what's most important.\\n\\n\r\nNow, all this being said, does this mean I have no complaints about Mahou Site? Not true at all. It could\u2019ve been better in a lot of ways. As much as I\u2019ve said that the anime shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously, there were admittedly some moments where scenes get heavier and more emotional, and it doesn\u2019t pay off too well as they not only drag on for too long, but the characters aren\u2019t engaging enough to get behind. \\n\\n\r\nI also would\u2019ve preferred more action in this series, since it involves a bunch of magical weapons and abilities. While there are a few big, key fights to be seen, the anime plays more like a drama than an action thriller. I suppose this could be more of a preference, because both elements blended together fairly well, but it should be kept in mind that it\u2019s not super action-heavy.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, Asagiri develops into a character that\u2019s just annoying and even more non-sensical than when she had no personality. Hearing her try to plead with others to not harm the ones who\u2019ve caused her grief is just strange and unsatisfying. I was hoping she would have some super badass moment where the gloves come off and she unleashes a rage that reciprocates all of the wrong that\u2019s been done to her in the past, but instead she insists on playing the good girl. It\u2019s boring. People don\u2019t like Guts because he had a shit life. People like Guts because his shit life hardened him into a living badass, so you know that when goes into battle, he does NOT fuck around. \\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the other characters manage to pick up the slack. They\u2019re not amazing, but they\u2019re enjoyable enough to keep the show on its feet. Yatsumura works great as the #2 of the show, and the side characters are about as weird as they come. I already mentioned the fetish idol, but I didn\u2019t mention the girl who felt the need to state that she had big tits like four times in one episode, or the girl whose Magical Girl weapon is a knife that cuts herself to heal others, and that she\u2019s okay with it because she was \u201calready practicing self-harm.\u201d But the real star of the show is the bad boi Onii-chan, whose personality is so off-the-rails that you could tell the author wrote him with a smile on their face. It helps a lot that star actor Nobuhiko Okamoto delivers him with tons of conviction. And I\u2019ll say it again: this character has the greatest scene in recent years.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack had no notable pieces, but the voice acting was good all-around. I already praised Okamoto, and I\u2019ll do it again because he was great. Newcomer Yuko Ono does a solid job as Asagiri, nailing the despairing moments well along with having a wispy, wimpey voice without sounding like a dying mouse. Yuu Serizawa also delivers with the character of Nijimin, who has some rather severe shifts in tone that happen quickly, and both sides are done well. The OP grew on me a bit--it\u2019s not much more than a standard rock tune with a bit of an edgy streak to it, but it gets the job done. Same with the ED, but less so. Rather, they are carried with their visual presentation--the OP has a cool camera effect that looks like it\u2019s being played through a broken screen or lens. The ED is\u2026\u2026\u2026 uh, it\u2019s something. Something about two girls doing a live-action dance on a school rooftop while a bunch of sperm cells float around in the background. Yeah, I dunno.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation--ugh, can I go now? I just wanted to dunk on people who were talking shit about me liking this anime because apparently edgy = bad or some stupid bullshit. Look, I\u2019ll just leave this 7/10 score right here, and that should tell you the art is good but not amazing. Alright? \\n\\n\r\nAlright, kids, what have we learned today? We learned that watching violent cartoons is okay, there\u2019s no such thing as turning your brain off, and that if you have no personality then you should kill yourself. Alright, cool. Leave me alone now.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nSound - 5/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nEdge - 9/10\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 8\\n\r\nFavorite character - ONII-CHAN\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Medium-high",

            "content": "Have you ever seen a show so banal, so worthless, so unintelligent, so uselessly defiant, so lazy and so pathetic that you hate it with every fiber of your being the longer it goes on as lazy jump ship of popular trends? For me, the biggest example of that, is the latest edge cancer to pound the anime community known as: Mahou Shoujo Site.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIt is inevitable that within a community, when some concept does something to \u201cbreak the mold\u201d in a unique way and becomes a mega hit, there will be a ton of copycats spawning from it, to get a slice of that sweetsweet dough. In Western Animation, films like Shrek, as well as cartoons like Ren & Stimpy and South Park made such big impacts that they inspired a jillion ripoffs continuing to this day, all misunderstanding what made their originals work. In anime, we\u2019ve seen this a lot recently when shows attempt to make money by blatantly taking the template from a successful series. It has come with the success of the high school battle harem genre, the survival game genre, Sword Art Online, and of today\u2019s subject: Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Not the earliest example of moe gone dark (When They Cry beats it by about half a decade), but certainly a modern landmark.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nMadoka Magica, a show using the disguise of a typical Mahou Shoujo praised for its artistry, emotional depth and willingness to go to dark places in showing its characters confronting mistakes they wished to undo, was a mega success, and other creators\u2019 response to that was \u201cif we take a Magical Girl show, and add dark elements, it\u2019ll be a hit\u201d. Shows like Yuki Yuna, Selector Infector WIXOSS, Magical Girl Raising Project and today\u2019s subject: Mahou Shoujo Site, are a result of that bandwagoning.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nHaving seen Yuki Yuna about two years ago, it felt like it went too safe with its content, not being able to properly explore the darker elements the same way Madoka did and not greatly delivering on the lighthearted fun at its front. At the time, I thought maybe if one of these shows would be more willing to handle darker themes, it could have interesting things to say about life and expectations. I was WROOOOOOOOOOOOOONG.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Site might, flat out, be the most thoroughly reprehensible, apathy inducing, tryhard, edgy, unpitiable, lazily produced, tonally retarded, inhumane, DISGUSTING pile of shit that I have ever come across. It sucks ass! It sucks balls! It sucks ASS BALLS!\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nAnd it all starts from one of the worst first episodes I have ever seen for ANY series, let alone anime, one that was so bad it encouraged me to see this to the end just to tear it to shreds.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nThe entire episode was nothing but torture porn, shown with a shy cute girl, to instantly draw sympathy dealing with a list of edge tactics like it was some sort of fucking checklist. These range from her contemplating suicide, to being emotionally/physically tortured by school bullies, to being viciously beaten by her psychopathic brother, having a cute kitten she saved be thrown in front of a train/delivered to her, and being nearly raped by an upperclassman while said bullies just snicker and watch. Eventually through the power of plot convenience, she obtains a magic gun that accidentally kills several of said bullies, only for her to be backed into a corner by another character threatening her with a razor blade. That character then gets stopped by an edgy sociopath girl who could control time.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nUsing so many edge tactics would be laughable if it wasn\u2019t so thoroughly DISGUSTING to watch. All of this torture throughout the first episode is handled in an overtly methodical way, not representative of genuine human fault but a lazy writer using every edgy thing he discovered as a means of forcing audience sympathy. It doesn\u2019t work, not even in the slightest. Gore, violence and cruelty all have their place in a meaningful narrative when they underlie an interesting story or human drama, but going on episode 1 alone, more care seemed to be placed on the tools of edgelords compared to the basic essentials of story, character, or presentation.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nAnd yet, despite this awful first episode, it never tried to go further in darkness, but remained brain dead, single minded and bizarrely bipolar with edge to the end. The show was too lazy to even go to the same extremes again. People like me who wanted to watch this to see how much more torturous it could get were met with a barely functional Madoka plagiarist trying to wring earnest interactions out of fetishes with no sense of tone, pacing, or comradery.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nEverything from Episode 2 onwards is introducing a powerful world ending conflict (the nature of which was blatantly stolen from you know what), while other characters are slowly but surely brought in to put on their edgiest Yandere smile before becoming party members in the inevitable quest.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nThere are many, many, many problems with the writing of this show but for me, the biggest one is tonal cohesion. It can be seen as a problem in a large amount of anime from Fullmetal Alchemist to The Ancient Magus Bride that there are silly comedy moments in addition to the handling of darker themes. However, shows like those keep their overall presentation at a respectable middle ground where either comedy or drama could work when needed, because they care and understand about character building causes for conflict or human drama. The one thing I wasn\u2019t expecting Magical Girl Site to pull was have so many moments where \u201ccomedy\u201d arises, whether through one character taking on an appearance with gag boobs, a reference to \u201capple butts\u201d, comedy credits stingers with the sister-molesting older brother, XD chibi expressions, a girl who frequently gets off to smacking her old butler on the ass, magical mind control panties, or a Beach Episode.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nYes, you heard that right. A BEACH EPISODE. A show where everything I mentioned in the first episode occurs, where a character cuts herself in order to heal people with blood, and where another character says \u201cGod has never abandoned me before\u201d crazy eyed while bleeding from the mouth and nose, has time for a beach episode. The sheer extent of the whiplash is what really takes me out of anything the show attempts. Whatever humor exists here would be horribly unfunny even in a comedy show, but putting it in a show where nearly every girl deals with cold blooded torture and bleeds from some part of their body when using their power makes any attempts at wacky humor feel like incomprehensible tonal homicide. And not intentionally to create false ease like say, Higurashi. The humor mainly exists to fulfill more of the author\u2019s obvious fetishes.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not just the humor that detracts from the show\u2019s tone, it\u2019s the forced togetherness of the End of the World conflict (pretentiously called The Tempest) that brings it down to the dark depths of anime hell. In a show where crazed maniac girls are commonplace holding death grudges against one another, none of the many relationships feel like they build to comraderies. They just happen because the plot type demands it. Most egregiously with one of the bullies from Episode 1 that remained alive. Said character gets an incredibly disproportionate reason for starting her less than human bullying streak, nearly kills the protagonist at a latter point, and then just because the protagonist doesn\u2019t kill her back, they become buddy buddies to stop the end of the world. WHAT?! Sure, there\u2019s a realization there but that\u2019s barely a redemption arc and it is unforgivable to try and move our sympathies to a girl who gleefully tortured the shy and ineffectual protagonist in Episode 1 because of a ctrlCctrlV broad conflict.\\n\\n\r\nSeveral other character relationships go the exact same way, with characters at each other\u2019s throats becoming close friends without any sort of proper pacing to get to that point. What could\u2019ve been developed drama of troubled characters finding it within themselves to work together becomes sullied by a forced need to have the \u201cband together against the apocalypse\u201d involving way too many characters who get no time to let conflicts hold. For a show proudly putting its foot down to say \u201cwe\u2019re willing to go to DARK depths of what people suffer in life\u201d without time to care about anything, going Team Force Friendship is about the most clich\u00e9 thing it could possibly do. It\u2019s DiC Sailor Moon putting on the mask of Elfen Lied and Mirai Nikki just to appeal to the edgelord crowd, forgetting that it drove out all likability in only the first episode!\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s the power system and eponymous Magical Girl Site system itself, which like many elements of this show, are also f*cked beyond belief. First off, every weapon used by a girl in this show is called\u2026\u2026.a Stick. Yup, a Stick, like a tree branch or something. It\u2019s used here to describe anything from heart guns to necklaces to yo-yos to magic controlling panties. Unless you named the weapons Ding Dongs I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way the author could\u2019ve put less thought in. Serious scenes where characters call their weapons Sticks come off as more silly than fierce. I could just now imagine one girl picking up a tree branch and attempting to wear it underneath her skirt, insisting that it is called underwear, in a world where magic panties are considered Sticks. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the whole Magical Girl Site concept. \u201cScary\u201d face papercut people in some weird pocket dimension hack computers to give random girls magical girl powers for what seems like no reason, but eventually is revealed to relate to the completely forced apocalypse. The one who gather the most arbitrary negative energy gets to survive while everyone else dies. No specific idea is handled with the Magical Girl recruiting, since they didn\u2019t even nick Madoka\u2019s \u201cwish for a price hope/despair\u201d routine, just the enemy identity idea stolen in every series ever featuring fights against inhuman monsters, with no time to sink in because of awful pacing. Most of the origin stories for the girls don\u2019t get an exclamation at all for the site being there, like the writer was too lazy to care about why they had their generic or fetish powers. The site itself doesn\u2019t connect to the conflicts of any character even semi-well, with this antagonist force not getting any justification for their appearance, random ass powers or Halloween play paper cutout appearance.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nIn that sense, the show\u2019s script is emblematic of everything regarding this series. Illogically lazy. Not bothering to commit to any unique ideas, it instead nicks them from a source most people would recognize, but lacks any sort of tonal cohesion, proper pacing, variety, understanding of human drama, effort or passion. It doesn\u2019t even conclude itself properly, giving fuck all to any sort of viewer payoff as well. It\u2019s pure phoned in tripe, creating a torturous 1st episode only to wring further relationships from the foundation of a used toilet paper tower on a raft in the ocean, during a thunderstorm.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nNaturally this laziness extends to the animation as well, from the studio\u2019s 2nd ever project. With no effort blas\u00e9 character designs, bleh grey and black backgrounds (except during the beach episode), and absolutely nothing resembling flow in fight scenes, this is about the lowest effort one can put into a TV anime, sans excessive CGI armies or characters moving like a PowerPoint presentation. Even the few attempts at visual flourish are either \u201cpaint everything blue or red\u201d, or sunset scenes. Action, as I mentioned before, has no flow in any capacity, even doing things like using action lines over colored backgrounds that I thought we grew out of in early  Pokemon. Fundamental things are done terribly, like crows not bleeding when they are cut in half, or photoshopped meatballs being over characters\u2019 heads in one occurrence. And there\u2019s also the wonderful images of many Yandere faces, a psychotic grown man putting on little girl panties, and the ED having sperm fly everywhere. A show like Hand Shakers looks godawful in its own way but I could at least tell that the staff at Studio GoHands were TRYING to do something unique and inventive, despite it backfiring in every conceivable way. A show like this does about the minimum effort possible to be considered passable in some capacity, and absolutely suffers for poor art design because of it. So it\u2019s a shame for however many Japanese animators spent long days and nights on it.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nThe sound is also low effort, so low effort that I barely have anything to talk about. Suppose I could mention that the one girl who runs fast does so with an obvious stock sound effect, or the fact that this show\u2019s entire reason for being adapted hinges on promoting the idol group I\u2b50\ufe0fris. You heard that right, even the STUDIO only made this to profit off a contract for a promoting idol group, one whose insert in the series wasn\u2019t even memorable by Idol standards. Because anyone who gave a crap about artistic integrity or creativity stayed as far away from this as possible.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nFinally, the characters. What \u201ccharacters\u201d? This show has none! All it has is inhumane gleefully cruel excuses for the author to jot down his fetishes and edge checklists. These characters all have names and unique hair types, but without any distinguishing character features to them, the \u201ccharacter\u201d element fades in the background. Already Episodes 2-12 are forced to work with Episode 1\u2019s broken foundation, and when it does have to try and \u201cdevelop\u201d anyone from that episode, it has nothing to work with and leads to nothing properly worthwhile. The pacing\u2019s jank so any chemistry between devices feels tenuous at best and completely unbelievable at worst.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nThe lack of effort isn\u2019t just present for what the show lacks but for what is present as well. Of the nine girls (eventually ten) that it puts in the \u201cHero Group\u201d role, six of them have edgy Yandere moments at different points, which is not only lazy but barely distinguishable or built up. Higurashi didn\u2019t make every single girl a Yandere, and for the ones they did, they built up the element, however well. It even uses the \u201cmy parents were killed by a psychotic man\u201d backstory twice, one of which gets revenge so fast that we have no reason to care for the endeavor. And when those in the show are not being psycho Yanderes (including the evil for the sake it older brother), they\u2019re either completely cliche or fulfilling a sick fetish for the author with no substance or identifiable goal. Whether it be the gag boobs girl, the apple butted idol who controls people with magic panties, a girl who cuts herself frequently to heal people through the mouth insisting she\u2019s not emo, a girl whose only trait is \u201cruns fast\u201d, or a girl whose main trait is smacking about an innocent old butler. Every Magical Girl bleeds from a different part of their body as well, so anyone with a bleeding fetish can rejoice in knowing that bleeding from body parts will be a continual process that is never confronted as a problem because the show is that lazy!\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nThe ONLY attempt at anything resembling a character arc is protagonist Aya, who learns to get over her shyness, make friends with other characters, rebel against an immediate plan following a character death, and organize a beach visit for everyone! On paper it\u2019s acceptable growth, but in practice, the terrible writing and relationships that aren\u2019t given any time to rest, making many of her choices feel forced. This includes her forgiveness of the bully girl who viscerally tormented her prior and during the series start. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 path hampered down by the creator\u2019s laziness as well as awful plot rolling. No one else has anything CLOSE to that attempt, which I should stress was unsuccessful.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Conclusion\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nOne could easily say \u201cwhy did you even talk about this show if you knew you were going to hate it from Episode 1\u201d? Simply put, anime tends to inspire me in its ambition. Whether a show is a masterpiece or a dumpster fire, I\u2019m usually enthused by its wide variety across genres, different strengths and screw-ups, passion projects and inventive concepts using animation. I admire the storytelling potential present in an anime series, whether it be from the classics period or the modern age. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason I single out a show like this is because it is the antithesis of everything worthwhile in an anime, or any form of art period. Rather than putting effort to make their series high quality, the author did nothing more than rip off popular trends to steal away a direct audience, not having to keep tone so he can throw his sick fetishes into an angsty Yandere-full horribly contrived setup. It\u2019s a show the studio put out, not to share an inventive idea with the world, but to promote an idol group with the bare minimum in every capacity. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t misguided passion, or even the type of hilarious straight faced terrible idiocy one could find in Ousama Game. This is a product, assembly lined from checklists and trends that shouldn\u2019t persist, forgoing the artistry its inspirations held high, and is impossible to enjoy because it was neither consistently in straightfaced \u201ccrawling in my skin\u201d nor smart enough to be a parody of itself. Laziness begets laziness when it comes to this, spitting on the potential of anime storytelling for something less substantial than starring out a smoked window for 4 hours. This fetish fueled, plagiarized, lazily produced tripe isn\u2019t even remarkably bad. It disgusts me in having nothing but contempt for the concept of effort. It\u2019s boringly awful in every way, but complete failure all the same that I could never recommend to anyone.",

            "content": "This show is awful. It touches upon a lot of heavy themes including but not limited to; bullying, domestic abuse, torture, rape, depression, and other such fun topics. However, not once does it feel the need to adress these topics in a serious manner. A lot of the abuse the main character seems to soak up like a sponge, and is only used as a way to make you sympathise with the girl. It\u2019s essentially a guilt trip. What really doesn\u2019t help is that the abusers are in no way written realistically. They\u2019re not written as people with clouded judgement, or people who bend overbackwards to justify their own actions. They are written more like sadists; they simply enjoy abusing this poor little girl.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the major plotpoints thus far have also been lifted from another show, but for the sake of spoilers, I wont mention it. All I\u2019m saying is that it is extremely easy to draw a lot of parallels.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation mostly serves its purpose, but it never enhances the experience. It\u2019s a bit janky and goes off-model from time to time, and very often did I see something and think \u201cthere were so many better ways to animate that\u201d. Sometimes the strange animation leads to some unintentional hilarity. If you\u2019ve seen episode 2 you know the face i\u2019m talking about. Art wise, the backgrounds are plain and the character designs are nothing new. Background characters tend to look pretty wonky too.\\n\\n\r\nI tend to not notice music in anime unless it\u2019s extremely good, and here I also took note of the music but for different reasons. The music is extremely distracting. The worst soundtracks are the ones where there\u2019s a little girl chanting \u201cla la la\u201d as if it\u2019s supposed to be a cheesy fake-deep horror show. \\n\\n\r\nThere were a few short moments, however, where I found myself pleasantly surprised. Some of the interactions between the main character and her blonde friend I find kind of charming, and occasionally (but very rarely) there\u2019s some extremely strong visuals or really powerful facial expressions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is mostly just really boring. I\u2019d only recommend it if you want to dissect it\u2019s problems as a way to improve your own writing.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\n\"People say my life has hit rock bottom, but I do not believe any of that.\"\r\n-Our main bro while fapping to anime porn in episode 3. \r\nThis series has some serious issues. By this, I don't mean \"flaws\" or \"cons\", I mean real issues. This is the peak of insanity.\r\n\"Every day, all I think about is dying.\"\r\nOur main character, who is the most pathetic looking girl imaginable, seems to be living in a world which is pretty much a fucked up place. All her school budies are literally evil bullies whose favorite past time seems to be kicking her ass and destroyingher life while smirking in the evilest way possible. At home, however, her role in the family seems to be the one of a boxing bag. Sometimes they do strangle her too. After witnessing this, I thought \"woah, it's only a matter of time until she gets raped and gets her organs sold.\" ....And exactly 4 minutes later some dude forces himself in her. Oh, and btw, she has one thing in the world she actually likes. A cat. So naturally, some asshole just had to come and kill it because fuck this girl specifically. Did I mention they told her her cat is dead whilst she was getting raped? Well, now you know. Amazing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, it should be mentioned that this series should not be watched by people who can't tolerate with violence and fucked up shit because this is pretty much as far as anime can go with darkness. This series is mature and gore in a way which is mainly only accomplished in manga series.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Every living thing that harms you, should disappear.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nJust so happens to be, our heroine gets the access to a mahou shoujo powers via the power of the internet and starts her rampage towards every living thing, except cats. Sweet, sweet revenge will be served. It's satisfying as hell, and presented in a manner most similar to Lute Ryner's murder phase seen in one of the most epic anime series ever made, DenYuDen. Mahou Shoujo Site completely abandons moral values, social norms and heroism. It only cares about chaos and resolve. When it comes to series similar to it, it achieves exactly as much as shows such as Madoka Magica, Elfen Lied and Higurashi no Naru Koro ni, but being much more direct with its twisted world and characters, giving exactly as little value to human lives as the Gods seen in Gantz. At this point, I am impressed. Some people will of course meme that the show is edgy, mc the epitome of victimhood and some characters one-dimensional baddies. I get it. One can kill all the good things this show has to offer by clinging onto these thoughts. My advice, if you can, don't let general consensus ruin the fun. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe series also comes with the best live action ED seen since the 2nd season of Arakawa Under the Bridge. I just love seeing them girls dancing all around the place while animated sperm flies everywhere. When I saw that I thought this series is definitely 10-worthy and not a 9/10. A goddamn masterpiece. I highly recommend Mahou Shoujo Site for anyone who has the tendency of liking chaos and the fucked up stuff. Especially the fans of Becchin to Mandala should give this a go along the fans of series already mentioned in the review.",

            "content": "We, the anime community, have been blessed once more with yet another edgy bullshit to digest, which has steadily and firmly joined the edgefiesta family. The newly born child of edge called Mahou Shojo Site sat among its emo relatives such as Ousama Game, Mirai Nikki and others and as their successor and production doA's first TV series, it did its job pretty damn well; I mean, succeeding in being a completely lifeless and rotten experience is quite an achievement... \r\nMahou Shojo Site is the prime example of how NOT to make the first episode, heck, of how not to make an anime. Through its22 minutes duration, we have to endure seeing over-the-top bullying, domestic abuse and even rape \"performed\" on our cute little main high school girl-kun. But fear not, this wonderful adventure doesn't end on that one episode! The entire world she inhabits seems like it's full of the evil moustached men who, in their free time, tie damsels in distress to the rail tracks for their own amusement. Both her school bullies and her brother, the master of domestic abuse 9000, grin and act like a bunch of clowns when they punch and kick the heck out of the laziest depiction of an abused and depressed person in fiction, *cough*, I mean Asagiri. However, everything changes when Aya discovers the eponymous Magical Girl site. After obtaining her \"stick\", I know, that's a weird way to call your magical \"wand\", meeting her new best friend Yatsumura and other magical girls they do... something. Well, since this show is such a (un)forgettable piece of \"work\", this is all I can say about this anime's narrative: something happens. That's all. There's no clear direction for at least half of this show's duration, as what truly matters is all the gore, shock factor and cute high school girls being psycho and trying to make the viewer as emo as it is possible. Even when the final goal of the characters is finally revealed the only appropriate reaction to it is... meh, who cares? My wrists are covered in fricking blood! Darn you, razorblades! Throw in some more bullshit so I can lose more litres! I don't even know what to think about the masterfully crafted characters. Besides the supporting psychopaths such as the previously mentioned bullies and Aya's brother, who in one episode took off his pants and showed of the stolen panties stick, yes, that's a weird flex but okay, all of her buddies are straight-up fucked in the head. Did you torture your family's murderer in your own room? Yeah, that's cool :3. Did you murder her friend and she went insane because of it and, after a while, you became pals? No problem; we gucci :33. Did you change from a mass murderer to a dumb fan service dispenser that unreasonably cares about others? Hehe, look at my BALLOONS :333. No one questions even one of these situations and, to be honest, it would be quite laughable... if the show actually managed to be ironically funny. The common trait, which edgy Chinese cartoons produced in Vietnam share, is being so damn serious that they become a top kek laughing material, but in MSS's case, I could hardly laugh. It's just that monotonous and tiring. Sigh, honestly, I would much rather watch paint dry than rewatch it, even if given a reasonable amount of alcohol. How is it production value-wise though? The animation is junky, inconsistent, but still better looking than an MS Paint drawing made by a 10-year-old blind child, which is something at least, amirite? The only thing that appears to matter is the \"hehe crazy xd face\", every single strong independent wom... girl in this show has to display at least once. None of the insert songs was passable enough for my brain to remember, well, I guess not having one might be the reason why... so yeah. The opening is shallow and it's hard to swallow and the ending is... something indescribable. It's a mix of 2D footage and some live-action idol-ish dancing with sperm flying in the background. What the actual fuck am I watching? What the heck are you doing hentaihaven?\\n\\n\r\nAll and all, I think I lost the rest of my brain cells after thinking about this show for 2 hours straight and spending 25 minutes on this \"review\". That's why it looks like it was written by a brain dead monkey, well, at least its atrocious quality matches the show's quality. Ugh, I feel like I'm losing consciousness, so hear me out: stay away from this show and drink a chug jug. If you want to laugh at an edgy anime, then go watch Ousama Game or Mirai Nikki... or something that's worth your time... I don't know. Are you still here? Guys?",

            "content": "What is an edgy anime?\r\nEdgy anime are the type of series that uses it and themes to make a serious tone however unlike mature shows where they create a permanent tone eddy shows would very often switch it\u2019s dark tone around in favour of having a more lighthearted narrative and tone. A lot of the time these shows would often have a lot serious topics, and themes that ultimately goes nowhere thanks to they awful tone shifts and because of this a lot of theses edgy shows ending up very pretentious as a result. The real problem with theses edgy shows that like with ecchiand harems they have the high chance of seeing well which sadly attracts the lowest common denominator where the audience in that group would only a show because it\u2019s dark themes and violence.\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill is one of the worst examples of this because not only the show itself didn\u2019t function correctly as thanks it\u2019s non-existence worldbuilding, plot holes, cringe-worthy storytelling, embarrassing production values, horrid characters designs that don\u2019t fit with the setting of the show and pathetic characters but the show had no had no idea of what a mature show should be. There are other edgy anime like Future Dairy, Elfen Lied, and that I want to talk about but I will save theses edge feasts for another time. Personally I really despite anime that are edge because not only do these shows would forget to tell a story but they also would go out of the way to shock the audience with the edge and tonal shifts.\\n\\n\r\nSo what does this have to with Spring 18 Magical Girl Site you may ask? Well, I will tell you to know. Magical Girl Site is one of the most cringiest edgy anime I have ever seen because not only it\u2019s generally a horrible but it cannot even use it\u2019s edgy/dark content correctly. While Magical Girl Site isn\u2019t the worst anime, I have seen it still an anime that I hate.\\n\r\nStory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a middle school girl named Aya Asagirl who has problems with both her school and home life thanks to the aggravated bullying and physical abuse. While browsing online a website pops up on her computer featuring a creepy-looking person. The person appears to take pity on her and announces that she has granted Asagiri magical powers. She clicks yes and on the following day a pink toy looking gun shows up in her school locker and there Aya must learn to deal with her new magical power as well finding the meaning of the countdown clock on the website.\\n\\n\r\nAm just going to say it right now the story for Magical Girl Site is abysmal.\\n\\n\r\nRide of the bat this anime makes an awful first impression where the audience are awkwardly thrown into heavy and sensitive themes such as child abuse, rape, depression and torture without any reason apart from poorly establish the protagonist for the story.\\n\\n\r\nBesides of all the dark edgy shit that goes on in the story this is just your typical magical girl where characters in the show will have mini characters arcs as well being a boring survival type of show where only one magical girl can survive. This is the least of my issues with the show. The real issue of this show that ended up killing the anime was its portrayal of heavy and sensitive themes. This is by far the most disusing anime I have seen because it too all of the sensitive and heavy themes such as rape, child abuse, depression, torture, and bullying and doesn\u2019t treat them with respect as the show constantly went over the top and edgy about them. I liked shows where they address and tackle sensitive and heavy themes but this show clearly did not have a clue to present its sensitive themes and because of this me and majority of anime fans literally got sick while watching. After watching the first three episodes I was physically being ill thanks to this show physically abusing the poor little girl. What makes this worse is how Aya the protagonist doesn't do a damm thing about it because honestly, this show could have gone for a different direction if the writers simply allow Aya to move into the foster care home away from her school and school after episode 1 as soon she gets the pink toy gun and the plot could have moved along a bit differently but no we can\u2019t have nice thing thanks to this show stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show is pretty inconstant overall as either go way too fast or way too slow. While it\u2019s not as bad as Record of the Garncrest War it\u2019s still a big issue that kills the flow of the series as well as all the events that happen in the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really pissed me off about the show that the show had the balls to have a poorly directed beach episode aka episode 8. Not only that episode killed the tone of the series up to that point where it\u2019s very dark, but the show at no point had a piece of dialogue that stated the girls are going to the beach to have some cool time. I understand the show was trying to throw the audience of its sudden tone shift, but this was the worst way to do as it feels so lazy and forced.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Episode 8 this was the same episode that features the worst man to man confrontation I have ever seen in anime as not only it was all over the top but the direction/writing was horrible.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 9 is even worse as the show decides to takes all of its physics and logic and ultimately throws out the window in favor of shock value.\\n\\n\r\n(Spoilers ahead)\\n\r\nThe way that Nijimi died in the show was horrible because not only it featured horrible directing but the way Nijimi was able to live for that along to even able to stab Kaname in the throat with an edge of a glass bottle after being cut by Ringa sword which Kaname our comically evil villain was using. It's was bad enough that she didn't get decapitated immediately from the way that was cut by Ringa sword but the way the show didn't even bother showing us the amount of blood that Nijimi while she was on the floor. What makes this episode baffling compared to any other episodes in the series is her death could have been easily avoided if Nijimi actually controlled her temper like in the earlier episodes in the series where despite having temper issues she still smart enough to not allow her temper to take over. Ridiculous...\\n\\n\r\n(End of spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story for Magical Girl Site was beyond awful and sickening.\\n\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Magical Girl Site are all one-dimensional edgelords as they are all tropey as hell as well being very unlikeable fools.\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist Aya is your shitty damsel in distress type character who everyone treats like trash for no reason other than to give her a sad backstory.\\n\r\nTsuyuno is the boring ass monitor with dark past\\n\\n\r\nNijimi is a cute but tempered idol who would stop at nothing to kill the person who killed her best friend.\\n\\n\r\nSarina is the loud mouth bitch who refuses to listen to people even if it important.\\n\\n\r\nRina is a very intelligent girl who is very clumsy.\\n\\n\r\nKosame is the stoic edgelord who has the edgiest power ever where she gets to heal someone by cutting her own skin.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters aren't much better at in fact some of them are even worst.\\n\\n\r\nKaname is probably one of the most contrived villains I have ever seen in my life. Not only he such a disgraceful human being where he actively liked beats her own sister up Aya for stress relief but the way he literally became one of the main villains in the second half of the show was retarded!!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall like with the story itself the characters are utter shit.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nThe visuals are okay, but it doesn\u2019t matter when you have absolutely no substance to back up your visuals.\\n\r\nThe character designs for the main characters are pretty good overall and recognizable however the character designs for the side characters just were just awful and unappealing to look at\\n\r\nThe animation is okay for the most part, but there were times where the show had fair of still frames and choppy movement for some fights.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully the soundtrack for Magical Girl Site is the best part about this the series as it does a good job at capturing the dark nature of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and endings theme on the other are just forgetful and the voice acting overall is alright for what it was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the soundtrack is decent overall.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nSo that's is Magical Girl Site. A broken edgy mess of a show that doesn't even respect its audience.\\n\r\nThe story is horrendously written that is filled with horrible pacing and directing. The characters are all unsympathetic idiots who are edgy for the sake of being edgy. The only decent things about this show are the visuals and music other than that this show is a broken mess that barely functions.\\n\\n\r\nEasily the worst anime from spring 18 season by far and I strongly recommend you to avoid this edge feast as possible.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 1.5/10",

Well, the show manages to, with another live action ED involving idols dressed up as dogs. Here's hoping for episode5 the bitcoin idols turn up. The plot follows suit in one-upping itself in preposterousness but I want to refrain from spoilers because this is an experience you can only have once. However, let's be clear, the number of times I went \"WHAT??\" at the show is more than I can count on my fingers and toes. We're only at episode 4.\\n\\n\r\nI like how funny this show is. Fantastic comedy. If you can tolerate blood etc. then I highly recommend this show as a great example of absurdism, and what *not* to do if you ever happen to write a serious story. Grab a beer, watch this with friends, enjoy it for what it is.",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Site is absurd but its also an argument against absurdity. If that sounds like I made a contradiction that's because it was intentional. The absurdity within the show is also intentional. The show uses contradictions as a tool to highlight absurdity. It uses contradictory imagery and the main character also acts in seemingly contradictory ways. Although the show contains absurdity it also rallies against absurdity by having its characters fight for meaning in a meaningless and cruel world. Despite being absurd, Mahou Shoujo Site has strong morals and a positive message.\r\nMahou Shoujo Site uses contradictory imagery masterfully to juxtapose negative and edgy conceptswith positive and hopeful ideals. Take the main character for example, she is shown in the opening theme song aiming a gun at her head and then disappearing into thin air after pulling the trigger. This imagery suggests suicide, however upon further inspection we find that the gun is shaped like a heart and instead of causing death it causes the person getting shot at to teleport to a different location. The main character is capable of using this as a weapon but she instead chooses to use it as a tool to assist her comrades. Another character cuts her own wrists with a box cutter knife, however she uses the blood from her cuts to heal her friends. This turns the symbolism of wrist cutting from selfish and masturbatory to selfless and sacrificial. Using imagery that turn suicide and self-harm into positive things is a tremendously absurd contradiction. Showing traditionally bad things in a positive way like this highlights the goodness of the characters despite their cruel and unusual circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nThe imagery is great but the characters also act in seemingly contradictory ways. All of the magical girl characters are shown or implied to have been gifted their powers due to intense suffering they have faced. The logical course of action for most of these girls then, is to carry out acts of revenge. This is most clearly seen in the main character's best friend, Tsuyuno. Tsuyuno doesn't understand why our main character, Aya, refuses to carry out similar acts of revenge. Aya's refusal is the core contradiction of her character and is what leads to her success as a magical girl. Aya not only refuses to carry out revenge but she actually forgives and co-operates with her former bullies. Willingness to co-operate, even with those who wronged you or who have the ability to betray you, takes a lot of trust. Aya's trust may seem naive however it is continuously positively reinforced by the events that happen in the show thus cementing Aya's trusting and co-operative actions as a positive message.\\n\\n\r\nAya's actions also teach a positive message relating to free will. The villains want Aya to accept her fate as an unfortunate soul and use that negative viewpoint to spread more negativity. The bullying that lead to Aya being gifted her powers was senseless and cruel. She would be completely justified in reciprocating these actions. However, Aya believes that doing so will be an acceptance of her unfortunate fate. Aya rejects this fate and uses her own free will to shape her destiny. She does this by setting her own moral rules such as not killing or taking revenge.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Aya is rejecting her unfortunate fate, Tsuyuno is so dedicated to revenge that she struggles to find any meaning in life beyond her own personal acts of vengeance. Tsuyuno is still shown to be a good person despite her negative outlook. Tsuyuno acts cold, calculating and pragmatic which is a foil to Aya's more naive and idealistic outlook. However, Tsuyuno has a strong moral framework and her hatred of bullying is what lead her to save Aya in the first place. Tsuyuno's conflict is compelling because she is a good person who is simply morally confused about how to find meaning in her life beyond her senseless and cruel suffering.\\n\\n\r\nIf the other characters are struggling with how to cope with their senseless and cruel suffering, then Aya's brother, Kaname, is the personification of that senselessness and cruelty. Kaname faces pressure from his father and from society to succeed academically. Instead of taking on the burden of this pressure himself, he vents his frustrations by abusing Aya. After Aya gains her magical abilities, Kaname loses the outlet for his angst. Kaname uses manipulation to gain power and control that he lacks in his own life by tricking one of the magical girls into giving him her power to command people. He uses his new power in insanely cruel ways. It's honestly quite difficult to understand Kaname's motivation as a character because he is just so absurd. Kaname's presence is a reminder that no matter what outlook you have on life that senselessness and cruelty will always still exist and that they need to be stamped out wherever they may be.\\n\\n\r\nUsing absurd imagery and storytelling to teach an overall positive message is a good thing. However at times the absurdity of this show can go too far. Some of the character's backstories are just so unbelievably absurd that they can border on becoming comedic. I could argue that being so absurd is actually an accomplishment but having a character's suffering be so ridiculous that it causes me to roll my eyes or laugh just does not give me a positive reinforcement as a viewer. The show also has some fetishistic imagery which limits its accessibility to more casual fans (assuming the edgy imagery didn't already do that). Some of the magical girls have man-slaves and Kaname is shown wearing women's underwear in one particularly absurd scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Mahou Shoujo Site has a very clear and simple message: be a good person and fight against evil. It also teaches to not let your suffering control your life and to use your free will to do good. These aren't unusual messages for a magical girl anime to have but the absurd way of delivering these messages is what sets Mahou Shoujo Site apart. Although Mahou Shoujo Site pushed the envelope as far as possible for the cruelty in the character's suffering and absurdity of some of the story events, they never diverted from the strong positive message at the foundation of the show. I really appreciate the decision to stick to a positive message because with such an absurd premise and events they could have easily went for a more nihilistic route in which case the show would just be edgy for the sake of edge.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, contradictory imagery and seemingly contradictory character actions show that people can be good even in an absurd world, Tsuyuno's struggle to find meaning in life beyond avenging her own suffering is a great moral conflict, and Kaname's unbelievable cruelty is a reminder that evil will always persist and is worth fighting against. All of these aspects highlight a strong moral message however the show is also quite absurd. Lots of edgy and fetishistic imagery is used throughout the series and can be very off-putting for a lot of people. If you are put off by such images you should not watch this series. For everyone else, Mahou Shoujo Site presents an interesting and fun absurd story that has a strong, magical girl-based moral backing.",

            "content": "Just about anyone could have made Mahou Shoujo Site. I say this with an open mind because it really comes down to a bunch of grimy ideas mixed together at once. Before I get to the who, what, how, where, and why, you really need to be aware of what\u2019s ahead.  As someone who have read the manga, I say with regret that Mahou Shoujo Site (Magical Girl Site) ended up being one of the worst shows of Spring 2018. It\u2019s actually a bit demoralizing considering that there aren't many big magical girl hitters this year and it already set the bar very low.\r\nForgetthe happy moments you\u2019ll find in some magical girl series, there\u2019s little to none in Mahou Shoujo Site. What you will find is a misfortunate girl named Aya Asagiri who has been bullied throughout her life. The thought of suicide often come across her mind and it doesn\u2019t help that she has a dysfunctional family. Her life does change in the most peculiar way possible after acquiring a magical power from a mysterious website. Thus, Aya\u2019s life as a magical girl begins.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, I\u2019ll be honest here. Watching Mahou Shoujo Site at first felt like a guilty pleasure. I\u2019m a sucker for dark, grimy series that tries to deconstruct the magical girl theme. At first glance, the show seems to explore the worst traits of humanity. The pilot episode features merciless bullying, family abuse, and even an animal killed off-screen. If we take a closer glance at Aya\u2019s life, you can see that positivity is nonexistent. The first episode also establishes that Aya feels helpless because of her fragile personality and living conditions. It\u2019s almost if the world is fighting against her and there\u2019s always that thought of ending suffering by suicide. Indeed, this series deals with some sensitive issues that can be relatable in the real world so be aware of that. There\u2019s no easier way to say it but bullies can cause emotional distress so distasteful that certain individuals just wants to end it all. However in Aya\u2019s case, it\u2019s just the beginning. After becoming a magical girl, she uses her powers to take revenge against Sarina Shizukume, the leader of a trio of bullies that has been tormenting her life. So what does this really mean for the show\u2019s purpose? It basically means that humans have way too many flaws. Revenge is a common theme in dark magical girl shows so this isn\u2019t something new. However, Mahou Shoujo Site\u2019s execution of this formula fell flat because it feels unbelievable. A kind girl like Aya actually comitting a sin? That\u2019s about as edgy as it can get. In fact, Mahou Shoujo Site loves to capitalize on every moment in attempt to make them unique. What ends up happening is the same formulatic execution over and over. Characters committing sin and trying to get even with someone is almost a norm in this anime. If that\u2019s not your cup of tea, then this will be a very grueling experience.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t figured out the show is depressing to watch by this point, then maybe this could end up being a different experience for you. For me, this didn\u2019t change especially after meeting the other characters. It seems that every magical girl in the show suffers from some sort of tragic past. The real question though is if we should feel sorry for them? Honestly, there\u2019s two side of the coin to this. On one side, it\u2019s easy to pity them because the magical girls chosen by the Magical Girl Site suffered so much in their lives. However, most of these magical girls show their personal flaws as they would do anything to escape their personal hell. This includes using their powers to torture, manipulate, or even kill. Characters such as Tsuyuno, Rina, and Nijimi have proven that they would do anything to achieve their goals. In essence, hardly any character in the series ends up being likable because of their flaws. The worst of all is Aya\u2019s demented brother, Kaname. He abuses his own sister in any way possible for the pure joy of being in control. Throughout the series, Kaname shows a disturbing God-like complex that seems to be his own personal way of relieving stress in the family. It brings out the worst of this series whenever he appears on screen. Hiding behind his fake mask is a demon that is anything but acceptable in society. At some point of the show, I stopped taking him seriously because how fake the character is presented. He became more of a meme that exposes the worst of humanity. In fact, this anime presents men in disgraceful ways. Kaname\u2019s father and the bully that nearly rapes Aya in the beginning of the series are two other examples. I\u2019m not sure if that was the show\u2019s intention in the first place but still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\n\r\nWith 12 episodes, are there any reasons to watch this anime? Well to be fair, the anime is actually faithful to the series\u2019 central themes despite omitting certain plot points and characters. Also, the administrators of the Magical Girl Site may pique the curiosity of the viewers. It may cause viewers to wander what their true intentions and how it ties to the overall story. Aya also does mature more as a character as she becomes more confident through her friendship with others, in particular Yatsumura. There\u2019s even some minor shoujo-ai elements although don\u2019t expect anything too serious. Sadly, none of these really saves this abomination.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll give some credit to Production doA for making the bold attempt to animate this series. It isn\u2019t easy with how grim and dark is. The magical girls are designed with noticeable characteristics especially with their exotic-looking eyes and feminine features. Furthermore, every magical stick the characters uses are distinctive despite how ridiculous some of them are. However as a series with magical elements, it fell short in making a favorable impression of battle choreography. The camera angles is all over the place on some fighting scenes. The only noticeable part is how characters react which is extremely predictable. To no one\u2019s surprise, the anime also contains fan service such as with a beach episode. However, most of it is overshadowed by the cruelty of character behaviors. I honestly felt uncomfortable watching some of the early episodes. You\u2019ll probably get used to it once you make it through half the series. The character voices tries to carry some episodes but usually feels forced and unrealistic. Kaname is a good example that becomes a recurring joke of a bad villain. The only character that seems believable is Aya because of her fragile voice. The theme songs contains fast tempo with dark eerie lyrics and dark metal tunes. It works for the series but doesn\u2019t really make a favorable impression in the end. That ED theme song with the live action dancing is a thing of beauty though.\\n\\n\r\nI tried. I really tried to enjoy Mahou Shoujo Site but it just ended up being a trashy horror bomb. It tried way too hard to make itself looking cool by using ideas of graphic abuse and sexual assault. What ends up happening is a series with one dimensional characters and unnerving story. There are good magical girl shows out there but Mahou Shoujo Site is nowhere near that category. Stay away from this series and burn it with fire.",

            "content": "[Free of Major or Specific Spoilers]\r\nIn my opinion, Mahou Shoujo Site is basically the King's Game of this season. It's an \"edgy\" anime with a low score. But this anime's been called edgy countless times and it's used as a reason to show why it's bad. I don't really agree with this.\r\nOk, so, the story of Mahou Shoujo Site revolves around Aya and her miserable life and a website that can turn people into magical girls. It had the potential for some good psychological depth...but that potential was kinda wasted. I feel bad for a lot characters, especially Aya, but I wish more depth could'vegone into them. And in the last episode, there's a scene that's confusing. Aya was unable to perform a certain action before but then she suddenly can. Yes, I get that it sucks when an anime's potential is wasted. Yes, it sucks that some things are inconsistent. But a show can still be enjoyable despite that. Mahou Shoujo Site is interesting and keeps us watching to see how it'll end. Not everything was wrapped up...and it could've ended better...but it was still enjoyable to watch because of the tension-heavy scenes, fights, and the want to know more about the Tempest and everything else.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters...I believe Tsuyuno was a relatively good one. I found myself liking her and she at least changed. She went from living for the sake of revenge to living for someone else. Aya and Tsuyuno basically lived for each other and I like how the anime showed this. Our main character went from a shy doormat to a person who speaks more freely and is determined to keep her friends safe. Rina and Sarina both changed as well as so there's that. I honestly thought Sarina would remain a bully with a dumb sense of logic but she didn't. I'm glad. Rina went from freaking psycho to just a little crazy (yet caring) in a way. Nijimin was likable to some extent but I think her backstory could've been timed better. The others weren't there for long so they didn't get much development which sucks because I actually liked Sayuki and Kiyoharu a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nice, especially the parts when the magical girls used their powers. The animation itself wasn't too bad either. It was good enough to not distract me from watching it and instantly make me think \"Oh wait, it just looked really weird right there\". \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was good too. Not a single moment felt weird because of any out of place music. Each one is timed well. It definitely added to the sadder parts of the show. The opening was good and really fits the magical girl genre in my opinion. The ending song didn't sound bad but I have to admit that the visuals were weird (and not because it was a live action).\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Mahou Shoujo Site did some things wrong...but it also did some things good. Because of this, the show was enjoyable despite the flaws it had. Overall, I give it a 9.",

            "content": "Magical Girl Site is what you get when you take Madoka Magica and mix it with Higurashi, but then remove all of the interesting story elements. It is a grim-dark, edge-lord misery porn revenge fantasy with no real substance to back it up. Oh, also while we\u2019re making this comparison, get rid of any interesting character development from Madoka and any well executed moments of levity from Higurashi. Because you know, it doesn\u2019t really matter if you actually care about any of the characters that are having horrible stuff happen to them and you totally don\u2019t need any nice moments to break up the misery,right?\\n\\n\r\nSo this series is bad. Really bad. While I\u2019m not going to go into any particular details, people should know what they might be getting into. This series tries so hard to be as dark and messed up as possible that it contains severe and extremely violent bullying at school, heavy physical abuse at home, the murder of a pet, and an attempted rape that comes very close to actually happening. And this is all in the first episode, all to the same girl. Sorry to be a bad, lazy reviewer and continuing to compare this to other anime, but it\u2019s basically like taking all of the bad things that happened to three of the main girls in Elfen Lied (Lucy, Nana, and Mayu). Make all of that stuff happen to one person and instead of spreading it out over multiple episodes, cram it all into one episode; the FIRST episode!\\n\\n\r\nYou may be thinking, \u201cWell, that almost sounds so horrible that it could be amusing!\u201d You know, the whole \u201cso bad it\u2019s good\u201d thing. That was honestly what I was hoping for after the first episode. However, then the second episode came and it was just kind of.... boring. The ridiculous levels of stupid overly-edgy crap dropped off quick. Episode 2 brings in hints of the actual overarching \u201cplot\u201d of the series and it\u2019s very underwhelming. Those behind the mysterious website that gives the girls their magical powers are coming and you better be ready! The \u201cplot\u201d gets more convoluted as the series goes on to an almost laughable degree. And while all of this \u201cstuff\u201d happens, we just continue to have no reason to care at all about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re not already convinced that you shouldn\u2019t waste your time on this series, here are my category breakouts:\\n\\n\r\n-----Story - 1 out of 10-----\\n\r\nAgain, one of the worst things about this series is its total lack of any interesting story. The plot that develops is so meandering and nonsensical that it\u2019s nearly impossible to ever legitimately enjoy any of it. The twists are uninspired and (again) make no real sense whatsoever with no foreshadowing to support the reveals. The pacing is all over the place with spans of episodes having no real development and then just full-on info dumps in other episodes. It\u2019s all around bad.\\n\\n\r\n-----Art - 3 out of 10-----\\n\r\nWhile not completely abysmal, the art isn\u2019t good either. This anime could have been shown to people 10 years ago and they still wouldn\u2019t have been impressed. I guess you could laugh at the stupid facial expressions and the total edge-lord imagery; like, \u201cOMG! The main magical girl bleeds from her eyes when she uses her powers!\u201d But in the end, it\u2019s just flat and uninspiring. Some could say that the stupid facial expressions and the general art/animation quality in the first season Higuarshi was worse than this. However, Higurashi is over 10 years old at this point. The art and animation also had very good direction despite its shortcomings and had life to it. Higurashi also wasn\u2019t just empty shock visuals in most cases because the characters actually had the ability to get people invested.\\n\\n\r\n-----Sound - 3 out of 10-----\\n\r\nI suppose this is as good a place as any to mention the opening and ending sequences this anime. God, they are some of the worst credit sequences I\u2019ve ever seen in all of anime. The opening is mostly just an over-filtered mess of crap. The ending, however, really takes the cake. It has a bizarre sperm-going-to-egg thing which I guess is meant to be artsy (and the motif does show up in the series proper), but it totally doesn\u2019t work. Then it has the absolute worst integration of live-action sequences in anime ever, period. So bad. And then there is a special one-time ending sequence based on the idol magical girl character which is one of the cringiest things I\u2019ve ever seen, as a live action version of the character performed a bad idol song. The opening and endings aside, the sound is mostly just passable, like the art. While the score isn\u2019t good, it\u2019s also not distractingly bad. The voice acting is also mostly passable although it is legitimately bad at times.\\n\\n\r\n-----Characters - 2 out of 10-----\\n\r\nNow, I could really overlook a bad story and poor production. But characters, I just cannot get into a show without connecting with or being interested in its characters. Magical Girl Site has complete crap for characters. They\u2019re flat, seem to have no real point in life, and have no way of pulling sympathy from the audience. They\u2019re just there as a vehicle for having bad stuff happen to them. As mentioned before, they do nothing to try to actually develop these characters so that you actually care about them or what happens. Maybe they\u2019re banking on people automatically feeling bad for the characters because what happens to them legitimately sucks? It all just comes off as extremely lazy.\\n\\n\r\n-----Enjoyment - 2 out of 10-----\\n\r\nI was really hoping for something that would at least be crazy, stupid fun. But in the end, this just ended up being stupid. The first episode had some stuff that made me laugh more than I ever should at this kind of content. Then from there it gets so bogged down by its bad story and worse characters that I couldn\u2019t even enjoy it ironically. I just ended up being bored and rolling my eyes or raising an eyebrow at every twist. From about the midpoint onward, I did get a few more big inappropriate laughs: a very dumb, edgy phrase said when a magical girl with a box cutter magic item explained its power; a situation with a guy wearing panties; and one of the final scenes in the series involving two guys\u2026. Really though, if it wasn\u2019t for my morbid curiosity and the fact that I was watching this week-to-week as part of the 2018 Anime Watching Challenge, I would have dropped this by the third episode.\\n\\n\r\n-----Overall - 2 out of 10 (Conclusion)-----\\n\r\nI would say that this is the worst \u201cproper\u201d anime that I\u2019ve ever finished (the only \u201canime\u201d I\u2019ve ever given a 1-score to is Forest Fairy Five, but I refuse to call that a \u201cproper\u201d anime). I\u2019ve probably watched plenty of stuff that many would consider to be objectively worse than this, but most of those things are so short that the quick burst of weird badness is far more interesting to me and easier to swallow than this load of crap. This is just a contrived mess with no real point to it. All that saved this show from getting a 1 from me were those moments of unintentional comedy and WTF moments that were so out of left field that I couldn\u2019t do anything but find them to be interesting. But this is just my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nDo I think some people can enjoy this? Maybe. What kind of people would enjoy Magical Girl Site? Honestly, that\u2019s a hard question for me to answer without potentially offending fans of this series. This could be a good thing to watch if you really want to explore how to not develop a story, its world, or the characters within it. Or if you are just so absolutely sick of cute school girls that you want to \u201cdestroy something beautiful\u201d then maybe this can be a breath of fresh air. And some people may actually connect with these characters somehow and just automatically feel bad for them because the viewer went through similar situations. But for anyone else? You really don\u2019t need to waste your time. If you want to see some stupid over the top edge-lord crap just to laugh at, watch the first episode then drop this crap. For anyone else or if you have completionist syndrome and wouldn\u2019t be able to drop it, do yourself a favor and just don\u2019t. Stay far, far away.",

            "content": "(No specific spoilers are mentioned in this review, however the overall direction of the anime will be mentioned through vague descriptions and thematic comparisons to Madoka Magica which I presume everyone here has at least watched since this is yet another grim-dark magical girl anime.)\r\nYou may have stumbled upon this review wanting to check if anyone would have given the likes of Mahou Shoujo Site a perfect score of 10 and whether a review like this was written on the premise of satire. This will be my first review, so satire is completely unintended.\r\nThe grim-dark magical girl genre is nothing new, but for as copy-pasteas most people normally give it Mahou Shoujo Site is the much needed exception that would be highly praised if it were any other anime.\\n\\n\r\nI can sum up this genre easily, the main character is a cute morally-good girl who becomes a magical girl, becoming a magical girl comes at a sinister price, beloved characters die pitiful deaths, the once happy-go-lucky world turns into death and despair, cue nitty-gritty to the teeth style climax that resolves in borderline happy/unhappy resolution. This is the culture-shock style formula that propelled the likes of Madoka Magica to be a major hit along with the typical wave of criticism of proposed copy-cat titles that try to ride the same \"hype train.\" This isn't the case here, because Mahou Shoujo Site itself makes its own spin-off of the spin-off genre by playing around the formula and putting its own stake in the medium.\\n\\n\r\nBefore watching Mahou Shoujo Site my prior experience with Dark Magical Girl anime consisted of Madoka Magica, Magical Girl Raising Project, and Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero, and while I can admit each one has it's strengths the genre itself isn't something I could ever call myself a fan of, rather I'd prefer my magical girls to be on the bright and happy side of the spectrum. If you're like me you may find this anime much more pleasant than the first few episodes may have you believe from the start. For myself I started Mahou Shoujo Site thinking I was about to be put on another distressful roller-coaster ride only for it to end with me feeling like I had fallen in love, because despite how edgy, obnoxious, and clich\u00e9 this anime wants to appear on the outside the inside carried a lot of the same passion and love I'd find elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nI can understand why most other people would review this anime negatively, but I can't really agree with them either. To me saying the edginess of this anime is what ruins it would be the equivalent of saying the fact Madoka Magica has cute magical girls in it is what ruins it. Yes, both factors are equally prevalent in both anime, but those aspects aren't the key features of either anime, rather their only purpose is to specifically lure the audience into a false sense of the true nature of that anime's setting, plot, and characters. It's just in Mahou Shoujo Site's case instead of using cute magical girl designs along with a cute anime style as way to deceive the audience in believing the anime is cute and happy before turning dark and morbid it does the opposite by first painting a world that's so morally dark and volatile that the viewer can't help but doubt any kind of positive outcome to come out of any conflict or personal motive of the anime's characters. That's not to say Mahou Shoujo Site is a bunch of fluffy bunnies and rainbows under the surface, but it puts a lot more care and faith into it's characters and conflicts much more than you'd find in any other dark magical girl anime that carelessly kills off and tosses away its characters as if they were last week's garbage for shock value. That's the point most viewers have failed to noticed here, that the edginess is a deliberate factor meant to hijack their expectations from the reality of the anime's actual content.\\n\\n\r\nDespite comparing Mahou Shoujo Site to Madoka Magica I wouldn't say it should rival it in greatness as it's own classic, rather I used it as a reference like all other reviews that try to compare it to any other dark magical girl anime. That said my review score reflects my personal enjoyment of this anime and I'd recommend it to anyone who is able to stomach gore and blood and can keep an open enough mind to look past the edgy exterior as a design choice rather than a reflection of it's core. If you're looking for something similar to a small bright candle that refuses to be snuffed out in a big dark and damp cave, something that can be happy or positive despite the odds and circumstances trying to suffocate it, something that's \ud835\udc27\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2d meant to be taken as a serious train-wreck that tears at your heart-strings screaming tragedy over your dead waifu then this might be the anime for you if and only if you can keep an open enough mind for the first few episodes that paint a picture of anything but.\\n\\n\r\nLastly Aya Asagari and Tsuyuno Yatsumura will forever be one of my favorite character pairings of all time.",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Site is not for the faint of heart. Despite the name and its creator Kentarou Satou, this series is actually a spin off (not direct) of his earlier manga series called Magical Girl Apocalypse, which used action-horror undertones to showcase what would it be like if magical girls were ever this frenzy and evil-like. AND...despite everything else, this series is just too bloody, gruesome and an uncomfortable feast for the human eye to process.\r\nThe story of Mahou Shoujo Site is no different from Satou's earlier work, defisive to say about its main character, Aya Asagiri, through her measly self always being the targetwhether at home or in school. At home, she is always tormented by the sicko brother of hers (Kaname) who is the source of favoritism from the parents, who uses her as his personal punching bag, and at school, another tormenting by Sarina Shizukume and her trio of friends who doesn't give a care about weak people.\\n\\n\r\nThe turning point is when the Magical Girl Site admin comes popping by her computer browser, saying \"Oh, you poor, unfortunate soul, want to avenge and become and magical girl?\" It was there and then that she receives her weapon and encounter Tsuyuno Yatsumura, her first friend and same-status Magical Girl Site-chosen girl. It is then that the story had become full circle by stating that the Tempest, happening soon, is ridding all Magical Girls chosen by the site admins themselves, and both girls' quest to find more Magical Girls and their weapons, all to ally together and rid the site admins and stop the Tempest.\\n\\n\r\nIf the story isn't depressing enough, wait till you watch the story's progression, when more girls and problems ensue that make the whole process A LOT tougher (e.g. when Aya's brother Kaname learns of her being a Magical Girl gets the trust of one and bulldozing-ly trashes the entire group before being sent away for confinement), and enemies become friends (e.g. Shizukume learning the true intent after being the Magical Hunter which hunts the weapons, and joins with Aya's side to kill the site admins). Overall, the execution isn't bad, but it is far from perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAya and Yatsumura has been the faithful duo through trials and tribulations, and have gone through high and hell to reach to the point where they can be strong-willing towards one another but still in dire need of each other to support their motivation and goals all the way though, and the duo I truly appreciate that its where Yatsumura puts herself in compromising situations that gets Aya's blood flowing and increasing her resilience to take care of her more than just a comrade of sorts, but as first and foremost a close friend.\\n\\n\r\nRina Shioi and Sarina Shizukume may be Magical Hunters aided by the Site to steal the weapons of magical girls, but their behaviours are nothing exceptional. Rina, the 1st generation Hunter appears when Aya and Yatsumura were ready to expedite their expos\u00e9 into the true intentions of the Magical Girl Site and its admins, and Rina is nothing short of the rash thinking of attaining her goals through endless means with no plan in mind in order to stay alive. Her changing point is when her realization of the full picture is at hand, and that's when she changed sides. Shizukume, the next-in-line, is more or less like Rina, only more intelligent, but too realizes the situation at hand, and gives a helping hand. Their ruthless attitudes and demeanor are nothing short of typical, but yet serves their purposes.\\n\\n\r\nThe most despicable, annoying, horrible sibling, Kaname Asagiri and the idol Nijiimi Anazawa: the ideal love-hate-betrayal story gone so wrong. At first, Nijiimi's rage in Rina killing her best friend (who's also a magical girl) leads her into Aya and Yatsumura's hands, knowing that if she successfully eliminates Rina, there's no turning back, and Nijiimi subsequently gives in, and around the same time, develops love for Aya's shitty brother, whom through his intelligence of a sucker brain, knows the existence of the Magical Girl site and the weapons, and through her weapon (a pair of panties), subdues Aya and her team of magical girls but does not know the full story and gets stolen away (the anime won't explain this, so check the manga).\\n\\n\r\nThe other magical girls are there for show that the Tempest is the equivalent of a world gone rogue if they don't ally their efforts and stop the underlying tones of the site admins' free-to-do demeanors and plans.\\n\\n\r\nThe character placement is ALSO what you'd expect, but nothing this tragic, after watching Madoka Magica, you would have thought that there's nothing else like it, wait till Mahou Shoujo Site sweeps it under your feet.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation:\\n\r\nThis is the first anime TV series production by an entirely new studio, production doA, other than the \"Is My Order A Rabbit: Dear My Sister\" movie, and I really hesitate the directions that it takes for the production committee team to handle everything now to newly founded studios with no backlog nor reputation to them. I will say one thing: Yes, it's good that many new studios are coming out with good first impressions, but no, it's not when something like this show HAS to be the VERY FIRST one in the long-term. I have an affinity for studios that know what they are good and bad at, so production doA will have to step up their game if this is going to be the first of longshots, because the art and animation here is subpar, and maybe too dark for visual tastes.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nI remember hearing something about a relatively new idol group helming the series as their intro (it's the OP) for more exposure, and that's not wrong, because the song is legit good, and rightfully so on its own. The rest here (including the ED) is wacky, the background music scenes sometimes don't do a good job as it is and the ED has sperms around the wall of towers that is the Tempest, just take my word that all conventions will be thrown out of the puzzle.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Site is not a bad show, but not a good one either. If you can handle copious amounts of blood, the constant backstabbing that doesn't come close to how normal humans do and the overall premise of the show, it's understandable. I won't say I hate this series, but it's the yes-no plane hanging in the balance. If you want a series that's (said) darker than Madoka Magica, try this and see how it defines your taste in blood and gore in anime.\\n",

It's so bad that almost nobody liked this freak. Speaking like that I look like an anime hater, but of course I do, and still proud. It's impossible not to hate this crap. Mahou shoujo website is one of the greatest examples of why anime is in decadence in recent times. All this thanks to the pseudo innovation of madoka magic and other edgys shit we have this piece of junk these days.\r\nStory: The most edgy shitin the world. The first episode of this anime is so bad, but so bad that you already give 1/10 in the first episode. The first episode of this anime, is one of the most ridiculous things ever created, and an offense to intelligence. The first episode of this anime is extreme victimization. It's just delayed torture and nothing more. Not only the first episode is the mass of victimization, but all episodes. And the most offensive is that in a certain part of the story has very fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nFanservice, EDGY, Victimized Lolis And magic madoka were the perfect ingredients to create this garbage. If the author's goal was to create the world's dirtiest thing, my applause, my congratulations, he succeeded. If the author's goal was to create a depressive story in which people cry a river of tears and to make us think that what we are watching is very mature or adult, my congratulations he failed a lot, but a lot. Congrats to the author of this shit, created the most edgy and generic shit in the world, should win a prize for having made such a cancer.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also an atrocity. They are all victimized and one-dimensional. Villains are also an atrocity. The very creator of the mahou shoujo site is the typical villain villain because yes that tortures all the girls. There is also the sister of the protagonist, he is the worst of them all. There's an episode where he even got to wear a girl's panties, seriously, that's ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the animation of this shit is decent? And the answer is no. Animation is general bullshit and full of mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall mahou shoujo site is this. A generic story, lollis victimized to the extreme, pathetic, ridiculous, convenient and edgy history with nothing special. It's the usual edgy shit ever. And thank you madoka magica, your pseudo innovation inspired a lot of shit and we appreciate it.\\n\\n\r\n0/10",

Some people will immediately compare this show to Madoka in the trendy line of \"Dark\" magical girl series. However, this is somewhat of a mistake. Madoka was a Thriller that intended to rewrite the rules of what a mahou shoujo could be. Mahou Shoujo Site is a Horror that never really cared about those rules to begin with. Aside from including magical girls and having a plot that isn't about spreading love n' peace, the two shows have little in common. In some ways MHS can't even be considered a magical girl anime, or at the very least has a very different take on what makes someone \"magical\". The magical sticks the girls are given function more like weapons in that technically anyone can use them. This makes for a unique plot device in that the sticks are often stolen, sometimes by people who aren't even \"magical girls\" and used for various effects. The girls themselves do not gain any magical power that is unique to them as an individual. This further drives the point that MHS should not be directly compared to other mahou shoujo series. \\n\\n\r\n  What we are seeing here is more or less a blood and shock show that just happens to include the premise of magical girls rather than the other way around. In truth it makes far more sense to compare this show to things like \"Another\" or even Danganronpa, as those would give you a much better idea for the atmosphere and tone that MHS is going for. \\n\\n\r\n  Mahou Shoujo Site is indeed very dark. Almost comically so, with an unusually high number of characters being completely insane for no apparent reason with the only real exception being the main character. This drives home the first point that needs to be understood to enjoy this anime: you can't take it too seriously, because it isn't trying to be serious. What the show is trying to accomplish is more or less placing an innocent character in a hopeless situation and then exploring the more twisted underbelly of human psyche from there. Characters in this show die. Characters have their bodies torn up with their blood and guts strewed all over the place. This show includes almost every possible bad thing you can imagine happening to the MC, but what makes it watchable is that very little of it is particularly unrealistic in the sense that \"this never happens to anyone ever\". \\n\\n\r\n  Overall, the quality of Mahou Shoujo Site is there. The plot has decent flow albeit some logical flaws, the animation is good, and the voice acting is actually some of the best of the season.  However this only holds value as long as you don't hate this type of anime.  If you do not care for some edgelording, then do yourself a very big favor and do not watch this show. If you either enjoy this genre or are indifferent to it, then you will likely find that it is quite underrated and overly criticized for being exactly what it was trying to be. The biggest downside to the show has more to do with the length than anything, in that it is a single cour show of an ongoing manga and thus doesn't really conclude on a closing note. \\n\\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Why you should watch Mahou Shoujo Site?\r\nStory is Outstanding (10). I was was never a fan of the Magical Girl genre since I was young, although I've watch a good amount of Card Captor Sakura and Sailor moon since I don't have a choice back in the Television era. But there is something with Magical Girls and a dark and morbid story that really tingles my weird taste in anime. \r\nMahou Shoujo Site is another anime that I did not expect much to blow me away in the Spring Anime 2018 lineup together with Hinamatsuri. I just thought that this is a mixture of totallycontrasting genre and since I love opposing genre mashups that I would give this a try. And after watching the very first episode, it swept me away like a tempest in the end of days! I could not get enough of it that I have started reading its manga and the other work of Kentarou Satou Mahou Shoujo of the End (You should read this). This meant a lot for me since I am the type of person that is really picky when it comes to story and Mahou Shoujo Site did not disappoint... well I've never really set a huge expectation to it to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does not adapt the manga on a 1:1 ratio. It omits some parts and rearranges the story to fit the 12 episode seasonal format. Surprisingly, I did not feel that it was badly adapted; moreover, I felt that the anime developed an identity of itself that it can stand toe to toe with it's manga counterpart. I am glad that it did not have the adaptation disease that Tokyo Ghoul had.\\n\\n\r\nOutstanding Story of bullied, abused, mistreated unfortunate girls who receives special items to help redeem their lost life and happiness.\\n\\n\r\nArt is Great (9). The art felt magically eerie and I absolutely love it! The way that it mashes cutesie magical girly stuff with grunge darkness surprisingly works well. And I should not forget to mention how they combine live action, 3D CG, traditional hand drawn animation at the ending of the episode that makes me cringe for a bit then appreciate it after watching it. It is well represented in this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSound is Outstanding (10). \"Changing point\" by i\u2606Ris is one of the best opening songs for the Spring Anime 2018 lineup. It perfectly hypes me up to watch the episode and goes well with the dark theme of the story.\\n\\n\r\n\"Zenzen Tomodachi\" by Haruka Yamazaki tremendously adds to the eerie cringe of the ending animation. I couldn't even skip the ending song even if I want to. It is what I can describe as a satisfying cringe.\\n\\n\r\n\"...Watashi dake Mitete\u2661 (...\u79c1\u3060\u3051\u898b\u3066\u3066\u2661)\" by Nijimi Anazawa (Yuu Serizawa) the ending song for the 3rd episode is another surprise for me. It is not as a cringe-fest as the main ending theme but it felt out of place at the beginning but after it was over it felt \"Yeah it was a perfect ending theme for this episode\"\\n\\n\r\nThe overall sound and song choices for Mahou Shoujo site scarily fits the theme of the story well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are Great (8). As for the characters in the story, the main protagonist of Aya and Yatsumura-san are one of the best yuri team ups that I have ever seen and I was not even aware of it at the beginning. Both of their back stories fleshes out their characters more which in turn make them into an endearing and easy to relate to characters.\\n\\n\r\nI also want to give a special mention to Sarina's character in the story. I strongly believed that she is just a one off character that would eventually die at some point earlier in the story, but I got surprised on how she developed to one of my favorite characters in the whole Mahou Shoujo Site story. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are good, but not great enough to hold their ground. They are more developed in the manga compared to the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is not for everyone's liking and I know that. But if you are into the eerie, bizarre and good cringes, I would definitely recommend this anime to you in a heartbeat! One of the best Spring Anime of 2018.\\n\\n\r\nI would give Mahou Shoujo Site 9 magical sticks out of 10.",

            "content": "This review is spoiler-free.\r\nA lot of anime adaptations fail to meet the bar set by the manga, and Mahou Shoujo Site is one of them.\r\nThe fault of this anime is it wasn't able to incorporate the shape of horror of its manga. For this reason, it ended up being shallow. This has something to do with the usage of sound and visual effects. Perhaps this is also the reason why other critics find the anime pretentious for even using stern issues (i.e mental health) as a narrative.\r\nThe only good thing about this anime is its character development. Every episode, it manages to grip its audienceto know the characters even more. Clearly, knowing a detrimental character is as interesting as it could get.\\n\\n\r\nDissecting this anime into parts won't do anything better as it is meant for a targeted audience who watch anime casually without entirely gleaning on the themes of the anime. Consequently, if you enjoy gore anime with a sub-par plot, this anime is recommendable. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is the type anime that you'd categorize as \"it's so bad, it's good\".",

            "content": "before i start my reviews, i would ask you a few question,\r\n1. Do you ever want to suicide but you dont have any courage to die?\r\n2. Have you ever been bullied but never had any courage to tell anyone else?\r\n3. What is the meaning to be stronger to you?\r\n4. You always get bullied day by day, but magicaly you had a power to stop time, but when you using those power your aged will shortened by 1 or more years. What will you do?\r\n5. Last but no least. You had a sibling that always kicking your ass every day and he or she never lookedyou as a sibling but as a punchbag, but someday you had a power to teleport anything to anywhere you think about, but when you using those power your age will shortened by 1 or more years. What will you do?\\n\\n\r\nok lets start the review,\\n\r\nThis anime wasn't bad as they talked about, even in the first time when i watch the PV, i just like \"WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?\".... but  i started to take my courage up to watch this anime when its already at 11th eps. so i watched for the first episode to the latest one.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY : Bully, rape (almost), violance, madness, insanity and 40% blood.\\n\r\nThe whole story was not about cute magical girl(s) that fighting toy, or evil clown. The story is about unfortunate random girl that had a magical power by random tools that they got from 'Magical Girl Site' with random masked admin. If you are low hearted people you'll get torment by watching terrible things from the very beginning of the story. For me, this anime doesnt suit for anyone who had mahou shojo fetishes. Why? i dont want give much spoiler here, so watch the show from the beginning to the latest one. (IF YOU ARE WEAK, DONT WATCH THIS ANIME!)\\n\\n\r\nART : The art was impress me, remembered that production doA who produce this show.\\n\r\nNote :  this anime was the second project by doA, the first one was the movie of Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka? i could tell it was amazing the PH that produce a cute loli movie had such horror project like Magical girl site that containt 70% of violence and blood. \\n\r\nIf you never skipped the opening theme for the first to the latest episodes, you'll see naruto 2nd opening theme (haruka kanata) animation, tokyo ghoul first opening, Uchiha  Itachi that sit in the chair when sasuke is about to fight itachi for the last time, and many more other anime reference in this opening.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND : The opening theme is Changing point by i\u2606ris, most of i\u2606ris personel take a voice role in this anime, like Serizawa Yuu and Yamazaki Haruka. obviously, only Yamazaki Haruka sung for ending theme, special for 3rd epsiode ending theme was sung by Serizawa Yuu. (You'll enjoy the 3rd episode ending theme). The 10th episode opening theme is still Changing Point, BUT it was sung by anyone else, How unfortunate.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER : There is not much explanation for the character, it just simple magical girl character that doesnt do a cute thing and doesnt fight certain clown, rather than fighting clown, they're trying to killing each other in the beginning and joining force to prevent 'Tempest'. Even there a certain people who interfere their activity.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT : Mental disorder, Shit Otaku, Uncontrollable Emotion,  Psycopahtic Elder brother, no Revenge no Life. I cant enjoy this anime, but this anime make my blood rising, give my exitement almost to the top, and some of my feeling cant explain by words. This anime told us TO NOT JUDGE THE BOOK BY ITS COVER, EVEN YOU HAVE READ SOME PAGE IN IT, YOU CANT TELL THAT BOOK WAS GOOD OR BAD BEFORE YOU READ THE WHOLE CONTENT (at least read it even it just 50% of whole content). If in the very beginning you have no interest in it, dont force yourself or you'll regret it\\n\\n\r\nI recommended this anime for anyone who likes psychological genre, especially horror.\\n\r\nI dont recommend this anime if your're weak hearted or you dont like pscyhological theme even there is your favorite VA in it.",

            "content": "The term \u201cedgy\u201d gets thrown around as some sort of criticism by people who like to sound smart and mature, because they engage with a medium for people half their age. Personally, I don\u2019t use the word as a criticism, because I often enjoy edge a lot. I think there\u2019s a level of edge that gets enjoyable, because it passes so many levels of believability that I don\u2019t believe it was meant to be taken seriously in the first place. That\u2019s where Mahou Shoujo Site comes in.\r\nA more accurate term to describe this anime would be \u201ccampy\u201d, but fucking nobody uses that term so I\u2019mnot gonna bother. This anime has knives so therefore it is edgy ha ha ha never saw that joke coming did you.\\n\\n\r\nYou may be thinking that this is a matter of \u201cturning your brain off\u201d to enjoy something--ignoring the flaws to indulge in the positives. This is also false. I don\u2019t believe in such a concept. In fact, I present the opposite: you should keep an open mind and keep your brain turned on to understand why a creator would make such a thing in such a way. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cMahou Site is sooooo edgy!!! It\u2019s just a bunch of shock value!!!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWow, it\u2019s almost like that was the fucking point or something. Some people like edgy schlock like this. Why? Who knows. Maybe I\u2019m just some sick fuck looking to get off. Or maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t always need a compelling narrative to pick my brain. Look, I\u2019m mentally challenged enough. I don\u2019t need my damn cartoons to enforce that. Sometimes, I like to keep it nice and simple. There are girls in this anime, and they get hurt a lot. It\u2019s not real, so I don\u2019t need to take it seriously. And that\u2019s about it. At no point did I ever get the impression that Mahou Site was supposed to be taken seriously. It wasn\u2019t even trying to take itself seriously half the time, and I can explain this just by looking at the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nAsagiri, the main character, thinks about throwing herself in front of an oncoming train, but hesitates at the last minute. As she sits on the ground in her despair, office men on their way to work mutter to themselves how it\u2019s too early in the day to deal with this kind of bullshit, that they were slightly inconvenienced by her attempted suicide. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the best thing that happens to her on this day.\\n\\n\r\nShe goes to school and gets thrashed around by some bullies. Then she goes home and gets thrashed around by her brother. Her only salvation is taking care of a stray cat, which the bullies kill on the next day, right before they send in a JoJo character to come rape her.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in fifteen minutes, we\u2019ve already covered suicide, bullying, rape, animal murder, and domestic abuse. Some would tell you this is all an act to make you pity the main character, and while you\u2019re free to do that, I don\u2019t feel that any attempt was made at making Asagiri a likable character, and here\u2019s why: \\n\\n\r\nAya Asagiri is not a character at all.\\n\\n\r\nYou see her in an ordinary day, where she lives through incredible amounts of horrifying things, but at no point do you ever get a sense of who this person really is. Her entire character is defined by the things that happen to her. And, at the expense of making my most callous remarks to date, there is simply no logic behind her survival. She hesitates to end her life, but why? She doesn\u2019t have anything to live for. No friends, no dreams, not even a conviction that \u201cit gets better\u201d. Aya Asagiri walks this fictional Earth only to suffer. Anyone who\u2019s depressed, suicidal, victims of bullying, etc. all put up with it for some clear, emotional reason. Aya does not, which is what separates her from being an actual character you are meant to take seriously, as opposed to an avatar for projecting suffering onto.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the graphic loli suffering plastered on the screen, it\u2019s all there just for you to gawk at. Maybe you have some weird fetish, or this kind of thing is just amusing you. You do you. Personally, I find it funny. Mahou Site is cute. It\u2019s a level of edge that comes around to being endearing, because it passes so many levels of believability. Even disregarding my argument about Asagiri not being a real character, the things that happen to her are so extreme that I can only see the thinnest lines of logic. Knives in her locker, that\u2019s believable. Glue on the chair in the class, that\u2019s believable--the recent season of 3-gatsu kinda covered that. But setting up a rape in the back room and watching it? Look, I\u2019ve already proven that I\u2019m not the greatest person, but this is crossing a few lines of sanity here. Not to mention that the older brother beats the shit out of Asagiri right in her bedroom. What the hell kind of soundproofing did they do to their house to keep the parents from not hearing all of the screaming and gasping and thumping? I just moved into a new basement with a thin roof, so it\u2019s very creaky and I can hear everyone talking and having sex, so I\u2019d like to get in on this.\\n\\n\r\nShit, I\u2019m already 900 words into this review for a website I don\u2019t even like using and I still haven\u2019t even scratched the surface of how silly this anime is. How about the fact that one of the magical girls is some fuckin\u2019 bizarre fetish idol group that wears dog costumes and calls their fans their \u201cmasters\u201d? Or the magical girl that has some weird, old-ass, masochistic butler who praises her existence so much that he lives to be stepped on? How about the scene where the brother\u2026 you know what, no. I can\u2019t spoil that episode. It\u2019s too good to be sullied by this review. \\n\\n\r\nAll that I\u2019m trying to say is that Mahou Site is fucking wacky. And if you have a problem with that, then that lies with you alone. If you\u2019re disappointed that this author isn\u2019t making high art, that\u2019s fine. And although I can\u2019t speak on behalf of this person, I don\u2019t believe they were trying to make high art in the first place. To dismiss Mahou Site as worthless simply because it is not to your standard is not a weakness of the anime or the creators, it\u2019s a weakness of your own for not being able to accept things outside of your comfort zone. Look, I\u2019m not trying to sound pretentious. I\u2019m not perfect. I dropped Tada-kun after one episode because it bored me to tears. I don\u2019t like anime that have natural characters in a natural setting, and they don\u2019t do anything in particular, but it\u2019s a romance because of course it is. There\u2019s no real reason for that, I just don\u2019t like them. But, I never got the impression that Tada-kun was a bad anime. It was just an anime that wasn\u2019t for me.\\n\\n\r\nIf you wanna see something from Spring 2018 that\u2019s super edgy and DOES try taking itself seriously, go look at Devils Line. However, I won't go into detail about that because this is a review for Mahou Shoujo Site and not Devils Line. You can ask me about it if you want. That\u2019s all I have left to say on the matter.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're interested in the story itself, it's not much on paper. Girls get magical items called Sticks, and they use them to do things, and they have to prevent some sort of doomsday. Some people, aka dumbasses, will tell you that this is a Madoka ripoff, but it's really not a unique formula to begin with, as many action series, anime or otherwise, have some sort of doomsday plot. Overall, I don't really have anything to say about the story itself because it's not anything special, but the way it's told is very fun, and that's what's most important.\\n\\n\r\nNow, all this being said, does this mean I have no complaints about Mahou Site? Not true at all. It could\u2019ve been better in a lot of ways. As much as I\u2019ve said that the anime shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously, there were admittedly some moments where scenes get heavier and more emotional, and it doesn\u2019t pay off too well as they not only drag on for too long, but the characters aren\u2019t engaging enough to get behind. \\n\\n\r\nI also would\u2019ve preferred more action in this series, since it involves a bunch of magical weapons and abilities. While there are a few big, key fights to be seen, the anime plays more like a drama than an action thriller. I suppose this could be more of a preference, because both elements blended together fairly well, but it should be kept in mind that it\u2019s not super action-heavy.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, Asagiri develops into a character that\u2019s just annoying and even more non-sensical than when she had no personality. Hearing her try to plead with others to not harm the ones who\u2019ve caused her grief is just strange and unsatisfying. I was hoping she would have some super badass moment where the gloves come off and she unleashes a rage that reciprocates all of the wrong that\u2019s been done to her in the past, but instead she insists on playing the good girl. It\u2019s boring. People don\u2019t like Guts because he had a shit life. People like Guts because his shit life hardened him into a living badass, so you know that when goes into battle, he does NOT fuck around. \\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the other characters manage to pick up the slack. They\u2019re not amazing, but they\u2019re enjoyable enough to keep the show on its feet. Yatsumura works great as the #2 of the show, and the side characters are about as weird as they come. I already mentioned the fetish idol, but I didn\u2019t mention the girl who felt the need to state that she had big tits like four times in one episode, or the girl whose Magical Girl weapon is a knife that cuts herself to heal others, and that she\u2019s okay with it because she was \u201calready practicing self-harm.\u201d But the real star of the show is the bad boi Onii-chan, whose personality is so off-the-rails that you could tell the author wrote him with a smile on their face. It helps a lot that star actor Nobuhiko Okamoto delivers him with tons of conviction. And I\u2019ll say it again: this character has the greatest scene in recent years.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack had no notable pieces, but the voice acting was good all-around. I already praised Okamoto, and I\u2019ll do it again because he was great. Newcomer Yuko Ono does a solid job as Asagiri, nailing the despairing moments well along with having a wispy, wimpey voice without sounding like a dying mouse. Yuu Serizawa also delivers with the character of Nijimin, who has some rather severe shifts in tone that happen quickly, and both sides are done well. The OP grew on me a bit--it\u2019s not much more than a standard rock tune with a bit of an edgy streak to it, but it gets the job done. Same with the ED, but less so. Rather, they are carried with their visual presentation--the OP has a cool camera effect that looks like it\u2019s being played through a broken screen or lens. The ED is\u2026\u2026\u2026 uh, it\u2019s something. Something about two girls doing a live-action dance on a school rooftop while a bunch of sperm cells float around in the background. Yeah, I dunno.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation--ugh, can I go now? I just wanted to dunk on people who were talking shit about me liking this anime because apparently edgy = bad or some stupid bullshit. Look, I\u2019ll just leave this 7/10 score right here, and that should tell you the art is good but not amazing. Alright? \\n\\n\r\nAlright, kids, what have we learned today? We learned that watching violent cartoons is okay, there\u2019s no such thing as turning your brain off, and that if you have no personality then you should kill yourself. Alright, cool. Leave me alone now.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nSound - 5/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nEdge - 9/10\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 8\\n\r\nFavorite character - ONII-CHAN\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Medium-high",

            "content": "Have you ever seen a show so banal, so worthless, so unintelligent, so uselessly defiant, so lazy and so pathetic that you hate it with every fiber of your being the longer it goes on as lazy jump ship of popular trends? For me, the biggest example of that, is the latest edge cancer to pound the anime community known as: Mahou Shoujo Site.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIt is inevitable that within a community, when some concept does something to \u201cbreak the mold\u201d in a unique way and becomes a mega hit, there will be a ton of copycats spawning from it, to get a slice of that sweetsweet dough. In Western Animation, films like Shrek, as well as cartoons like Ren & Stimpy and South Park made such big impacts that they inspired a jillion ripoffs continuing to this day, all misunderstanding what made their originals work. In anime, we\u2019ve seen this a lot recently when shows attempt to make money by blatantly taking the template from a successful series. It has come with the success of the high school battle harem genre, the survival game genre, Sword Art Online, and of today\u2019s subject: Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Not the earliest example of moe gone dark (When They Cry beats it by about half a decade), but certainly a modern landmark.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nMadoka Magica, a show using the disguise of a typical Mahou Shoujo praised for its artistry, emotional depth and willingness to go to dark places in showing its characters confronting mistakes they wished to undo, was a mega success, and other creators\u2019 response to that was \u201cif we take a Magical Girl show, and add dark elements, it\u2019ll be a hit\u201d. Shows like Yuki Yuna, Selector Infector WIXOSS, Magical Girl Raising Project and today\u2019s subject: Mahou Shoujo Site, are a result of that bandwagoning.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nHaving seen Yuki Yuna about two years ago, it felt like it went too safe with its content, not being able to properly explore the darker elements the same way Madoka did and not greatly delivering on the lighthearted fun at its front. At the time, I thought maybe if one of these shows would be more willing to handle darker themes, it could have interesting things to say about life and expectations. I was WROOOOOOOOOOOOOONG.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Site might, flat out, be the most thoroughly reprehensible, apathy inducing, tryhard, edgy, unpitiable, lazily produced, tonally retarded, inhumane, DISGUSTING pile of shit that I have ever come across. It sucks ass! It sucks balls! It sucks ASS BALLS!\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nAnd it all starts from one of the worst first episodes I have ever seen for ANY series, let alone anime, one that was so bad it encouraged me to see this to the end just to tear it to shreds.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nThe entire episode was nothing but torture porn, shown with a shy cute girl, to instantly draw sympathy dealing with a list of edge tactics like it was some sort of fucking checklist. These range from her contemplating suicide, to being emotionally/physically tortured by school bullies, to being viciously beaten by her psychopathic brother, having a cute kitten she saved be thrown in front of a train/delivered to her, and being nearly raped by an upperclassman while said bullies just snicker and watch. Eventually through the power of plot convenience, she obtains a magic gun that accidentally kills several of said bullies, only for her to be backed into a corner by another character threatening her with a razor blade. That character then gets stopped by an edgy sociopath girl who could control time.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nUsing so many edge tactics would be laughable if it wasn\u2019t so thoroughly DISGUSTING to watch. All of this torture throughout the first episode is handled in an overtly methodical way, not representative of genuine human fault but a lazy writer using every edgy thing he discovered as a means of forcing audience sympathy. It doesn\u2019t work, not even in the slightest. Gore, violence and cruelty all have their place in a meaningful narrative when they underlie an interesting story or human drama, but going on episode 1 alone, more care seemed to be placed on the tools of edgelords compared to the basic essentials of story, character, or presentation.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nAnd yet, despite this awful first episode, it never tried to go further in darkness, but remained brain dead, single minded and bizarrely bipolar with edge to the end. The show was too lazy to even go to the same extremes again. People like me who wanted to watch this to see how much more torturous it could get were met with a barely functional Madoka plagiarist trying to wring earnest interactions out of fetishes with no sense of tone, pacing, or comradery.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nEverything from Episode 2 onwards is introducing a powerful world ending conflict (the nature of which was blatantly stolen from you know what), while other characters are slowly but surely brought in to put on their edgiest Yandere smile before becoming party members in the inevitable quest.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nThere are many, many, many problems with the writing of this show but for me, the biggest one is tonal cohesion. It can be seen as a problem in a large amount of anime from Fullmetal Alchemist to The Ancient Magus Bride that there are silly comedy moments in addition to the handling of darker themes. However, shows like those keep their overall presentation at a respectable middle ground where either comedy or drama could work when needed, because they care and understand about character building causes for conflict or human drama. The one thing I wasn\u2019t expecting Magical Girl Site to pull was have so many moments where \u201ccomedy\u201d arises, whether through one character taking on an appearance with gag boobs, a reference to \u201capple butts\u201d, comedy credits stingers with the sister-molesting older brother, XD chibi expressions, a girl who frequently gets off to smacking her old butler on the ass, magical mind control panties, or a Beach Episode.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nYes, you heard that right. A BEACH EPISODE. A show where everything I mentioned in the first episode occurs, where a character cuts herself in order to heal people with blood, and where another character says \u201cGod has never abandoned me before\u201d crazy eyed while bleeding from the mouth and nose, has time for a beach episode. The sheer extent of the whiplash is what really takes me out of anything the show attempts. Whatever humor exists here would be horribly unfunny even in a comedy show, but putting it in a show where nearly every girl deals with cold blooded torture and bleeds from some part of their body when using their power makes any attempts at wacky humor feel like incomprehensible tonal homicide. And not intentionally to create false ease like say, Higurashi. The humor mainly exists to fulfill more of the author\u2019s obvious fetishes.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not just the humor that detracts from the show\u2019s tone, it\u2019s the forced togetherness of the End of the World conflict (pretentiously called The Tempest) that brings it down to the dark depths of anime hell. In a show where crazed maniac girls are commonplace holding death grudges against one another, none of the many relationships feel like they build to comraderies. They just happen because the plot type demands it. Most egregiously with one of the bullies from Episode 1 that remained alive. Said character gets an incredibly disproportionate reason for starting her less than human bullying streak, nearly kills the protagonist at a latter point, and then just because the protagonist doesn\u2019t kill her back, they become buddy buddies to stop the end of the world. WHAT?! Sure, there\u2019s a realization there but that\u2019s barely a redemption arc and it is unforgivable to try and move our sympathies to a girl who gleefully tortured the shy and ineffectual protagonist in Episode 1 because of a ctrlCctrlV broad conflict.\\n\\n\r\nSeveral other character relationships go the exact same way, with characters at each other\u2019s throats becoming close friends without any sort of proper pacing to get to that point. What could\u2019ve been developed drama of troubled characters finding it within themselves to work together becomes sullied by a forced need to have the \u201cband together against the apocalypse\u201d involving way too many characters who get no time to let conflicts hold. For a show proudly putting its foot down to say \u201cwe\u2019re willing to go to DARK depths of what people suffer in life\u201d without time to care about anything, going Team Force Friendship is about the most clich\u00e9 thing it could possibly do. It\u2019s DiC Sailor Moon putting on the mask of Elfen Lied and Mirai Nikki just to appeal to the edgelord crowd, forgetting that it drove out all likability in only the first episode!\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s the power system and eponymous Magical Girl Site system itself, which like many elements of this show, are also f*cked beyond belief. First off, every weapon used by a girl in this show is called\u2026\u2026.a Stick. Yup, a Stick, like a tree branch or something. It\u2019s used here to describe anything from heart guns to necklaces to yo-yos to magic controlling panties. Unless you named the weapons Ding Dongs I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way the author could\u2019ve put less thought in. Serious scenes where characters call their weapons Sticks come off as more silly than fierce. I could just now imagine one girl picking up a tree branch and attempting to wear it underneath her skirt, insisting that it is called underwear, in a world where magic panties are considered Sticks. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the whole Magical Girl Site concept. \u201cScary\u201d face papercut people in some weird pocket dimension hack computers to give random girls magical girl powers for what seems like no reason, but eventually is revealed to relate to the completely forced apocalypse. The one who gather the most arbitrary negative energy gets to survive while everyone else dies. No specific idea is handled with the Magical Girl recruiting, since they didn\u2019t even nick Madoka\u2019s \u201cwish for a price hope/despair\u201d routine, just the enemy identity idea stolen in every series ever featuring fights against inhuman monsters, with no time to sink in because of awful pacing. Most of the origin stories for the girls don\u2019t get an exclamation at all for the site being there, like the writer was too lazy to care about why they had their generic or fetish powers. The site itself doesn\u2019t connect to the conflicts of any character even semi-well, with this antagonist force not getting any justification for their appearance, random ass powers or Halloween play paper cutout appearance.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nIn that sense, the show\u2019s script is emblematic of everything regarding this series. Illogically lazy. Not bothering to commit to any unique ideas, it instead nicks them from a source most people would recognize, but lacks any sort of tonal cohesion, proper pacing, variety, understanding of human drama, effort or passion. It doesn\u2019t even conclude itself properly, giving fuck all to any sort of viewer payoff as well. It\u2019s pure phoned in tripe, creating a torturous 1st episode only to wring further relationships from the foundation of a used toilet paper tower on a raft in the ocean, during a thunderstorm.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nNaturally this laziness extends to the animation as well, from the studio\u2019s 2nd ever project. With no effort blas\u00e9 character designs, bleh grey and black backgrounds (except during the beach episode), and absolutely nothing resembling flow in fight scenes, this is about the lowest effort one can put into a TV anime, sans excessive CGI armies or characters moving like a PowerPoint presentation. Even the few attempts at visual flourish are either \u201cpaint everything blue or red\u201d, or sunset scenes. Action, as I mentioned before, has no flow in any capacity, even doing things like using action lines over colored backgrounds that I thought we grew out of in early  Pokemon. Fundamental things are done terribly, like crows not bleeding when they are cut in half, or photoshopped meatballs being over characters\u2019 heads in one occurrence. And there\u2019s also the wonderful images of many Yandere faces, a psychotic grown man putting on little girl panties, and the ED having sperm fly everywhere. A show like Hand Shakers looks godawful in its own way but I could at least tell that the staff at Studio GoHands were TRYING to do something unique and inventive, despite it backfiring in every conceivable way. A show like this does about the minimum effort possible to be considered passable in some capacity, and absolutely suffers for poor art design because of it. So it\u2019s a shame for however many Japanese animators spent long days and nights on it.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nThe sound is also low effort, so low effort that I barely have anything to talk about. Suppose I could mention that the one girl who runs fast does so with an obvious stock sound effect, or the fact that this show\u2019s entire reason for being adapted hinges on promoting the idol group I\u2b50\ufe0fris. You heard that right, even the STUDIO only made this to profit off a contract for a promoting idol group, one whose insert in the series wasn\u2019t even memorable by Idol standards. Because anyone who gave a crap about artistic integrity or creativity stayed as far away from this as possible.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nFinally, the characters. What \u201ccharacters\u201d? This show has none! All it has is inhumane gleefully cruel excuses for the author to jot down his fetishes and edge checklists. These characters all have names and unique hair types, but without any distinguishing character features to them, the \u201ccharacter\u201d element fades in the background. Already Episodes 2-12 are forced to work with Episode 1\u2019s broken foundation, and when it does have to try and \u201cdevelop\u201d anyone from that episode, it has nothing to work with and leads to nothing properly worthwhile. The pacing\u2019s jank so any chemistry between devices feels tenuous at best and completely unbelievable at worst.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nThe lack of effort isn\u2019t just present for what the show lacks but for what is present as well. Of the nine girls (eventually ten) that it puts in the \u201cHero Group\u201d role, six of them have edgy Yandere moments at different points, which is not only lazy but barely distinguishable or built up. Higurashi didn\u2019t make every single girl a Yandere, and for the ones they did, they built up the element, however well. It even uses the \u201cmy parents were killed by a psychotic man\u201d backstory twice, one of which gets revenge so fast that we have no reason to care for the endeavor. And when those in the show are not being psycho Yanderes (including the evil for the sake it older brother), they\u2019re either completely cliche or fulfilling a sick fetish for the author with no substance or identifiable goal. Whether it be the gag boobs girl, the apple butted idol who controls people with magic panties, a girl who cuts herself frequently to heal people through the mouth insisting she\u2019s not emo, a girl whose only trait is \u201cruns fast\u201d, or a girl whose main trait is smacking about an innocent old butler. Every Magical Girl bleeds from a different part of their body as well, so anyone with a bleeding fetish can rejoice in knowing that bleeding from body parts will be a continual process that is never confronted as a problem because the show is that lazy!\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nThe ONLY attempt at anything resembling a character arc is protagonist Aya, who learns to get over her shyness, make friends with other characters, rebel against an immediate plan following a character death, and organize a beach visit for everyone! On paper it\u2019s acceptable growth, but in practice, the terrible writing and relationships that aren\u2019t given any time to rest, making many of her choices feel forced. This includes her forgiveness of the bully girl who viscerally tormented her prior and during the series start. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 path hampered down by the creator\u2019s laziness as well as awful plot rolling. No one else has anything CLOSE to that attempt, which I should stress was unsuccessful.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Conclusion\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nOne could easily say \u201cwhy did you even talk about this show if you knew you were going to hate it from Episode 1\u201d? Simply put, anime tends to inspire me in its ambition. Whether a show is a masterpiece or a dumpster fire, I\u2019m usually enthused by its wide variety across genres, different strengths and screw-ups, passion projects and inventive concepts using animation. I admire the storytelling potential present in an anime series, whether it be from the classics period or the modern age. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason I single out a show like this is because it is the antithesis of everything worthwhile in an anime, or any form of art period. Rather than putting effort to make their series high quality, the author did nothing more than rip off popular trends to steal away a direct audience, not having to keep tone so he can throw his sick fetishes into an angsty Yandere-full horribly contrived setup. It\u2019s a show the studio put out, not to share an inventive idea with the world, but to promote an idol group with the bare minimum in every capacity. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t misguided passion, or even the type of hilarious straight faced terrible idiocy one could find in Ousama Game. This is a product, assembly lined from checklists and trends that shouldn\u2019t persist, forgoing the artistry its inspirations held high, and is impossible to enjoy because it was neither consistently in straightfaced \u201ccrawling in my skin\u201d nor smart enough to be a parody of itself. Laziness begets laziness when it comes to this, spitting on the potential of anime storytelling for something less substantial than starring out a smoked window for 4 hours. This fetish fueled, plagiarized, lazily produced tripe isn\u2019t even remarkably bad. It disgusts me in having nothing but contempt for the concept of effort. It\u2019s boringly awful in every way, but complete failure all the same that I could never recommend to anyone.",

            "content": "This show is awful. It touches upon a lot of heavy themes including but not limited to; bullying, domestic abuse, torture, rape, depression, and other such fun topics. However, not once does it feel the need to adress these topics in a serious manner. A lot of the abuse the main character seems to soak up like a sponge, and is only used as a way to make you sympathise with the girl. It\u2019s essentially a guilt trip. What really doesn\u2019t help is that the abusers are in no way written realistically. They\u2019re not written as people with clouded judgement, or people who bend overbackwards to justify their own actions. They are written more like sadists; they simply enjoy abusing this poor little girl.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the major plotpoints thus far have also been lifted from another show, but for the sake of spoilers, I wont mention it. All I\u2019m saying is that it is extremely easy to draw a lot of parallels.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation mostly serves its purpose, but it never enhances the experience. It\u2019s a bit janky and goes off-model from time to time, and very often did I see something and think \u201cthere were so many better ways to animate that\u201d. Sometimes the strange animation leads to some unintentional hilarity. If you\u2019ve seen episode 2 you know the face i\u2019m talking about. Art wise, the backgrounds are plain and the character designs are nothing new. Background characters tend to look pretty wonky too.\\n\\n\r\nI tend to not notice music in anime unless it\u2019s extremely good, and here I also took note of the music but for different reasons. The music is extremely distracting. The worst soundtracks are the ones where there\u2019s a little girl chanting \u201cla la la\u201d as if it\u2019s supposed to be a cheesy fake-deep horror show. \\n\\n\r\nThere were a few short moments, however, where I found myself pleasantly surprised. Some of the interactions between the main character and her blonde friend I find kind of charming, and occasionally (but very rarely) there\u2019s some extremely strong visuals or really powerful facial expressions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is mostly just really boring. I\u2019d only recommend it if you want to dissect it\u2019s problems as a way to improve your own writing.",

By this, I don't mean \"flaws\" or \"cons\", I mean real issues. This is the peak of insanity.\r\n\"Every day, all I think about is dying.\"\r\nOur main character, who is the most pathetic looking girl imaginable, seems to be living in a world which is pretty much a fucked up place. All her school budies are literally evil bullies whose favorite past time seems to be kicking her ass and destroyingher life while smirking in the evilest way possible. At home, however, her role in the family seems to be the one of a boxing bag. Sometimes they do strangle her too. After witnessing this, I thought \"woah, it's only a matter of time until she gets raped and gets her organs sold.\" ....And exactly 4 minutes later some dude forces himself in her. Oh, and btw, she has one thing in the world she actually likes. A cat. So naturally, some asshole just had to come and kill it because fuck this girl specifically. Did I mention they told her her cat is dead whilst she was getting raped? Well, now you know. Amazing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, it should be mentioned that this series should not be watched by people who can't tolerate with violence and fucked up shit because this is pretty much as far as anime can go with darkness. This series is mature and gore in a way which is mainly only accomplished in manga series.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Every living thing that harms you, should disappear.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nJust so happens to be, our heroine gets the access to a mahou shoujo powers via the power of the internet and starts her rampage towards every living thing, except cats. Sweet, sweet revenge will be served. It's satisfying as hell, and presented in a manner most similar to Lute Ryner's murder phase seen in one of the most epic anime series ever made, DenYuDen. Mahou Shoujo Site completely abandons moral values, social norms and heroism. It only cares about chaos and resolve. When it comes to series similar to it, it achieves exactly as much as shows such as Madoka Magica, Elfen Lied and Higurashi no Naru Koro ni, but being much more direct with its twisted world and characters, giving exactly as little value to human lives as the Gods seen in Gantz. At this point, I am impressed. Some people will of course meme that the show is edgy, mc the epitome of victimhood and some characters one-dimensional baddies. I get it. One can kill all the good things this show has to offer by clinging onto these thoughts. My advice, if you can, don't let general consensus ruin the fun. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe series also comes with the best live action ED seen since the 2nd season of Arakawa Under the Bridge. I just love seeing them girls dancing all around the place while animated sperm flies everywhere. When I saw that I thought this series is definitely 10-worthy and not a 9/10. A goddamn masterpiece. I highly recommend Mahou Shoujo Site for anyone who has the tendency of liking chaos and the fucked up stuff. Especially the fans of Becchin to Mandala should give this a go along the fans of series already mentioned in the review.",

            "content": "We, the anime community, have been blessed once more with yet another edgy bullshit to digest, which has steadily and firmly joined the edgefiesta family. The newly born child of edge called Mahou Shojo Site sat among its emo relatives such as Ousama Game, Mirai Nikki and others and as their successor and production doA's first TV series, it did its job pretty damn well; I mean, succeeding in being a completely lifeless and rotten experience is quite an achievement... \r\nMahou Shojo Site is the prime example of how NOT to make the first episode, heck, of how not to make an anime. Through its22 minutes duration, we have to endure seeing over-the-top bullying, domestic abuse and even rape \"performed\" on our cute little main high school girl-kun. But fear not, this wonderful adventure doesn't end on that one episode! The entire world she inhabits seems like it's full of the evil moustached men who, in their free time, tie damsels in distress to the rail tracks for their own amusement. Both her school bullies and her brother, the master of domestic abuse 9000, grin and act like a bunch of clowns when they punch and kick the heck out of the laziest depiction of an abused and depressed person in fiction, *cough*, I mean Asagiri. However, everything changes when Aya discovers the eponymous Magical Girl site. After obtaining her \"stick\", I know, that's a weird way to call your magical \"wand\", meeting her new best friend Yatsumura and other magical girls they do... something. Well, since this show is such a (un)forgettable piece of \"work\", this is all I can say about this anime's narrative: something happens. That's all. There's no clear direction for at least half of this show's duration, as what truly matters is all the gore, shock factor and cute high school girls being psycho and trying to make the viewer as emo as it is possible. Even when the final goal of the characters is finally revealed the only appropriate reaction to it is... meh, who cares? My wrists are covered in fricking blood! Darn you, razorblades! Throw in some more bullshit so I can lose more litres! I don't even know what to think about the masterfully crafted characters. Besides the supporting psychopaths such as the previously mentioned bullies and Aya's brother, who in one episode took off his pants and showed of the stolen panties stick, yes, that's a weird flex but okay, all of her buddies are straight-up fucked in the head. Did you torture your family's murderer in your own room? Yeah, that's cool :3. Did you murder her friend and she went insane because of it and, after a while, you became pals? No problem; we gucci :33. Did you change from a mass murderer to a dumb fan service dispenser that unreasonably cares about others? Hehe, look at my BALLOONS :333. No one questions even one of these situations and, to be honest, it would be quite laughable... if the show actually managed to be ironically funny. The common trait, which edgy Chinese cartoons produced in Vietnam share, is being so damn serious that they become a top kek laughing material, but in MSS's case, I could hardly laugh. It's just that monotonous and tiring. Sigh, honestly, I would much rather watch paint dry than rewatch it, even if given a reasonable amount of alcohol. How is it production value-wise though? The animation is junky, inconsistent, but still better looking than an MS Paint drawing made by a 10-year-old blind child, which is something at least, amirite? The only thing that appears to matter is the \"hehe crazy xd face\", every single strong independent wom... girl in this show has to display at least once. None of the insert songs was passable enough for my brain to remember, well, I guess not having one might be the reason why... so yeah. The opening is shallow and it's hard to swallow and the ending is... something indescribable. It's a mix of 2D footage and some live-action idol-ish dancing with sperm flying in the background. What the actual fuck am I watching? What the heck are you doing hentaihaven?\\n\\n\r\nAll and all, I think I lost the rest of my brain cells after thinking about this show for 2 hours straight and spending 25 minutes on this \"review\". That's why it looks like it was written by a brain dead monkey, well, at least its atrocious quality matches the show's quality. Ugh, I feel like I'm losing consciousness, so hear me out: stay away from this show and drink a chug jug. If you want to laugh at an edgy anime, then go watch Ousama Game or Mirai Nikki... or something that's worth your time... I don't know. Are you still here? Guys?",

            "content": "What is an edgy anime?\r\nEdgy anime are the type of series that uses it and themes to make a serious tone however unlike mature shows where they create a permanent tone eddy shows would very often switch it\u2019s dark tone around in favour of having a more lighthearted narrative and tone. A lot of the time these shows would often have a lot serious topics, and themes that ultimately goes nowhere thanks to they awful tone shifts and because of this a lot of theses edgy shows ending up very pretentious as a result. The real problem with theses edgy shows that like with ecchiand harems they have the high chance of seeing well which sadly attracts the lowest common denominator where the audience in that group would only a show because it\u2019s dark themes and violence.\\n\\n\r\nAkame ga Kill is one of the worst examples of this because not only the show itself didn\u2019t function correctly as thanks it\u2019s non-existence worldbuilding, plot holes, cringe-worthy storytelling, embarrassing production values, horrid characters designs that don\u2019t fit with the setting of the show and pathetic characters but the show had no had no idea of what a mature show should be. There are other edgy anime like Future Dairy, Elfen Lied, and that I want to talk about but I will save theses edge feasts for another time. Personally I really despite anime that are edge because not only do these shows would forget to tell a story but they also would go out of the way to shock the audience with the edge and tonal shifts.\\n\\n\r\nSo what does this have to with Spring 18 Magical Girl Site you may ask? Well, I will tell you to know. Magical Girl Site is one of the most cringiest edgy anime I have ever seen because not only it\u2019s generally a horrible but it cannot even use it\u2019s edgy/dark content correctly. While Magical Girl Site isn\u2019t the worst anime, I have seen it still an anime that I hate.\\n\r\nStory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a middle school girl named Aya Asagirl who has problems with both her school and home life thanks to the aggravated bullying and physical abuse. While browsing online a website pops up on her computer featuring a creepy-looking person. The person appears to take pity on her and announces that she has granted Asagiri magical powers. She clicks yes and on the following day a pink toy looking gun shows up in her school locker and there Aya must learn to deal with her new magical power as well finding the meaning of the countdown clock on the website.\\n\\n\r\nAm just going to say it right now the story for Magical Girl Site is abysmal.\\n\\n\r\nRide of the bat this anime makes an awful first impression where the audience are awkwardly thrown into heavy and sensitive themes such as child abuse, rape, depression and torture without any reason apart from poorly establish the protagonist for the story.\\n\\n\r\nBesides of all the dark edgy shit that goes on in the story this is just your typical magical girl where characters in the show will have mini characters arcs as well being a boring survival type of show where only one magical girl can survive. This is the least of my issues with the show. The real issue of this show that ended up killing the anime was its portrayal of heavy and sensitive themes. This is by far the most disusing anime I have seen because it too all of the sensitive and heavy themes such as rape, child abuse, depression, torture, and bullying and doesn\u2019t treat them with respect as the show constantly went over the top and edgy about them. I liked shows where they address and tackle sensitive and heavy themes but this show clearly did not have a clue to present its sensitive themes and because of this me and majority of anime fans literally got sick while watching. After watching the first three episodes I was physically being ill thanks to this show physically abusing the poor little girl. What makes this worse is how Aya the protagonist doesn't do a damm thing about it because honestly, this show could have gone for a different direction if the writers simply allow Aya to move into the foster care home away from her school and school after episode 1 as soon she gets the pink toy gun and the plot could have moved along a bit differently but no we can\u2019t have nice thing thanks to this show stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show is pretty inconstant overall as either go way too fast or way too slow. While it\u2019s not as bad as Record of the Garncrest War it\u2019s still a big issue that kills the flow of the series as well as all the events that happen in the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really pissed me off about the show that the show had the balls to have a poorly directed beach episode aka episode 8. Not only that episode killed the tone of the series up to that point where it\u2019s very dark, but the show at no point had a piece of dialogue that stated the girls are going to the beach to have some cool time. I understand the show was trying to throw the audience of its sudden tone shift, but this was the worst way to do as it feels so lazy and forced.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Episode 8 this was the same episode that features the worst man to man confrontation I have ever seen in anime as not only it was all over the top but the direction/writing was horrible.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 9 is even worse as the show decides to takes all of its physics and logic and ultimately throws out the window in favor of shock value.\\n\\n\r\n(Spoilers ahead)\\n\r\nThe way that Nijimi died in the show was horrible because not only it featured horrible directing but the way Nijimi was able to live for that along to even able to stab Kaname in the throat with an edge of a glass bottle after being cut by Ringa sword which Kaname our comically evil villain was using. It's was bad enough that she didn't get decapitated immediately from the way that was cut by Ringa sword but the way the show didn't even bother showing us the amount of blood that Nijimi while she was on the floor. What makes this episode baffling compared to any other episodes in the series is her death could have been easily avoided if Nijimi actually controlled her temper like in the earlier episodes in the series where despite having temper issues she still smart enough to not allow her temper to take over. Ridiculous...\\n\\n\r\n(End of spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story for Magical Girl Site was beyond awful and sickening.\\n\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Magical Girl Site are all one-dimensional edgelords as they are all tropey as hell as well being very unlikeable fools.\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist Aya is your shitty damsel in distress type character who everyone treats like trash for no reason other than to give her a sad backstory.\\n\r\nTsuyuno is the boring ass monitor with dark past\\n\\n\r\nNijimi is a cute but tempered idol who would stop at nothing to kill the person who killed her best friend.\\n\\n\r\nSarina is the loud mouth bitch who refuses to listen to people even if it important.\\n\\n\r\nRina is a very intelligent girl who is very clumsy.\\n\\n\r\nKosame is the stoic edgelord who has the edgiest power ever where she gets to heal someone by cutting her own skin.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters aren't much better at in fact some of them are even worst.\\n\\n\r\nKaname is probably one of the most contrived villains I have ever seen in my life. Not only he such a disgraceful human being where he actively liked beats her own sister up Aya for stress relief but the way he literally became one of the main villains in the second half of the show was retarded!!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall like with the story itself the characters are utter shit.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nThe visuals are okay, but it doesn\u2019t matter when you have absolutely no substance to back up your visuals.\\n\r\nThe character designs for the main characters are pretty good overall and recognizable however the character designs for the side characters just were just awful and unappealing to look at\\n\r\nThe animation is okay for the most part, but there were times where the show had fair of still frames and choppy movement for some fights.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully the soundtrack for Magical Girl Site is the best part about this the series as it does a good job at capturing the dark nature of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and endings theme on the other are just forgetful and the voice acting overall is alright for what it was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the soundtrack is decent overall.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nSo that's is Magical Girl Site. A broken edgy mess of a show that doesn't even respect its audience.\\n\r\nThe story is horrendously written that is filled with horrible pacing and directing. The characters are all unsympathetic idiots who are edgy for the sake of being edgy. The only decent things about this show are the visuals and music other than that this show is a broken mess that barely functions.\\n\\n\r\nEasily the worst anime from spring 18 season by far and I strongly recommend you to avoid this edge feast as possible.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 1.5/10",

The studio is genuinely trying to make a good thriller, and that's why this is so entertaining. Think you know edgy? Think you know insane? Think again. Then think again again because every episode gets *edgier and more ridiculous* than the last.\r\nThe ED is SPERM FLYING THROUGH THE AIR WHILST LIVE ACTION IDOLS DANCE. How do you top that? Well, the show manages to, with another live action ED involving idols dressed up as dogs. Here's hoping for episode5 the bitcoin idols turn up. The plot follows suit in one-upping itself in preposterousness but I want to refrain from spoilers because this is an experience you can only have once. However, let's be clear, the number of times I went \"WHAT??\" at the show is more than I can count on my fingers and toes. We're only at episode 4.\\n\\n\r\nI like how funny this show is. Fantastic comedy. If you can tolerate blood etc. then I highly recommend this show as a great example of absurdism, and what *not* to do if you ever happen to write a serious story.

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Site is absurd but its also an argument against absurdity. If that sounds like I made a contradiction that's because it was intentional. The absurdity within the show is also intentional. The show uses contradictions as a tool to highlight absurdity. It uses contradictory imagery and the main character also acts in seemingly contradictory ways. Although the show contains absurdity it also rallies against absurdity by having its characters fight for meaning in a meaningless and cruel world. Despite being absurd, Mahou Shoujo Site has strong morals and a positive message.\r\nMahou Shoujo Site uses contradictory imagery masterfully to juxtapose negative and edgy conceptswith positive and hopeful ideals. Take the main character for example, she is shown in the opening theme song aiming a gun at her head and then disappearing into thin air after pulling the trigger. This imagery suggests suicide, however upon further inspection we find that the gun is shaped like a heart and instead of causing death it causes the person getting shot at to teleport to a different location. The main character is capable of using this as a weapon but she instead chooses to use it as a tool to assist her comrades. Another character cuts her own wrists with a box cutter knife, however she uses the blood from her cuts to heal her friends. This turns the symbolism of wrist cutting from selfish and masturbatory to selfless and sacrificial. Using imagery that turn suicide and self-harm into positive things is a tremendously absurd contradiction. Showing traditionally bad things in a positive way like this highlights the goodness of the characters despite their cruel and unusual circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nThe imagery is great but the characters also act in seemingly contradictory ways. All of the magical girl characters are shown or implied to have been gifted their powers due to intense suffering they have faced. The logical course of action for most of these girls then, is to carry out acts of revenge. This is most clearly seen in the main character's best friend, Tsuyuno. Tsuyuno doesn't understand why our main character, Aya, refuses to carry out similar acts of revenge. Aya's refusal is the core contradiction of her character and is what leads to her success as a magical girl. Aya not only refuses to carry out revenge but she actually forgives and co-operates with her former bullies. Willingness to co-operate, even with those who wronged you or who have the ability to betray you, takes a lot of trust. Aya's trust may seem naive however it is continuously positively reinforced by the events that happen in the show thus cementing Aya's trusting and co-operative actions as a positive message.\\n\\n\r\nAya's actions also teach a positive message relating to free will. The villains want Aya to accept her fate as an unfortunate soul and use that negative viewpoint to spread more negativity. The bullying that lead to Aya being gifted her powers was senseless and cruel. She would be completely justified in reciprocating these actions. However, Aya believes that doing so will be an acceptance of her unfortunate fate. Aya rejects this fate and uses her own free will to shape her destiny. She does this by setting her own moral rules such as not killing or taking revenge.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Aya is rejecting her unfortunate fate, Tsuyuno is so dedicated to revenge that she struggles to find any meaning in life beyond her own personal acts of vengeance. Tsuyuno is still shown to be a good person despite her negative outlook. Tsuyuno acts cold, calculating and pragmatic which is a foil to Aya's more naive and idealistic outlook. However, Tsuyuno has a strong moral framework and her hatred of bullying is what lead her to save Aya in the first place. Tsuyuno's conflict is compelling because she is a good person who is simply morally confused about how to find meaning in her life beyond her senseless and cruel suffering.\\n\\n\r\nIf the other characters are struggling with how to cope with their senseless and cruel suffering, then Aya's brother, Kaname, is the personification of that senselessness and cruelty. Kaname faces pressure from his father and from society to succeed academically. Instead of taking on the burden of this pressure himself, he vents his frustrations by abusing Aya. After Aya gains her magical abilities, Kaname loses the outlet for his angst. Kaname uses manipulation to gain power and control that he lacks in his own life by tricking one of the magical girls into giving him her power to command people. He uses his new power in insanely cruel ways. It's honestly quite difficult to understand Kaname's motivation as a character because he is just so absurd. Kaname's presence is a reminder that no matter what outlook you have on life that senselessness and cruelty will always still exist and that they need to be stamped out wherever they may be.\\n\\n\r\nUsing absurd imagery and storytelling to teach an overall positive message is a good thing. However at times the absurdity of this show can go too far. Some of the character's backstories are just so unbelievably absurd that they can border on becoming comedic. I could argue that being so absurd is actually an accomplishment but having a character's suffering be so ridiculous that it causes me to roll my eyes or laugh just does not give me a positive reinforcement as a viewer. The show also has some fetishistic imagery which limits its accessibility to more casual fans (assuming the edgy imagery didn't already do that). Some of the magical girls have man-slaves and Kaname is shown wearing women's underwear in one particularly absurd scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Mahou Shoujo Site has a very clear and simple message: be a good person and fight against evil. It also teaches to not let your suffering control your life and to use your free will to do good. These aren't unusual messages for a magical girl anime to have but the absurd way of delivering these messages is what sets Mahou Shoujo Site apart. Although Mahou Shoujo Site pushed the envelope as far as possible for the cruelty in the character's suffering and absurdity of some of the story events, they never diverted from the strong positive message at the foundation of the show. I really appreciate the decision to stick to a positive message because with such an absurd premise and events they could have easily went for a more nihilistic route in which case the show would just be edgy for the sake of edge.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, contradictory imagery and seemingly contradictory character actions show that people can be good even in an absurd world, Tsuyuno's struggle to find meaning in life beyond avenging her own suffering is a great moral conflict, and Kaname's unbelievable cruelty is a reminder that evil will always persist and is worth fighting against. All of these aspects highlight a strong moral message however the show is also quite absurd. Lots of edgy and fetishistic imagery is used throughout the series and can be very off-putting for a lot of people. If you are put off by such images you should not watch this series. For everyone else, Mahou Shoujo Site presents an interesting and fun absurd story that has a strong, magical girl-based moral backing.",

            "content": "Just about anyone could have made Mahou Shoujo Site. I say this with an open mind because it really comes down to a bunch of grimy ideas mixed together at once. Before I get to the who, what, how, where, and why, you really need to be aware of what\u2019s ahead.  As someone who have read the manga, I say with regret that Mahou Shoujo Site (Magical Girl Site) ended up being one of the worst shows of Spring 2018. It\u2019s actually a bit demoralizing considering that there aren't many big magical girl hitters this year and it already set the bar very low.\r\nForgetthe happy moments you\u2019ll find in some magical girl series, there\u2019s little to none in Mahou Shoujo Site. What you will find is a misfortunate girl named Aya Asagiri who has been bullied throughout her life. The thought of suicide often come across her mind and it doesn\u2019t help that she has a dysfunctional family. Her life does change in the most peculiar way possible after acquiring a magical power from a mysterious website. Thus, Aya\u2019s life as a magical girl begins.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, I\u2019ll be honest here. Watching Mahou Shoujo Site at first felt like a guilty pleasure. I\u2019m a sucker for dark, grimy series that tries to deconstruct the magical girl theme. At first glance, the show seems to explore the worst traits of humanity. The pilot episode features merciless bullying, family abuse, and even an animal killed off-screen. If we take a closer glance at Aya\u2019s life, you can see that positivity is nonexistent. The first episode also establishes that Aya feels helpless because of her fragile personality and living conditions. It\u2019s almost if the world is fighting against her and there\u2019s always that thought of ending suffering by suicide. Indeed, this series deals with some sensitive issues that can be relatable in the real world so be aware of that. There\u2019s no easier way to say it but bullies can cause emotional distress so distasteful that certain individuals just wants to end it all. However in Aya\u2019s case, it\u2019s just the beginning. After becoming a magical girl, she uses her powers to take revenge against Sarina Shizukume, the leader of a trio of bullies that has been tormenting her life. So what does this really mean for the show\u2019s purpose? It basically means that humans have way too many flaws. Revenge is a common theme in dark magical girl shows so this isn\u2019t something new. However, Mahou Shoujo Site\u2019s execution of this formula fell flat because it feels unbelievable. A kind girl like Aya actually comitting a sin? That\u2019s about as edgy as it can get. In fact, Mahou Shoujo Site loves to capitalize on every moment in attempt to make them unique. What ends up happening is the same formulatic execution over and over. Characters committing sin and trying to get even with someone is almost a norm in this anime. If that\u2019s not your cup of tea, then this will be a very grueling experience.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t figured out the show is depressing to watch by this point, then maybe this could end up being a different experience for you. For me, this didn\u2019t change especially after meeting the other characters. It seems that every magical girl in the show suffers from some sort of tragic past. The real question though is if we should feel sorry for them? Honestly, there\u2019s two side of the coin to this. On one side, it\u2019s easy to pity them because the magical girls chosen by the Magical Girl Site suffered so much in their lives. However, most of these magical girls show their personal flaws as they would do anything to escape their personal hell. This includes using their powers to torture, manipulate, or even kill. Characters such as Tsuyuno, Rina, and Nijimi have proven that they would do anything to achieve their goals. In essence, hardly any character in the series ends up being likable because of their flaws. The worst of all is Aya\u2019s demented brother, Kaname. He abuses his own sister in any way possible for the pure joy of being in control. Throughout the series, Kaname shows a disturbing God-like complex that seems to be his own personal way of relieving stress in the family. It brings out the worst of this series whenever he appears on screen. Hiding behind his fake mask is a demon that is anything but acceptable in society. At some point of the show, I stopped taking him seriously because how fake the character is presented. He became more of a meme that exposes the worst of humanity. In fact, this anime presents men in disgraceful ways. Kaname\u2019s father and the bully that nearly rapes Aya in the beginning of the series are two other examples. I\u2019m not sure if that was the show\u2019s intention in the first place but still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\n\r\nWith 12 episodes, are there any reasons to watch this anime? Well to be fair, the anime is actually faithful to the series\u2019 central themes despite omitting certain plot points and characters. Also, the administrators of the Magical Girl Site may pique the curiosity of the viewers. It may cause viewers to wander what their true intentions and how it ties to the overall story. Aya also does mature more as a character as she becomes more confident through her friendship with others, in particular Yatsumura. There\u2019s even some minor shoujo-ai elements although don\u2019t expect anything too serious. Sadly, none of these really saves this abomination.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll give some credit to Production doA for making the bold attempt to animate this series. It isn\u2019t easy with how grim and dark is. The magical girls are designed with noticeable characteristics especially with their exotic-looking eyes and feminine features. Furthermore, every magical stick the characters uses are distinctive despite how ridiculous some of them are. However as a series with magical elements, it fell short in making a favorable impression of battle choreography. The camera angles is all over the place on some fighting scenes. The only noticeable part is how characters react which is extremely predictable. To no one\u2019s surprise, the anime also contains fan service such as with a beach episode. However, most of it is overshadowed by the cruelty of character behaviors. I honestly felt uncomfortable watching some of the early episodes. You\u2019ll probably get used to it once you make it through half the series. The character voices tries to carry some episodes but usually feels forced and unrealistic. Kaname is a good example that becomes a recurring joke of a bad villain. The only character that seems believable is Aya because of her fragile voice. The theme songs contains fast tempo with dark eerie lyrics and dark metal tunes. It works for the series but doesn\u2019t really make a favorable impression in the end. That ED theme song with the live action dancing is a thing of beauty though.\\n\\n\r\nI tried. I really tried to enjoy Mahou Shoujo Site but it just ended up being a trashy horror bomb. It tried way too hard to make itself looking cool by using ideas of graphic abuse and sexual assault. What ends up happening is a series with one dimensional characters and unnerving story. There are good magical girl shows out there but Mahou Shoujo Site is nowhere near that category. Stay away from this series and burn it with fire.",

            "content": "[Free of Major or Specific Spoilers]\r\nIn my opinion, Mahou Shoujo Site is basically the King's Game of this season. It's an \"edgy\" anime with a low score. But this anime's been called edgy countless times and it's used as a reason to show why it's bad. I don't really agree with this.\r\nOk, so, the story of Mahou Shoujo Site revolves around Aya and her miserable life and a website that can turn people into magical girls. It had the potential for some good psychological depth...but that potential was kinda wasted. I feel bad for a lot characters, especially Aya, but I wish more depth could'vegone into them. And in the last episode, there's a scene that's confusing. Aya was unable to perform a certain action before but then she suddenly can. Yes, I get that it sucks when an anime's potential is wasted. Yes, it sucks that some things are inconsistent. But a show can still be enjoyable despite that. Mahou Shoujo Site is interesting and keeps us watching to see how it'll end. Not everything was wrapped up...and it could've ended better...but it was still enjoyable to watch because of the tension-heavy scenes, fights, and the want to know more about the Tempest and everything else.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters...I believe Tsuyuno was a relatively good one. I found myself liking her and she at least changed. She went from living for the sake of revenge to living for someone else. Aya and Tsuyuno basically lived for each other and I like how the anime showed this. Our main character went from a shy doormat to a person who speaks more freely and is determined to keep her friends safe. Rina and Sarina both changed as well as so there's that. I honestly thought Sarina would remain a bully with a dumb sense of logic but she didn't. I'm glad. Rina went from freaking psycho to just a little crazy (yet caring) in a way. Nijimin was likable to some extent but I think her backstory could've been timed better. The others weren't there for long so they didn't get much development which sucks because I actually liked Sayuki and Kiyoharu a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nice, especially the parts when the magical girls used their powers. The animation itself wasn't too bad either. It was good enough to not distract me from watching it and instantly make me think \"Oh wait, it just looked really weird right there\". \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was good too. Not a single moment felt weird because of any out of place music. Each one is timed well. It definitely added to the sadder parts of the show. The opening was good and really fits the magical girl genre in my opinion. The ending song didn't sound bad but I have to admit that the visuals were weird (and not because it was a live action).\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Mahou Shoujo Site did some things wrong...but it also did some things good. Because of this, the show was enjoyable despite the flaws it had. Overall, I give it a 9.",

            "content": "Magical Girl Site is what you get when you take Madoka Magica and mix it with Higurashi, but then remove all of the interesting story elements. It is a grim-dark, edge-lord misery porn revenge fantasy with no real substance to back it up. Oh, also while we\u2019re making this comparison, get rid of any interesting character development from Madoka and any well executed moments of levity from Higurashi. Because you know, it doesn\u2019t really matter if you actually care about any of the characters that are having horrible stuff happen to them and you totally don\u2019t need any nice moments to break up the misery,right?\\n\\n\r\nSo this series is bad. Really bad. While I\u2019m not going to go into any particular details, people should know what they might be getting into. This series tries so hard to be as dark and messed up as possible that it contains severe and extremely violent bullying at school, heavy physical abuse at home, the murder of a pet, and an attempted rape that comes very close to actually happening. And this is all in the first episode, all to the same girl. Sorry to be a bad, lazy reviewer and continuing to compare this to other anime, but it\u2019s basically like taking all of the bad things that happened to three of the main girls in Elfen Lied (Lucy, Nana, and Mayu). Make all of that stuff happen to one person and instead of spreading it out over multiple episodes, cram it all into one episode; the FIRST episode!\\n\\n\r\nYou may be thinking, \u201cWell, that almost sounds so horrible that it could be amusing!\u201d You know, the whole \u201cso bad it\u2019s good\u201d thing. That was honestly what I was hoping for after the first episode. However, then the second episode came and it was just kind of.... boring. The ridiculous levels of stupid overly-edgy crap dropped off quick. Episode 2 brings in hints of the actual overarching \u201cplot\u201d of the series and it\u2019s very underwhelming. Those behind the mysterious website that gives the girls their magical powers are coming and you better be ready! The \u201cplot\u201d gets more convoluted as the series goes on to an almost laughable degree. And while all of this \u201cstuff\u201d happens, we just continue to have no reason to care at all about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re not already convinced that you shouldn\u2019t waste your time on this series, here are my category breakouts:\\n\\n\r\n-----Story - 1 out of 10-----\\n\r\nAgain, one of the worst things about this series is its total lack of any interesting story. The plot that develops is so meandering and nonsensical that it\u2019s nearly impossible to ever legitimately enjoy any of it. The twists are uninspired and (again) make no real sense whatsoever with no foreshadowing to support the reveals. The pacing is all over the place with spans of episodes having no real development and then just full-on info dumps in other episodes. It\u2019s all around bad.\\n\\n\r\n-----Art - 3 out of 10-----\\n\r\nWhile not completely abysmal, the art isn\u2019t good either. This anime could have been shown to people 10 years ago and they still wouldn\u2019t have been impressed. I guess you could laugh at the stupid facial expressions and the total edge-lord imagery; like, \u201cOMG! The main magical girl bleeds from her eyes when she uses her powers!\u201d But in the end, it\u2019s just flat and uninspiring. Some could say that the stupid facial expressions and the general art/animation quality in the first season Higuarshi was worse than this. However, Higurashi is over 10 years old at this point. The art and animation also had very good direction despite its shortcomings and had life to it. Higurashi also wasn\u2019t just empty shock visuals in most cases because the characters actually had the ability to get people invested.\\n\\n\r\n-----Sound - 3 out of 10-----\\n\r\nI suppose this is as good a place as any to mention the opening and ending sequences this anime. God, they are some of the worst credit sequences I\u2019ve ever seen in all of anime. The opening is mostly just an over-filtered mess of crap. The ending, however, really takes the cake. It has a bizarre sperm-going-to-egg thing which I guess is meant to be artsy (and the motif does show up in the series proper), but it totally doesn\u2019t work. Then it has the absolute worst integration of live-action sequences in anime ever, period. So bad. And then there is a special one-time ending sequence based on the idol magical girl character which is one of the cringiest things I\u2019ve ever seen, as a live action version of the character performed a bad idol song. The opening and endings aside, the sound is mostly just passable, like the art. While the score isn\u2019t good, it\u2019s also not distractingly bad. The voice acting is also mostly passable although it is legitimately bad at times.\\n\\n\r\n-----Characters - 2 out of 10-----\\n\r\nNow, I could really overlook a bad story and poor production. But characters, I just cannot get into a show without connecting with or being interested in its characters. Magical Girl Site has complete crap for characters. They\u2019re flat, seem to have no real point in life, and have no way of pulling sympathy from the audience. They\u2019re just there as a vehicle for having bad stuff happen to them. As mentioned before, they do nothing to try to actually develop these characters so that you actually care about them or what happens. Maybe they\u2019re banking on people automatically feeling bad for the characters because what happens to them legitimately sucks? It all just comes off as extremely lazy.\\n\\n\r\n-----Enjoyment - 2 out of 10-----\\n\r\nI was really hoping for something that would at least be crazy, stupid fun. But in the end, this just ended up being stupid. The first episode had some stuff that made me laugh more than I ever should at this kind of content. Then from there it gets so bogged down by its bad story and worse characters that I couldn\u2019t even enjoy it ironically. I just ended up being bored and rolling my eyes or raising an eyebrow at every twist. From about the midpoint onward, I did get a few more big inappropriate laughs: a very dumb, edgy phrase said when a magical girl with a box cutter magic item explained its power; a situation with a guy wearing panties; and one of the final scenes in the series involving two guys\u2026. Really though, if it wasn\u2019t for my morbid curiosity and the fact that I was watching this week-to-week as part of the 2018 Anime Watching Challenge, I would have dropped this by the third episode.\\n\\n\r\n-----Overall - 2 out of 10 (Conclusion)-----\\n\r\nI would say that this is the worst \u201cproper\u201d anime that I\u2019ve ever finished (the only \u201canime\u201d I\u2019ve ever given a 1-score to is Forest Fairy Five, but I refuse to call that a \u201cproper\u201d anime). I\u2019ve probably watched plenty of stuff that many would consider to be objectively worse than this, but most of those things are so short that the quick burst of weird badness is far more interesting to me and easier to swallow than this load of crap. This is just a contrived mess with no real point to it. All that saved this show from getting a 1 from me were those moments of unintentional comedy and WTF moments that were so out of left field that I couldn\u2019t do anything but find them to be interesting. But this is just my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nDo I think some people can enjoy this? Maybe. What kind of people would enjoy Magical Girl Site? Honestly, that\u2019s a hard question for me to answer without potentially offending fans of this series. This could be a good thing to watch if you really want to explore how to not develop a story, its world, or the characters within it. Or if you are just so absolutely sick of cute school girls that you want to \u201cdestroy something beautiful\u201d then maybe this can be a breath of fresh air. And some people may actually connect with these characters somehow and just automatically feel bad for them because the viewer went through similar situations. But for anyone else? You really don\u2019t need to waste your time. If you want to see some stupid over the top edge-lord crap just to laugh at, watch the first episode then drop this crap. For anyone else or if you have completionist syndrome and wouldn\u2019t be able to drop it, do yourself a favor and just don\u2019t. Stay far, far away.",

            "content": "(No specific spoilers are mentioned in this review, however the overall direction of the anime will be mentioned through vague descriptions and thematic comparisons to Madoka Magica which I presume everyone here has at least watched since this is yet another grim-dark magical girl anime.)\r\nYou may have stumbled upon this review wanting to check if anyone would have given the likes of Mahou Shoujo Site a perfect score of 10 and whether a review like this was written on the premise of satire. This will be my first review, so satire is completely unintended.\r\nThe grim-dark magical girl genre is nothing new, but for as copy-pasteas most people normally give it Mahou Shoujo Site is the much needed exception that would be highly praised if it were any other anime.\\n\\n\r\nI can sum up this genre easily, the main character is a cute morally-good girl who becomes a magical girl, becoming a magical girl comes at a sinister price, beloved characters die pitiful deaths, the once happy-go-lucky world turns into death and despair, cue nitty-gritty to the teeth style climax that resolves in borderline happy/unhappy resolution. This is the culture-shock style formula that propelled the likes of Madoka Magica to be a major hit along with the typical wave of criticism of proposed copy-cat titles that try to ride the same \"hype train.\" This isn't the case here, because Mahou Shoujo Site itself makes its own spin-off of the spin-off genre by playing around the formula and putting its own stake in the medium.\\n\\n\r\nBefore watching Mahou Shoujo Site my prior experience with Dark Magical Girl anime consisted of Madoka Magica, Magical Girl Raising Project, and Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero, and while I can admit each one has it's strengths the genre itself isn't something I could ever call myself a fan of, rather I'd prefer my magical girls to be on the bright and happy side of the spectrum. If you're like me you may find this anime much more pleasant than the first few episodes may have you believe from the start. For myself I started Mahou Shoujo Site thinking I was about to be put on another distressful roller-coaster ride only for it to end with me feeling like I had fallen in love, because despite how edgy, obnoxious, and clich\u00e9 this anime wants to appear on the outside the inside carried a lot of the same passion and love I'd find elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nI can understand why most other people would review this anime negatively, but I can't really agree with them either. To me saying the edginess of this anime is what ruins it would be the equivalent of saying the fact Madoka Magica has cute magical girls in it is what ruins it. Yes, both factors are equally prevalent in both anime, but those aspects aren't the key features of either anime, rather their only purpose is to specifically lure the audience into a false sense of the true nature of that anime's setting, plot, and characters. It's just in Mahou Shoujo Site's case instead of using cute magical girl designs along with a cute anime style as way to deceive the audience in believing the anime is cute and happy before turning dark and morbid it does the opposite by first painting a world that's so morally dark and volatile that the viewer can't help but doubt any kind of positive outcome to come out of any conflict or personal motive of the anime's characters. That's not to say Mahou Shoujo Site is a bunch of fluffy bunnies and rainbows under the surface, but it puts a lot more care and faith into it's characters and conflicts much more than you'd find in any other dark magical girl anime that carelessly kills off and tosses away its characters as if they were last week's garbage for shock value. That's the point most viewers have failed to noticed here, that the edginess is a deliberate factor meant to hijack their expectations from the reality of the anime's actual content.\\n\\n\r\nDespite comparing Mahou Shoujo Site to Madoka Magica I wouldn't say it should rival it in greatness as it's own classic, rather I used it as a reference like all other reviews that try to compare it to any other dark magical girl anime. That said my review score reflects my personal enjoyment of this anime and I'd recommend it to anyone who is able to stomach gore and blood and can keep an open enough mind to look past the edgy exterior as a design choice rather than a reflection of it's core. If you're looking for something similar to a small bright candle that refuses to be snuffed out in a big dark and damp cave, something that can be happy or positive despite the odds and circumstances trying to suffocate it, something that's \ud835\udc27\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2d meant to be taken as a serious train-wreck that tears at your heart-strings screaming tragedy over your dead waifu then this might be the anime for you if and only if you can keep an open enough mind for the first few episodes that paint a picture of anything but.\\n\\n\r\nLastly Aya Asagari and Tsuyuno Yatsumura will forever be one of my favorite character pairings of all time.",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Site is not for the faint of heart. Despite the name and its creator Kentarou Satou, this series is actually a spin off (not direct) of his earlier manga series called Magical Girl Apocalypse, which used action-horror undertones to showcase what would it be like if magical girls were ever this frenzy and evil-like. AND...despite everything else, this series is just too bloody, gruesome and an uncomfortable feast for the human eye to process.\r\nThe story of Mahou Shoujo Site is no different from Satou's earlier work, defisive to say about its main character, Aya Asagiri, through her measly self always being the targetwhether at home or in school. At home, she is always tormented by the sicko brother of hers (Kaname) who is the source of favoritism from the parents, who uses her as his personal punching bag, and at school, another tormenting by Sarina Shizukume and her trio of friends who doesn't give a care about weak people.\\n\\n\r\nThe turning point is when the Magical Girl Site admin comes popping by her computer browser, saying \"Oh, you poor, unfortunate soul, want to avenge and become and magical girl?\" It was there and then that she receives her weapon and encounter Tsuyuno Yatsumura, her first friend and same-status Magical Girl Site-chosen girl. It is then that the story had become full circle by stating that the Tempest, happening soon, is ridding all Magical Girls chosen by the site admins themselves, and both girls' quest to find more Magical Girls and their weapons, all to ally together and rid the site admins and stop the Tempest.\\n\\n\r\nIf the story isn't depressing enough, wait till you watch the story's progression, when more girls and problems ensue that make the whole process A LOT tougher (e.g. when Aya's brother Kaname learns of her being a Magical Girl gets the trust of one and bulldozing-ly trashes the entire group before being sent away for confinement), and enemies become friends (e.g. Shizukume learning the true intent after being the Magical Hunter which hunts the weapons, and joins with Aya's side to kill the site admins). Overall, the execution isn't bad, but it is far from perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAya and Yatsumura has been the faithful duo through trials and tribulations, and have gone through high and hell to reach to the point where they can be strong-willing towards one another but still in dire need of each other to support their motivation and goals all the way though, and the duo I truly appreciate that its where Yatsumura puts herself in compromising situations that gets Aya's blood flowing and increasing her resilience to take care of her more than just a comrade of sorts, but as first and foremost a close friend.\\n\\n\r\nRina Shioi and Sarina Shizukume may be Magical Hunters aided by the Site to steal the weapons of magical girls, but their behaviours are nothing exceptional. Rina, the 1st generation Hunter appears when Aya and Yatsumura were ready to expedite their expos\u00e9 into the true intentions of the Magical Girl Site and its admins, and Rina is nothing short of the rash thinking of attaining her goals through endless means with no plan in mind in order to stay alive. Her changing point is when her realization of the full picture is at hand, and that's when she changed sides. Shizukume, the next-in-line, is more or less like Rina, only more intelligent, but too realizes the situation at hand, and gives a helping hand. Their ruthless attitudes and demeanor are nothing short of typical, but yet serves their purposes.\\n\\n\r\nThe most despicable, annoying, horrible sibling, Kaname Asagiri and the idol Nijiimi Anazawa: the ideal love-hate-betrayal story gone so wrong. At first, Nijiimi's rage in Rina killing her best friend (who's also a magical girl) leads her into Aya and Yatsumura's hands, knowing that if she successfully eliminates Rina, there's no turning back, and Nijiimi subsequently gives in, and around the same time, develops love for Aya's shitty brother, whom through his intelligence of a sucker brain, knows the existence of the Magical Girl site and the weapons, and through her weapon (a pair of panties), subdues Aya and her team of magical girls but does not know the full story and gets stolen away (the anime won't explain this, so check the manga).\\n\\n\r\nThe other magical girls are there for show that the Tempest is the equivalent of a world gone rogue if they don't ally their efforts and stop the underlying tones of the site admins' free-to-do demeanors and plans.\\n\\n\r\nThe character placement is ALSO what you'd expect, but nothing this tragic, after watching Madoka Magica, you would have thought that there's nothing else like it, wait till Mahou Shoujo Site sweeps it under your feet.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation:\\n\r\nThis is the first anime TV series production by an entirely new studio, production doA, other than the \"Is My Order A Rabbit: Dear My Sister\" movie, and I really hesitate the directions that it takes for the production committee team to handle everything now to newly founded studios with no backlog nor reputation to them. I will say one thing: Yes, it's good that many new studios are coming out with good first impressions, but no, it's not when something like this show HAS to be the VERY FIRST one in the long-term. I have an affinity for studios that know what they are good and bad at, so production doA will have to step up their game if this is going to be the first of longshots, because the art and animation here is subpar, and maybe too dark for visual tastes.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nI remember hearing something about a relatively new idol group helming the series as their intro (it's the OP) for more exposure, and that's not wrong, because the song is legit good, and rightfully so on its own. The rest here (including the ED) is wacky, the background music scenes sometimes don't do a good job as it is and the ED has sperms around the wall of towers that is the Tempest, just take my word that all conventions will be thrown out of the puzzle.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Site is not a bad show, but not a good one either. If you can handle copious amounts of blood, the constant backstabbing that doesn't come close to how normal humans do and the overall premise of the show, it's understandable. I won't say I hate this series, but it's the yes-no plane hanging in the balance. If you want a series that's (said) darker than Madoka Magica, try this and see how it defines your taste in blood and gore in anime.\\n",

            "content": "Mahou shoujo site is one of the worst anime in history. It's one of those anime's so bad, it's not worth criticizing, because your mistakes are so obvious. It's so bad that almost nobody liked this freak. Speaking like that I look like an anime hater, but of course I do, and still proud. It's impossible not to hate this crap. Mahou shoujo website is one of the greatest examples of why anime is in decadence in recent times. All this thanks to the pseudo innovation of madoka magic and other edgys shit we have this piece of junk these days.\r\nStory: The most edgy shitin the world. The first episode of this anime is so bad, but so bad that you already give 1/10 in the first episode. The first episode of this anime, is one of the most ridiculous things ever created, and an offense to intelligence. The first episode of this anime is extreme victimization. It's just delayed torture and nothing more. Not only the first episode is the mass of victimization, but all episodes. And the most offensive is that in a certain part of the story has very fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nFanservice, EDGY, Victimized Lolis And magic madoka were the perfect ingredients to create this garbage. If the author's goal was to create the world's dirtiest thing, my applause, my congratulations, he succeeded. If the author's goal was to create a depressive story in which people cry a river of tears and to make us think that what we are watching is very mature or adult, my congratulations he failed a lot, but a lot. Congrats to the author of this shit, created the most edgy and generic shit in the world, should win a prize for having made such a cancer.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also an atrocity. They are all victimized and one-dimensional. Villains are also an atrocity. The very creator of the mahou shoujo site is the typical villain villain because yes that tortures all the girls. There is also the sister of the protagonist, he is the worst of them all. There's an episode where he even got to wear a girl's panties, seriously, that's ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the animation of this shit is decent? And the answer is no. Animation is general bullshit and full of mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall mahou shoujo site is this. A generic story, lollis victimized to the extreme, pathetic, ridiculous, convenient and edgy history with nothing special. It's the usual edgy shit ever. And thank you madoka magica, your pseudo innovation inspired a lot of shit and we appreciate it.\\n\\n\r\n0/10",

            "content": "The \"Horror\" genre of anime comes with an extremely bizarre and inexplicable phenomena, in where people who absolutely hate this genre will watch it anyways expecting it to be something else and then lambast it for in fact being exactly what the show originally claimed to be. This is then followed by multiple Dunning-Kruger inspired reviews that vary in intellectual quality but are all easily spotted by their superfluous use of the word \"edgy\". Why horror is the only genre \"haunted\" ( dohohohoho I make joke ) by this oddity is anyones' guess.\r\n  But anyways, on to the anime in question itself:Mahou Shoujo Site. Some people will immediately compare this show to Madoka in the trendy line of \"Dark\" magical girl series. However, this is somewhat of a mistake. Madoka was a Thriller that intended to rewrite the rules of what a mahou shoujo could be. Mahou Shoujo Site is a Horror that never really cared about those rules to begin with. Aside from including magical girls and having a plot that isn't about spreading love n' peace, the two shows have little in common. In some ways MHS can't even be considered a magical girl anime, or at the very least has a very different take on what makes someone \"magical\". The magical sticks the girls are given function more like weapons in that technically anyone can use them. This makes for a unique plot device in that the sticks are often stolen, sometimes by people who aren't even \"magical girls\" and used for various effects. The girls themselves do not gain any magical power that is unique to them as an individual. This further drives the point that MHS should not be directly compared to other mahou shoujo series. \\n\\n\r\n  What we are seeing here is more or less a blood and shock show that just happens to include the premise of magical girls rather than the other way around. In truth it makes far more sense to compare this show to things like \"Another\" or even Danganronpa, as those would give you a much better idea for the atmosphere and tone that MHS is going for. \\n\\n\r\n  Mahou Shoujo Site is indeed very dark. Almost comically so, with an unusually high number of characters being completely insane for no apparent reason with the only real exception being the main character. This drives home the first point that needs to be understood to enjoy this anime: you can't take it too seriously, because it isn't trying to be serious. What the show is trying to accomplish is more or less placing an innocent character in a hopeless situation and then exploring the more twisted underbelly of human psyche from there. Characters in this show die. Characters have their bodies torn up with their blood and guts strewed all over the place. This show includes almost every possible bad thing you can imagine happening to the MC, but what makes it watchable is that very little of it is particularly unrealistic in the sense that \"this never happens to anyone ever\". \\n\\n\r\n  Overall, the quality of Mahou Shoujo Site is there. The plot has decent flow albeit some logical flaws, the animation is good, and the voice acting is actually some of the best of the season.  However this only holds value as long as you don't hate this type of anime.  If you do not care for some edgelording, then do yourself a very big favor and do not watch this show. If you either enjoy this genre or are indifferent to it, then you will likely find that it is quite underrated and overly criticized for being exactly what it was trying to be. The biggest downside to the show has more to do with the length than anything, in that it is a single cour show of an ongoing manga and thus doesn't really conclude on a closing note. \\n\\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Why you should watch Mahou Shoujo Site?\r\nStory is Outstanding (10). I was was never a fan of the Magical Girl genre since I was young, although I've watch a good amount of Card Captor Sakura and Sailor moon since I don't have a choice back in the Television era. But there is something with Magical Girls and a dark and morbid story that really tingles my weird taste in anime. \r\nMahou Shoujo Site is another anime that I did not expect much to blow me away in the Spring Anime 2018 lineup together with Hinamatsuri. I just thought that this is a mixture of totallycontrasting genre and since I love opposing genre mashups that I would give this a try. And after watching the very first episode, it swept me away like a tempest in the end of days! I could not get enough of it that I have started reading its manga and the other work of Kentarou Satou Mahou Shoujo of the End (You should read this). This meant a lot for me since I am the type of person that is really picky when it comes to story and Mahou Shoujo Site did not disappoint... well I've never really set a huge expectation to it to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does not adapt the manga on a 1:1 ratio. It omits some parts and rearranges the story to fit the 12 episode seasonal format. Surprisingly, I did not feel that it was badly adapted; moreover, I felt that the anime developed an identity of itself that it can stand toe to toe with it's manga counterpart. I am glad that it did not have the adaptation disease that Tokyo Ghoul had.\\n\\n\r\nOutstanding Story of bullied, abused, mistreated unfortunate girls who receives special items to help redeem their lost life and happiness.\\n\\n\r\nArt is Great (9). The art felt magically eerie and I absolutely love it! The way that it mashes cutesie magical girly stuff with grunge darkness surprisingly works well. And I should not forget to mention how they combine live action, 3D CG, traditional hand drawn animation at the ending of the episode that makes me cringe for a bit then appreciate it after watching it. It is well represented in this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSound is Outstanding (10). \"Changing point\" by i\u2606Ris is one of the best opening songs for the Spring Anime 2018 lineup. It perfectly hypes me up to watch the episode and goes well with the dark theme of the story.\\n\\n\r\n\"Zenzen Tomodachi\" by Haruka Yamazaki tremendously adds to the eerie cringe of the ending animation. I couldn't even skip the ending song even if I want to. It is what I can describe as a satisfying cringe.\\n\\n\r\n\"...Watashi dake Mitete\u2661 (...\u79c1\u3060\u3051\u898b\u3066\u3066\u2661)\" by Nijimi Anazawa (Yuu Serizawa) the ending song for the 3rd episode is another surprise for me. It is not as a cringe-fest as the main ending theme but it felt out of place at the beginning but after it was over it felt \"Yeah it was a perfect ending theme for this episode\"\\n\\n\r\nThe overall sound and song choices for Mahou Shoujo site scarily fits the theme of the story well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are Great (8). As for the characters in the story, the main protagonist of Aya and Yatsumura-san are one of the best yuri team ups that I have ever seen and I was not even aware of it at the beginning. Both of their back stories fleshes out their characters more which in turn make them into an endearing and easy to relate to characters.\\n\\n\r\nI also want to give a special mention to Sarina's character in the story. I strongly believed that she is just a one off character that would eventually die at some point earlier in the story, but I got surprised on how she developed to one of my favorite characters in the whole Mahou Shoujo Site story. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are good, but not great enough to hold their ground. They are more developed in the manga compared to the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is not for everyone's liking and I know that. But if you are into the eerie, bizarre and good cringes, I would definitely recommend this anime to you in a heartbeat! One of the best Spring Anime of 2018.\\n\\n\r\nI would give Mahou Shoujo Site 9 magical sticks out of 10.",

            "content": "This review is spoiler-free.\r\nA lot of anime adaptations fail to meet the bar set by the manga, and Mahou Shoujo Site is one of them.\r\nThe fault of this anime is it wasn't able to incorporate the shape of horror of its manga. For this reason, it ended up being shallow. This has something to do with the usage of sound and visual effects. Perhaps this is also the reason why other critics find the anime pretentious for even using stern issues (i.e mental health) as a narrative.\r\nThe only good thing about this anime is its character development. Every episode, it manages to grip its audienceto know the characters even more. Clearly, knowing a detrimental character is as interesting as it could get.\\n\\n\r\nDissecting this anime into parts won't do anything better as it is meant for a targeted audience who watch anime casually without entirely gleaning on the themes of the anime. Consequently, if you enjoy gore anime with a sub-par plot, this anime is recommendable. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is the type anime that you'd categorize as \"it's so bad, it's good\".",

            "content": "before i start my reviews, i would ask you a few question,\r\n1. Do you ever want to suicide but you dont have any courage to die?\r\n2. Have you ever been bullied but never had any courage to tell anyone else?\r\n3. What is the meaning to be stronger to you?\r\n4. You always get bullied day by day, but magicaly you had a power to stop time, but when you using those power your aged will shortened by 1 or more years. What will you do?\r\n5. Last but no least. You had a sibling that always kicking your ass every day and he or she never lookedyou as a sibling but as a punchbag, but someday you had a power to teleport anything to anywhere you think about, but when you using those power your age will shortened by 1 or more years. What will you do?\\n\\n\r\nok lets start the review,\\n\r\nThis anime wasn't bad as they talked about, even in the first time when i watch the PV, i just like \"WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?\".... but  i started to take my courage up to watch this anime when its already at 11th eps. so i watched for the first episode to the latest one.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY : Bully, rape (almost), violance, madness, insanity and 40% blood.\\n\r\nThe whole story was not about cute magical girl(s) that fighting toy, or evil clown. The story is about unfortunate random girl that had a magical power by random tools that they got from 'Magical Girl Site' with random masked admin. If you are low hearted people you'll get torment by watching terrible things from the very beginning of the story. For me, this anime doesnt suit for anyone who had mahou shojo fetishes. Why? i dont want give much spoiler here, so watch the show from the beginning to the latest one. (IF YOU ARE WEAK, DONT WATCH THIS ANIME!)\\n\\n\r\nART : The art was impress me, remembered that production doA who produce this show.\\n\r\nNote :  this anime was the second project by doA, the first one was the movie of Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka? i could tell it was amazing the PH that produce a cute loli movie had such horror project like Magical girl site that containt 70% of violence and blood. \\n\r\nIf you never skipped the opening theme for the first to the latest episodes, you'll see naruto 2nd opening theme (haruka kanata) animation, tokyo ghoul first opening, Uchiha  Itachi that sit in the chair when sasuke is about to fight itachi for the last time, and many more other anime reference in this opening.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND : The opening theme is Changing point by i\u2606ris, most of i\u2606ris personel take a voice role in this anime, like Serizawa Yuu and Yamazaki Haruka. obviously, only Yamazaki Haruka sung for ending theme, special for 3rd epsiode ending theme was sung by Serizawa Yuu. (You'll enjoy the 3rd episode ending theme). The 10th episode opening theme is still Changing Point, BUT it was sung by anyone else, How unfortunate.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER : There is not much explanation for the character, it just simple magical girl character that doesnt do a cute thing and doesnt fight certain clown, rather than fighting clown, they're trying to killing each other in the beginning and joining force to prevent 'Tempest'. Even there a certain people who interfere their activity.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT : Mental disorder, Shit Otaku, Uncontrollable Emotion,  Psycopahtic Elder brother, no Revenge no Life. I cant enjoy this anime, but this anime make my blood rising, give my exitement almost to the top, and some of my feeling cant explain by words. This anime told us TO NOT JUDGE THE BOOK BY ITS COVER, EVEN YOU HAVE READ SOME PAGE IN IT, YOU CANT TELL THAT BOOK WAS GOOD OR BAD BEFORE YOU READ THE WHOLE CONTENT (at least read it even it just 50% of whole content). If in the very beginning you have no interest in it, dont force yourself or you'll regret it\\n\\n\r\nI recommended this anime for anyone who likes psychological genre, especially horror.\\n\r\nI dont recommend this anime if your're weak hearted or you dont like pscyhological theme even there is your favorite VA in it.",

            "content": "(This is a prelim review, so I may or may not submit a new review after this series ends, or may end up just resubmitting this entirely.)\r\nFor the most part, anime series that showcase the realities of life are usually really solid or even great. Here, this is not the case at all. Over-the-top edginess DOES NOT equal good storywriting whatsoever, and series like Ousama Game and this series are near perfect examples of what NOT to do when making series with dark elements and plot points. Also, this series seems to lack a true sense of identity: it's as if this series hasn't madeup its mind on whether it's mostly a horror/thriller series, or a magical girl series...cause I'll tell you right now....IMO, it is getting a failing grade in both categories so far. This series is so FUCKED UP....in a more bad than good way.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: (I'm probably gonna end up talking too long about this one) While I understand that the backstories of the settings and the characters can't really compare to a good handful of examples of even worse situations in the real world, this series really seems to be \"force-feeding\" the viewers these backstories and/or flashbacks in an attempt to make it look compelling and impactful. Basically, anyone (in this case, all girls so far) that has experienced moments of periods of great misfortunes in their lives are qualified to become magical girls via a website run by a very shady admin character with dark intentions. Honestly, the backstories are trying to force us as viewers to sympathize with the main characters, when they really haven't actually looked into the heavy elements of their pasts in a more serious and informal manner. Additionally, the abusers or bullies are in no way realistic at all, and neither are the people surrounding the main cast....it is WAY too exaggerated and dynamic of a situation to really consider it compelling without getting pissed off or even laughing at it. Oh yea, btw, it doesn't help either when the characters are not exactly very likable, anyway. One more thing, the story, like with a majority of LN/manga adaptations, feels very rushed and skimming on certain details, so it makes it even harder for us to feel anything for it besides getting shocked or terrified at some of the scenes, or even make us scratch our heads in confusion (I mean, c'mon....sperm swimmming to somewhere, a magical \"stick\" in the form of underwear...the term \"odd\" can't really describe that)\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: The animation style of this series does a decent enough job, especially when it comes down to the \"rape\" faces and other \"full-blown\" facial expressions. However, it never really does anything particularly breathtaking. Also, some scenes felt rather awkward, as if the staff had some complications animating those parts, which can turn out as more hilarious than actually terrifying. The character and setting designs are also rather bland, though not actually that bad. Also, this series rode the recent CG trend as well and became one of those that didn't get on it the right way.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Music from a series is considered good if it becomes noticeable and notable. Here, this wasn't the case. In fact, some of the OST placed in certain scenes don't even really fit the atmosphere of the situation at the time. The only soundtracks I can call anywhere near decent are the OP and ED themes, and that's about it. I don't even want to mention the \"soundtrack\" (it's too stupid to be really called that) where a girl is going \"fa la la la\"....in a series that doesn't know if it wanted comedy or horror in those timings.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: I personally don't like the \"miss goody two shoes\" main heroine. I feel like this character's pessimism is just over-the-top ridiculous, considering that she thinks this even though she didn't really do anything significant to change that up until she got her powers...and even then, she hesitates and bitches around about using those powers to potentially harm others. For many other \"goody-two-shoes\" characters in other series, at least their situation was better explained, more reasonable, and often more forgivable, imo....but here, it's hard to really find the main heroine really likable, anyway, especially considering how her backstory was trying to force us to somehow do so. The only real character that can be considered likable is the secondary main heroine, and even her character is really kinda bland. There is one good aspect in this area, though....the interactions between the two main characters are really good to see, though it'll still depend on whether or not any of them get significant development.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: It's honestly really offputting on a personal as to how the backstories and plot introduction were presented. It does have its comedy moments and some of the plot elements are interesting to me personally. However, overall, this rather rushed story already lacking of details feels rather dry to me for now. It's safe to say, though, that at least I get more out of this than I did with the likes of something like Ousama Game or School Days, which had their own dark elements and edginess, though their executions didn't pan out the right way, either. The fact that the plot is still rather interesting, even though it's still really dry, is pretty much the sole reason why I'm still watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: You're better off watching the \"perfect\" magical girl series, Madoka Magica, than this series jumping in and out of horror/psycho and magical girl. If you like horror/psycho, maybe this series could click for you if you don't mind the skimming details and rushing of the story. For magical girl fans....while I'm not into the magical girl genre as most people, I'd really suggest you NOT to bother wasting your time on this. If you're an anime fan in general like me, it's really up to you....I guess it probably shouldn't hurt too much trying the first few episodes before deciding whether or not to continue this \"fuckery\" of a show. Watch at your own risk...",

            "content": "(NOTE that my ratings are influenced by my knowledge of the manga)\r\nI was afraid to watch the anime because I heard this was a bad adaptation, and after watching it, I can see why. The anime, imo, did the manga little to no justice, and if you're at all interested in this series, I highly recommend reading the manga.\r\nThe anime changed the series the events occurred in and never fleshed the characters the way it is in the manga. This could be due to the anime trying to adapt an unfinished manga, which deserves more than 12 episodes to be adapted properly, but even then,I feel that this could have been adapted better. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of this, imo, is the ending. It was just thrown together because the fate of the two characters in question have not been revealed. The anime tried to create a concluding end, and that makes me believe that we will not be getting a season two. Honestly though, I don't even want a season two, because if we did get a season two, it would be an entirely new series since stuff that happened in the anime completely alters the plot and some characters in the manga. If anything, a completely new adaptation is needed.\\n\\n\r\nAn anime I can liken to this is Akame ga Kiru. The manga was adapted before it was even completed, and because of this, the fate of a handful of characters was completely different. It takes away from the experience after dedicating time to reading the manga, and it was just a huge disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nI can only hope that when the manga concludes, we will get a proper adaptation. The characters develop a lot more, and the plot is deeper (in some aspects), and this was all thrown away in this adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I can say that the anime was entertaining enough. The art and animation was good enough for me to not be driven away by it, so I enjoyed that. Something manga readers look forward to is the series you are reading get animated on screen, and that was the elation I felt when seeing the characters come to life with voices and colors. I still am disappointed in the adaptation overall, but I enjoyed seeing these characters on screen.\\n",

            "content": "---- This review has some spoilers since the anime has already finished ------\r\nMost people call this anime \"edgy\" and this word has been a trend lately around some mahou shoujo animes. What is edgy? Everybody might describe it differently, but to sum up it is an anime that showcases easy \"jumpshocks\" or shocking situations in order to make it look deep, but not really succeding at all.\r\nDo I consider this anime edgy? Well, not really and I'm going to explain why:\r\nThe story itself doesn't go any further than other \"dark\" mahou shoujos such as madoka magica: magic girls finding out that being a magic girlis not really that nice and sweet. It's not really something inovating by this point so the story is nothing new for the ones- like me, who have certain interest in this kind of animes. Being this said, what I consider that stands out the most is the humanity of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAya Asagiri seems like an abused, moe girl with depression who doesn't seem to have any reason to live yet she doesn't commit suicide for some reason or another. Some people critized this saying it seems \"fake\" or \"unlikely\" since our main character looks like it's made to suffer. As a person who suffers depression myself, I consider that this is actually really relatable; I haven't been abused nor got through the horrible things that Asagiri has been through, but I know her suffering and how depression can consume your life yet you're not able to kill yourself. Why? You can not even explain why, I guess we just try to go along and get used to or hang on to any little hope there is left. You think about suicide but you just CAN'T commit it. Been there, so I find this feelings or behaviour actually really realistic to what some of us may have experienced.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that caught my attention was the reaction Asagiri had when she realized she killed 2 of her abusers. Eventhough they were going to rape her, just the thought of having killed somebody and the guilt that might come to her if somebody finds out drives her crazy.\\n\r\nIf there is something that I have always found weird, is the way that magic girls tend to react to death in this kind of animes. When they kill the villain or the villains, although they may have some moment of hesitation, they seem to randomly accept it and take it as natural, as if killing was something that can have an excuse. I can't pretend reality on a very fantasy kind of anime, but those reactions seemed very odd to me.\\n\r\nIn Mahou Shoujo Site I have found that the reaction to death seems very rational and human-like. Let's be real, if you killed somebody, eventhough that person did something really wrong, wouldn't you feel guilty af? Would you even consider that what you did has an excuse and that nobody is going to judge you not even yourself? I don't think so. The reaction Aya has is the same that any of us would have if this happens in real life, we would feel guilty because we killed somebody and more if we didn't mean it. This behaviour around Aya's powers goes along the anime, with Asagiri finding it difficult to assume that it wasn't her fault and that she's not a killer until she evolves into a more deep and fierceful person. I consider this attitude more reasonable than just taking death as it was nothing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, Mahou Shoujo Site might not be the most inovating and original anime of the season and has a lot of triggers in it that seem to have no reason at all, but I think they did a pretty good job with the character development. They humanized the characters, making them seem more human and relatable. I don't see edgyness at all.",

It must contain awful and terrible events happening to our characters, a dark and troubled past, causing anguish, a bleak setting, and very obvious good and bad characters.\r\nThis show has it all, and more.\r\nThe show aims for shock value with no clear narrative to justify its inclusion.  It also deliberately has exaggerated facial expressions with \u201cdark\u201d dialogue to reinforce the dark and edginess. After a certain point, I stopped caring about the setting and characters, I didn\u2019t care whether they lived or died, orwhether they will get their \u201chappy ending\u201d or not. In fact, the show doesn\u2019t have a happy ending, it\u2019s a bleak and inconclusive ending with many questions let unresolved.  In short, Mahou Shoujo Site is an awful, aimless, and agonizing show to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nStory Summary: a bunch of poor, unfortunate girls are recruited by a creepy figure, running a sketchy website, to become magical girls, only for them to discover that the website holds a more sinister message + cue lots of anguish, misery, and anger + lots of distorted facial expressions and over-the-top violence = this fucking show\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Site is a dark and edgy show from beginning to end. As soon as you finish Episode 1 and move on to the remaining episodes, you\u2019ll realize the darkness and edginess never fades. As the series progress, does it get more dark and edgy?  That\u2019s debatable.  However, for me, in terms of dark and edgy, I\u2019m finding it really difficult to top anything beyond Episode 1.  In fact, let me breakdown what occurs in Episode 1, so you\u2019ll understand why I believe it\u2019s more dark and edgy than any episode beyond it.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1: Aya Asagiri, our main character, is constantly bullied at school at the hands of Sarina Shizukume and her friends. They write verbally abuse language on her desk, they destroy her books, they beat her in the bathroom, et cetera. What does Aya do, she does nothing, but soak up all the abuse. At home, Aya experiences domestic violence at the hands of Kaname Asagiri, her older brother, whereby he continuously ties her up and beats her.  What does Aya do, she does nothing, but soak up all the abuse. Then, one day Aya\u2019s pet cat is brutally murdered by who else, her school bullies. And, on that same day, the bullies decide to get one of their guy friends and ask him to rape her. Luckily for Aya, she doesn\u2019t get raped. And, again, luckily for her, she had received a magical weapon from the sketchy website, and used it on the random dude and one of Sarina\u2019s friends. In the next scene, they are shown completely decapitated by an oncoming train. Later, Aya becomes friends with Yatsumura, a violent sociopath, who casually slits the throat of Sarina. End of Episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nYep, that all happens in Episode 1, and the remaining episodes will continue to have dark and edgy content, such as the kidnapping and torture of a burglar, the cruel and horrible character backgrounds, every action Kaname Asagiri does, the gory deaths of many characters, and the depressing undertones.  A show that is dark and edgy is fine if there is a meaning and purpose.  However, for Mahou Shoujo Site, there is no real meaning or purpose. In fact, the show seems to bask in all the violence, cruelty, gore, and \u201cmature\u201d themes without restraint, and shoves it in the our faces and expects us to enjoy the content. More importantly, many of the \u201cmature\u201d themes are never addressed in a serious manner and are used as a tool to artificially create sympathetic characters, which to mean is a sign of bad writing.\\n\\n\r\nBesides its awful setting, unnecessary \u201cmature\u201d themes, and bad writing, the show is missing tons of content. For example, the early battles with the administrators and the later battle with Nana, the introduction of important characters like Alice Misumi or Hinomoto Makoto, Sarina Shizukume\u2019s realization of the truth, her supposed \u201cdeath\u201d was suppose to happen soon, and her reasons for revenge, additional background details of many characters, the kiss with Yatsumura, etc. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, there are numerous unanswered questions, such as who is that girl that the administrators are talking too, why was Aya\u2019s brother kidnapped and locked away when he could have killed all the magical girls in the resort and finished it, why is the detective working for the administrators and what does he gain from all this, and why is the King the most unfortunate girl in the world?\\n\\n\r\nSome additional problems include: the death of Nijimi Anazawa lacked impact even with her backstory told within the episode, the detective appearing out of nowhere to stop Kaname Asagiri was a huge deus ex machina, also Aya having a new power to save Tsuyuno was a really ass-pull, the reshuffling of the fight scenes, and finally the Anime\u2019s ending deviating from the manga.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATIONS:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is adequate and, sometimes, downright hideous, especially the background art and character designs. The character designs are simple and not very detailed. The characters sometimes look janky and off-model, but it usually occurs to background characters. The background art features many dark colors, such as shades of gray, brown, black, and red, and it maintains these colors throughout the series, constantly reminding the viewers that Aya\u2019s world is filled with terrible people who do terrible things, and that anything she does will only hurt her and her friends. The background objects, such as buildings, furniture, trees, and other landscapes, are plain-looking and unremarkable. There are occasionally some bright screen tones like \u2018love bubbies\u2019, \u2018love flowers\u2019, or \u2018speed stripes\u2019 to emphasize certain emotions and actions that are being performed, but they are short and often fleeting.\\n\\n\r\nThe animations are decent, especially the excellent live-action ending credits, and, at time, outright hilarious. For example, in episode 2 and 9, Kaname Asagiri displays some of the most distorted and exaggerated facial expressions I\u2019ve ever seen. It was created to be serious, but it was too funny to not laugh. Other characters will also have distorted and exaggerated facial expressions, such as Nijimi Anazawa when she wants to kill someone really badly, or Rina Shioi with her crazy eyes and loud laughing, or everyone else with their heart or blood shot eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very good with noticeable performances from Nobuhiko Okamoto, who voices Kaname Asagiri, Yuuko Oono, who voices Aya Asagiri, and Himika Akaneya, who voices Tsuyuno Yatsumura. The background music is very hit-or-miss, it sometimes creates the mood and atmosphere of a typical horror show, other times it fails and turns it into a comedy. This mainly happens when the girl beginning to chant \u201cfa la la\u201d attempts to create horror vibes, but turns it into a trivial and ludicrous scene. Basically, that particular background music is cheesy and occasionally distracting.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song, \u201cChanging point\u201d,  is sung by Japanese band i\u2606Ris, and its intro displays many magical girls, including our two main protagonist, set in a gray and dreary world with most of them bleeding from various areas on the body. The ending song, \u201cZenzen Tomodachi\u201d, is sung by Haruka Yamazaki, and its outro displays live action clips of idols running and dancing, various scenes of our two main protagonist, and hundreds of CG sperm flying through the sky. The opening song is your standard J-Pop, which to me is uninteresting and dull; the intro is also typical for many anime shows, thus making it uninteresting and dull. The ending song is also your standard J-Pop, however its outro was so bizarre and strange that I couldn\u2019t help but be enthralled by it. I mean, watching live action clips of dancing idols with CG sperm flying through the sky? Interesting. Very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be honest, I hated almost every single character in this show from their pathetic excuses/reasons to perform stupid or inhumane actions to their shallow and tragic backstories and finally to their almost nonexistent character developments. Everything about these characters just screams unrealistic, superficial, mentally unstable, and soulless. Still, I want to talk about four characters, specifically our two main characters and the two antagonist characters. Every other character was either lacking depth, irrelevant to the story, or not interesting.\\n\\n\r\nMain Characters in this Show:\\n\\n\r\nAya Asagiri is a middle-school student with fair skin, long straight black hair with bangs, and pink eyes. Her stick is a gun that allows the teleportation of people to her last visited location. Upon using her stick's ability, many physical changes begin to occur: blood streams from her eyes, her inner eyes become heart-shaped, and her hair turns red. She is very timid, frail, easily frightened, and isolated from her peers; she suffers from depression and has suicidal ideations. She has a warmhearted personality and doesn\u2019t hesitate to protect people even at the risk of her own life, as seen in Episode 5 where she protects Yatsumura and Shizukume from the collapsing building.\\n\\n\r\nNow, here\u2019s the problem, the anime was throwing everything it could to turn Aya into the most sympathetic character possible. Shown in Episode 1, Aya was viciously bullied at school, suffered from domestic violence, had her pet cat killed, and almost became a rape victim. The viewers are forced from the very beginning to feel sorry for her and to be angry at the bullies and the older brother for the horrible things they were doing. This is such a cheap tactic to gain sympathy for a character that I can\u2019t believe the creators would put something like this in Episode 1. In fact, I\u2019m sure most people weren\u2019t feeling sympathy for Aya, but rather disturbed and disgusted by the \u201ctorture porn\u201d filled first episode that they didn\u2019t even make past the half-way mark. And I don\u2019t blame them. And if you do decide to continue watching, you can expect Aya to cry, whine, and bitch all the way until the final two episodes, where she suddenly grows a backbone. But, for me, it was way too late, and I had already grown tired of her.\\n\\n\r\nTsuyuno Yatsumura is a middle-school student with fair skin and short blonde hair. Her stick is a smartphone that has the power to stop time for herself and for anybody else written on the smartphone. Upon using her stick\u2019s ability, many physical changes begin to occur: blood drips from her mouth, her inner eyes becomes a crescent moon, and her hair turns orange. Before meeting Aya, she had a stoic personality and a tendency to be sadistic, but now with Aya being her friend she was slowly changing and opening up to people. \\n\\n\r\nTsuyuno has a typical tragic backstory, where she lived an ordinary and fortunate lifestyle, until a burglar murdered her family. She was spared, however the burglar vowed to return and find her when she grew up. And since then, she spend several years living in fear that he'll return. That is, until she discovered the magical site, received her powers, and exacted revenge.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I would like to say that Tsuyuno is a fairly interesting and dynamic character with a justified backstory. However, her earlier actions, slitting the throat of Sarina Shizukume, portrays her as a violent sociopath. And her kidnapping and torture of the burglar, only reinforces this notion. Still, her repeated interactions with Aya made her charming, sweet, and caring, and thus one of the better characters in this show. \\n\\n\r\nMain Antagonist in this Show:\\n\\n\r\nThe real antagonists are, of course, the administrators, however the lack of appearances and the numerous questions concerning their existences makes it difficult for me to either like or hate them. Some questions include: who was the first administrator, what are their \u2018true\u2019 intentions, what is their method and purpose to using magical girls as administrators, do the administrator remember their former lives, etc. Because of these unanswered questions, I\u2019ve decided to focus on Sarina Shizukume and Kaname Asagiri as I despise both these characters.\\n\\n\r\nSarina Shizukume is a middle-school student with fair skin, red hair with pigtails, visible neck stitches, and red eyes. Her stick is a yo-yo that can cut anything. Upon using her stick\u2019s ability, many physical changes begin to occur: blood leaks out of her ears, her inner eyes becomes the Greek letter phi, and her hair turns yellow. She has a fierce and violent personality, who exhibits traits like resentfulness, envy, and insincerity.\\n\\n\r\nSarina\u2019s path to becoming a magical girl is marked by deep vengeance and personal hatred against Aya and Tsuyuno. Originally, one of Aya\u2019s bullies, she replaced Shioi Rina as the new Magical Girl Hunter, shortly after getting sliced by Tsuyuno. However, in Episode 10, she suddenly has a change of heart and assists Aya and her friends in defeating the administrators.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I\u2019ll state that I dislike Sarina and her bullshit reason to commit vicious bullying, as shown and explained in Episode 4. Her reasons for this bullying are extremely petty and beyond stupid; she bullies Aya because she seen as timid, weak, frail, \u201cunthankful\u201d, and a hinder to the class. I guess she must have thought, \u201cHmm. If Aya is making class hard for everyone, I\u2019m just going to make her life even harder by bullying the shit out of her. Yeah! And hopefully, she will stop being a hinder to everyone in class.\u201d Wow, solid reasoning! And the strange part is that after becoming a Magical Girl Hunter, she decides to join Aya\u2019s side because she was \u201cpissed\u201d and the administrators were treating humans like animals. (Which is ironic because she treated Aya almost like an animal as well.) Anyway, in the anime, her reasons to join Aya\u2019s side are weak and extremely sudden, unlike in the manga where she had a more justified reason to join Aya\u2019s side.\\n\\n\r\nKaname Asagiri is a tall and handsome high-school student with blue-black hair and glasses. He has used two sticks: Nijimi Anazawa\u2019s panties to mind control people and Sayuki Ringa\u2019s katana to cut and kill Nijimi. Upon using her stick\u2019s ability, many physical changes begin to occur: his inner eyes becomes spades and his hair turns white. He is manipulative, abusive, egocentric, and has \u2018god complex\u2019, i.e., feeling a being superior to everyone. He is extremely abusive and violent towards his sister to the extent of physical and psychological torture. He performs these cruel actions in order to expel his hatred of his father, i.e., the father abuses him and has high expectations of him getting into Tokyo University. It\u2019s because of this stress and pressure that he regularly ties up Aya and punches her, and even stating that her only role in life is to be his stress relief.\\n\\n\r\nKaname is one of the worst characters in anime I\u2019ve ever seen. He\u2019s an inhuman bastard that doesn\u2019t care about anybody, but himself. He has killed two people, Keisuke Naoto, Nijimi Anazawa, without remorse and believes they are human scum. He likes being in control, as shown in Episode 8 and 9, and enjoys the suffering of other people. In short, he\u2019s a terrible character with no redeemable qualities what so ever.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Site is one of the worse shows I\u2019ve ever watched. We have \u201cdark and edgy\u201d villains who get high off of bullying, torturing, and killing people, and we have a weak and pathetic main character who cries and talks rather than fight. We have an incomplete story with many lingering questions and numerous omitted details and content, revealed only in the manga. It also has many pointless mature themes, such as domestic violence, torture, suicidal ideation, and sexual assault, just for the sake of making it \u201cdark and edgy\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nWe have cheap and bland background and character designs with decent animations, especially the distorted and exaggerated facial expressions. And finally, we have hilarious background music of a girl chanting \u201cfa la la\u201d trying to create horror vibes, and an interesting live action ending song complete with dancing idols and sperm flying through the sky. There are many additional problems with this show, however the ones that I mentioned are what\u2019s making this show absolutely goddamn awful. My recommendation: avoid this show like the plague and watch something else. Something with more substance and entertainment than this piece of shit.",

            "content": "(This review contains minor spoilers about the characters.)\r\nTerrible Magical Girl anime is a guilty pleasure of mine. Ever since Mahoiku aired in late 2016, I've been wanting more bad Magical Girl anime, and this anime definitely delivered.\r\nStory - 1\r\nThe story revolves around Aya Asagiri, Despite the fact that she has done nothing wrong, everyone she meets absolutely despises her. She's relentlessly bullied by her peers at school, and physically assaulted by her older brother every night. Then out of nowhere, a creepy website grants her a magic stick. Except, like all pseudo-horror magical girl anime, there's a catch. A being called the Tempest is preparingto end the world, and only one magical girl can survive.\\n\\n\r\nIt's extremely cliche, definitely been done better before. There isn't much to be said other than it's an absolute train-wreck of a plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing wrong with the art. Character designs are okay at best, nothing appalling but nothing breathtaking. The only nitpick I have is with the idol group, Dog Play. All of the members except Nijimi look like boring background characters. They all have brown hair, no effort at all was put into their designs. It'd be passable if they all just had colourful hair like Nijimi does, but it seems they didn't care enough about them to do that.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5\\n\\n\r\nNone of the music is memorable at all. I come back every week having forgotten what the background music even sounded like. The sound effects are adequate.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 1\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are terrible. Seriously, I could rant about them for hours. I'll provide a brief summary of my feelings for each major character that has been introduced so far.\\n\\n\r\nAya Asagiri - Boring damsel in distress type character who everyone treats like trash for no reason other than to give her a sad backstory.\\n\r\nTsuyuno Yatsumura - The stereotypical \"mentor\" character. Most magical girl anime has one of these characters. Her backstory is just about some guy who murdered her family for no reason at all.\\n\r\nKaname Asagiri - That one guy every female character is falling over for. His parents have unrealistic expectations of him, so he beats up his sister to let off his stress. Disproportionate? You bet. He seems to only exist to create conflict.\\n\r\nRina Shioi - Also probably only exists to create conflict. She goes around murdering other magical girls to steal their sticks, just to almost get herself killed because of it.\\n\r\nSarina Shizukume - One of the most unlikable characters in the series, and that says a lot seeing as they're all unlikable as hell. She doesn't have an ounce of empathy within her, and the majority of her dialogue is just her not listening to the other person and forcing the blame of all her problems over to Aya. I mean, yeah, her friend was killed. Absolutely tragic. This must justify how unlikable she is, am I right?!\\n\r\nNijimi Anazawa - Actually off the rails at this point. She will stop at nothing to kill the person who killed her friend, she'll even go after her own friends without a second thought. Her complete 180 would have been surprising if it weren't for the fact that literally every character does it too.\\n\r\nKosame Amagai - An emo girl with the edgiest power ever. She's the reason why I lost all faith I previously had in this show's ability to tell a compelling story. She's literally just a plot device created to make things convenient, she's also an annoying edgelord.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason why I'm enjoying this show is because I love laughing at terrible magical girl anime. If I didn't, I'd have dropped this show after the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 2\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to spend your night laughing at a terrible show with terrible characters, then this is for you. However, if you're going in looking for a compelling story, you've got another thing coming. This anime should only be watched when there's absolutely nothing else you can watch.",

            "content": "An honest review.\r\nThis anime talks about the misfortunes of Aya Asagiri, a 14 year old girl who was bullied for most of her life. She attempts to commit suicide multiple times, but fails to succeed. One day she is called upon to earn a magical weapon that would help end her bully. She hesitate to use the magical weapon, but when used it she accidentally kills two students; her bully and the bully's friend that was going to rape her. And the story goes from there, this is just the surface.\r\nStory: There is a lot of violence and a lot of blood, but that isnot we are here for. The story is complex and confusing. Every character introduced in the anime gets a brief background, even the antagonist (well, not all of them). It all revolves around the \"Tempest\" but it never talks anything past that, maybe there will be more information later. Every magical girl wants to survive the Tempest, but no one ever try. They just want information, information, and capture the site admin. IDK, seems confusing that if someone was going to die, they might as well kill as much they can.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Like said before, character are developed in a brief manner. You feel numb for the Aya Asagiri trying to commit suicide because the character is only briefly explained and makes it hard to be conveyed by her feeling. There are twisted girl, but along with Aya, everyone feels numb also. Everyone is in the shadow.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoy the sperms flying everywhere in ED as there is idol dancing XD, it always makes me laugh. Anyway, this show is exceptional for enjoyment if you don't mind the blood and violence along with twisted characters. The plot is \"ight,\" not too shabby or too great.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Compared to some other season anime *cough *cough \"Ousama Game,\" it phase the story in a good and exceptional way. Not too many dumb characters, but not too many too smart characters. Those who know more information at least tries to help those who don't. Characters has their own knowledge, personalities, and god forbid, a background at least. It's like angel and devil put together here. Light and dark.",

            "content": "Mahou Shojo Site is not a good magical girl show under any serious context. For any of those going into this show expecting to see Madoka Magica, take this review as your warning. Mahou Shojo Site not only fails as a dark magical girl show, but as a magical girl show in general. Whereas magical girl shows typically try to establish the main character and basic magical systems in the first episode, this show prefers to make up the magical nonsense as it goes along and only establishes that the main character has an overly tragic backstory that gives her no personality to get attachedto. She just seems like this object getting constantly abused by the plot. Her best friend isn't that much better. She indeed has a personality, but that personality only consists of dumping exposition at convenient times and being overall reserved and depressed constantly with no motivation to better herself. Anyone else who's seen generally making the main character's life miserable are psychopaths with seemingly no motivation at all other than causing this girl in particular as much pain as humanly possible. I don't even care enough about Rina to talk about her. Nijimin is this shows one saving grace in terms of characters. She has an adorable idol that completely offsets all of the melancholy teenagers around her. She's upbeat and a nice breath of fresh air in a series that tries to beat moral dilemmas into you every five seconds, despite these dilemmas not being engaging in the slightest. How can they be if the characters experiencing them are thin as paper?  Art is overall very good in this series. I enjoy the different character designs and the show's over all atheistic. I question the directoral choice to have flying CG sperm in the end credits, but I at least have something to laugh at after 24 minutes of suffering. I recruited my boyfriend to sit through episode two with me post ranting to him about episode one, and he suffered just as much as I did whilst yelling at the television, so I think it's safe to say that this is a show you should skip unless you enjoy making fun of bad shows, which luckily, I do.",

            "content": "Associating the \u201cMagical Girl\u201d concept with brutality, torture and killing can be contradictory at first. You\u2019re basically taking the innocence of that magical girl trying to save the world and reducing it into \u201cGirls with supernatural abilities trying to kill each other\u201d, regardless of their intentions. Torturing someone to death, even though he deserves it, doesn\u2019t really fall into the heroic nature of the \u201cMagical Girls\u201d concept. Because it is still a wrong thing to do. You\u2019re no better than the person you\u2019re actually harming. Because you\u2019ve become him. Point is, you can forget about the whole \u201cmagical\u201d genre here. You can replace the titleof the show with anything you\u2019d like, say \u201cDevilish Girls Site\u201d or \u201cMentally Unstable Girls with Powers Site\u201d and it\u2019s not going to change a thing. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is not about everlasting conflict and dilemma between good and evil. Because let\u2019s face it, almost all of them are evil, and they try to wash away their sins by pretending nothing happened in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is about retarded girls who get rewritten every time the writer demands it so they can supposedly fight each other without any sense of logic and motive.\\n\\n\r\nMagical Girls Site is a bad, bad show. And it doesn\u2019t even try to hide it.\\n\\n\r\nThis review will contain minor spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around Aya, a social awkward student who just transferred to a new school. Little did she know that some of her classmates are the reincarnation of the Devil himself. From the very first episode, we witness endless bullying, extreme and exaggerated physical torture such as drowning Aya\u2019s head straight into a toilet and hiring a rapist to have his way with her. Man, school sure sucks. Can\u2019t wait for her to go back home so she can take a nap from all this nightmare. But it doesn\u2019t stop there! At home, her brother tortures her by treating her as his \u201cpersonal punching bag\u201d just because he wants to release his stress. Because what better way to let it all out? Gym, boxing, music, gaming? Forget it. Punching his very own sister is much more enjoyable because he blames her for enjoying a carefree life. What an ignorant. Enough of that, let\u2019s give Aya a cat, the only companion who truly understands her suffering and acknowledges her existence as a human being. Let\u2019s also kill this pet by the very same bullies at school. What a day! Aya has had enough. In fact, we had enough. What\u2019s with the exaggerated bullying and torturing of this poor and innocent girl? We get that the brilliant writer wants to victimize the protagonist, but why go so far? So far for a girl who apparently suffers from social anxiety and struggles to fit in her school. But that\u2019s not the main reason for the bullying. Aya was bullied because she didn\u2019t thank her classmate. I wish I was joking!\\n\\n\r\nSo all this brutal torturing and harassment must be for a reason: becoming a Magical Girl. Oh boy! Can\u2019t wait for Aya to teach the bullies a lesson! And she does, well, accidentally and feels sorry for them. Yes, she feels sorry for the man who tried to rape her, and the girl who brought him here. Basically, she feels sorry for defending herself. \\n\\n\r\nI get it. The writer wants to portray Aya as an innocent and caring little girl who doesn\u2019t harm a soul. But how can she stay the same after all this physical and mental torture? This is where the psychological aspect of the show fails miserably. And it doesn\u2019t begin with Aya. You\u2019ve got Rina, a serial killer on the loose known as the \u201cMagical Hunter\u201d who murdered hundreds of magical girls but later on befriends Aya and her friend Tsuyuno like nothing ever happened. One would think that Rina is heartless and cold-blooded killer, because that what she was at the beginning, but then she starts crying at Nijimi\u2019s funeral, a girl she barely interacted with, a girl whose friend was brutally murdered by no other than Rina herself. \\n\\n\r\nAfter Rina \u201cmagically\u201d becomes one the good guys, she transfers to school, having NO MONEY and PARENTS to rely on because she took the identity of another Magical Girl. And she admits it when she decides to spend the night at Aya\u2019s house, a girl she tried to kill a few episodes ago. At this point, the story doesn\u2019t present any sense of logic. Characters do whatever they want to, change their personalities however they like, and get rewritten from scratch just so that they can fit the plot and its context. \\n\\n\r\nI wish it gets better. Tsuyuno, Aya\u2019s BFF, keeps the guy who killed her parents locked in her house in a BDSM fashion. Did I mention that the girls we\u2019re talking about are only 14? Yet Tsuyuno sadistically tortures the killer day after day. Let\u2019s not forget about Nijimi, a friend of Aya and Tsyunuyo and enemy of Rina. We have a whole episode where all the characters cry at her funeral when in reality they barely even knew her. It was unsympathetic and irrelevant because nothing was really giving to the viewer so he can CARE for her character, just like nothing was giving to the characters themselves so they can care for her. They just HAVE to pretend they do, and we just have to blindly imitate their emotions. This is why Magical Girls Site can never be considered a drama, simply because it fails portraying its characters and doesn\u2019t develop their relationships and interactions between each other. It just paints them as if they exist already, and we just have to accept that. Just like we have to accept that 14-year-old girls can be worse than real life criminals.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Aya\u2019s brother becomes a forced antagonist who wants to kill his own sister along with her friends. Wait, wasn\u2019t he supposed to be focusing on his studies all day? Because that\u2019s how he was presented in the beginning: an angel who studies in the day and a devil who tortures his sister at night. Again, he gets rewritten, just like everybody else. \\n\\n\r\nRemember the leader of the bullies, Sarina? She wants to get back at Aya for killing her \u201cfriends\u201d but suddenly becomes friends with her after she gets saved for no apparent reason. Let me get this straight: Aya saved a girl who mentally broke her, physically tortured her, and attempted raping her with her bigger \u201cfriend\u201d. Sounds about right.\\n\\n\r\nEven the voice acting was not well-handled. They hired a fairly new voice actress for Aya. When voicing, Yuku Ono was not acting. She really had trouble reading her lines. The other voice actors/actresses were acceptable. We have an ED that blatantly shows sperms flying around and girls dancing on the roof. Huh. In episode 4, there\u2019s a live action ED based on Nijimi\u2019s character. This was far better than the previous nonsense. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was also mediocre. Besides the rather funny faces such as Njimi\u2019s killer face or the brother\u2019s rape-y face, nothing was really memorable. In fact, they tried their best to hide the facial traits of the characters especially during the more serious scenes for several minutes at a time. It didn\u2019t help settle the mood, it just made it worse. \\n\\n\r\nI wanted to like Magical Girls Site. I really did. But it turns out to be a show that ironically goes too far with its \u201cedgy-ness\u201d without actually going anywhere. It\u2019s not a disappointing show that gradually becomes worse in time. It\u2019s a show that starts bad and ends bad, and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone unless he\u2019s as mentally insane as the writer. \\n",

            "content": "I have seen a good amount of anime. A lot of people judge things on the merits of another anime or anime they have seen. Rarely do you find someone who deconstructs an anime and judge's it bases on the anime as a whole.  Without bias and without letting their taste get in the way\r\n So that is what I am going to attempt to do with this short and sweet review.\r\nLet's talk story first. The story was interesting to say the least. While at times I felt uncomfortable or anger at the things I was viewing, the story kept me interested. Kept mefocus. Wanting to know how things would unfold. It kept me on edge. Here and there, there are dark bits of humor but the overall story is balances. We see the life of our main character unfold and we watch her day to day interactions and we see how she deals. This gives us a glimpse into who this person is. And for that reason we are drawn to her. Because we feel for her. Many who watch anime have been victim of bullying themselves and can relate to the feeling of being bullied. So there's always that to connect with. I personally was bullied at a younger age so I can relate. \\n\\n\r\nWatching these girls lives and learning how they got there kept me interested in this story. I wanted to see if they could pull it off. I suggest if you watch this anime to focus on the interactions that happen between characters and look beyond what is shown at face value\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was wonderful and pleasing to the eye. Simplistic emotions and even complex ones were portrayed very well. The puffiness on a characters eyes who had been crying and the detail to show anguish and suffering or happiness and laughter were stylized well. It was pleasing to watch over all. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was not something I focused on a lot. I'm one of those guys who skips intros and outros once in a while,  but I caught myself watching them here. Plus there is a good score within the anime during scenes as well. I'm trying in the voice acting here as well. I watched subbed anime and the range of emotion delivered did not disappoint. I give high praise to the staff that worked on this anime with their voice acting. I'm sure they worked very hard to produce the results they did. Overall sound was of a very good standard. It's not the best but it's not the worst either.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters. Now we get to a crucial point. Story is one thing but it's another if you fail to have characters that cannot bring your story to life. And this one did. I pray that the things that happen here in this anime aren't too common because there were a good list of characters who, in more than one instance, I rooted for their death and suffering. There were characters I felt for that when they died their disappearance was felt. Characters who matured in ways I didn't see coming. I will say one thing though. Each and every teacher in this anime should be fired.\\n\\n\r\nI highly enjoyed this anime. I recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a dark yet enjoyable anime. It has dark times and light times. It isn't a total gore feast. It's psychological at best,  I wouldn't even call it horror. Not one time was i scared or completely unsettled to the point of tears or rage. It was an anime with a story I wished to see progress. And in all honesty I wouldn't mind a season 2. Or picking up the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime an 8. It's a very good anime. Worth watching and enjoying. Pace yourself while you watch it, take time to understand characters and try to look at the anime with an open mind and I'm sure you can enjoy it as well.\\n",

The ending was actually really good and the fight scenes were good but not \"wow\" like C3's or Fate/Zero.\r\n8/9/10/9/5/9\r\nNow that I've watched the whole thing, I feel like a through review is in motion.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is unique; I haven't seen this before, and it doesn't feel like a blatant copy of some other anime, or just another anime in a generic genre.  Most episodes made me feel uneasy, because the amount of edge and disgustingstuff is over the line, but there were some moments.  The ending was the de-facto best part of the anime, mainly because *cough* it involved yuri *cough* and it closed the series nicely.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI haven't seen a more diverse cast in such a long time.  Each girl actually has something that differentiates them, unlike SAO where every girl is just the same with different looks.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty good.  Sounded too real, and added to the said unease.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe girls' personalities are also very different from one another, and I can tell the niche that each fills pretty clearly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI can't say that I didn't enjoy this, but there were many parts that I wish I could unsee.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWatch for the ending, and ONLY the ending.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPrevious Ratings: 6/9/4/8/3/3\\n\r\nVery rarely do I not like anime; in fact, it's very common for me to like whatever anime I find.  At first glance, I read the title, and decided to watch it because, come on, it's a magic girl anime, who doesn't like those?  \\n\\n\r\nMy reaction to the first scene: \"what the f*ck\"\\n\\n\r\nI dropped the series after 7 episodes because it was purely disgusting.  I'm very serious when I call it that, because if you thought School Days was bad, this is over ten times worse.  I'm warning EVERYONE not to watch it, because I have seen many, many things, and even I threw up after watching a specific episode (forgot which one).  DO NOT watch this anime.  YOU WILL NOT HAVE A GOOD TIME.",

            "content": "\"DID HE SERIOUSLY GIVE MAHOU SHOUJO SITE A 9\" YEAH I DID BUCKLE UP AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT SOMETHING YOU PROBABLY NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED WHILE YOU WERE WATCHING THIS INCREDIBLE DUMPSTER FIRE\r\nLet me get something out of the way really quick: the beginning of this show is awful! it's incredible. The art is stiff, the music is generic, the character interactions suck, and overall the whole thing is written like a hamfisted attempt to set the stage for a story the author started writing from the middle. Weirdly enough it smooths out by episode five and by episode six you'll find yourself suddenlyaboard the hype train with an EXPRESS TICKET TO HYPEVILLE.\\n\\n\r\nBut to get to this point you have to take a step back and really try to understand the thing you're looking at. If you try to absorb this as-is, take the characters and their interactions at face value and expecting the show to create value to you by itself you're going to be disappointed. This isn't Gurren Lagann or BNH. The characters and the circumstances and the special powers and stuff are all metaphors.\\n\\n\r\nYou can laugh at me for digging meaning out of somewhere there is none but I'd like you to consider this: I'm still fully acknowledging that this show is bad. The way I went in to this experience started shaping the way I contextualized everything and ultimately how much I enjoyed the experience. One of the biggest criticisms I notice about this show have to do with unrealistic character interactions, particularly with the brother, and the bullying in the beginning. I was skeptic (and even angry) while I was watching it. This isn't how abuse works! Bullying doesn't happen like this! on and on. But you can look at it from another direction too: the hyper-absurdist depictions of these kinds of things ends up lending itself to how the story is told. Building the interactions and fleshing out the characters is great and all, but it would have ended up confusing the whole situation. PLUS! The series isn't about them! They're used as plot devices. They're not built up as characters because in the context of the story they aren't characters, they're monsters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to do a breakdown because those are dumb. Here's what I'll leave you with, though:\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Site, on the surface, is a mind-numbing, torturously generic \"muh suffering\" madoka magica wannabe that isn't worth watching. Peel it back though, and watch it in the context of the message it's trying to send instead of just staring slack-jawed, drooling with your left hand in your pants at the pixels dancing around on your screen, and you find something that's really weird but suddenly really exciting. If you put Madoka Magicka, Higurashi no naku koro ni, and (bear with me here) Hataraku Saibou in a blender, something pretty close to Mahou Shoujo Site would come out.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't see where I'm coming from when I say that, you missed the point I'm trying to make entirely and should probably reread my entire review from start to finish.",

I started to see him totally at random and I only knew that the protagonist was a bullshit girl, when I saw the name of the anime with \"shoujo\" I really demoralized because I do not like the genre at all and I saw the first random episode. I realized that this is not the usual story of maghettes doing nice things and fighting bad guys with the power of love. No. This anime is beautiful, of course it has its flaws, but I think I was never bored to see it and I was very taken. I didnot find it boring or stupid at all. The only flaw I think it is for the final that I think they left a little random .. maybe for a second season?\\n\r\nIn my opinion this soul must be given at least one chance.\\n\\n\r\nPS: Excuse me if I made mistakes, I used the translator because I'm not English.

            "content": "(This is my first review, so bear with me, and I\u2019m sorry this does contain spoilers)\r\n   Did you really like Madoka Magica? Do you like edgy things?\r\nIf you answered yes to the first one, too bad because Magical Girl Site is no where near as good. If you answered yes to the second question, good luck because I\u2019m pretty sure you found the edgiest anime that has ever existed in Magical Girl anime history.\r\n   Mahou Shoujo Site is the perfect example of how NOT to do a good first episode. In the opening, the main character Aya Asagiri, some shy damselin distress with an adorable voice, is falling into train tracks with a train about to hit her. Not only that, the first episode consists of Aya is constantly getting bullied at school, tortured and beaten by her unintentionally hilarious brother, almost raped, and more. Sadly, it handled those darker themes altogether darn poorly. All of these different things are all slapped onto you in the first episode to make you feel bad. I love animes that handle dark/sensitive subjects. Yet, Mahou Shoujo Site was done so poorly, so deficient, that I was so disappointed that I almost dropped it.\\n\r\nBut, I didn\u2019t because I just like to get things over with, and of course I would want to see if it actually got better.\\n\r\nSpoiler alert, it doesn\u2019t!\\n\\n\r\n   After episodes of watching Aya getting tortured and almost driven to suicide, she is saved my some time stopping girl. They become good friends and figure out a bunch of crap with some new characters introduced. The bad part about after Yatsumura was introduced was the pacing of the story. No, the whole entire thing was paced awfully. In just one episode we\u2019re thrown into watching Aya get tortured and almost raped. Few episodes later we got Yatsumura and a few others. THEN a bunch of other characters are introduced AT ONCE which made it impossible for me to like. I would\u2019ve loved to get to know them more. But, if you introduced half of the characters halfway through the series, that\u2019s certainly not possible. And that stupid ending. How was Nana beaten so easily with a train while there are tons of other administrators left to take over the entire world? Why was Nijimi\u2019s death so stupid that it made it impossible for me to feel bad? They healed someone who had a hole through their stomach yet it was \u201ctoo late\u201d to save Nijimi. Literal bull. And.. let\u2019s not talk about that ending with the brother...\\n\\n\r\nNot only was the story paced terribly, it somehow had time for a BEACH EPISODE to \u201cenjoy the time they had left.\u201d I could be enjoying some Magical Girl action (oh wait, there wasn\u2019t any good magical girl action), but instead I had to go through a stupid beach episode with Aya\u2019s brother wearing loli panties to kill some dude in the ocean. Aya just watches it happen. Very smart, Aya, very smart.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story was badly paced and something that handled the dark subjects poorly that it was pretty funny. Terrible, but still something I could bare with. Some of the moments with Aya and Yatsumura were pretty cute, like their bath. Off topic from all the dangers in their world, but still a cute small thing, unlike a whole beach episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation wasn\u2019t special. Aya was cute, yeah, but sometimes the animation was quite bad it was hard to even look at. For example, Nijimi\u2019s eyes turning into an awkward shade of red. Or, (episode 11) that one brown haired girl who made a blog and everything that is true gets deleted. Her face made me cringe a little bit. \\n\\n\r\n The characters each have their own unique \u201cstick,\u201d from yoyo\u2019s to panties, which made it quite funny that it was hard to even take it seriously.\\n\r\nThe characters are boring and have almost no personality. Aya is just a damsel in distress with Yatsumura to save her. Nijimi is a loli with anger issues. The pink haired boobs girl is insane. All the other characters were introduced at once and I never got attached to them and was emotionless when there were any fight scenes with them.\\n\\n\r\n Almost nothing about the sound was worth mentioning. I did like the OP, it became quite catchy. Other than the OP, I found the sound quite bothersome or just quite plain. It was nothing special, just like the story and animation. \\n\\n\r\nEach of the episodes made me feel partially bad for Aya. She has to handle all sorts of problems. A lot of them made me laugh because of how the show handled it\u2019s \u201cedge.\u201d But in all it was something I partly enjoyed because of how it was okay in a pretty dumb way. Overall a 5 out of 10.",

            "content": "Will contain very minor spoilers. \r\nI started this show with high hopes and watched it every week although I rarely watch an airing show (hate cliffhangers) and was one of the guys that liked episode 1. Thought that it was necessary to move the show forward. \r\nOn all levels this has been a disappointment. \r\nCharacters act in ways that are not believable, they try to kill each other one moment, the next they're best friends because of plot, plot which get forgotten in the end. Not anything psychological here. \r\nThe art and hence the fights are boring. I have the feeling the art quality dropsfrom episode 6, in episode 8 or 9 the facial features are not there, the characters look like cardboard cutouts. The fights are boring and some not even animated or not there to be considered a fight. Apart from one in the early episodes (where the dialogue consists mainly of Japanese profanity courtesy of Haruka Yamazaki). The backgrounds are generic with no special art to them. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is confusing, they set a goal, the goal is never expanded upon nor does it have a conclusion. The apocalypse theme doesn't have either, seems to be forgotten by the end of the show. Characters behave erratically sometimes violent, sometimes non violent, mostly to shock the viewer rather than drive the plot forward.\\n\\n\r\nSound is boring, nothing special during the boring fights either. Voice actresses are mostly newbies, also a good indication of the low budget for this one. As a side note, one of the administrators in episode 10 I think is voiced by Aoi Yuuki, a great performance and an interesting voice change from her part - I guess it's a promotional role to showcase the voice. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if the show is disturbing for you, if the animal violence in episode one is disturbing for you then the implied male rape scene in the end credits is the cherry on the rotten cake MGS is. \\n\\n\r\nWas really disappointing, was not really expecting Madoka here, or Yuuki Yuna, but at least I was expecting this to be on par with Ikusei Keikaku. Not the case here unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nSymphogear S1 had bad art, bad plot, but characters were okish in their beliefs and the way they acted. MGS I think is overrated at 6.6 on Mal, 5 something would be fitting. I choose a 4, there was nothing memorable for me here but I will forever remember the sperm ending credits scene. Why? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Does taking an anime series less seriously make it better? Sometimes an anime series doesn't take itself seriously in order to be more enjoyable. By making itself self aware to be over the top and absurd can lead to some very enjoyable scenes and moments that keep you entertained. But what about those shows that unintentionally make you take it less seriously. Does it make it good or does it simply cover its flaws? This anime series optimises this idea by taking a dark spin on a genre that is generally light and fluffy but making itself enjoyable in the way it didn't want youto. \\n\\n\r\nSo Sit back, relax you poor, unfortunate souls as I present to the anime review for Mahou Shojou Site, or by its English translation, Magical Girl Site. lets begin. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 4.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Aya Asagiri. A girl who has pretty much had life kick the s**t out her. Constantly bullied at school and abused by her Brother at home, this poor girl is struggling to have the will to live and constantly thinks of suicide but lacks the courage to do so. After an abuse session by his Brother, a mysterious website appears in front of Aya called \"Magical Girl Site\" where the administrator, Nana, gives Aya a magical device called a \"stick\" to become a magical girl. She then meets another Magical girl by the name of Tsuyuno Yatsumura, who introduces her to the idea of being a magical girl and tells of her of a mysterious event that is going to take place known as \"Tempest.\" From there the two girls try to find out what is Tempest and the truth behind the Magical Girl Site. \\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, this show tackles some very heavy subject matter such as domestic abuse, bullying, suicidal thoughts and even rape (\"lovely\"). Subject matter that this show brings up and never is talked about again; which leaves the question. Why? Well to bring one obvious point that this show is trying to be \"dark\" and \"edgy,\" even with the razor blades and pins in the shoes. And you know what, that what makes this show enjoyable. You can just sit back and relax as you watch this anime be absurd and over the top to the point where you can just enjoy the whole absurdity of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nDoes this mean it can cover its flaws? Good god no. This show has plot holes and continuity errors that leave you scratching your head as to why this has happened. When you are progressing the plot, you can't just leave things unanswered and resolve things quickly. That's bad storytelling. A girl who is mentally unstable and wants to kill someone should not just play it down when you don't have the means to kill that person (even though you could improvise). This is just for the sake of reminding you that this is a dark show and not for kids even though you should still tell a good story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the thing, it struggles to differentiate itself from the obvious anime its taking influence from, Madoka Magika. In fact, I'm going to say that this show is Madoka Magika with a mixture of Higurashi in there and a lot more edge. It struggles to carve itself its own identity as it only thinks that making the show even darker would help make it unique even though it just makes itself more absurd. \\n\\n\r\nAnd don't get me started on the ending of this show. Heading into the last few episodes, I was wondering how this anime was going to end. Well guess what? It doesn't. Leaving us on a cliffhanger which I honestly don't think is going to get resolved, leaving me bitter in the mouth. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nAya is portrayed as being a sympathetic character so much that you just want to walk over and give her a hug. Bad things always happens to her which brings her down on her luck to the point of trying to commit suicide. She is presented as a character being incredibly weak and shy but over time, she gains more confidence in herself as she has someone to talk to in the form of Tsuyuno. Now I like Aya as a character since she is someone that we can care for because she has just been a very unfortunate girl. But she is merely a victim in the anime's attempt to be dark and edgy since most of its darker scenes include her. \\n\\n\r\nHer relationship with Tsuyuno is what I consider to be the highlight of the show as it is clear that these two girls need each other. This is because they are getting something that they have desperately needed, a friend. To have someone to talk to and share your problems. Aya gains confidence and is more sociable thanks to Tsuyuno. Tsuyuno is less cold and understands peoples' emotions better thanks to Aya. From the beginning, we are introduced to Tsuyuno as a cold and serious person who doesn't take nonsense for an answer. But by talking to Aya more, she is more understanding and feels less pressured to to everything by herself because she has someone by her side. It even has a tiny bit of Yuri in their relationship just to make it that much emotional. \\n\\n\r\nNow the rest of the cast is where the Higurashi element comes in as some of them struggle to keep their violent tendencies in check. Nijimi is the best example of this because she can flip between a cute pop idol to a revenge filled monster at the flip of a hat. Of course she isn't the only character that has personality changes but she is the best example. But in terms of depth, they are lacking. Even though you can't do everyone, some of the more important characters don't get any depth in their character. This is mainly due to poor storytelling that causes these characters to be more simplistic and have their actions to be explained with little reason. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Mahou Shojou site is fine. Not bad but certainly doesn't stand out. It definitely does its job and it doesn't put me off but again, it's just fine. However, I do like the exaggerated facial expressions (aka the \"Higurashi Face\") that are shown on these characters, even though some of them are over the top a bit. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character designs, they are all pretty standard affair with the exception of two characters, Aya and Nana. Aya really does look like a character who would be and has been abused. Small stature, looks weak like she doesn't eat and has baggage around her eyes, telling the viewer of her lack of sleep because she is never comfortable because of all the abuse she is getting. And then we have Nana with her old look from old black and white TVs and an unmoving expression that really does get creepy the longer you stare about it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 5.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also fine but it doesn't exactly stand out. It more or less to stays in the background and does its own thing which is kind of disappointing because for a horror series, the ambient soundtracks helps to add to the atmosphere of the show. Shows like Higurashi and Shiki do this well to add to the tension and atmosphere but unfortunately, this show's OST doesn't do that. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the show's opening I actually do like it even though there isn't a lot of stand out animation in the opening. It is more or less foreshadowing of things to come in the show. However, it does do things right. For one, I do like the cracks on the corners of the screen since many characters are mentally broken so it is good symbolism. Another thing that stands out is the scenes change in the opening depending on where we are in the story, making me wish more anime did this. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending for the show is..... weird. Like, really weird. Not only does it have a live action dance number, there was a heavy emphasis on sperm. Yep sperm. It is just wierd to watch this. Although the song \"Zenzen Tomodachi\" by Haruka Yamazaki is good, it definitely overshadowed by the weird visuals on display. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\\n\r\nThis is a show that is difficult to decide whether or not you should at least check out this show. On one hand the absurdity and the over the top antics of this show makes this entertaining and the relationship between Aya and Tsuyuno is something I genuinely cared about. On the other hand, its poor story writing and emphasis that this is a dark and edgy show hampers this show quite a bit. Honestly, I wouldn't blame you if you dismiss this show or if you already had dismissed this show because this show doesn't exactly scream high quality anime. I also honestly think it should have broken the 12 episode mould and have at least 14 episodes to wrap things up and not leave us on a cliffhanger which suggests a sequal that might not possibly happen. \\n\\n\r\nI'm going to use an analogy right here. Mahou Shoujou Site is like the Shadow the Hedgehog video game. Does it fail at telling a cohesive and good story? Yes. Does it go over the top with the emphasis that is is dark and edgy? Yes. Does it still has entertainment value from its stupidity and absurdness? Yes. If you are looking for an anime to turn your brain off and be entertained, then check this anime out. If not, then you can just skip this one. \\n\\n\r\nMy Personal Enjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6.2/10           Recommendation: Consider it",

            "content": "Fuku dane fuku dane.......why is it that Cool_Guy_Senpai gets a 112 helpful review that he rated a 2, while Karhu get's 105 helpful reviews that that Yasser Arafat fan dude rated a 10? Now, I don't know about them who gave them such rating, it only goes to show that people who watched this have mixed reaction, more like Pres Trump and his family separation policy for illegal immigrants, where he says one thing and says a different thing. I guess it either has to do with one having to empathize with the main character Aya, who is in a world of shit from beingbullied in school by a trio of gang bitches to being a punching bag of his sadist onichan  and with such boring storyline of the two namely Aya and Yatsumura's lesbian affair. Now don't get me wrong, I ain't got no issues with those two dude that've mention, for me, just seeing this was a clear indication that of ones conflicting issues upon watching this anime. Ok so Aya's sadistic onichan got what he deserves and we can conclude  that he got man raped by that guy cop named Detective Masumi, which to us adudence has given Aya some justice after getting a lotta beating from her sadist onichan, we also get so see Yatsumura getting some justice when Sarina missed her target which happens to be her and ends up killing the killer who killed Yatsumura's family 10 years ago who, Yatsumura is slowing killer him by means of a method used by them Chinese, which \"Killing by a Thousand Cuts\" OUCH!But seeing Sarina become a mahou shoujo hunter was an injustice , cu's she is suppose to be \"DEATH\" WHEN YATSUMURA SLIT HER THROAT!!!!!!!!!!!!Also being the girls ally was another slap to us audience cu'z were expecting that she get's her ass kicked either by Yatsumura or Aya so that way we can say that \"PAYBACK IS A BITCH!\" Cu's she is sa bitch, also some of those mahou shoujo from the other site don't seen to deserve welding a stick like Mikari Izumigamine the girl with a flying broom, whom I think should have been the antagonist or should be death just like what happened Nijimi Aizawa,  and Saiyuki Ringa the girl with a cut anything katana, now according to info she got her magical stick before she got kidnapped, and she didn't developed any unfortunate feelings after she used her magic stick, so basically that conflicts the policy of them site admins to give her a magical stick since according to their laws the girls who should have a magic stick must have some unfortunate feelings first. Also, let's not forget that transgender homo Kiyoharu Suirenji, according to that gay cop Misumi it should be only girls who should posses magical stick, so wtf was original creator Satou  Kentarou thinking of adding a fag like Kiyoharu when it would have been better of if that Original Creator just made it an all girls group. On the sound part, I really hated the voiced of them site admins like Nana who sounded like some gay old man, but the end theme was  good, also since them administrators were girls according to info, then they should have sounded like girls and not like a bunch of cross dress fags or old matrons, Now how enjoyable was this?????IMAO it was enjoyable especially the post credits were we see Aya's sadist oniichan get raped it kinda gives us that feeling of \"How'ya like being on the receiving end you bastard\" Kinda of thing, so yes it was good t some point but overall all I hate the yuri thing that exist around here. so here are my ratings:\\n\\n\r\nStory- Very Good 8: Cu'z it starts with us empathizing with Aya's predicament and seeing his sadistic oniichan getting what he deserves.  \\n\\n\r\nArt- Decent 6: As in decent enough to only limit the panty service to Nijimi and there were some of those usual swimsuit service with the girls in the beach scene.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Good 7: For the closing theme, but them site admins sounded like a bunch of old homos and matrons. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Very Good 8- Cu'z we empathize with them girls misfortunes, especially with Aya.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Good 7: Though \"Good\" the original creator relies a lot with the character having to suffer such poor predicament that has haunted them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Good 7: Though \"Good\" the Yuri thing that exist was a let down of some sorts and not seeing who should die was also part of it cu'z I really would have liked to see Sarina, Mikari , Rina , Site admins, Gay Cop and that sadistic oniichan DEATH!!!!!!!!!!!",

            "content": "This show touches on many controversial themes such as rape, domestic violence, suicide and extreme bullying (in the first episode). The first episode is where you see a cluster bomb of edgy concepts, which the main character Aya Asagiri is suffering from. I thought that the series was going to make a unique twist to the already famed Madoka Magica that was a magical girl series that had a great psychological and realistic perspective to the genre that made it unique to begin with. But it seems that Magical Girl Site copies those ideas made by Madoka and makes it worse. I dont know ifit's the edginess or the bad written main character that made it go under for me. Though, I am still watching this, because it's so bad that it makes me laugh (not to offend fans). \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you are interested in this series, I would suggest the manga instead of this show, as the manga has a better pacing than the show. The core concepts are still in the manga, but the composition of the story is better. \\n\\n\r\nThis show did not cut it for me after 6 episodes, but it had great potential with its concepts that could have explored more of the magical girl genre. But with many shows, it was executed poorly because of the bad pacing and writing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "So, firstly, I'll admit this show is far from perfect. I can totally see why some people have given this show as low as a 2 rating overall. MSS is a dark, unfeeling anime that is truly not for everyone.\r\nThe abuse, torture, etc. of the MC, Aya, is essentially a plot device to drive our sympathy for her. Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I do think it could've been made a bit... less dense. In the first ten minutes of EP1, sadness is just fired nonstop, and while I guess you could say that's to represent how, from Aya's perspective, it *is*nonstop, it still feels like too much at once.\\n\\n\r\nThe bully characters are written a tad too heartless for my tastes, as they seem to enjoy literally nothing but making her sad. I'm not going to spoil, but the reason why the bully her is just... so dumb. I mean it's so fucking stupid, the first time I saw it I was literally in open-mouthed awe at the unrealistic stupidity of it. The conflicting emotions the show tries to make you feel (making you sympathize with one of the bullies) is completely undermined, at least for me, personally, by the fact that she is so clearly unredeemable.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so, why an 8 out of 10? Simple. I genuinely enjoyed this show. Despite everything, no matter how bad or good this anime may be, I actually liked it. I was curious to see where it went, I think the plot was engaging and well-paced, twists were reasonably built up to, etc. I can't necessarily say I recommend MSS, but if you think you're in the mood, you should give it a shot. Just... make sure you're in a good mental place, first.",

            "content": "WARNING, MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!\r\nYay, another comedy anime, and another fantastic one at that.  Although, unlike Dragon Pilot and Hinamatsuri, I\u2019m undecided if this one is trying to get those laughs intentionally, or if it\u2019s just poorly written.  As you can obviously tell at first glance, Magical Girl Site is the latest attempt at doing the whole Madoka Magica deconstruction thing, except this one stands out from its contemporaries because it\u2019s hilariously over the top.  It\u2019s so obscene that I have to warn you that it won\u2019t be for everyone.  In just the first few minutes our poor suicidal protagonist Aia, whowe see try and fail to kill herself in front of a train, is beaten by her sadistic older brother and a trio of female bullies at her school, feels neglected and isolated from her parents, although admittingly we don\u2019t actually see if her parents are as horrible as everyone else or not, she has her shoes packed to the brim with razor blades, which is still barely a fraction of the total edge in this anime, her desk and seat are covered with glue, and her fucking cat is brutally murdered, which she is tragically informed about in the middle of an attempted rape by some guy which those aforementioned girls helped orchestrate.  \\n\\n\r\nThen she accidentally murders two of them by using a magical gun to teleport them in front of a train.   Like King\u2019s Game last fall, or The Lost Village in 2016, this is edgy on a level that makes it impossible to take seriously, but also, a t least for me, impossible to hate.  And just like King\u2019s Game and The Lost Village, if you have a dark, twisted, morbid sense of humor, like me, then I expect that you will absolutely love this show.  While it doesn\u2019t have King\u2019s Games inept animation, it makes up for it with some truly ridiculous reaction faces.  And also the ending, which the visuals of are about Jizz.  I couldn\u2019t make this up if I tried.  It seems like we\u2019re getting more and more of these overly edgy and humorous anime lately, which I very much am a fan of.  I highly recommend it if you are too.",

            "content": "You may want less edge on that... Should be the motto of this anime.\r\nIt just keeps getting dumber and edgier every episode. It tries to deal with some heavy themes, e.g. torture, rape, abuse, bullying, murder, etc., but does it in such a comically overdone awful way, it actually becomes hilarious. I think such themes should be treated with some dignity, or at least some basic human decency. In the way it is portrayed, I find it hard not to laugh when yet another terrible thing meets our shy cardboard cut-out main character. It is very difficult to sympathize with any character, because they areall awful. Not even awful people (which most of them all, anyway. Or rather, stereotypes of awfulness), just awfully written. And speaking of characters...\\n\r\nCharacters are not even 2D, they are 1D cookie-cutter stereotypes without any real reason to do anything. The story doesn't make much sense either, at least I couldn't see any. The \"characters\" constantly have information they shouldn't have and their actions are quite nonsensical as well. \\n\r\nWhat I quite like is the art and sound. The ED has flying sperms in it, who wouldn't want that?\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason why I am still watching it is just to see how much edgier it gets.

            "content": "This anime held a lot of potential upon first glance. The very first episode was amazing at getting the audience invested into the main character's plight, albeit in a cruel and hard to watch way. Intense bullying, suicide, self harm, domestic abuse and rape all make their way into just one episode. I respected how serious her circumstances were and how unapologetic the show was about displaying them. It set a nice tone for the rest of the series based off mere minutes which made me genuinely excited to see how far they could push these dark themes. Unfortunately it all falls apart from episode2 and onwards. Besides the main 2 characters Asagiri and Yatsumura, the show introduces a whole host of both unlikeable or completely useless characters. They add very little to the world building or narrative at hand and take away a huge amount interest whenever they appear in a scene. As time went on, I felt more obligated than curious to see the series through to the end which is never a good sign. Subplots and character motivations were just all over the place making it difficult to follow what exactly was more important and interesting. Thankfully this anime is only 12 episodes making it a somewhat quick watch. Some redeeming qualities would be some of the character designs and \"transformations\" when the magical girls use their powers. They have a nice subtle change in hair and eye color giving them a somewhat menacing look. It works with the mood the show is trying to portray and honestly just looks plain cool. I found the opening pleasing to watch and listen to as well, nothing too fancy or innovative but enjoyable nonetheless. All in all, an anime with a promising start but shortcoming in subsequent episodes. I wouldn't recommend this anime unless you're extremely bored or love to watch anime that try to explore darker subject matter.",

Even in a world full of hatred , perversity and chaos , we still get some moments of comedy (these moments are so weird that you dont know if you should laugh or feel uncomfortable), friendship, happiness and , most of all , true love. And thats why I like the main protagonist Aya Asagiri : she loves everything inconditionally , she is just a good girl who is tired of being pushed around , searching for a place to fit in ... whatcould be more relatable ?\\n\\n\r\n  The other characters are good too. in some of them, it is possible to perceive the influence of their tragic past in traces of their personalities. Yatsumura, for example, has a good trajectory and the development of her personality is very cool and captivating.\\n\\n\r\nOverall , I like the atmosphere of it , with a dark mood and some happy and heart-warming moments.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best Mahou Shoujo animes (in my opinion).\\n\\n\r\nWaiting for the second season !!!",

Everybody (besides the main girl who is so pure she wouldn't hurt a fly) is horrible! Everything that happens is just a big mess of whatever horrible thing you could think of\r\nAlso the writer or whatever missed the whole part of what makes a magical girl story is getting us to care about the character before everything turns south. Honestly there is nothing smartor inventive about the anime and it does it in the plainest way possible.\\n\r\nI don't think I would be that upset if it didn't feel like the show was to dileratly trying to manipulate the view by throwing whatever graphic imagery they could through (good writes and shows can do this without is being to obvious or pandering)\\n\r\nAlso the lighting in the of the scenes are so dark I could barely tell what was happening.",

            "content": "Oh lord, what do I say about Magical Girl Site? This is one of those rare shows that I find impossible to give a review score. Is it good? Is it bad? It's hella WEIRD, I can tell you that! My feelings about the show changed from love to hate and back CONSTANTLY, so I can't even give you a consensus with this one. The first episode I found objectively bad, bordering on torture porn. It's a rough sit as you watch literally every terrible thing happen to this poor girl, from being viciously bullied at school, to being used as a punching bag byher brother, to having her cat murdered, you get the picture. All this to establish that girls who are beset by misfortune are the ones qualified to access the website and become magical girls? You could've just shown *one* of those scenes and it would've had the same effect! So yeah, I stuck with the show for some reason, and actually started loving the action scenes and weird batshit insane characters. One of my favorite moments is when heroine Aya uses her teleportation gun to \"catch\" the villain's razor yo-yo, create a portal behind her, and fire it right back at her. At a certain point the magical girls all team up to fight the website admins, and that's when the show REALLY goes off the rails! The admins are so bizarre looking, unlike anything I've ever seen, and their fight scenes are DBZ-levels of epicness. The show is too \"edgy\" for its own good, like when we introduce the magical girl whose power is activated by cutting her wrists with her \"magical knife\" (OK, come on, really?), or the various girls who bleed from the eyes when they use their power. It also copies Madoka Magica in several ways. I just don't know with this one. Approach at your own risk!\\n\\n\r\nThe numbers I picked for story, art, enjoyment, etc. are all arbitrary, as I constantly changed my mind on whether I liked or hated it. I'm sorry to be so vague but this is one of those shows you just have to see for yourself. I can't even predict how you're going to respond to it, thought I DO recommend you stick with it for a few episodes before giving up. Remember, I hated episode 1 but ended up really enjoying parts of this show.  ?/10, your mileage may vary.",

            "content": "In a somewhat unusual fashion I'm going to keep it \"fairly short\".\r\nIt's a decent enough anime that however it ends in a poor way. The closest comparison I can give to this is the anime adaption of \"Deadman Wonderland\". Characters were cut, the story was condensed but still managed to leave some of the overarching plotlines and intrigue, and more importantly they went ahead and did something that Deadman Wonderland didn't even do... they completely changed when and how the story ends.  They basically cut maybe... 1/2 or more of the story and altered what remained so it ended when the anime did ina concise fashion.\\n\\n\r\nI went to read the Manga out of curiosity and... immediately had no idea what was going on. This seems to scream that they didn't see much potential in the series itself and probably just wanted filler anime that would attract attention with the amount of Edge\u2122 it contained in the first episode alone. Adaptions typically don't retcon half or more of the story so that it ends when the anime ends, is what I'm getting at. They weren't trying to sell the Manga or build a fanbase, they just wanted a timeslot filler.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a decent anime, but a downright terrible adaption. The sheer amount of cut content and story alteration is mindblowing, but if you feel like you aren't going to read the manga anytime soon (or at all) than it's a fine anime to watch on its own merits.",

It's called, \"Mahou Shoujo Site\", and the girls are called, \"magical girls\", however, the sticks are what give them any magical powers to make them magical girls in the first place. Rendering any magical girl without their stick, \r\npractically human. \r\nThe art and sound are ok, I wouldn't say it's amazing, but it is decent. I don't really have any complaints but I will say they are forgettable. Noscene's music or sound really had a huge effect on me. \\n\r\nThe characters are not that good. While some possess a unique thing about them that separates them from every other character, there is practically no character development what so ever with important characters like Kosame Amagai. You'll find yourself questioning what misfortunes brought these girls to be magical girls, but you'll never truly find the answer with a lot of them. \\n\r\nEnjoyment wise, I sort of enjoyed myself laughing over things I found silly that is supposed to be taken seriously. Also the first episode I think is the best episode and really pulled me in to watch the rest.\\n\r\nOverall, I give this a 3/10. I wouldn't give it a 2 or a 1 because I definitely think there's enjoyment to be had in this but also I definitely think you should look somewhere else.",

If you were attracted to this anime because you heard it was super \u201cedgey,\u201d you probably won\u2019t like this anime; yes, Mahou Shoujo Site can be dark, but this is not a show that takes itself seriously (most of the time.)  Many of the characters have crazy personalities that are played for gags: one of the characters has anger issues (It seems more like a mix of manic depression and PTSD, but the show calls it anger issuesso I\u2019ll call it anger issues) which are played off as a major plot point.  Also, let me just add that, arguably, the most psychotic character in the show is voiced by the voice actress for Love Live Sunshine\u2019s Mari Ohara: if you, like me, have not only watched Love Live Sunshine but play School Idol Festival, you will swear you hear \u201cit\u2019s joke\u201d when her voice appears in the show.  Enough with side tracking, Mahou Shoujo Site condenses a fair chunk of manga into twelve episodes, so the show ends up feeling a bit rushed, and the characters suffer for it: to make sure they end up at a certain point in the manga, the show steamrolls past character and plot development leaving characters as empty husks and the last few episodes making no sense contextually.  I had a big problem with the ending; that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean everyone will.  I say, if the concept of this anime interests you and manga isn\u2019t your thing, go ahead and give this anime a go.  On the other hand, if you enjoy reading manga and watching anime equally, just read the manga.",

The show knows what it is, and never presents itself as anything else. If anything the show toned down much of the violence and gore from the source material. \r\nThis anime is best compared to 80's, campy horror such as 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'. It is intentionally over the top, and utilizes absurdist violence that draws dissonance with its seemingly cute, magical aesthetic. The show is also incredibly self-aware, and very, VERY funny, even going as far as to film alternative live-action endings,and having the main-antagonist perform their own intentionally bad rendition of the opening song.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative is unusually inspired, and unique, and a lot of the characters serve as an absurdist form of social commentary - ranging from the harms of celebrity worship, to societies treatment of transgenderism. The main cast also serves as a positive conduit for LGBT representation, a rare thing in Japanese media.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy campy, humorous horror, in an unusual setting - that at times proves itself to be the catalyst for real romance and heart-felt emotions, then this anime will prove an enjoyable watch. Just be aware of the genre you're viewing.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The difference between Madoka and this is that Madoka catches you off guard while Site slaps you in the face with depression and cliche characters that you've seen in most other slice of life series. \r\nStory 3/10 \r\nThe story is about this girl who's like really sad and wants to die butshe's a pussy so she never jumps in front of the train so this shady deep web business contacts her and she becomes a magical girl. Apparently the more she uses her magic stick the shorter her lifespan becomes, which is pretty messed up these guys over at Mahou Shoujo Site are huge jerks. She meets some other magical girl and they become friends and then their super interesting adventure begins. This story is pretty bland and stupid. Things are explained later on but I still think it's stupid and most importantly edgy. I'm not really a person who'd lose his temper over unoriginality but you could've thought of more original stuff while taking a shower.\\n\\n\r\nArt 4/10 \\n\r\nThis is a show about girls, as a direct consequence the girls are all cute. Yet still, the show's artstyle is mediocre and bland. Not done poorly, but not good either. The manga is probably better.\\n\\n\r\nSound 2/10\\n\r\nI'll just start with the OST. It's unrecognizable for the most part but when it is recognizable it's awful. People who've watched this show would probably remember that one that sounds like a girl singing and it's obviously just a sad attempt at horror, which basically summarizes this entire show.  The voices are either annoying or mediocre. Other than one voice actor (Suzuki Aina) the rest of the cast didn't do that good of a job in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10\\n\r\nThey're your typical slice of life characters with a drop of edginess and some spicy yuri undertones (delicious). I don't understand what made the author think it was a good idea to add yuri to this series, because it was most certainly a bad idea. There are also some unrealistically vile characters in the series, which serves the story well. Though obnoxious, the story wouldn't be the same without them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nTo me, enjoyment is the most important factor when it comes to a series. I enjoyed this, mostly because I thought it was really funny. People who don't watch a lot of anime would probably enjoy this, while it must've been torture for those who watch a lot of seasonal anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, this show is not worth your time. It's cheap horror that no one could possibly enjoy, but it's funny if you don't take it very seriously.",

            "content": "Sometimes you enjoy something you shouldn\u2019t. Magical Girl site is a show about a poor unfortunate girl named Aya Asagiri. Her life, is just the worst thing you can ever imagine. She is physically and emotionally abused. Both in school and at home by her brother. In school, three girls make her life hell. At home, her brother beats her until she pukes. Her teachers don\u2019t care about her, her parents don\u2019t care about her. Needless to say, she wants to die. One night, after getting beaten by her brother, she encounters a mysterious website. This website takes pity on Aya and makes her intoa Magical Girl.\\n\r\nMagical Girl Site is a horror, drama, psychological, and supernatural anime. From the synopsis, everyone and their mother knew what this show was going to be like. It was going to be edgy. And it was edgy. People died. People had psychotic breakdowns. There are those chaotic edgelord destruction characters. Dark backstories. Rape. They even cry blood. The entire show is like that, with no light at the end of the tunnel. All this edge is of course a bad thing, but the thing I was interested in was the situation around the magical girls, and their powers. A magical girl, in the subject of the show, is a girl who has had a bad life and was pitied by the administrators of the Magical Girl Site. These girls are given a \u201cstick\u201d which holds magical powers. They all take different forms (Gun, phone, pair of panties) and all do different things (Teleport, stop time, mind control, respectively). And the fact that the girls have to have a terrible upbringing, (or at least have a bad event happen) makes them have a reason for the dark edgy backstory. If they didn\u2019t have a backstory like that, then they wouldn\u2019t be a magical girl in the first place.\\n\r\nI watched this show as a guilty pleasure. I just stare at these characters making bad decisions and get in these bad situations then solve it by being edgy. These nothing special about the technical aspect of the show. Art and animation is fine. The OP and ED are wild though. You gotta see it yourself. Being an edgy magical girl show, you gotta compare it to the widely successful Madoka Magica. These anime aren\u2019t really similar aside from the obvious. They\u2019re both just dark, magical girl anime. If you just want to experience another dark magical girl anime then watch this show. Also if you just want to watch it because you want to watch stupid edge for the sake of it. I give this show a 6 out of 10. This has been PixEFit\u2019s spoiler free, but not really review on Magical Girl Site.",

Really what LA is saying is because of the nature of Mahou Shoujo Site, most of the characters are awful, terrible people, blood hungry with no dignity whatsoever or straight up mentally homicidal, this statement can easily be said about Nijimi of all people as they \"try\" to be sentimental but it failed for LA went it tried and she kinda deserved her own stupidity by the end of it. Nonetheless the only light to the darkness of Mahou Shoujo Site and the anime is mostly focused on Aya's despair and how she got out of it with the help from Tsuyuno. LA's favourite character weirdly enough wasn't Aya however as LA liked Rina Shioi voiced by Aina Suzuki, the \"Mahou Shoujo Hunter\" and \"it's NO JOKE\" that she livened things up and was the start to the craziness of Mahou Shoujo Site, on the other side of things, LA quite easily deems Kaname Asagiri (Aya's older brother) voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto as the WORST character of Spring 2018 because of what he did before and after the end of the series and his fate at the end of the series was an ironic fate that LA didn't mind reveling in.\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Site also had a tonal problem when it brings in murder, bullying and unbashed violence then somehow makes a chibi experssion joke about a character or situation. LA gets that Mahou Shoujo Site wants to relieve the tension at times but there is a time and place but Mahou Shoujo Site doesn't time these well and considering the nature of Mahou Shoujo Site that causes LA's entire tonal problem in the first place.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by production doA, the animation from character designs and battles were quite decent though because of the animation is uncensored (in most cases for TV syndication anyways) it makes most of the unpleasant scenarios all the more nerve wracking to go through at times. LA didn't mind the battles as they were fluid and the uncensorship was good to have and again the overall animation done by production doA was decent.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting wise, the majority of the cast was decent, though LA is bias against \"shy-willed characters\" which Yuuko Oono was cast as Aya and she kept her \"shrill voice\" throughout but still Yuuko had some sense of range nonetheless. so what happens when the majority of the voice cast hams it up to no end, well we get some hammy performances...like Rina Shioi voiced by Aina Suzuki, Yuu Serizawa as Nijimi Anazawa, Kaname Asagiri voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto, Sarina Shizukume voiced by Haruka Yamazaki and Site Admin 7 voiced by Freeza himself...no seriously. Mahou Shoujo Site's voice cast was hammy as hell and LA loved it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso for those in the know, Ai Kizuna along with another virtual youtuber was cast in this anime, with some few lines (they were Site Admins)...LA kept forgetting about that little tidbit...did it help?...well they were characters with little screentime all things considered...soooo...take that like you will...\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Site's finale did give Aya a full character development and resolution to tear out the despair from not only herself but the rest of the magical girls which is easily taking cues from Madoka Magica but the finale if anything was an anticlimax to what it was trying to do, we do at least know about how the Site Admins work but the anticlimax comes from the entire \"Tempest\" situation and if Aya and Tsuyuno even completed it, but LA thinks Mahou Shoujo Site tried to leave it ambiguous for \"effect\". LA just felt the finale was just left there however...\\n\\n\r\nYes, Mahou Shoujo Site can easily be pointed as the \"edgiest\" anime of Spring 2018, but if you got the guts and love despair (like a certain pink twintailed despair girl) and can handle all the abuse our main protagonist goes through...or just love a batshit crazy plot that is another of the \"dark magical girl\" genre it's trying to put out in, then Mahou Shoujo Site probably has something for you...for LA...it's an \"ok\" anime but all the abuse and violence definitely took a bit to handle and for LA definitely got better away from the despairing beginning but kinda faltered in it's finale.\\n\\n\r\nFukou-dan ni.....FUKOU DAN NI indeed...",

It is about miserable girls that are turned into magical girls by being given magical 'sticks' gotten from a website called Mahou Shoujo Site.\r\nThe show starts by showing our main protagonist being bullied and abused 24/7. I feel like all of these scenes are supposed to make you feel bad and sympathize with our protagonist, Aya Asagiri. But what it really did is making it painful to watch. Fortunately, it is only like this in the beginning.\r\nAll those misfortune made herget a magical stick after stumbling to Mahou Shoujo Site. After first using her magical stick, she encountered another magical girl, Tsuyuno Yatsumura. Together, they form some kind of bond, while fighting off the problems that is hidden in the Mahou Shoujo Site. Along the way, they will meet some other magical girls, some become the focus of future episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme in this anime is usually some kind of dark psychological atmosphere. Occasionally, there is some moments they tried to make it heart-warming when the characters remind themselves of their bonds. But if course, it fails to make you feel those dark atmosphere or sympathize with the characters because of how utterly ridiculous the scene is. Some scenes are absolutely ridiculous that you will be unable to watch this seriously and just start laughing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are made super unrealistic and are in no way relatable. Our main character just tolerates all the abuse that she gets. Her brother (the one that abused Aya) is someone who looks down on litterally everyone but himself.\u00a0 There is also Nijimi Asazawa, who is an idol at surface but actually just wants to kill someone horribly underneath. Some characters also went through drastic changes with only little time (sudden development), they are hostile towards the protagonist at first, but easily changes sides to helping her. All these characters are made very messed up, it might not necessarily be bad if you like watching extremely messed up characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt and music are not impressive either. The anime's ending is also one of the weirdest one i have seen. It is live action dancing with flying sperms in the sky. I think it is supposed to have some kind of connection to the story, but i can't help thinking how weird it is.\\n\\n\r\nTaking everything into account, while the premise is quite unique or weird, this anime is just a horrible mess of gimmicks including, but not limited to, magical girls, psychological problems (abuse, murdered relatives, etc), and psycho genius brother. It fails to make us care about the characters, even when we are given half-episode-long backstory. But can it be entertaining? Yes. It is so bad that you can get enjoyment watching its badness, or you could actually become curious on how it will progress.",

            "content": "A show that has good ideas but executes them poorly. I get the impression that the writer either wanted to write something like Madoka Magica or Sailor Nothing but got impatient and threw pacing out the window. \r\nAs a result, the plot becomes very predictable, very fast. I'll start with the cons and work up from there.\r\nThe first issue is, the main character is so severely, unrealistically, unfortunate. She hit the absolute lottery on generic depression inducing misfortunes to happen to a character. It gets laid on super thick from the start. \r\nI'm a sucker for contract, tontine, 'Alice Game' plotted animes, but this one'splot is far too predictable and character motivations are paper thin. What's more, too many plot devices are too similar to that of Madoka Magica, seeming to be jumping on the growing trend of the 'dark magical girl' genre. The problem is, unlike others that carry out a balancing act of cute oldschool tropes juxtaposed against looming darkness on the horizon, Site just staight up vomits psych horror onto you to a hilarious degree.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of characters, many of them are completely and unrealistically psychotic right off the bat. Over half the cast begins with some severe crippling behavioral issue that wouldn't run unchecked for that long in a normal functioning society, and that's BEFORE anyone gets life altering powers. What's more, the motivations behind the insanity are tremendously weak.  So far only a select one or two characters have become remotely relatable, since most are just beyond crazy. \\n\\n\r\nSo what's good about it? Artistically it looks nice, sound's decent, animation's decent, cute character designs, and cool ideas and gimmicks for the usage of magical powers. Not necessarily revolutionary in that regard, but a definite strongpoint. If you can get past the 'edge' it becomes pretty to look at. Still an enjoyable show at face value, and I'd recommend it for those that like some senseless violence, mayhem, and psychotic characters. I personally plan to finish this one.",

Don't get me wrong, those complaints are found, but by no means should it be considered an abomination as there are other series that take the seriousness and attempts at edginess to another level while still having lighter subject material and being aimed at younger demographics. I just see there being so many obvious points that could be considered a cringe-worthy cliche or trope. The general mood and often sadism of the characters,particularly the magical girls is something that I feel an edgy Western teenage girl would enjoy on top of the occasional \"lalalala\" whimsical horror theme. But the thing is is that I doubt that sort of crowd would be behind this show, much less able to get past all the subject material without instantly getting upset. Either way, it's a fun watch after the first three or so episodes, and the character designs become progressively more enjoyable.",

            "content": "This story tells us about something about a person's experience through bad things. Aya and Yatsumura had a tragic experiences which leads them to be able to access the website in their desperate situation. It just explaining that every 1 people out of 1 million of people maybe suffers this kind of situation out there and crying for help. This situation is just a fact of a reality that really happens. It just the story of the anime the author thinks that what if they are given a chance to change their situation but it will cost their own life.  It just what ifin reality also these persons who are suffering made a contact on something or unknown power,Will they make a revenge to the ones who made them suffer or will they forgive them. \\n\\n\r\nI liked the animation too. Its just there are different companies that draws anime like highschool dxd series which receives a lot of changes in Hero(Season 4) but I still love the original art of the series. The facial expression tells us what really an emotion should the character have just like in reality if your angry or mad your emotion should be in enraged situation, or somewhat killing intent to the the person you want to have revenge. Same animation in Kakegurui.  Its not boring and I am really excited what will happen in Episode 6 until the end. I find this anime interesting (Omoshiroi).\\n\\n\r\nWell that's my opinion, I do respect other's opinion and review for this anime\\n\r\nbut as for me I love anime and this adds to my collection of the Greatest Anime That I Haved Watched.\\n\\n\r\nPeace Yo!!\\n",

It's just... nothing happening. You have to guess most of the time what is going on because the bond is so poorly that the motivations for the characters just seem stupid.\r\nThe animation is not terrible, but fora Mahou Shoujo it could be better, also considering this type of MS. \\n\r\nThe music is just forgettable. \\n\r\nI'll probably follow this untill the end, but if you haven't started it yet, I suggest you: Don't do it.",

            "content": "Remember Watchmen\u00a0?\r\nWritten by Alan Moore and drawn by Dave Gibbons in 1986, Watchmen changed american comics books\u00a0: it was (and still is ) a well-written deconstruction about superheroes, with a lot depth and complexity. It was also, a big financial success. So of course, other companies tried to do the same thing that Watchmen did in order to make some cash except that they didn\u2019t understood why Watchmen worked. It was a violent story yes but it was good because it had a great plot, interesting characters and good visual. But those people didn\u2019t see that. They only saw that Watchmen had violence so clearly,violence = success and so begins the Dark Age of Comics where tons of bad/mediocre/awful titles were created, filled with tons of dark-gritty-edgy-violent-characters who wear shoulder pads but with no depth whatsoever. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat the hell is that anything to do with today's subject, Mahou Shoujo Site?\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell, this kind of stuff is also present in anime, especially now with Magical Girls or Cute Girls anime.  Magical /Cute Girls are a big part of anime/manga history and naturally, some tought that it would be interesting to create something original by adding darkness and complexity in what was originally, pretty naive and simple stories.\\n\r\nMadoka, Gakkougurashi and episode 46 of Magical Princess Gigi showed this kind of stories done right. But of course, just like for the comics industry, many people only saw the money those series were making and once again, tough that they worked only because they were brutal, harsh, full of tears and traumatized little girls. Many mangas/anime have been creating only to make some easy cash with the simple premise of \u00ab\u00a0cute girls (sometimes with magic) + death + plot twist + a lot of deranged psychos\u00a0 = instant success \u00bb. Some of them are good/decent, others are funny because of how bad they are and some are just mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Site isn\u2019t in those three categories because it\u2019s a unique show. It\u2019s not just a bad show. It\u2019s not even the bottom of the barrel. Mahou Shoujo Site is one of those things that are bottomless, an abyss made of the worst writing you will ever witness. \\n\\n\r\nNormally I always tries to watch at least two hours of a show before making a review of it but with this one\u00a0? I could\u2019nt last more than fifty minutes. There are many words to describe Mahou Shinjo Date like \u00ab\u00a0horrible\u00a0\u00bb, \u00ab\u00a0disgusting\u00a0\u00bb, \u00ab\u00a0boring\u00a0\u00bb, \u00ab\u00a0immature\u00a0\u00bb, \u00ab\u00a0talentless\u00a0\u00bb and of course \u00ab\u00a0edgy\u00a0\u00bb (yes I used the curshed word because this show deserves it) but it\u2019s still isn\u2019t enough to describe the show.  In the first minutes, you can tell what you\u2019re in for.\\n\\n\r\nSo this start with a our protagonist, Aya, trying and failing to kill herself. No ones around her seems to care. Hum okay, that\u2019s actually something that does unfortunately happens in real lif\u2026 Oh you have three bullies who put razor blades in her shoes. And they trashed/shit on her seat and desk and no one, even the teacher, seem to notice or care because? And then they beat Aya up, try to drown her using the bathroom and almost kills her, leaving her uncouscious. And when Aya actually regains consciness (hours after), one of then actually waited for Aya to wake up in order to stalk her to see if she can torture Aya even more (in that case, she finds out that Aya dares to like some little cute cat). Oh but look, Aya has an older brother, Glasses-Guy\u00a0! He look so nice, I clearly don\u2019t expect him to be another sociopa\u2026 Wait he is. He beats the shit out of his sister while gloating like a madman but don\u2019t worry, the parents are apparently blind/deaf and don\u2019t hear/see any of that. They also don\u2019t see the depressed look on their daughter face. But oh, look the bullies are back and they ask some guy to rape Aya in front of them. And of course, one of them trolled Aya because they killed the cute cat offscreen (because they\u2019re evil. Did you get it\u00a0? They\u2019 re evil, so evil that they kill cute cats. Did you get it?). Wow, what a well-written, credible, logical story\u00a0! \\n\\n\r\n\u2026\\n\\n\r\nYou tough that the bullies from Stephen King were caricatures? Try those girls\u00a0: no humanity whatsoever, just complete monsters without any reasons. This show tries super-duber-hard to be this dark-violent-shocking show but it never works\u00a0: it\u2019s so overexagerrated, badly-written and filled with characters with no personality. It's kinda like Elfen Lied without none of the good parts. \\n\\n\r\nBut the worst is that MSS is not even fun or interesting to watch. Like before watching this, I tough I was gonna have a good laugh like I had with Big Order or Mayoiga but this show doesn\u2019t even succeed in that. It\u2019s so joyless because it\u2019s just torture porn treated in a very serious way. There is nothing fun when you see some empthy shell getting beat up, over and over. And again, it doesn\u2019t work as a serious show since nothing make sense, nothing is interesting but everything is boring. Yes, MSS can't even entertain you with how bad it is. Also did I forgot to say that MASS is also boring, predictable and repetitive? Because it is.\\n\\n\r\nNow I tried to skip a little bit to see if this show gets better\u00a0; it doesn\u2019t. Want to see Glasses-Guy gaining superpowers and beating more little girls\u00a0? No\u00a0? Too bad because it happens. But don\u2019t worry since this is such as smart and classy show, he eventually get some kind of punishment. What is his punishment? The most predictable thing ever. Like just try to think like a 15 years old who is currently in his dark-edgy phase and you\u2019ll predict it. Like the rest, you feel nothing when Glasses-Guy gets his comeuppance because it\u2019s so annoying, so immature\u2026 Watching MSD is like having some jerk screaming in your ears \u00ab\u00a0I\u2019m an adult\u00a0! I\u2019m an adult and I know how to shock you\u00a0!\u00a0\u00bb every two seconds.\\n\\n\r\nAnd don\u2019t get me wrong\u00a0: I like dark-mature shows. I like evil characters so much that my profil pic is Shou Tucker (love that dude by the way, best daddy of every year). I like  the\u00ab\u00a0so bad it\u2019s good\u00a0\u00bb shows. And even I can\u2019t find anything worth your time in MSS. It\u2019s as shallow as a puddle. A disgusting puddle. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOkay, there is maybe one thing: the voice of Glasses-Guy is Okamoto Nobuhiko AKA Rin from Blue Exorcist. So if you wanted to hear Rin act like the biggest shitbag in the planet, this is for you!",

I forced myself to watch this in order to lower my standards(I already knew this was a bad anime) but OH GOD HOW CAN YOU CREATE SUCH AN ABOMINATION? \r\nArtstyle sucks. And really, it would be better to make everything in CGI instead(or wasit already CGI?).\\n\r\nOh I really hate everything about this. Stop making mahou shoujo parodies ffs people start believing mahou shoujo genre sucks because of this trash.\\n\r\nI could somehow watch 3 episodes before starting to puke. Then I said, \"Hako, why are you torturing yourself so much? It isn't worth being able to enjoy any other anime if you have to go through this.\" Then I dropped this anime.\\n\r\nSeriously though, don't watch this one. Just choose any other anime from my anime list or something",

            "content": "Honestly when I finished the first episode, I thought I was the only one who disliked this show and I agree with many people who didn't like this show. \r\nThe story is about a girl named Aya Asagiri who starts off as a sympathetic sue because she gets bullied by classmates in school as well as her brother at home. Honestly the bullies were not portrayed that well. They were basically written off as sadistic yanderes just to remind us that this is a DAAAAAAAARRRRRRK magical girl anime. It would've been much better if we see why they are acting like that but nope. Theyare there for the sake of being edgy, that's it. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters weren't memorable in the slightest because like I said, they only exist for superficial darkness, that's it. When the characters aren't yanderes, the creators write them off as an appeal to loli and fetishes which serve no purpose in there. Again if they explained why the fanservice is there, maybe I would accept that but...I don't think they did that as well. People claim Puella Magi Madoka Magica tries too hard to be edgy but at least that show has a reason to be edgy. It was edgy because the girls made naive decisions, not because they are sympathetic sues. I wouldn't call this show a ripoff of that but the problem with this show is that the creators assume death, gore and conflicts are what makes a dark show a smash hit even though it isn't so they try too hard to victimize the characters to make us sympathize with them which is the problem with most dark magical girl shows nowadays (save Yuki Yuna Is A Hero which is the only post 2010 dark magical girl anime I liked).\\n\\n\r\nThe art and soundtrack are kinda okay but I am not too bothered by it cuz...they aren't that memorable to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the enjoyment, nope. This show is trash and is not worth watching but here's a thing:\\n\\n\r\nIf you prefer shows that contain only gory and dark moments in a flashy manner, then this is for you.\\n\r\nIf you however prefer shows that have good narrative and memorable characters, then this show is a wasted potential that I don't recommend it to you.",
