Japan just never ceases to amaze me.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of having an anime about a highly oversexualized fictional wrestling sport for girls where they can only use their breasts and ass to push each other out of the ring may have sounded somewhat distasteful on paper. But Keijo actually pulls it off a lot better than I initially expected, and turned out to be a surprisingly good ecchi/comedy/sports anime as a whole, albeit a rather a ridiculous one.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, its so-called ridiculousness is also exactly what makes it successful. Keijo is a prime example of an anime which does not take itself seriously *at all*. You will legitimately have a hard time finding many anime that are less serious than this. It is fully self-aware that its concept is incredibly stupid, but it just decides to roll with it as far as it can and tries to make everything as exaggerated as humanly possible, and the sheer absurdity of it all is what makes it entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe special fighting moves these girls quite literally pull out of their asses do not only have the silliest names imaginable, but they are generally not-so-subtle parodies of other series such as One Piece, Shingeki no Kyojin, Fate/Stay Night and more, and what they actually do is just as wacky. Supersonic hip swings, machine-gun-like butt missiles, titty hypnosis, nipple judo tosses, and many other shounen-like abilities, all neatly remade into something originating from a pair of breasts or an ass. It makes no sense at all and is silly in every meaning of the word, but that is also why it is funny. Not like rolling-on-the-floor Prison School-tier of funny, but more something that will make you constantly smile and giggle at the sheer wtf factor that the show brings.\\n\\n\r\nNow that said, I still have to mention that it does not *always* come across as funny. The silly nature of the show skirts a fine line between being humorous and just being weird or awkward, and sometimes I found myself facepalming rather than laughing. Statistically speaking though, I would still say that it manages to stay funny most of the time, so it is not a huge problem. However, I also realize that it is going to be very individual regarding which scenes you will find amusing and which ones you will only find cringey depending on your sense of humour, so it is worth taking into account at least, as it could be a pretty big make-or-break factor depending on who you ask.\\n\\n\r\nComedy asides though, what else does Keijo have? Well for one, there is obviously the ecchi aspect of it. Now this is very closely tied to the comedy however so it is more or less the same thing, but basically the sexual elements of this show are not designed to be hot or romantic or anything along those lines, they are simply there to be as over-the-top and exaggerated as possible, which is what generates the comedy of the anime. In that sense, because of its absurd general feel I would honestly put Keijo closer to the likes of Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, Grand Blue, Kore wa Zombie Desu ka, Seitokai no Ichizon, Sakamoto desu ga or even Gintama rather than notorious lewd series like To LOVE-Ru or Kiss x Sis. I have even seen some people refer to it as a female version of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, there is also the sports side of Keijo. I should probably mention that I am not really a fan of sports anime in general as I find them to usually be rather predictable, and also the fact that the outcome of all the matches are scripted tends to kill most of the excitement for me. In order for me to enjoy a sports anime, it needs to do something a bit out of the ordinary. And well, Keijo sure as hell is about as out of the ordinary as it gets, so at least that part was not really a problem for me this time. I will say though that if it was not for the fact that the sport in question was so utterly ridiculous as a whole, then honestly Keijo would be a pretty typical sports anime. It still has the same general plot points like the optimistic and hardworking protagonist with a dream to be the best of the best within a particular sport, the close bonds that she forges with other hopefuls of similar interests, the constant training to improve themselves and the hurdles they have to overcome along the way, the new abilities they learn over time, the \"rival\" characters they have to compete with and one day surpass, the teams from other schools that they play against... etcetera, all of it can be found in Keijo as well. However, you do not tend to think of it as much because the silly and comedic elements of the show steal the spotlight far too much. As for whether that should be considered a good thing or a bad thing depends on personal preference, but at least for me personally I vastly prefer Keijo's absurd approach over the one of your average sports anime, no contest on that front.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what can we make of all this in the end? Well, Keijo is an anime which on paper could and arguably perhaps should have been a complete trainwreck... but it is not. It is actually a quite decent comedy anime with plenty of creativity in it to boot. Admittedly it can get a bit repetitive over time since hysterical ass attacks can only remain funny for so long, but I think you should at least be able to make it to the end of the show whilst still having an awkward grin remaining on your face, and although the animation quality does have a bit of a hard time keeping up with the fast-paced nature of the action at times, it still does not feel like a huge problem. After all, those scenes are all about being as ridiculous and exaggerated as possible rather than ever trying to be anything photorealistic. And if nothing else, Keijo's mere existence was a massive middle finger to a large portion of the SJWs all over the internet, so at the very least it definitely deserves some bonus points for that.",

            "content": "\u201cKeijo is love, Keijo is life.\u201d ---Nostradomus, French Times\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the review Keijo needs.  This is the review Keijo deserves.\u201d ---Aristotle of Greek\r\n\u201c I can\u2019t believe this was better than the new Berserk anime!!!\u201d----Me, From My Television Set \r\nI think this series is pretty above average.  In all seriousness, most of what you may have heard about Keijo can best be described as possibly over exaggerated.  Keijo is by no means a savior of anime, but contrary to popular belief Keijo is actually quite a decent series.  Truthfully this series has no right to be as good as it actually is,but there's definitely some care here.  To give you the short and sweet version, Hip Whip Girl, as the series is dubbed separates the surface level critics from the people who were willing to give this series a chance.  Let me tell you straight out, Keijo is NOT a series relying on fanservice because it can\u2019t survive on its own,  anyone who says that is either lying to you, misinformed, too serious, or God forbid the worst of all---They disagree with me (SHOCKER). I'll be honest, to the untrained or critical eye Keijo is probably just your stereotypical T.N.A bullshit, but I found in it one of the most entertaining anime this season.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, this show thrives off its ridiculousness.  Keijo is a series much a liken to franchises like Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure or Free.   The true face of Keijo is that it is actually a shonen-action and comedy series, not a harem or romance or some other crap.  It really is a good thing that this series is so self-aware too, as Keijo\u2019s charm for the most part comes simply from how damn outrageous it can get.  You\u2019ll be seeing references to other anime, attacks that make no sense, and asspulls galore (no that wasn\u2019t intentional).  What I\u2019m trying to get across to you is that this is clearly a series that had a lot  of care put into it, when it didn\u2019t need any of it.  This could have easily been a quick cash grab with no thought put into it, but that clearly wasn't the case.  Is the series the deepest show you\u2019re going to watch?  Hell no.  I think that would be fairly obvious at this point.  But the company working on this obviously had a clear interest in making an entertaining series.\\n\\n\r\nI mean what else can I say.  The art and animation are both crisp and smooth.  Everything flows so well and attacks look both astounding and even sometimes, physically painful.  The animation is not amazing mind you, but considering its only real competition this year was Drifters, Yuri on Ice, and probably Jojo\u2019s,  I think it does pretty well.  What I like the most about Keijo though is that the characters all have actual passion to play the sport.  There is no, \u201c Yeah! This was actually a harem in disguise, you don\u2019t learn about the actual sport\u201d  garbage.  NO!  There are women of all shapes and sizes, many with unique motives, powers and abilities. There\u2019s a lot of genuinely clever moments here, albeit they do require a lot of suspension of disbelief.  The girls very real interest in the sport is also quite motivating and dare I say, even a bit\u2026\u2026touching in some weird way.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, if you like shonen you can either watch Keijo or not.  If you understand that the series is all in good fun, you might find something that\u2019s actually better than just the average T.N.A.  If you just can\u2019t get past the breast and butts flying on the screen.  Regardless of how ridiculous the very concept is, this isn\u2019t the series for you.  It\u2019s kind of like One Punch Man in that regard.  You either get the joke\u2026or you don\u2019t.  In my opinion, I want to see this show continue, it made me laugh, the action scenes were legitimately good, and I wanted to see the characters succeed. Hell, I even found the intro getting stuck in my head a couple times.  Keijo may start a trend, if that\u2019s for better or worse who can say?  All in all, I say give the series a try, you never know---there\u2019s nothing to it butt to do it.  Love it or hate it, Keijo definitely turned some heads and well....... asses.\\n",

            "content": "There are some people who thinks anime can be good in only one way. If it's deep and thought provoking, whatever that means to them. These people tend to underrate everything light hearted and despise fan-service shows. Well this is hell for these snobs and elitists.\r\nBecause what Keijo!!!!!!!! actually is? It is a fan-service show, but that's just a cover. It's a satire of the shounen sports genre. Those sport series, where the games are dominated by some legendary players with super powers. For that, we get an insanely stupid sport, a butt and breast wrestling. And this was the first catch. A fan-service heavyshow can easily go awkward from where the comedy doesn't work. There are a lot of shows like that. Keijo is not one of them, it manages to be consistently hilarious. The fan-service is incorporated into the plot so well that it's always feels natural.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story goes, it's basically a regular underdog tale. A bunch of freshmen starts attending this butt wrestling school, because everything has a dedicated high school in Japan. Our heroines start to sharpening their skills through a lot of mock matches and ridiculous training sessions, while every one of them discovers a special move. As for characters, we get the heroes of these kinds of stories, but even further exaggerated, with the same goal, they want to be professionals. And in context of the series, they are working splendidly.\\n\\n\r\nFor the production quality, I have no complaints. There are some moments where they didn't get the CG right and the characters go off model, but over all, as far as design and technical quality goes, it's definitely strong in this season, and considering how flashy the matches are, it's amazing how they kept up the quality without inserting too much cheap budget saving scenes, like another sports series of this season did.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime is not for everyone. This show is dumb, but it meant to be dumb, it wants to be dumb and it's proud of it. The ones who will appreciate it the most are the ones who're somewhat deep into the medium and seen some series this makes fun of and seen the biggest hits of the past few years, because Keijo is really heavy in references. It's an easy on the mind show with high entertainment value. I recommend it to everyone who has an open mind.",

Alright men (and ladies, if you're into that sort of thing), let's jump in to this pool of ass-ridden glory! \r\n*...I need a thesaurus*\r\nWell, the season is coming to an end soon, and so is this crazy ass year. We had our first orange president, the internet collectively got more PC than ever before, and best of all, we got Rogue One, the best movie of the year. So, what better way to end it than with the Jojo's Bizzzare Adventure of sports anime...butwith loads of crazy ass fan service. I may have a little but of bias towards this show. I AM just a filthy male! So, did this booty-licious romp pay off? Well, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nBasically, this is an underdog sports story about 4 girls training to be accepted as elites and eventually, being true pride to their school: a school that teaches KEIJO!!!!!!!! You need a lot to truly make this kind of story stand out, and unfortunately, this is Keijo's (not very) fatal flaw. Despite all of the amounts of tits and ass in full, glorious display here, the story beats present don't necessarily come off as new, and since some things (like ass pull power-ups, how after almost a year in which part of the training regimen is sit-ups, very few of them have ass, the way our final opponent changes hair due to personality change despite that that's now how that works, how in the finale, Nozomi spams a dangerous attack multiple times but feels no pain, how they often forget that they can use their boobs to attack since the only two things you're allowed to use are the tits and dah bootay, etc) make no sense, even for the show's logic, I gotta put aside my manly urges and knock this story down a peg. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, some of the things that happen here are...unique. No only does this show have some puny ass arcs, but the powers can definitely be creative. I mean, Gate of Bootylan? Butt-tack on Titan ? This show makes more bouts of bad puns than Yang from RWBY, and that is saying a lot. Also, sometimes, just to mix things up, they make one of our protagonists lose in a way that feels downright unfair (Aoba in episode 10). Plus, the major tone-shift in the first half of episode 12 can give such a whiplash, that if it was directed at my ass, that booty would be red as hell. I also wish that there would've been some buildup to the Ease and West War tournament that takes up the last 1/3 of the series. However, let it not be said that I like the sheer escalation of events. With each arc, the protagonists make it by the skin of their teeth, but each arc's obstacles are much more kickass and brutal than that of the previous one. Plus, as the series goes on, the absurdity of these crazy ass moves increases exponentially, and to glorious results in each of the battles in the last 4 episodes. It's ridiculous. It's absurd. It's...not enough to save the story all things considered, despite how tragic some of the characters' pasts (like Maya) can be, and how nice the ending is. Now, off with that boring ass thing we call: reasonable criticism. This is KEIJO!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNozomi is a hot-blooded protagonist that ends up having to work her butt off just to keep up with each new groundbreaking opponent, ad she is a total romp! I especially love the fact that instead of the classic protagonist motivations (I wanna be stronger, I wanna be the best), she just wants to be rich. Sayaka is a rival of hers who wants approval of her father while keeping up with her peers, no matter how much stress and offense she takes in the process. Aoba starts off really shy, but though her effed up powers and acceptance by her peers, she becomes much more confident. Plus, the lucky sod gets all the ass! Non is your cutely and clumsy big tittied gal, but instead of just hurting herself with her clumsiness, she puts everyone through hell, both through near-death accidents, or knocking coffee on a white bed. Then, she has the nerve to make all sorts of excuses justifications in an attempt at bravado. My favorite thing about these girls is the fact that they actually have dialects! How many times have you seen an anime that does that with its MCs.  It does this with Maya as well, but we'll get to that lovely lady in a bit. \\n\\n\r\nMio is probably my favorite character. She is a total lech (have you SEEN how she gets around cute girls?!), more so than most men of this archethype, but she is also one of the ultimate badasses this this show. She is the crux of some pf the funniest moments of the show (like her few second of punishment in episode 5). Not to mention, that she is the most beautiful, and fight me IRL if you disagree! I would definitely want a piece of her ass in bed! Well, not really, but she is my favorite here. Then we have a few quirky characters like Kawai (sinister in battle, but a total romantic dork), Kotone (lover of gay hentai), Saya (swordsman-like beauty who shows up in episode 11 for a badass moment of awesome) Usagi (fangirl of Mio, and possibly lesbo for her), Yuko ( who, along with Aoba, has the curse of just never being able to win) Nagisa (our coach who was once a pro at this sport, as well as Nozomi's predator of the Butt Vacuum Wave technique), Kyoko (badass teacher and Kyoto's butt missile lady), and Rin (overconfident, but, umm, she doesn't have any real quirks). Some are more interesting than others, but (and they all have big butts) they are generally a very endearing cast with plenty of life in them.\\n\\n\r\nMaya is an interesting one. Undoubtedly the second most beautiful mistress here, she is originally mysterious (not without accidentally revealing her crazy dialect that pops up on occasion), and with a rushed yet harsh past. She fights for her mama (who coaches a rival school) due to said mama being the first to accept her, and she even has a harsher alternate personality hell-bent on protecting her and her ass, while being a bit more violent, shall we say. Unfortunately, none of her peers are nearly as interesting aside from their powers. Well, let it not be said that they made for some epic fights.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nXebec is famous for their work on the tit and ass filled romp known as To Love-RU. Well, they definitely brought their expertise to this show. It is loaded with that stuff! Plus, the action is pretty cool to look at, and the rough outlines make this show's look stick out, like a competitor's ass while wearing one of these swimsuits. It makes sure that the hits that connect are all hard-hitting, and full of impact. Unfortunately, the CGI in some moments (like the KEIJO lands in the first few episodes) is utter ass! That being said, this show truly embraces its insanity, with the art being no exception. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP, \"DREAM x SCRAMBLE\" by AIRI is energetic as hell, and with the proper amount of T&A to really set the tone for this series. We can't forget the song that takes up the rump of each episode, the ED. Today, we have \"Fantas/HIP Girlfriends!\" by the VA's of our main 4 ladies, and it is a delightfully cheery song to cool us off after the as(s)inine experience we just went through. Too bad literally none of the background OST was remotely memorable! Such a shame, too. The dub is pretty good here. The kept the dialect of these kooky characters, and with some mostly well-casted fresh new talent to take up the mains while standout veterans like Monica Rial (who plays Hitomi) pepper some of the supporting roles to help out with the quality just in case. It's a pretty solid dub, which is an absolute necessity for us foreigners who wanna hear our lovely ladies in a less foreign language.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSome of the jokes got a bit old, and I did have a few big questions, but, as I said, this show busted its rump to bring us a fun ol' time here. It was a blast to see just how crazy each new event would get, reminding me of my time with Gurren Lagann, which is a good thing to be reminded of. The fights could get really freakin' fun, and I found myself laughing my ass off at some of the jokes and weird sh*t that went on here (not always for the right reasons, but hey, it worked). Sure, it wasn't truly epic for me, and I could've covered its ground a bit better so assholes like me would stop asking questions, but it was still a good time. Plus, the second half of the ending really put an endeared smile on my face. Then again, I am just a filthy male :P\\n\\n\r\nT&A: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNozomi, Mio ,and Maya alone brought this up to a 10. Their legendary selves are just, well, legendary. Kawai and Kyoko being up high up as well. Plus, each girl uses their tits and asses in creative ways and to crazy effects. It's captivating how well this anime mastered this art. Then again, this anime IS the pinnacle of class.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7/10    RAW SCORE: 72/100\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is truly a romp of 2016 that will be remember for a long time. With its crazy moves, its absurd fan service, and its sheer tenASSity, all our gripes with the Fall 2016 season have been rendered superfluous. Besides, as Suave from AnimeAbandon puts it: \"The 13 year-old in me thinks this is hilarious and dumb, and at the end of the day, that's all we really asked for.\" Well, with all that said, with this final word count, I bid you adieu.\\n\\n\r\nWord Count: I don't know.

On the surface, Keijo looks like a typical anime about fights with boobs and butts, but I found more meaning into this anime, and in reality, its actually a masterpiece. \r\nStory 10/10: If you look at the story and set everything aside, it is thought out REALLY well. The anime starts off with our hyper-energetic MC trying to enter the elite class, she fights her own classmates and at that point, the viewer is like \"Go Nozomi! bringher overboard!\" and you develop a minor hatred for those that the MC verses and hope that they lose. Now the second half of the anime, those characters who you once hoped for to lose are now the ones you hope to win. Without any cheesy cliche anime logic, the enemy is now the MC's friend. (well they were in the same school the entire time) This is what made me realize that Keijo is more than just fanservice with boobs and butts, it actually has an amazing story to it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: In most Ecchi anime, people complain about the fanservice taking over and ruining the actual anime. In Keijo, the fight scenes and serious tension of the battle actually takes away from the fanservice. Now this is good since nothing ruins the show, the fanservice becomes a side thing to make the anime even better. In the final battle, i didnt even care about the fact all the girls were in swimsuits, i just wanted them to win, it was so tense. Secondly, the combat scenes in Keijo are better than most action anime i seen. Everything from the other-worldy color flashes to the powerful moves these characters pulls off, the combat scenes are the BEST i have ever seen, and yes i have watched Fate. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: Adding on to the combat scenes, the sounds are top notch, perfectly placed and completely appropriate. When Sayaka uses her W-Acceleration, those sonic boom sounds really emphasis her speed and brings a feeling of epicness to the viewers. With every Vacuum butt cannon by our MC, we hear a loud sound almost as if an explosion, this perfectly chosen sound shows off our MC's power. All the sound effects are perfect. Now the Intro and the Outro, I loved them both so much that im currently working on an osu! beatmap for the ending song. I can't find any flaws to them. The OP and ED are great. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: Do I even need to say anything about this? The anime tried to be unique with the art, do what no one has ever done. Mix in manly Jojo shading with Moe. The result, was perfect. Keijo's art style is unique and just beautiful. The Moe is still there to show they are cute girls and the manly shading is there too to show off their power during a battle. The mini pauses to display move names is done so pefectly too, its like a Jojo stand, but moe and better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Kanaze wins best girl of this anime. GATE OF BOOTYLON! Not only that, every girl has their own special butt super power, it gives a nice distinction between everyone. As I explained in the \"Story\" section, the anime can make u hate a character but then love them later on, anime that do that always has good character development. In the end, you will even start to like some of the characters on the other school. In an anime like Keijo, you would not expect there to be any backstory, but nope, Sayaka's backstory is in there and it makes a great point. It greatly adds to the tension of the first battle in the east-west war. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: Best anime of the year, and next. Please be season 2. \\n",

            "content": "Imagine for a moment that you're a recent graduate of a prestigious art school in Japan. You land your big boy job at a studio known for their terrible ecchi adaptations. Months of slavishly working late nights pass, drawing frames for trashy harem comedies after garbage light novel adaptations, and all the magic and wonder of animation has been replaced with a visceral hatred and complacency; because, face it, you can always quit and get a lower paying job drawing hentai. \r\nYou get a promotion, all of a sudden you're key animating, and life gets a little better. The next day, the first thing thatdrops on your brand new mahogany desk is a manilla folder. Your line director tells you that you need to draw frames for a dynamic action sequence where a swimsuit clad girl slams her cooch down into another scantily clad girl's face before performing a movie that would make Mortal Kombat cringe: an \"Ass Guillotine\". You're told that the show is called \"Keijo!!!!!!!!\", with 8 exclamation points. \\n\\n\r\nAnd people wonder why karoushi is particularly high among animators. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Keijo begins with the butt and ends with the butt\\n\r\nAnd so did any possibility of this anime being anything other than pathetic, titillating fanservice with the utterance of that line. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems like every year, right around Christmas time, we're given gifts. Some gifts are good, useful, and necessary in our lives- like when I got my bicycle. I was elated, it was useful, and I still cherish it, because it keeps my ass from having to walk! \\n\\n\r\nAnd then at the other end of the spectrum, that weirdo at work or school gets your name for secret santa and gives you some useless piece of crap like a duct taped ball of change, someone's Pottery 1001 class final project, an electric can opener, and some used deodorant. I mean, imagine waking up on Christmas morning to find you got a new computer, a new phone, a new car, and oh... a Keijo dvd... who gave me that? \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, much like herpes, Keijo was a gift that kept on giving this season, too. Boy, did it ever give- but mostly just what it stole from other anime. My biggest criticism of Keijo is certainly that it has not one original thought in its disgustingly voluptuous body. I just reviewed Akame and bashed it for misappropriating setpieces and scenes from other anime, and Keijo takes this to 11, with the least amount of tact and taste possible. Half the characters are just reincarnations of Jojo characters- down to the sound effects and power abilities (stop time, ORAORAORA, take your pick, it's in there), rips from Fist of the North Star, Fate Stay Night (replace GIlgamesh's noble fantasm with butts, how original), Attack on Titan, and a myriad other hamfisted \"references\" that you could file under fanservice as well. \\n\\n\r\nSee, the problem with Keijo isn't that it's just a stupid tournament panty fighter like Ikkitousen, the problem is that it shows all of its cards way too early, dissolves tension, and gives all of its characters the Code Geass treatment of way too many fanservicey butt and boob shots to the detriment of the fight. Panty fighters can be funny and still have a semblance of a story, like Butt Attack Punisher Girl. Panty fighters can be narrow, shameless and tasteless displays of female sex objects too- which is what Keijo falls under. \\n\r\nTo the tension dissolving point- we see every character's \"SUPER ULTRA MEGA MONSTER\" move within the first few episodes. You know that they have the ability within them, and that they're only going to use it right at the climax of the battle when all looks lost- swoop in and save the day, ride off into the sunset, the end, everyone wins, power of friendship! \\n\r\nTake for instance, Jotaro from Jojo part 3. In the beginning, his Star Platinum ability is barely controllable, and while still strong, beatable by many early opponents. The nefarious DIO shows that he has the power to stop time with ZA WARUDO right at the beginning- but his ability to do so also grows. When the final battle comes, not only has Jotaro learned new abilities, but he also pulls one out of the hat that we didn't expect, though it fits in perfectly with the show, enabling him to do what I said before- swoop in and claim victory from the jaws of defeat. Keijo? You learn the super move day 1, use it to win in every battle afterwards. That's neither interesting nor fun to watch, it's just a matter of taking bets on when it's coming. \\n\\n\r\nYou know, if you rearrange the letters in Keijo, you can get another world that describes it better... Kojei: which means shit in Okinawan. \\n\\n\\n\r\nKeijo is like a bad gag gift. Some gag gifts can be funny, because they put the recipient in a situationally funny or embarrassing position in front of a bunch of people, like getting some sexy underwear and a dildo. Except you're a guy. And the lingerie won't fit. So what do you do? You just throw that shit in the trash, and move on with your life, just like Keijo.\\n",

            "content": "Originally with 500+ upvotes, my review is back. \r\nWhat does it mean to \"save anime?\"\r\nFor years, humans and otaku alike have presented the concept that an upcoming or airing series can rescue the medium of Japanese animation from its own self-wrought destruction. I've viewed this line of thinking with a grain of salt, for the obvious reason that, well, anime can't be saved, it's irredeemable at this point.\r\nBut what if it could be saved?\r\nWhat if we could end this cycle of bad karma?\r\nBut what could do it? What could save anime?\r\nA new Trigger romp with experimental animation and another iteration on Gunbuster's coming of agestory? Noble effort, Imaishi, but you can only go so far. Panty&amp;Stocking was but a deflated life vest lost in the sea of moe-colored urine. Luluco, despite being anime of the year, also failed to resonate and return these Chinese cartoons to their original purity.\\n\\n\r\nA fresh romp from acclaimed director Cowboy \"Watanabe\" Bebop? Sadly no, Terror in Resonance offered less hope than Obama, while Space Dandy offered as much substance as our future emperor Donald J. Trump. (Editor's note: nailed it. )\\n\\n\r\nMaybe one of the murderers who killed anime could do it. Could Geass' Taniguchi come back and deliver us something as good as his magnum opus, Scryed? No, we got Active Raid instead. Sunrise's Cross Ange was definitely saving anime for a while, but petered out in the end. \\n\\n\r\nAll hope appeared to be lost. But. What if... What if a series went the opposite route? What if it took everything that killed anime, and went so far into it that it looped around on itself and became the cure? What if derivative, pandering trash like Angel Beats pandered so hard that it smashed right through its target audience of lowlifes and became High Art?\\n\\n\r\nWell, we're going to find out. You're 1000 words into this review (for the second fucking time thanks MAL) and now you're going to learn about\\n\\n\r\n~ * ~ KEIJO!!!!!!!! ~ * ~\\n\\n\r\nKEIJO!!!!!!!! is an action series about dedication and fighting spirit, but it's more than that: it's a story about one girl's dream to get fuckin' paid. Yeah, the series is about this Blue Hair girl who graduated high school and wants to get paid by beating other girls' faces in with her ass. She has a friend, White Hair, who is a judo master that can attack with her ass at supersonic speed. Another friend, Udders, has an ass so soft that it deflects oncoming trains, and the last friend, Hairtail, can judge an opponent's power level by feeling their ass.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the series is about some kind of sport where young martial artists and gymnasts fight with their hips or something. It's more or less just a device to push the narrative of \"hard works gets you mad dollars\", much like all those other sports anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nThe show delivers this soft-hitting (editor's note: LOL) premise with great production values. Character animation and fight choreography are right out of goddamn Hajime no Ippo or Gurren Lagann. The animation uses varying line thicknesses for foreground and background during fights, giving the series a very hand-animated look at points, and the cinematography is phresh. The shots are dynamic and interesting to look at, along with great use of ON-SCREEN WORDS popularized by Panty&amp;Stocking/Kill la Kill, JoJo, etc. KEIJO!!!!!!!! carries great energy and timing into almost every scene, making it both not-boring, and funny.\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER after the first 7-8 episodes the art and animation kind of falls off a cliff, which is a damn shame, since that's right around when the climactic final tournament starts. It's most evident in the final episode, which is easily the worst-looking in the series. Luckily, the usual absurdity of what's happening still saves the show and keeps it very compelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters' abilities and fighting styles are about as fleshed out (editor's note: LOL) as any fighting shounen series, but it's all presented with an amazing sense of facetiousness. You can tell the team behind this show was having a lot of fun putting a nearly uncalled for level of thought into the reasoning and presentation of the action sequences. Special techniques all have fabulous names with accompanying ~extreme on-screen text~ - it's very cool and creative. The source material was ridiculous, but more grounded, whereas is the anime goes full ham.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is great. The anime skips the first half of the manga or so and settles right in on the meaty competition portion of the story, and moves along at great speed. Characters and concepts are introduced quickly, and even though you technically miss 40 chapter of content, you don't actually notice because the writers for the show were competent enough to know how to adapt the material to best fit the medium.\\n\\n\r\nI've grown to really like the OST for this show. Opening is catchy, and the accompanying animation is very much amusing enough. There are some very hammy emotional/background tracks that stand out during climactic scenes. The sound design though: That's where this show shines. KEIJO!!!!!!!! uses sound in some pretty unique ways that are genuinely hilarious. You'll hear mechanical sounds, explosions, energy pulses and everything in between when various ass-centric attacks are used, and during combat every fight in this series is full of other varied and exaggerated impact sounds.\\n\\n\r\nSo, is this how one saves anime?\\n\r\nDoes this series do what none before it could?\\n\\n\r\nYes.",

            "content": "Keijo (insert 8 exclamation points) is an over-the-top ecchi show featuring women with large tits and assess attempting to used said assets to beat the everlasting hell out of each other. At first, this show sounds like it could be pretty fun and indeed it was for the first couple of episodes. The sheer insanity and silliness of it all certainly made for an entertaining watch especially since the show never took itself seriously in the slightest and each of these girls had their own super powered attack using their butts which kind of reminded me of JoJo of all things. However, just like theanime Ben-to, it starts off pretty promising for a rule-of-cool anime with a lot of over-the-top action sequences but fails at this since it becomes repetitive and the characters are not interesting enough to hold it all together.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the narrative is something that has been done a million times before to much better effect. It's a basic story of a girl who wants to become the best in her field, and in this context, the best ass and tit champion. She joins a school, makes new friends, proves herself in competitions, moves up the ranks, learns new moves and then fights stronger and stronger enemies. It's a very basic linear story that doesn't try to do anything new nor is all too memorable after you've finished watching the series. It's hard to find investment in the narrative and characters surrounding said story since the characters are hard to latch onto and remain one dimensional throughout the show. None of them really do all too much or do anything interesting nor go through any arcs as people. At the most, the only thing that does develop in terms of characters is the size of their assess (there's a sentence I never thought I would say). The fights, which can be entertaining in their own rights, lack any sort of investment or engagement since I never cared for a single character in the entire show. Everyone is a cardboard cut-out of an existing archetype and everyone is defined by the size of their breasts or the size of their butt. While some of the characterisations is okay and can lead into some genuinely fun moments these were still few and far between. There isn't all too much time invested in any character and whenever a new character is introduced they're normally pushed to the side after their initial introduction and left to remain stagnant. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm not expecting deep, groundbreaking themes in a show that is trying to be full of tits and ass with nothing else but I feel as if there were some things in the narrative which could have been expanded on and made into interesting ideas. One such example was in the case of Sayaka's father, a man who was new to this bizarre new sport. This could have provided us with a new perspective on this world and could have led into themes of sexualisation of women and the such but it is glossed over so quickly leading to no development in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nSince the fan-service is such a big part of this show I think I will address this now. I have nothing against fan-service in shows, in fact, some of my favourite anime have fan-service elements but when that's all your show has it comes across as a desperate plea to be noticed and the show feels trashy since it can't stand on its own two feet without the inclusion of a boob shot every five minutes. Now, it's obvious that the show is only meant to be enjoyed as a guilty pleasure; a show in which you're supposed to switch your mind off and just laugh at the idea of seeing women in tight swimsuits beating the crap out of each other with their tits and this is fine of its own since I believe this show does achieve its aim of being a cheesy light-hearted fan-service show. In fact, there were many times in which I was generally having fun with the show with the insane logic and attacks these girls were able to throw out. However, while there were plenty of moments in which I was entertained, this is also met with many moments in which I was bored and uninterested in what was going on, in particular during the training segments and during some of the forced character backstories which felt more like a lazy way for the writer to create emotion rather than building it up slowly which would be more impactful. The show does start off pretty fun but slowly degenerates into a dull and uninteresting mess since the novelty of the show begins to wear off for me since there were no interesting characters to root for nor anything worthwhile in the narrative. Now, I'm sure there are people who were entertained from start to finish with this show, which is fine, but I was not. I found the entire experience to be more tiresome than fun by the end since it felt like a chore to watch each and every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was pretty consistent and I liked some of the character designs too. As I've said, some of the killer attacks could be funny in their absurdity and the animation and art design do a good job at conveying this. It's clear that the staff put their sole attention into making every ass and pair of tits look as great as possible and for an ecchi oriented show, it does look pretty well done. The music was okay, and I did like the opening and ending tracks for this anime, albeit nothing amazing or too spectacular. \\n\r\nKeijo (insert 8 exclamation points) is clearly a series that serves to the lowest common denominator and thinks that slapping a bunch of tits on the screen will be enough to warrant the show to be 'fun'. While there were a couple of times I was having fun, it wasn't a substantial amount of time to raise the bar and I can't even argue in favour the notion that I should see this show as nothing more than a guilty pleasure.\\n\\n\r\n In order for Keijo (insert 8 exclamation points) to work, it needed to have stronger and more interesting characters and to have done more with its premise; which it didn't. I can only recommend this to you if you're a hardcore ecchi fan since there are so many better shows out there for you to enjoy that actually take the time to develop characters while still having a lot of ass and tits. I would imagine watching this show incredibly drunk with friends could be fun, however...\\n\\n\r\n(Part of LIQfilms 12 Days of Christmas - Day 9)",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nWith no less than 8 exclamation marks in the title, how could you possibly go wrong?\r\nKeijo is universally regarded as the dumbest anime of 2016. It is everything Miyazaki warned about anime becoming an \"inside joke\" by otaku for otaku. It doesn't have a creative bone in its body and simply spoofs other shonen anime cliches. Even the concept of the sport \"Keijo\" was shamelessly stolen from a minigame in the videogame Dead or Alive. That's why DoA is now doing a Keijo DLC in Japan and Studio Xebec is allowing them to use their characters.\r\nI admit I went into this anime wanting to hateit. I wanted to bash this casual filth...yet I found myself actually laughing at its stupidity and relentlessly awful puns. There is a reason people have begun calling this series \"JoJo's Bizarre Assventure\". It is everything we ironically love about JoJo only with tits and asses sprinkled on top. It is so headbashingly retarded and over the top it actually outdoes JoJo itself at times. The spoofs and references to other anime are in the dozens for every episode. Even Gintama has a hard time competing with Keijo on that front. Keijo isn't a brilliant satire. It isn't a marvelous deconstruction. It is simply stupid for the sake of stupid and...I actually have a hard time hating it.\\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is that there is a new sport and form of legalized gambling called Keijo. Women must use their tits and asses to try knock each other off inflatable rafts and into the water. Our main character is a blockhead who lives to fight and enjoys 3 things: food, the thrill of combat, and making friends. She also is one of VERY few shonen main characters to speak with a Kansai dialect. She trains with weighted clothing and shoots a blue laser out of her butt. Gee, can you guess which character she is supposed to be a copy of? We also have the tsundere strategist character, the ditz with massive tits, and the Yuki Nagato/Rei Ayanami ripoff. All episodes are laughably predictable in their outcomes, but they are supposed to be.\\n\r\nWe get all the shonen cliches like: Tournament Fights, Training Episodes, and some of the most gratuitous and idiotic fanservice you can imagine.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot and characters are cliche as hell, but that is honestly the point. It doesn't want to be anything other than a bare boned spoof for people to laugh at. What makes Keijo watchable is HOW the show is presented rather than the substance itself. The way they change the fight styles to mock JoJo and use the \u30b4\u30b4\u30b4\u30b4 Kanji and spelled out attack names. The purple butt laser vs blue butt laser to reference the first Kamehameha vs. Galick Gun battle from DBZ. The HORRIBLE puns like \"Walls of Bootylan\" and \"Asstronomy class\" that are spread thick across every episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Music:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is surprisingly some of the best that Studio Xebec has ever done and the soundtrack is actually...GOOD?! The soundtrack is done by the same guy who did the various JoJo anime and Hellsing Ultimate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nKeijo is a stupid anime. It won't change your outlook on life with its existential pondering. It won't make you rethink your ethics or question your values. It won't move you to tears with its beautiful art or open your intellectual curiosity with its surrealism. Despite all of this, it is surprisingly watchable crap that is simply so stupid you owe it to yourself to at least see a few episodes. My point is not to be a diehard defender of this series. If you hate Keijo then good for you. Maybe I'm being unfair for being so light on Keijo. Maybe if it were regarded as highly as Gintama or Kill la Kill I would feel better about shitting on it. For whatever reason, I embarrassingly enjoyed this piece of shit and maybe you might too.",

(I don't watch much ecchi anime) \r\nStory 10/10 \r\nI love the pacing of this anime , slow and steady which allow you to learn more about the environment which is mostly focusing on the MC that her dream is to bethe best keijo player to become the prize quuen so that her family will be in a better state , (she will use the money to help them because she came from a poor family).It was that moment you cheer for nozomi and hope for the opponnent to lose is like yeah go nozomi! In the beginning and when the anime reaches its climax after all the fighting you realize the meaning of respect and frienship with your opponents as you bow and shred tears after a fight.That is true sportsmanship is in this anime although it present itself as a sport of boobs and butts which I call B&B it is more to that since everyone has their own talent/skill pretty much like Kuroko no basket without the ecchi. With or without the eechi/fan service this piece of anime works for me so I'd give it a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt 8.8/10 \\n\r\nPretty much the same like most of the anime out there with hand drawn style which I like .\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nDon't you love the sound of sonic booom when jets goes supersonic you can hear it here and its pretty epic and fits well with the fights as well as all the other skills that the girls use such as the vacuum butt canon \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nEasily enjoyable and lovable characters that is easy to understand and each has their own traits which makes them cute or badass in away that makes the character progression smooth \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nRewatched for the 3rd time with my cousins and she rewatched twice Rewatch/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nWas a winner in making people laugh in 2k16 and the best in the season let's hope for it to have another season. Like and old man saying \"If its stupid and it works it ain't stupid\" to the author who came out with this hilarious idea that none can think off you got yourself a customer :)",

            "content": "TL;DR: Boobs, Butts, Bliss. Do I need to say more? \r\nKeijo, an anime marketed as an ecchi sports shounen anime, didn\u2019t need to rely on the usual \u201cplot\u201d to stay afloat as one of the top animes of 2016. The anime is outrageous. The best part is that the director knows it as well and doesn\u2019t shy away from abusing that factor. Keijo is a sport about pushing people off floating platforms using your boobs or butts. How can a show like this keep the audience captivated for an entire season? If you think it was the typical \u201canime plot\u201d that kept the audience hooked,well you are partially right, but it was more so the originality and making mockery of previous shounen animes that kept everyone entertained. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple and as straight forward as any other sport animes. You have a girl, Nozomi, who wants to be the very best that no one ever was. She will train harder than anyone and believe it she shall. Each adversaries she comes across, she faces with full determination and moves on. Through the power of friendship from her amigos, she will learn the OP Boob/Butt moves and have fun. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters surprisingly stand out from each other. They have unique characteristics and each of the characters bring their own set of skills and OP moves (parody of anime attacks, most notable include Booty of Babylons and Buttocks on Titan) that just makes you laugh and appreciate a good mockery of the sports shounen genre. From one ridiculous OP villains to the next (much like Naruto) the battle never ends. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is a blend of CGI and hand-drawn characters that gives it vibrant feeling to the anime as a whole. The music score accompanying it does its job phenomenally. Both the OP & ED songs are energetic enough to reflect the mood of this anime. They knew how to reveal just the right amount but not too much, almost as if teasing the audience to keep coming back for more. And for more (fan service) you shall return, I guarantee. \\n\\n\r\nJokes aside, when jumping into the world of Keijo, keep an open mind if you wish to really have fun with this anime. Do not take it seriously and just know that it\u2019s an outrageous anime whose main purpose is to make the audience react to its absurdity. If you look at it critically it has several flaws like plot armour, lack of logic and jokes getting overused.  However, it will still wow you with sheer amounts of bizarre unpredictability. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you want to watch an \u201cecchi\u201d show but can still tell your friends that you watched a sports shounen with comedy vibes like OPM & MP100, definitely give it a shot. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. I\u2019m always open to criticism and suggestions and I hope you found this short but supaishi review helpful. \\n",

            "content": "Keijo is a genuinely fun, unique and most importantly \"asstounding\" title. Bad English puns everybody, LeaderTGW (the greatest warriors) always provides them!\r\nBoobs & asses fighting it out on a small floating platform in water in a ridiculous game\u2026 well, sport that only the Japanese could possibly conceive. Keijo was definitely the transition anime needed this year. A break from those magical school battle harem titles, and the \u201coriginal\u201d (Sarcasm*) trapped in a fantasy world or video game titles. Keijo's story is simple, consistent, and most importantly it works. The plot is straight-forward and for the most part follows the original sources story. There are smallbreaks in the story however, these are necessary sub plots filled with training, backstories, and fan service. All necessary in order to keep the story refreshing and engaging.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this story so unique? So appealing? That isn't related to boobs and asses. I'd say that it's the pacing as well as the characters determination to be great at the tournaments. As many before me have already mentioned, the anime skips a few chapters of the manga, and this choice in direction improves the pacing. In addition to this change, I\u2019ve also noticed that some dialogue is cut too. Perhaps a change needed to focus more on action. The intensity and determination of the characters keeps the show interesting. The girls have a goal, and they're willing to subject themselves to weird \"ass\" training methods in order to improve their skill.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the fan-service. Personally I didn't feel that the fan service was rewarding enough. I'm not saying that it's bad; it's just that there was a lack of nudity, and sex appeal. I felt that the direction the fan-service leaned on was comedic rather than erotic. They had to force sexy moments rather than having them happen naturally, and honestly that took some of the pleasure away from the show.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, what was it about Keijo\u2019s story that made me happy? It was perhaps the most \"fun\" title that I've seen in a long time. Over the top explosions and blast from asses that aren't fart related, the action was intense. Overall the story wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought it was going to be. It provided enough entertainment and pleasure for an ecchi title.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Keijo\u2026 Oh boy. Character designs are awful! The character outlines to be more specific. They remind me of a bad vectoring job or rendering done in either Illustrator or Inkscape. The outlines look pixelated and the strokes are disgusting to see with their movements. This took away quality from the action scenes (Special moves) on platforms. A majority of the time, the outlines looked way too big! Hair on a majority of the girls was for the most part poorly done. Hair in anime is always unique and often times define a characters personality and appeal. While the personality part sticks with the character designs in Keijo, the appeal is appalling.\\n\r\n I felt like they went overboard with hair designs. Nozomi's hair in particular reminds me of a cockroach with those hideous antennae. There are way too many character design flaws in keijo and that really hurt the 7/10 score I wanted to give it. As an artist who loves to do vectors and renders it was a complete eyesore looking at the designs.\\n\\n\r\nBackground settings and the environment were surprisingly nice to look at. Water and waves would obviously be the eye catcher. Other things featured in the show like plantations and farms looked pretty nice too.\\n\r\nSpecial effects were amazing. Over the top as I had mentioned earlier. What I enjoy most was that the effects were able to captivate me as well as the manga\u2019s effects did. Special move were great despite the hideous character animation that often followed. Now the subtitles were bad in terms of localizing. I watched Keijo via CrunchyRoll and boy was that a mistake.  I\u2019d say about 85% of the changes that were made, were incredibly cringe-worthy and hurt the quality. In all honesty though, it\u2019s better than nothing. Overall I felt that the animation was vibrant and intense.\\n\\n\r\nIn the sound department, I felt that the voice actors were able to do an excellent job making battles intense and exciting with all their yelling. To be honest, it seemed like with the way the new voice actors dropped their lines, it is as if they were told by the voice director to watch 90\u2019s shounen anime to get an idea on how their character should yell out special moves! Needless to say, I am impressed. Sound effects were about a silver. For the most part I noticed that they were recycled like most are. Lastly, the opening and ending songs. I cannot say that I was impressed with them. They fit the theme of the show and unfortunately that\u2019s about all I can add.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall feelings for the show were low were I first started it. I expected nothing special to come of this series. It was only when I finally decided to read the reactions of others that I finally sat down and gave the show a watch. To my amazement the show is pretty solid and well-polished. As I said earlier there are various changes that could\u2019ve been done to make the visuals look better however, despite how unhappy I was with the designs, the action and comedy is what eventually allowed me to accept Keijo as an 8/10 anime. Overall I was very impressed with Keijo.\\n",

            "content": "I didn't really want to watch Keijo at the beginning of the Fall 2016 season. It looked dumb.\r\nAnd that's really what Keijo has going for it. It is dumb. It is the stupidest idea I have ever heard. Girls have to compete only using their breasts and butts to attack other competitors. Nobody can tell me that that isn't the dumbest thing.\r\nKeijo is everything that is wrong with anime. And it is parody gold at its finest. I'm not going to claim that this was the author's intent or that he's a genius for making this show. I couldn't care less what he thinks. Theshow is played so painfully straight that it parodies itself.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is why Keijo is such comedy gold. The competitors take this sport seriously. The audience takes it seriously. There are sports announcers covering it play-by-play and there is an instance where an instant replay is used to judge the outcome of the match.\\n\\n\r\nGirls shout out shounen based attacks that are based off video games and anime. Since they use nothing but their breasts and butts in the attacks, it just crescendos into the most lulzworthy moments where characters utilize attacks like the *shoryucans*.\\n\\n\r\nI really would have hated Keijo in any other context. I don't think the studio that picked it up really put that much thought into it either. The artwork suffers from what appears to be some anti-aliasing effect, which for a hand drawn show is just a \"da fuq\" moment. I'm sure with their vast catalog of ecchi shows they simply saw something with tits and ass and figured, \"looks legit and right up our alley.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhat they produced, however, was one of the best anime comedies of 2016.",

            "content": "With the sure-fire moneymaking genre of in-your-face ecchi anime that attempts to make guys wet their pants, combined with the trend of many sports anime that make girls wet their pants, the anime universe decided to fuse these 2 recipes of success into one. And thus, \u2018\u2019Keijoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u2019\u2019 was born. In this show, Tits and Ass (From now on will be known as T/A as I will be mentioning this a lot) go into a battle royale, pounding against each other in more than a hundred ways with the objective of knocking the bikini-clad girls off a platform to ultimately decide which female has the ultimate\u2018assets\u2019 that could win them a huge tonne of money. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSince this show has a plot regarding \u2018plots\u2019, it naturally divides fans into two camps: The former who think that this show is just a generic borderline hentai that shoves T/A every 5 seconds and thus having a non-existent storyline and cardboard characters, and the latter who are unafraid to claim that they love the T/A so much that this show is a Godsend. Though I share the sentiments of both camps, as the show goes on I came to realize that I am surprisingly, sitting on the fence here. Without a doubt, the show\u2019s concept of using T/A as a sport already springs up the many red flags resembling a money grabbing hentai show, but the way they execute the series is something that I would not dare label as \u2018half hearted\u2019 or \u2018purely for the sake of money\u2019. As each episode went by, I began to feel intrigued and look forward to each airing episode, not PURELY for the T/A (I can\u2019t deny that I am not a pervert here), but for the likeable characters and acceptable story, and most importantly, the \u2018WTF did I just watch\u2019 expression and the laughter that comes along with it. \\n\r\nNote: Surprise surprise, though this show has a shit tonne of fanservice, there is no nudity. In short : no explicit tits or butts, they are always conveniently covered) That is of course, the upcoming Blu-Ray comes and prove me otherwise. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWithout further ado, let us try to analyse this beast. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing much to be commented on here. It does not grind your ears like fingers against a blackboard nor is it something that you would call a masterpiece, Openings and Endings generic pop designed for the modern teen, and since I am a modern teen, I liked it. Music taste is pretty much subjective, so all I can say is that it\u2019s not anything unique and could be easily forgotten once you stopped watching the show, but do give it a listen. Soundtracks are up to standards of a modern anime series, doing its job to create mood and nothing more, with cheerful music for comedic scenes, upbeat soundtracks for the action scenes etc. I could be nit-picky here and say that the variety of the soundtracks is a bit lacking, but hey, a show with T/A as the main highlight, even if Beethoven was playing the Moonlight Sonata in all its glory, I would still be absorbed by the flashy \u2018action scenes\u2019. Voice of the characters are adequate, with the clumsy girls having the annoying high pitched voices (as usual) and the Shounen-Powerup-MC having a loud and confident tone, they just get the job done. (If you are wondering about yelps and the \u2018oohs\u2019 and \u2018ahhs\u2019 whenever one\u2019s T/A is getting smacked, yes, they are there for you as well). (6/10). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: In this type of show which shows the almost bare figure of many females which the male populace would like to claim as waifu, the creators made a good move to make characters of different looks, personalities and T/A techniques (more on to this later). I could draw a simile to how this diverse pool of girls can \u2018almost\u2019 satisfy each and every fetish of the anime community to how customers of a buffet would always find that one dish to fulfil their stomach. You have the big boobed one that always falls down and shows her undergarments, the never give up MC who always fight till the death and wins, the Tsundere friend who always manages to embarrass herself when no one\u2019s looking, the flat chest who is envy of other people\u2019s chest size, the one with the cat ears, the senpai who loves to fondles the boobs of others, the quiet but smart one\u2026. I could go on forever. \\n\r\nBecause of this variety, one could play the game \u2018find the anime trope\u2019 and could potentially be able to fill a whole Wikipedia page with them. This is not necessarily a thing needed to be criticised though, this show KNOWS that they are doing this trashy stuff, it is AWARE that it is predictable, and they are not shy to admit that, because this show doesn\u2019t require complicated characters to run, it\u2019s all about who uses their T/As the most effectively to achieve victory. You don\u2019t need a brain for this, just your eyes. You wanna talk about character development? HA\u2014HA\u2014HA, that hardly exists here, many of them remain the same at episode 1 until episode 12. However, if one insists that there needs to be at least some, the anime creators comply by giving one or two flash backs here and there that lasts for 2 minutes at most for the sake of explaining why X character behaved differently from its cardboard personality and that\u2019s about it. Aside from the MC, only 2-3 can be claimed to have their characters marginally fleshed out, in more ways than one. **coughs at bad pun**. (7/10 for character variety, 3.5/10 for character development). \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: This show is amazingly fluid in terms of animation, there are no glaring flaws that would become a highlight on Tumblr, and though one or two stand still frames are of poor quality ones, the action scenes are well done. In a show where T/A are swirling, vibrating, glowing, charging in super speed, and even shapeshifting, the animators really went all out to complete this show to the extent that although the T/A are already really attractive eye-candy by themselves, I can\u2019t help but be in awe of the many flashy movements and flashy effects that were put together, and, for a moment or two, take my attention from the T/A, and instead focus on the effects of them. A notable highlight to show how the artists really put effort into the show is that during its action scenes when the girls pull out their T/A moves, the outlines of the characters are noticeably thickened which actually shares a similar drawing style to AOT. Not only that, when there is a notable move that makes a huge impact, the drawing style changes to one in which there are multiple drawn lines to show displacement, speed, or even power, as if the panels of the original manga were coming to life and colour. In terms of how the characters are drawn, as previously mentioned, they come in all shape and sizes, A to F cups, red heads to blonds to white hair to the usual black. The pony tail, the twin tail, the short cut, the ribbon, there\u2019s no lacking of options, and most of them are attractive. This show isn\u2019t one to have any noticeable backgrounds whatsoever, they aren\u2019t ugly, but they are not really eye-catching unless you make it a point to notice them. But its fine, the show doesn\u2019t need them, (the bodies of the characters cover half the screen half the time anyway). With T/A being main stars of the show, some might ask: are the \u2018physics\u2019 done well? Absolutely, as farfetched as this show is, things move the way that they are supposed to, unless of course, their special power permits them to defy it. (8/10)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: The flow of the show is of the typical sports-shounen genre. The MC meets friends to partner up with, meet with overpowered mentors, work hard on training, finds new enemies, defeats them, become friends with said enemies, rinse and repeat. It is so generic that you could already tell the outcome of battles, thus rendering all cliffhangers and nervous moments irrelevant. For example: In a Keijo match, one could already predict that the side characters will lose no matter how powerful/strong they are all for the sake of making the MC crash in at the last moment to look good. Vice versa, one could also expect how the most powerful characters in the shows to do a 1v3 to make the whole development of certain characters unneeded since they would win without that development anyway. And lo and behold, the glorious MC making a huge comeback against presumably superior Keijoo players, leaving the characters who witnessed the match astonished, while leaving us stifling a yawn. It\u2019s like the \u2018power-levels\u2019 of the characters are always altered to the liking of the writers, lacking a consistency. Comebacks are nice to see, but with \u2018plot armour\u2019 ever-present, the natural outcome, if following power levels, would be far more refreshing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, the blueprint of the story sucks, but what about the details, that is, the world building of the show? They are magnificent! Never have I seen a fanservice show leave my jaw drop so hard, the nitbits of what makes the whole world of Keijo are absolutely insane, farfetched, that one could think that a prepubescent 12-year-old came up with it. From exercise /training regimes that include using your T/A to pull heavy objects to lectures regarding the anatomy of butts and boobs are all brushed upon. Almost every simple aspect of life from Ice cream, warm ups, ball sports are twisted into a wild Keijoo fashion, and my favourite: the special techniques of the T/A: (I would only name a few to avoid spoiling too much), but here are the cream of the crop, their names are pretty much self-explanatory to what they do.) : \\n\\n\\n\r\nVacuum Butt Canon\\n\r\nButt Gatling\\n\r\nTitty Hypnosis\\n\r\nWedgie Acceleration\\n\r\nAnal Probe Missle\\n\r\nDrill Nipples\\n\\n\\n\r\nOther techniques involve having butts that can singe clothing, butts enchanted by fairy magic, boobs acting as a samurai sword, etc. Some technique names are even parodies of famous animes, and when you hear them shout out their techniques, all the more laughter ensues. \\n\r\n(Plot: 3/10, World Building : 9/10).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe genius mind of the anime creators thought that by combining two trendy genres of the anime medium into one, the show could become a huge cash-cow to be milked for years to come. However, this hugely backfired in more ways than one. The beauty of sports anime is that it is so shounen-esque that it could pump people up, and sometimes even building desire to actually try-out said sport, that happened in Haikyuu, and KnB, could one even dare to imagine whether Keijoo could replicate such an effect? No way in Hell. (If Keijoo becomes a sport in real life I would be moving to Japan immediately though) Besides that, the intense/ drama moments from the shounen anime are not just mundane and predictable, but they could never be taken seriously, EVER. Combining ecchi with sports-shounen negates the appeal of the genres, and thus the show became a jack-of-all trades, a mediocrity. A slight positive to note is that though this is ecchi, the girls hit HARD, it ain\u2019t about the T/A bouncing in slow motion, once they come in contact with a person, they are definitely sent flying, each swing of the butt is like a strong sucker punch, and boy do you see them writhe in pain when they get hit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis show , in spite of all its mediocrity, is one of the most enjoyable shows that I have ever watched.\\n\\n\\n\r\nImagine this: \u2018A Keijoo player is at the brink of being knocked out, but at the final moment, is protected by a partner, the partner then reveals that she enjoys playing with her friends and thus would always protect them\u2019. One problem about this dialogue: As the character emotionally reveals her passion for her friends, we are given a shot where her ass and the ass of the enemies are pounding against each other at rapid rates, not to mention the sound of their springing/bouncing ass dwelling in the background. Sounds like a horrible attempt at trying to be serious doesn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t worry, it is exactly that, its the type of comedy that can be imagined as how one could depict  Martin Luther King giving his epic speech \u2018I dreamed a dream\u2019 in nothing but his underwear, it is THAT kind of funny. It reminds me of the times I laughed with my school friends over sex jokes when we just started  learning the reproduction system  in science class.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis show never fails to deliver what it wants to. So even though it disappoints to be a serious sports-shounen due to poor execution and its never-to-be-taken-seriously concept, it shows the very limits of what anime can do in terms of imagination and creativity, never to be replicated in any other medium. (Enjoyment :10/10).\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019re probably thinking, \u2018what the fuck is this\u2019, and that is exactly the appeal of this show, it doesn\u2019t just escape the confinements of the box that is labelled in, it crushes it through its sheer capacity for craziness. Just as you think that this show couldn\u2019t get any crazier, up comes another aspect of the show to blow your brains once again. I went in thinking that it\u2019s just another To Love Ru/High School DXD that I can just stare at with lust, but out comes the laughter and table pounding that makes my parents think I\u2019m insane. It\u2019s not well thought out, and that is totally okay, the fact that it goes beyond the expectations of many, bringing up things that one could never consider putting onto a storyboard. The phrase \u2018It\u2019s so bad it\u2019s good\u2019 summarizes it perfectly. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTherefore my dear readers who have made it this far, even if you zealously hate fanservice, or perhaps you\u2019re the one that faps to hentai every day of the week, try this show out. It\u2019s a polarizing one indeed, where one could either give it a 1/10 at a drop of the hat, or a 10/10 comparable to the second coming of Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, it is indeed one which will be brought up when you want to think of how crazy anime can be.",

            "content": "I was a bit harsh rating this Anime, but truly and honestly, considering what the animation studio had to work with, Keijo was presented and executed fantastically. At the end of the review I'll put a 'should you watch this'.\r\nStory 5/10:\r\nLets be honest here, I can't imagine anyone watching Keijo for the story because well simply, there isn't one, but it's got a solid premise. Keijo starts off like a sports anime, with a main female protagonist aiming to be the best in the sport but then branches off into more a shounen feel when she is put into an academy to train, goes againstother schools and then develops 'special attacks'. The only genre consistent in this anime is ecchi and comedy with every episode getting more ridiculous than the last- but don't let that stop you from watching it! I'm just saying that story telling isn't exactly Keijo's strong point, so don't watch the anime expecting some epic or heart wrenching tale. XD\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of an ecchi anime series, the art is pretty darn good. It's vibrant, clean and the girls all look super cute! I personally liked the way that they animated the attacks to look really impactful even though they're just hitting each other with their boobs and butts.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nNo gonna lie, the sound wasn't really memorable for me. Like it wasn't bad or anything, but the ost didn't stand out alot in my opnion. The voice acting, however, was superb (if there was a seperate score for this, It'd give it a 9/10) and very expressive and smooth.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10:\\n\\n\r\nI had one major issue with the character design, but I'm honestly not sure whether or not this was on purpose, so I'm just basing it off the point that it wasn't. Let me get this straight, the character designs are beautiful and vivid, with each character's personality distinct. Theres only one tinsey problem though...\\n\\n\r\nI've seen all those characters somewhere else before.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I was joking to be honest. I personally don't like to compare one anime character to another either, but tbh I was naming characters similar to the ones in keijo off the top of my head and it was getting ridiculous. I don't want to name and shame in case I'm wrong, but let's just say I think the author really likes Rosario vampire.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nLow scores aside, I really liked Keijo! There are alot of unique anime this season, and Keijo's definitely at the top of my list somewhere. I think Keijos strong point is it's level of enjoyment, not it's merits as an Anime production where several components are harshly critiqued. \\n\\n\r\nShould YOU watch Keijo?\\n\\n\r\n-Keijo is a show not meant to be taken seriously. I have seen *alot* of weird stuff on the internet, and Keijo still manages to amaze me. You will see attacks which involve nipples, the anatomy of the butt and the pounding of the breasts and if that doesn't sound appetizing to you, Back away now. \\n\\n\r\n-If you want  shounen, comedy, ecchi and fanservice anime which isn't involved in your generic harem or slice of life trope, this show is for you. To be honest with you though, you may need to overlook a few things in order to fully appreciate the fan service.\\n\\n\r\n-Please do not make this your first anime- both for the genre of ecchi and just anime in general. Keijo is an Anime that can only be recognized as fantastic from people who have been exposed to ecchi anime beforehand, and are comfortable with japan's 'weirdness'. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Keijo is an ecchi sports anime revolving around a girls-only fighting sport wherein the participants can only use their boobs and butts to knock each other into a pool. Did that premise catch your attention? If so, good. You're in for more than you bargained for.\r\nI actually didn't even watch this when it released. Around the time of the third episode, my girlfriend introduced me to the show. Since then, it became one of very few seasonal anime I watched as it released. As of writing this review, I have just viewed the final episode and can safely say this is one of my favoriteanime. If you want an in-depth look at why I feel this way, stick around.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has been making considerable waves since its debut in late fall 2016, and has become one of the most polarizing shows in recent years. The fans rave about the show \"saving anime\", while others see it as nothing more than mindless fanservice trying too hard to take itself seriously. Let's take a look.\\n\\n\r\nGoing along with the premise, Keijo follows 18-year-old Nozomi Kaminashi, a recent high school graduate who begins competing in the sport to support her poor family. Much like another Xebec-produced show, Zoids, Keijo is one big competition, with battles happening each episode for the sake of a competitive sport. It is a very faithful adaptation of the 2013 manga, which is something any anime fan can appreciate. Although the first episode skips a large portion of the story and does infact cut out some of the world building and character development (I own some of the physical manga, and the first four volumes are condensed in to episode one) the show very closely follows the manga after this.\\n\\n\r\nI could describe nearly every aspect of Keijo as \"a breath of fresh air\", but that would get redundant, so let's cover the individual categories instead.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe actual story is incredibly simple. Nozomi and her friend Miyata enroll in Setouchi Keijo Training School, compete in the sport, meet new friends and rivals along the way, and grow. Think of it like college football, if you will. This is arguably the weakest part of the show. The enjoyment comes from character development, the dynamics between said characters, and their interactions rather than storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nStill, we do get to explore the history of the sport a bit, and each individual character's story to an extent. I can understand why some of the early story was skipped in the manga, however. The way storytelling is executed in manga is considerably different than it is in anime, as you may realize if you do pick the Keijo manga up. The action scene you see in the first episode doesn't happen for a few volumes in the manga, and that was what drew most viewers in, so overall it was a smart move.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nEarlier this year, I rediscovered my love of Zoids and had to rewatch the anime. To see one of my favorite studios, Xebec, handling this show put a smile on my face. Although they don't use as much CG as they do in other works (it was mostly the land platforms you see the girls fighting on), the character designs themselves are the best I've seen since Gurren Lagann. Fans of To Love Ru will notice the distinct style here. \\n\\n\r\nLet me start by saying the body designs are absolute perfection. One issue I've taken with all-girl shows in the past is their body types. More often than not, they all look like they could snap like twigs at the slightest breeze. Keijo offers something different. In line with the fact that a competitor's best asset is their rear end, no expense was spared here; these girls have it going on in the back. As someone who likes big butts (and he cannot lie), these designs definitely stood out. It doesn't stop there, either. Just about every girl has a different body type. You've got the classic slender ladies (Miyata, Rin), to the more well-rounded curvy gals (Nozomi, Aoba), to downright thick (Hanabi, Non) and beyond. Muscular girls, statuesque, amazionian, BBWs, there's someone for everyone in Keijo. \\n\\n\r\nThey're drawn in a sharp, thickly outlined style that unsurprisingly brought back memories of the Zoids cast. However, the art especially shines during the battle scenes. The show demonstrates an incredibly good understanding of anatomy and doesn't exaggerate itself too much. That is to say, the characters themselves. Cuz if we're talking about the moves they perform, Keijo doesn't know the meaning of \"exaggerated\"! If I had to complain about one thing, the last episode seems to have spent its budget mostly on the big fight between Nozomi and Maya, as some of the characters look rough and low-detail compared to previous episodes. \\n\\n\r\nIt's an absolute blast to watch the races. The backgrounds and environments are quite lovely as well, from the crystal clear waters of the pools and rivers, to the lovely view of nature seen from their bus. Overall it's everything I like about animation and character design; you can really feel the weight of every movement!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nNo complaints here. The opening theme, DREAMxSCRAMBLE, became an instant favorite, which I even listened to in public a few times. It embodies the positive, passionate tone the show exudes. Then you have the end theme, Fantas/Hip Girlfriends, another light positive tune that sings about growing stronger together, set to a scene of the girls retrieving swimsuits. It's even performed by the Japanese cast of the show itself! The rest of the background music fits the mood to a T, especially the more action-oriented themes, which never fail to get me pumped for the next race. Each attack has tons of hard-hitting feedback, standard fare for the ecchi genre with smacking and rubbery stretch noises. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest compliment goes to the voice cast of BOTH the original Japanese and dub cast. Another issue I often take is that many female characters sound simply too young. Adult women that sound like lolis make a show hard to watch, but like many other all-girl shows (Madoka Magica, Love Live) the cast brings it home with unique voices fitting of a grown-ass woman. Japanese singer Lynn lends her voice as main character Nozomi, and puts a ton of energy and vibrant passion into the voice, especially during battles. Rena Maeda manages to strike a balance between cute and serious in her performance as Hanabi Kawai. \\n\\n\r\nEarly into the show's airing, a dub was also produced. Amber Lee Connors, a former fan dubber working with TeamFourStar, was cast as Nozomi here and manages to capture her rough-around-the-edges attitude very well. Seasoned dub actress Alexis Tipton brings out Aoba's reserved personality, while newer voices keep things fresh, like Kristen McGuire adding some girlish charm to Hanabi. I strongly recommend both formats, although I think the sub wins here, if only for Hibiku Yamamura's performance as Mio Kukasai, although Michelle Rojas does a great job sounding almost orgasmic in the dub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nLike Zoids before it, this is (other than the over-the-top fight scenes) where Keijo shows its stuff. This is where I have to mention that the show utilizes its 12 episodes better than many other shows of a similar length, showcasing some amazing time management. There's a \"main\" cast of eight characters, and believe me when I say every last one of them gets their chance to shine, and even then some girls outside of that bunch get some great moments. \\n\\n\r\nI'll use my favorite character, Hanabi Kawai as an example. She's introduced as one of the strongest competitors and comes off as extremely competitive and borderline sadistic. Imagine my surprise when she developed into the most lighthearted and optimistic character in the show! After the first episode, she isn't shown fighting (one fight happens offscreen, granted) and takes the role of providing commentary and exposition in each race. Many fans consider Keijo the girl version of the ever-popular Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, and I can definitely see the parallels peppered throughout the show, such as Hanabi essentially filling Speedwagon's role (there are infact direct references to Part 3 of the manga/anime, for the record). She becomes something of a friendly rival, believing in the others and later expressing her strong desire to use the fame she accrues from the sport to find a boyfriend. However, when she does return to the battlefield, she proves not only to be just as strong as ever, but instrumental in the victory of the final battle. \\n\\n\r\nJobbing (a term used in pro wrestling to refer to a previously-established powerful character being defeated by a new character for the purpose of showing just how powerful they are) does not exist in Keijo as it does in most action-centric anime, and that's one of the show's strongest points. Outside of battle, character interactions are fun to watch and can range from heartwarming to oftentimes downright hilarious. Just about every character comes off as three-dimensional and fleshed out, as much as they could be in twelve episodes. This is more than a lot of longer shows can say for their cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThere was very little about Keijo I didn't have fun with. After picking the show up three episodes in, it was quite the fun occasion to get to watch each episode Thursday night. In addition to watching the show both subbed and dubbed, I have watched this with three of my good friends, all of who enjoyed it. Being one of the few shows I watched as it released, Keijo instilled a childlike wonder in me that I have not felt since the days of old-school Toonami. I now know what it feels like when people anticipate a new episode of their favorite show, weird as that sounds. As of writing this, the dub has yet to finish, and you can bet I'm going to follow it to the end just like the original. It's the very definition of a \"fun\" show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nEven if you truly dislike Keijo, it's a show which is harmless at best. It's cute, fun, girly, positive, and lighthearted. It's more than just a sexy fanservice show. It promotes friendship, teamwork, personal growth, and especially good sportsmanship. I bet you didn't expect a show like this to have a good message, did you? Nagisa (one of the teachers) reminds the girls of the Keijo motto, \"Only Land\". This refers to the idea that players should treat each other with utmost respect, as equals when in normal social situations, and to save competition and rivalry for the races taking place on the Land itself. This is not my favorite anime of all time, but it earned its spot in my top five and managed to surprise me in more ways than one. I hope more people give this a chance despite the occasional detractor, because that joke about Keijo saving anime might hold more merit than you think!",

This mixes the sport and ecchi genres together and I feel like the producers pulled this off perfectly. Keijo is an anime with great artwork and sound and I enjoyed every episode thoroughly. The development of the girls from room 309 was rather fast paced but helped setup a perfect final ending to the series. The music seemed to fit every moment very well especially during battle scenes towards the end of the season. Speaking of the battle scenes, I feel the artwork of some of the abilities was astonishing especially when two opponents collide (this is very evident during the season finale.)\\n\\n\r\nI really hope that they announce season 2 and it looks like they plan to as the finale set a second season up perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 can't wait to purchase the box set.",

To understand this statement you must first understand the correct answer to the question \u201ctits or ass\u201d. While there does seem to be some debate that in itself is appalling. The answer, without a fucking doubt, should be ass. Why? A baby can live without sucking its mothers teat but can it exist without an ass? No. Of course it couldn\u2019t.The ass is important to humanity because it is humanity. Without ass there is no you, no me, no anyone. And thus we arrive a the importance of ass. While ass represents life, tits represent nurture. Both are essential to successfully raise a child.

            "content": "If you ever have worshipped an ass\r\nYou would know it's a feminine mass\r\nBut did you ever know\r\nThat it's not just for show\r\nThere is more to it than just its class\r\nSee, the butt can be used as a tool\r\nAs a weapon to wield in a school\r\nWhere they learn the skill tree\r\nKnown as asstronomy\r\nAnd are taught how to use it to duel\r\nBut let us not forget 'bout the breasts\r\nYou know, those lovely mounds on girls' chests\r\nAs I'm sure you can tell\r\nThey can use those as well\r\nTo surpass all different kinds of tests\r\nSo these ultimate weapons of war\r\nThey will clash like never seen before\r\nAnd the last girl tostand\\n\r\nRemaining on the Land\\n\r\nWill make the audience beg for more\\n\\n\\n\r\nYes indeed, Keijo is truly an asstounding anime in its own right. Japan just never ceases to amaze me.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of having an anime about a highly oversexualized fictional wrestling sport for girls where they can only use their breasts and ass to push each other out of the ring may have sounded somewhat distasteful on paper. But Keijo actually pulls it off a lot better than I initially expected, and turned out to be a surprisingly good ecchi/comedy/sports anime as a whole, albeit a rather a ridiculous one.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, its so-called ridiculousness is also exactly what makes it successful. Keijo is a prime example of an anime which does not take itself seriously *at all*. You will legitimately have a hard time finding many anime that are less serious than this. It is fully self-aware that its concept is incredibly stupid, but it just decides to roll with it as far as it can and tries to make everything as exaggerated as humanly possible, and the sheer absurdity of it all is what makes it entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe special fighting moves these girls quite literally pull out of their asses do not only have the silliest names imaginable, but they are generally not-so-subtle parodies of other series such as One Piece, Shingeki no Kyojin, Fate/Stay Night and more, and what they actually do is just as wacky. Supersonic hip swings, machine-gun-like butt missiles, titty hypnosis, nipple judo tosses, and many other shounen-like abilities, all neatly remade into something originating from a pair of breasts or an ass. It makes no sense at all and is silly in every meaning of the word, but that is also why it is funny. Not like rolling-on-the-floor Prison School-tier of funny, but more something that will make you constantly smile and giggle at the sheer wtf factor that the show brings.\\n\\n\r\nNow that said, I still have to mention that it does not *always* come across as funny. The silly nature of the show skirts a fine line between being humorous and just being weird or awkward, and sometimes I found myself facepalming rather than laughing. Statistically speaking though, I would still say that it manages to stay funny most of the time, so it is not a huge problem. However, I also realize that it is going to be very individual regarding which scenes you will find amusing and which ones you will only find cringey depending on your sense of humour, so it is worth taking into account at least, as it could be a pretty big make-or-break factor depending on who you ask.\\n\\n\r\nComedy asides though, what else does Keijo have? Well for one, there is obviously the ecchi aspect of it. Now this is very closely tied to the comedy however so it is more or less the same thing, but basically the sexual elements of this show are not designed to be hot or romantic or anything along those lines, they are simply there to be as over-the-top and exaggerated as possible, which is what generates the comedy of the anime. In that sense, because of its absurd general feel I would honestly put Keijo closer to the likes of Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, Grand Blue, Kore wa Zombie Desu ka, Seitokai no Ichizon, Sakamoto desu ga or even Gintama rather than notorious lewd series like To LOVE-Ru or Kiss x Sis. I have even seen some people refer to it as a female version of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, there is also the sports side of Keijo. I should probably mention that I am not really a fan of sports anime in general as I find them to usually be rather predictable, and also the fact that the outcome of all the matches are scripted tends to kill most of the excitement for me. In order for me to enjoy a sports anime, it needs to do something a bit out of the ordinary. And well, Keijo sure as hell is about as out of the ordinary as it gets, so at least that part was not really a problem for me this time. I will say though that if it was not for the fact that the sport in question was so utterly ridiculous as a whole, then honestly Keijo would be a pretty typical sports anime. It still has the same general plot points like the optimistic and hardworking protagonist with a dream to be the best of the best within a particular sport, the close bonds that she forges with other hopefuls of similar interests, the constant training to improve themselves and the hurdles they have to overcome along the way, the new abilities they learn over time, the \"rival\" characters they have to compete with and one day surpass, the teams from other schools that they play against... etcetera, all of it can be found in Keijo as well. However, you do not tend to think of it as much because the silly and comedic elements of the show steal the spotlight far too much. As for whether that should be considered a good thing or a bad thing depends on personal preference, but at least for me personally I vastly prefer Keijo's absurd approach over the one of your average sports anime, no contest on that front.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what can we make of all this in the end? Well, Keijo is an anime which on paper could and arguably perhaps should have been a complete trainwreck... but it is not. It is actually a quite decent comedy anime with plenty of creativity in it to boot. Admittedly it can get a bit repetitive over time since hysterical ass attacks can only remain funny for so long, but I think you should at least be able to make it to the end of the show whilst still having an awkward grin remaining on your face, and although the animation quality does have a bit of a hard time keeping up with the fast-paced nature of the action at times, it still does not feel like a huge problem. After all, those scenes are all about being as ridiculous and exaggerated as possible rather than ever trying to be anything photorealistic. And if nothing else, Keijo's mere existence was a massive middle finger to a large portion of the SJWs all over the internet, so at the very least it definitely deserves some bonus points for that.",

            "content": "\u201cKeijo is love, Keijo is life.\u201d ---Nostradomus, French Times\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the review Keijo needs.  This is the review Keijo deserves.\u201d ---Aristotle of Greek\r\n\u201c I can\u2019t believe this was better than the new Berserk anime!!!\u201d----Me, From My Television Set \r\nI think this series is pretty above average.  In all seriousness, most of what you may have heard about Keijo can best be described as possibly over exaggerated.  Keijo is by no means a savior of anime, but contrary to popular belief Keijo is actually quite a decent series.  Truthfully this series has no right to be as good as it actually is,but there's definitely some care here.  To give you the short and sweet version, Hip Whip Girl, as the series is dubbed separates the surface level critics from the people who were willing to give this series a chance.  Let me tell you straight out, Keijo is NOT a series relying on fanservice because it can\u2019t survive on its own,  anyone who says that is either lying to you, misinformed, too serious, or God forbid the worst of all---They disagree with me (SHOCKER). I'll be honest, to the untrained or critical eye Keijo is probably just your stereotypical T.N.A bullshit, but I found in it one of the most entertaining anime this season.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, this show thrives off its ridiculousness.  Keijo is a series much a liken to franchises like Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure or Free.   The true face of Keijo is that it is actually a shonen-action and comedy series, not a harem or romance or some other crap.  It really is a good thing that this series is so self-aware too, as Keijo\u2019s charm for the most part comes simply from how damn outrageous it can get.  You\u2019ll be seeing references to other anime, attacks that make no sense, and asspulls galore (no that wasn\u2019t intentional).  What I\u2019m trying to get across to you is that this is clearly a series that had a lot  of care put into it, when it didn\u2019t need any of it.  This could have easily been a quick cash grab with no thought put into it, but that clearly wasn't the case.  Is the series the deepest show you\u2019re going to watch?  Hell no.  I think that would be fairly obvious at this point.  But the company working on this obviously had a clear interest in making an entertaining series.\\n\\n\r\nI mean what else can I say.  The art and animation are both crisp and smooth.  Everything flows so well and attacks look both astounding and even sometimes, physically painful.  The animation is not amazing mind you, but considering its only real competition this year was Drifters, Yuri on Ice, and probably Jojo\u2019s,  I think it does pretty well.  What I like the most about Keijo though is that the characters all have actual passion to play the sport.  There is no, \u201c Yeah! This was actually a harem in disguise, you don\u2019t learn about the actual sport\u201d  garbage.  NO!  There are women of all shapes and sizes, many with unique motives, powers and abilities. There\u2019s a lot of genuinely clever moments here, albeit they do require a lot of suspension of disbelief.  The girls very real interest in the sport is also quite motivating and dare I say, even a bit\u2026\u2026touching in some weird way.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, if you like shonen you can either watch Keijo or not.  If you understand that the series is all in good fun, you might find something that\u2019s actually better than just the average T.N.A.  If you just can\u2019t get past the breast and butts flying on the screen.  Regardless of how ridiculous the very concept is, this isn\u2019t the series for you.  It\u2019s kind of like One Punch Man in that regard.  You either get the joke\u2026or you don\u2019t.  In my opinion, I want to see this show continue, it made me laugh, the action scenes were legitimately good, and I wanted to see the characters succeed. Hell, I even found the intro getting stuck in my head a couple times.  Keijo may start a trend, if that\u2019s for better or worse who can say?  All in all, I say give the series a try, you never know---there\u2019s nothing to it butt to do it.  Love it or hate it, Keijo definitely turned some heads and well....... asses.\\n",

            "content": "There are some people who thinks anime can be good in only one way. If it's deep and thought provoking, whatever that means to them. These people tend to underrate everything light hearted and despise fan-service shows. Well this is hell for these snobs and elitists.\r\nBecause what Keijo!!!!!!!! actually is? It is a fan-service show, but that's just a cover. It's a satire of the shounen sports genre. Those sport series, where the games are dominated by some legendary players with super powers. For that, we get an insanely stupid sport, a butt and breast wrestling. And this was the first catch. A fan-service heavyshow can easily go awkward from where the comedy doesn't work. There are a lot of shows like that. Keijo is not one of them, it manages to be consistently hilarious. The fan-service is incorporated into the plot so well that it's always feels natural.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story goes, it's basically a regular underdog tale. A bunch of freshmen starts attending this butt wrestling school, because everything has a dedicated high school in Japan. Our heroines start to sharpening their skills through a lot of mock matches and ridiculous training sessions, while every one of them discovers a special move. As for characters, we get the heroes of these kinds of stories, but even further exaggerated, with the same goal, they want to be professionals. And in context of the series, they are working splendidly.\\n\\n\r\nFor the production quality, I have no complaints. There are some moments where they didn't get the CG right and the characters go off model, but over all, as far as design and technical quality goes, it's definitely strong in this season, and considering how flashy the matches are, it's amazing how they kept up the quality without inserting too much cheap budget saving scenes, like another sports series of this season did.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime is not for everyone. This show is dumb, but it meant to be dumb, it wants to be dumb and it's proud of it. The ones who will appreciate it the most are the ones who're somewhat deep into the medium and seen some series this makes fun of and seen the biggest hits of the past few years, because Keijo is really heavy in references. It's an easy on the mind show with high entertainment value. I recommend it to everyone who has an open mind.",

Alright men (and ladies, if you're into that sort of thing), let's jump in to this pool of ass-ridden glory! \r\n*...I need a thesaurus*\r\nWell, the season is coming to an end soon, and so is this crazy ass year. We had our first orange president, the internet collectively got more PC than ever before, and best of all, we got Rogue One, the best movie of the year. So, what better way to end it than with the Jojo's Bizzzare Adventure of sports anime...butwith loads of crazy ass fan service. I may have a little but of bias towards this show. I AM just a filthy male! So, did this booty-licious romp pay off? Well, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nBasically, this is an underdog sports story about 4 girls training to be accepted as elites and eventually, being true pride to their school: a school that teaches KEIJO!!!!!!!! You need a lot to truly make this kind of story stand out, and unfortunately, this is Keijo's (not very) fatal flaw. Despite all of the amounts of tits and ass in full, glorious display here, the story beats present don't necessarily come off as new, and since some things (like ass pull power-ups, how after almost a year in which part of the training regimen is sit-ups, very few of them have ass, the way our final opponent changes hair due to personality change despite that that's now how that works, how in the finale, Nozomi spams a dangerous attack multiple times but feels no pain, how they often forget that they can use their boobs to attack since the only two things you're allowed to use are the tits and dah bootay, etc) make no sense, even for the show's logic, I gotta put aside my manly urges and knock this story down a peg. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, some of the things that happen here are...unique. No only does this show have some puny ass arcs, but the powers can definitely be creative. I mean, Gate of Bootylan? Butt-tack on Titan ? This show makes more bouts of bad puns than Yang from RWBY, and that is saying a lot. Also, sometimes, just to mix things up, they make one of our protagonists lose in a way that feels downright unfair (Aoba in episode 10). Plus, the major tone-shift in the first half of episode 12 can give such a whiplash, that if it was directed at my ass, that booty would be red as hell. I also wish that there would've been some buildup to the Ease and West War tournament that takes up the last 1/3 of the series. However, let it not be said that I like the sheer escalation of events. With each arc, the protagonists make it by the skin of their teeth, but each arc's obstacles are much more kickass and brutal than that of the previous one. Plus, as the series goes on, the absurdity of these crazy ass moves increases exponentially, and to glorious results in each of the battles in the last 4 episodes. It's ridiculous. It's absurd. It's...not enough to save the story all things considered, despite how tragic some of the characters' pasts (like Maya) can be, and how nice the ending is. Now, off with that boring ass thing we call: reasonable criticism. This is KEIJO!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNozomi is a hot-blooded protagonist that ends up having to work her butt off just to keep up with each new groundbreaking opponent, ad she is a total romp! I especially love the fact that instead of the classic protagonist motivations (I wanna be stronger, I wanna be the best), she just wants to be rich. Sayaka is a rival of hers who wants approval of her father while keeping up with her peers, no matter how much stress and offense she takes in the process. Aoba starts off really shy, but though her effed up powers and acceptance by her peers, she becomes much more confident. Plus, the lucky sod gets all the ass! Non is your cutely and clumsy big tittied gal, but instead of just hurting herself with her clumsiness, she puts everyone through hell, both through near-death accidents, or knocking coffee on a white bed. Then, she has the nerve to make all sorts of excuses justifications in an attempt at bravado. My favorite thing about these girls is the fact that they actually have dialects! How many times have you seen an anime that does that with its MCs.  It does this with Maya as well, but we'll get to that lovely lady in a bit. \\n\\n\r\nMio is probably my favorite character. She is a total lech (have you SEEN how she gets around cute girls?!), more so than most men of this archethype, but she is also one of the ultimate badasses this this show. She is the crux of some pf the funniest moments of the show (like her few second of punishment in episode 5). Not to mention, that she is the most beautiful, and fight me IRL if you disagree! I would definitely want a piece of her ass in bed! Well, not really, but she is my favorite here. Then we have a few quirky characters like Kawai (sinister in battle, but a total romantic dork), Kotone (lover of gay hentai), Saya (swordsman-like beauty who shows up in episode 11 for a badass moment of awesome) Usagi (fangirl of Mio, and possibly lesbo for her), Yuko ( who, along with Aoba, has the curse of just never being able to win) Nagisa (our coach who was once a pro at this sport, as well as Nozomi's predator of the Butt Vacuum Wave technique), Kyoko (badass teacher and Kyoto's butt missile lady), and Rin (overconfident, but, umm, she doesn't have any real quirks). Some are more interesting than others, but (and they all have big butts) they are generally a very endearing cast with plenty of life in them.\\n\\n\r\nMaya is an interesting one. Undoubtedly the second most beautiful mistress here, she is originally mysterious (not without accidentally revealing her crazy dialect that pops up on occasion), and with a rushed yet harsh past. She fights for her mama (who coaches a rival school) due to said mama being the first to accept her, and she even has a harsher alternate personality hell-bent on protecting her and her ass, while being a bit more violent, shall we say. Unfortunately, none of her peers are nearly as interesting aside from their powers. Well, let it not be said that they made for some epic fights.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nXebec is famous for their work on the tit and ass filled romp known as To Love-RU. Well, they definitely brought their expertise to this show. It is loaded with that stuff! Plus, the action is pretty cool to look at, and the rough outlines make this show's look stick out, like a competitor's ass while wearing one of these swimsuits. It makes sure that the hits that connect are all hard-hitting, and full of impact. Unfortunately, the CGI in some moments (like the KEIJO lands in the first few episodes) is utter ass! That being said, this show truly embraces its insanity, with the art being no exception. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP, \"DREAM x SCRAMBLE\" by AIRI is energetic as hell, and with the proper amount of T&A to really set the tone for this series. We can't forget the song that takes up the rump of each episode, the ED. Today, we have \"Fantas/HIP Girlfriends!\" by the VA's of our main 4 ladies, and it is a delightfully cheery song to cool us off after the as(s)inine experience we just went through. Too bad literally none of the background OST was remotely memorable! Such a shame, too. The dub is pretty good here. The kept the dialect of these kooky characters, and with some mostly well-casted fresh new talent to take up the mains while standout veterans like Monica Rial (who plays Hitomi) pepper some of the supporting roles to help out with the quality just in case. It's a pretty solid dub, which is an absolute necessity for us foreigners who wanna hear our lovely ladies in a less foreign language.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSome of the jokes got a bit old, and I did have a few big questions, but, as I said, this show busted its rump to bring us a fun ol' time here. It was a blast to see just how crazy each new event would get, reminding me of my time with Gurren Lagann, which is a good thing to be reminded of. The fights could get really freakin' fun, and I found myself laughing my ass off at some of the jokes and weird sh*t that went on here (not always for the right reasons, but hey, it worked). Sure, it wasn't truly epic for me, and I could've covered its ground a bit better so assholes like me would stop asking questions, but it was still a good time. Plus, the second half of the ending really put an endeared smile on my face. Then again, I am just a filthy male :P\\n\\n\r\nT&A: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNozomi, Mio ,and Maya alone brought this up to a 10. Their legendary selves are just, well, legendary. Kawai and Kyoko being up high up as well. Plus, each girl uses their tits and asses in creative ways and to crazy effects. It's captivating how well this anime mastered this art. Then again, this anime IS the pinnacle of class.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7/10    RAW SCORE: 72/100\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is truly a romp of 2016 that will be remember for a long time. With its crazy moves, its absurd fan service, and its sheer tenASSity, all our gripes with the Fall 2016 season have been rendered superfluous. Besides, as Suave from AnimeAbandon puts it: \"The 13 year-old in me thinks this is hilarious and dumb, and at the end of the day, that's all we really asked for.\" Well, with all that said, with this final word count, I bid you adieu.\\n\\n\r\nWord Count: I don't know. Somebody please be a diligent guy and deliver the number to my lazy ass, please?\\n\\n\r\nASS Count (all synonyms included, not including the word in this count): 50\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nBooty booty booty booty rockin' everywhere, booty booty booty booty rockin' everywhere, booty booty booty booty rockin' everywhere, body booty-\" -Barney Stinson's booty call phone, 2012.",

            "content": "When i first heard about it, I felt like a magical force has come to bless this world with one of the greatest anime of all time. On the surface, Keijo looks like a typical anime about fights with boobs and butts, but I found more meaning into this anime, and in reality, its actually a masterpiece. \r\nStory 10/10: If you look at the story and set everything aside, it is thought out REALLY well. The anime starts off with our hyper-energetic MC trying to enter the elite class, she fights her own classmates and at that point, the viewer is like \"Go Nozomi! bringher overboard!\" and you develop a minor hatred for those that the MC verses and hope that they lose. Now the second half of the anime, those characters who you once hoped for to lose are now the ones you hope to win. Without any cheesy cliche anime logic, the enemy is now the MC's friend. (well they were in the same school the entire time) This is what made me realize that Keijo is more than just fanservice with boobs and butts, it actually has an amazing story to it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: In most Ecchi anime, people complain about the fanservice taking over and ruining the actual anime. In Keijo, the fight scenes and serious tension of the battle actually takes away from the fanservice. Now this is good since nothing ruins the show, the fanservice becomes a side thing to make the anime even better. In the final battle, i didnt even care about the fact all the girls were in swimsuits, i just wanted them to win, it was so tense. Secondly, the combat scenes in Keijo are better than most action anime i seen. Everything from the other-worldy color flashes to the powerful moves these characters pulls off, the combat scenes are the BEST i have ever seen, and yes i have watched Fate. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: Adding on to the combat scenes, the sounds are top notch, perfectly placed and completely appropriate. When Sayaka uses her W-Acceleration, those sonic boom sounds really emphasis her speed and brings a feeling of epicness to the viewers. With every Vacuum butt cannon by our MC, we hear a loud sound almost as if an explosion, this perfectly chosen sound shows off our MC's power. All the sound effects are perfect. Now the Intro and the Outro, I loved them both so much that im currently working on an osu! beatmap for the ending song. I can't find any flaws to them. The OP and ED are great. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: Do I even need to say anything about this? The anime tried to be unique with the art, do what no one has ever done. Mix in manly Jojo shading with Moe. The result, was perfect. Keijo's art style is unique and just beautiful. The Moe is still there to show they are cute girls and the manly shading is there too to show off their power during a battle. The mini pauses to display move names is done so pefectly too, its like a Jojo stand, but moe and better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Kanaze wins best girl of this anime. GATE OF BOOTYLON! Not only that, every girl has their own special butt super power, it gives a nice distinction between everyone. As I explained in the \"Story\" section, the anime can make u hate a character but then love them later on, anime that do that always has good character development. In the end, you will even start to like some of the characters on the other school. In an anime like Keijo, you would not expect there to be any backstory, but nope, Sayaka's backstory is in there and it makes a great point. It greatly adds to the tension of the first battle in the east-west war. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: Best anime of the year, and next. Please be season 2. \\n",

            "content": "Imagine for a moment that you're a recent graduate of a prestigious art school in Japan. You land your big boy job at a studio known for their terrible ecchi adaptations. Months of slavishly working late nights pass, drawing frames for trashy harem comedies after garbage light novel adaptations, and all the magic and wonder of animation has been replaced with a visceral hatred and complacency; because, face it, you can always quit and get a lower paying job drawing hentai. \r\nYou get a promotion, all of a sudden you're key animating, and life gets a little better. The next day, the first thing thatdrops on your brand new mahogany desk is a manilla folder. Your line director tells you that you need to draw frames for a dynamic action sequence where a swimsuit clad girl slams her cooch down into another scantily clad girl's face before performing a movie that would make Mortal Kombat cringe: an \"Ass Guillotine\". You're told that the show is called \"Keijo!!!!!!!!\", with 8 exclamation points. \\n\\n\r\nAnd people wonder why karoushi is particularly high among animators. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Keijo begins with the butt and ends with the butt\\n\r\nAnd so did any possibility of this anime being anything other than pathetic, titillating fanservice with the utterance of that line. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems like every year, right around Christmas time, we're given gifts. Some gifts are good, useful, and necessary in our lives- like when I got my bicycle. I was elated, it was useful, and I still cherish it, because it keeps my ass from having to walk! \\n\\n\r\nAnd then at the other end of the spectrum, that weirdo at work or school gets your name for secret santa and gives you some useless piece of crap like a duct taped ball of change, someone's Pottery 1001 class final project, an electric can opener, and some used deodorant. I mean, imagine waking up on Christmas morning to find you got a new computer, a new phone, a new car, and oh... a Keijo dvd... who gave me that? \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, much like herpes, Keijo was a gift that kept on giving this season, too. Boy, did it ever give- but mostly just what it stole from other anime. My biggest criticism of Keijo is certainly that it has not one original thought in its disgustingly voluptuous body. I just reviewed Akame and bashed it for misappropriating setpieces and scenes from other anime, and Keijo takes this to 11, with the least amount of tact and taste possible. Half the characters are just reincarnations of Jojo characters- down to the sound effects and power abilities (stop time, ORAORAORA, take your pick, it's in there), rips from Fist of the North Star, Fate Stay Night (replace GIlgamesh's noble fantasm with butts, how original), Attack on Titan, and a myriad other hamfisted \"references\" that you could file under fanservice as well. \\n\\n\r\nSee, the problem with Keijo isn't that it's just a stupid tournament panty fighter like Ikkitousen, the problem is that it shows all of its cards way too early, dissolves tension, and gives all of its characters the Code Geass treatment of way too many fanservicey butt and boob shots to the detriment of the fight. Panty fighters can be funny and still have a semblance of a story, like Butt Attack Punisher Girl. Panty fighters can be narrow, shameless and tasteless displays of female sex objects too- which is what Keijo falls under. \\n\r\nTo the tension dissolving point- we see every character's \"SUPER ULTRA MEGA MONSTER\" move within the first few episodes. You know that they have the ability within them, and that they're only going to use it right at the climax of the battle when all looks lost- swoop in and save the day, ride off into the sunset, the end, everyone wins, power of friendship! \\n\r\nTake for instance, Jotaro from Jojo part 3. In the beginning, his Star Platinum ability is barely controllable, and while still strong, beatable by many early opponents. The nefarious DIO shows that he has the power to stop time with ZA WARUDO right at the beginning- but his ability to do so also grows. When the final battle comes, not only has Jotaro learned new abilities, but he also pulls one out of the hat that we didn't expect, though it fits in perfectly with the show, enabling him to do what I said before- swoop in and claim victory from the jaws of defeat. Keijo? You learn the super move day 1, use it to win in every battle afterwards. That's neither interesting nor fun to watch, it's just a matter of taking bets on when it's coming. \\n\\n\r\nYou know, if you rearrange the letters in Keijo, you can get another world that describes it better... Kojei: which means shit in Okinawan. \\n\\n\\n\r\nKeijo is like a bad gag gift. Some gag gifts can be funny, because they put the recipient in a situationally funny or embarrassing position in front of a bunch of people, like getting some sexy underwear and a dildo. Except you're a guy. And the lingerie won't fit. So what do you do? You just throw that shit in the trash, and move on with your life, just like Keijo.\\n",

            "content": "Originally with 500+ upvotes, my review is back. \r\nWhat does it mean to \"save anime?\"\r\nFor years, humans and otaku alike have presented the concept that an upcoming or airing series can rescue the medium of Japanese animation from its own self-wrought destruction. I've viewed this line of thinking with a grain of salt, for the obvious reason that, well, anime can't be saved, it's irredeemable at this point.\r\nBut what if it could be saved?\r\nWhat if we could end this cycle of bad karma?\r\nBut what could do it? What could save anime?\r\nA new Trigger romp with experimental animation and another iteration on Gunbuster's coming of agestory? Noble effort, Imaishi, but you can only go so far. Panty&amp;Stocking was but a deflated life vest lost in the sea of moe-colored urine. Luluco, despite being anime of the year, also failed to resonate and return these Chinese cartoons to their original purity.\\n\\n\r\nA fresh romp from acclaimed director Cowboy \"Watanabe\" Bebop? Sadly no, Terror in Resonance offered less hope than Obama, while Space Dandy offered as much substance as our future emperor Donald J. Trump. (Editor's note: nailed it. )\\n\\n\r\nMaybe one of the murderers who killed anime could do it. Could Geass' Taniguchi come back and deliver us something as good as his magnum opus, Scryed? No, we got Active Raid instead. Sunrise's Cross Ange was definitely saving anime for a while, but petered out in the end. \\n\\n\r\nAll hope appeared to be lost. But. What if... What if a series went the opposite route? What if it took everything that killed anime, and went so far into it that it looped around on itself and became the cure? What if derivative, pandering trash like Angel Beats pandered so hard that it smashed right through its target audience of lowlifes and became High Art?\\n\\n\r\nWell, we're going to find out. You're 1000 words into this review (for the second fucking time thanks MAL) and now you're going to learn about\\n\\n\r\n~ * ~ KEIJO!!!!!!!! ~ * ~\\n\\n\r\nKEIJO!!!!!!!! is an action series about dedication and fighting spirit, but it's more than that: it's a story about one girl's dream to get fuckin' paid. Yeah, the series is about this Blue Hair girl who graduated high school and wants to get paid by beating other girls' faces in with her ass. She has a friend, White Hair, who is a judo master that can attack with her ass at supersonic speed. Another friend, Udders, has an ass so soft that it deflects oncoming trains, and the last friend, Hairtail, can judge an opponent's power level by feeling their ass.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the series is about some kind of sport where young martial artists and gymnasts fight with their hips or something. It's more or less just a device to push the narrative of \"hard works gets you mad dollars\", much like all those other sports anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nThe show delivers this soft-hitting (editor's note: LOL) premise with great production values. Character animation and fight choreography are right out of goddamn Hajime no Ippo or Gurren Lagann. The animation uses varying line thicknesses for foreground and background during fights, giving the series a very hand-animated look at points, and the cinematography is phresh. The shots are dynamic and interesting to look at, along with great use of ON-SCREEN WORDS popularized by Panty&amp;Stocking/Kill la Kill, JoJo, etc. KEIJO!!!!!!!! carries great energy and timing into almost every scene, making it both not-boring, and funny.\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER after the first 7-8 episodes the art and animation kind of falls off a cliff, which is a damn shame, since that's right around when the climactic final tournament starts. It's most evident in the final episode, which is easily the worst-looking in the series. Luckily, the usual absurdity of what's happening still saves the show and keeps it very compelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters' abilities and fighting styles are about as fleshed out (editor's note: LOL) as any fighting shounen series, but it's all presented with an amazing sense of facetiousness. You can tell the team behind this show was having a lot of fun putting a nearly uncalled for level of thought into the reasoning and presentation of the action sequences. Special techniques all have fabulous names with accompanying ~extreme on-screen text~ - it's very cool and creative. The source material was ridiculous, but more grounded, whereas is the anime goes full ham.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is great. The anime skips the first half of the manga or so and settles right in on the meaty competition portion of the story, and moves along at great speed. Characters and concepts are introduced quickly, and even though you technically miss 40 chapter of content, you don't actually notice because the writers for the show were competent enough to know how to adapt the material to best fit the medium.\\n\\n\r\nI've grown to really like the OST for this show. Opening is catchy, and the accompanying animation is very much amusing enough. There are some very hammy emotional/background tracks that stand out during climactic scenes. The sound design though: That's where this show shines. KEIJO!!!!!!!! uses sound in some pretty unique ways that are genuinely hilarious. You'll hear mechanical sounds, explosions, energy pulses and everything in between when various ass-centric attacks are used, and during combat every fight in this series is full of other varied and exaggerated impact sounds.\\n\\n\r\nSo, is this how one saves anime?\\n\r\nDoes this series do what none before it could?\\n\\n\r\nYes.",

            "content": "Keijo (insert 8 exclamation points) is an over-the-top ecchi show featuring women with large tits and assess attempting to used said assets to beat the everlasting hell out of each other. At first, this show sounds like it could be pretty fun and indeed it was for the first couple of episodes. The sheer insanity and silliness of it all certainly made for an entertaining watch especially since the show never took itself seriously in the slightest and each of these girls had their own super powered attack using their butts which kind of reminded me of JoJo of all things. However, just like theanime Ben-to, it starts off pretty promising for a rule-of-cool anime with a lot of over-the-top action sequences but fails at this since it becomes repetitive and the characters are not interesting enough to hold it all together.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the narrative is something that has been done a million times before to much better effect. It's a basic story of a girl who wants to become the best in her field, and in this context, the best ass and tit champion. She joins a school, makes new friends, proves herself in competitions, moves up the ranks, learns new moves and then fights stronger and stronger enemies. It's a very basic linear story that doesn't try to do anything new nor is all too memorable after you've finished watching the series. It's hard to find investment in the narrative and characters surrounding said story since the characters are hard to latch onto and remain one dimensional throughout the show. None of them really do all too much or do anything interesting nor go through any arcs as people. At the most, the only thing that does develop in terms of characters is the size of their assess (there's a sentence I never thought I would say). The fights, which can be entertaining in their own rights, lack any sort of investment or engagement since I never cared for a single character in the entire show. Everyone is a cardboard cut-out of an existing archetype and everyone is defined by the size of their breasts or the size of their butt. While some of the characterisations is okay and can lead into some genuinely fun moments these were still few and far between. There isn't all too much time invested in any character and whenever a new character is introduced they're normally pushed to the side after their initial introduction and left to remain stagnant. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm not expecting deep, groundbreaking themes in a show that is trying to be full of tits and ass with nothing else but I feel as if there were some things in the narrative which could have been expanded on and made into interesting ideas. One such example was in the case of Sayaka's father, a man who was new to this bizarre new sport. This could have provided us with a new perspective on this world and could have led into themes of sexualisation of women and the such but it is glossed over so quickly leading to no development in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nSince the fan-service is such a big part of this show I think I will address this now. I have nothing against fan-service in shows, in fact, some of my favourite anime have fan-service elements but when that's all your show has it comes across as a desperate plea to be noticed and the show feels trashy since it can't stand on its own two feet without the inclusion of a boob shot every five minutes. Now, it's obvious that the show is only meant to be enjoyed as a guilty pleasure; a show in which you're supposed to switch your mind off and just laugh at the idea of seeing women in tight swimsuits beating the crap out of each other with their tits and this is fine of its own since I believe this show does achieve its aim of being a cheesy light-hearted fan-service show. In fact, there were many times in which I was generally having fun with the show with the insane logic and attacks these girls were able to throw out. However, while there were plenty of moments in which I was entertained, this is also met with many moments in which I was bored and uninterested in what was going on, in particular during the training segments and during some of the forced character backstories which felt more like a lazy way for the writer to create emotion rather than building it up slowly which would be more impactful. The show does start off pretty fun but slowly degenerates into a dull and uninteresting mess since the novelty of the show begins to wear off for me since there were no interesting characters to root for nor anything worthwhile in the narrative. Now, I'm sure there are people who were entertained from start to finish with this show, which is fine, but I was not. I found the entire experience to be more tiresome than fun by the end since it felt like a chore to watch each and every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was pretty consistent and I liked some of the character designs too. As I've said, some of the killer attacks could be funny in their absurdity and the animation and art design do a good job at conveying this. It's clear that the staff put their sole attention into making every ass and pair of tits look as great as possible and for an ecchi oriented show, it does look pretty well done. The music was okay, and I did like the opening and ending tracks for this anime, albeit nothing amazing or too spectacular. \\n\r\nKeijo (insert 8 exclamation points) is clearly a series that serves to the lowest common denominator and thinks that slapping a bunch of tits on the screen will be enough to warrant the show to be 'fun'. While there were a couple of times I was having fun, it wasn't a substantial amount of time to raise the bar and I can't even argue in favour the notion that I should see this show as nothing more than a guilty pleasure.\\n\\n\r\n In order for Keijo (insert 8 exclamation points) to work, it needed to have stronger and more interesting characters and to have done more with its premise; which it didn't. I can only recommend this to you if you're a hardcore ecchi fan since there are so many better shows out there for you to enjoy that actually take the time to develop characters while still having a lot of ass and tits. I would imagine watching this show incredibly drunk with friends could be fun, however...\\n\\n\r\n(Part of LIQfilms 12 Days of Christmas - Day 9)",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nWith no less than 8 exclamation marks in the title, how could you possibly go wrong?\r\nKeijo is universally regarded as the dumbest anime of 2016. It is everything Miyazaki warned about anime becoming an \"inside joke\" by otaku for otaku. It doesn't have a creative bone in its body and simply spoofs other shonen anime cliches. Even the concept of the sport \"Keijo\" was shamelessly stolen from a minigame in the videogame Dead or Alive. That's why DoA is now doing a Keijo DLC in Japan and Studio Xebec is allowing them to use their characters.\r\nI admit I went into this anime wanting to hateit. I wanted to bash this casual filth...yet I found myself actually laughing at its stupidity and relentlessly awful puns. There is a reason people have begun calling this series \"JoJo's Bizarre Assventure\". It is everything we ironically love about JoJo only with tits and asses sprinkled on top. It is so headbashingly retarded and over the top it actually outdoes JoJo itself at times. The spoofs and references to other anime are in the dozens for every episode. Even Gintama has a hard time competing with Keijo on that front. Keijo isn't a brilliant satire. It isn't a marvelous deconstruction. It is simply stupid for the sake of stupid and...I actually have a hard time hating it.\\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is that there is a new sport and form of legalized gambling called Keijo. Women must use their tits and asses to try knock each other off inflatable rafts and into the water. Our main character is a blockhead who lives to fight and enjoys 3 things: food, the thrill of combat, and making friends. She also is one of VERY few shonen main characters to speak with a Kansai dialect. She trains with weighted clothing and shoots a blue laser out of her butt. Gee, can you guess which character she is supposed to be a copy of? We also have the tsundere strategist character, the ditz with massive tits, and the Yuki Nagato/Rei Ayanami ripoff. All episodes are laughably predictable in their outcomes, but they are supposed to be.\\n\r\nWe get all the shonen cliches like: Tournament Fights, Training Episodes, and some of the most gratuitous and idiotic fanservice you can imagine.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot and characters are cliche as hell, but that is honestly the point. It doesn't want to be anything other than a bare boned spoof for people to laugh at. What makes Keijo watchable is HOW the show is presented rather than the substance itself. The way they change the fight styles to mock JoJo and use the \u30b4\u30b4\u30b4\u30b4 Kanji and spelled out attack names. The purple butt laser vs blue butt laser to reference the first Kamehameha vs. Galick Gun battle from DBZ. The HORRIBLE puns like \"Walls of Bootylan\" and \"Asstronomy class\" that are spread thick across every episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Music:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is surprisingly some of the best that Studio Xebec has ever done and the soundtrack is actually...GOOD?! The soundtrack is done by the same guy who did the various JoJo anime and Hellsing Ultimate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nKeijo is a stupid anime. It won't change your outlook on life with its existential pondering. It won't make you rethink your ethics or question your values. It won't move you to tears with its beautiful art or open your intellectual curiosity with its surrealism. Despite all of this, it is surprisingly watchable crap that is simply so stupid you owe it to yourself to at least see a few episodes. My point is not to be a diehard defender of this series. If you hate Keijo then good for you. Maybe I'm being unfair for being so light on Keijo. Maybe if it were regarded as highly as Gintama or Kill la Kill I would feel better about shitting on it. For whatever reason, I embarrassingly enjoyed this piece of shit and maybe you might too.",

(I don't watch much ecchi anime) \r\nStory 10/10 \r\nI love the pacing of this anime , slow and steady which allow you to learn more about the environment which is mostly focusing on the MC that her dream is to bethe best keijo player to become the prize quuen so that her family will be in a better state , (she will use the money to help them because she came from a poor family).It was that moment you cheer for nozomi and hope for the opponnent to lose is like yeah go nozomi! In the beginning and when the anime reaches its climax after all the fighting you realize the meaning of respect and frienship with your opponents as you bow and shred tears after a fight.That is true sportsmanship is in this anime although it present itself as a sport of boobs and butts which I call B&B it is more to that since everyone has their own talent/skill pretty much like Kuroko no basket without the ecchi. With or without the eechi/fan service this piece of anime works for me so I'd give it a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt 8.8/10 \\n\r\nPretty much the same like most of the anime out there with hand drawn style which I like .\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nDon't you love the sound of sonic booom when jets goes supersonic you can hear it here and its pretty epic and fits well with the fights as well as all the other skills that the girls use such as the vacuum butt canon \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nEasily enjoyable and lovable characters that is easy to understand and each has their own traits which makes them cute or badass in away that makes the character progression smooth \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nRewatched for the 3rd time with my cousins and she rewatched twice Rewatch/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nWas a winner in making people laugh in 2k16 and the best in the season let's hope for it to have another season. Like and old man saying \"If its stupid and it works it ain't stupid\" to the author who came out with this hilarious idea that none can think off you got yourself a customer :)",

            "content": "TL;DR: Boobs, Butts, Bliss. Do I need to say more? \r\nKeijo, an anime marketed as an ecchi sports shounen anime, didn\u2019t need to rely on the usual \u201cplot\u201d to stay afloat as one of the top animes of 2016. The anime is outrageous. The best part is that the director knows it as well and doesn\u2019t shy away from abusing that factor. Keijo is a sport about pushing people off floating platforms using your boobs or butts. How can a show like this keep the audience captivated for an entire season? If you think it was the typical \u201canime plot\u201d that kept the audience hooked,well you are partially right, but it was more so the originality and making mockery of previous shounen animes that kept everyone entertained. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple and as straight forward as any other sport animes. You have a girl, Nozomi, who wants to be the very best that no one ever was. She will train harder than anyone and believe it she shall. Each adversaries she comes across, she faces with full determination and moves on. Through the power of friendship from her amigos, she will learn the OP Boob/Butt moves and have fun. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters surprisingly stand out from each other. They have unique characteristics and each of the characters bring their own set of skills and OP moves (parody of anime attacks, most notable include Booty of Babylons and Buttocks on Titan) that just makes you laugh and appreciate a good mockery of the sports shounen genre. From one ridiculous OP villains to the next (much like Naruto) the battle never ends. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is a blend of CGI and hand-drawn characters that gives it vibrant feeling to the anime as a whole. The music score accompanying it does its job phenomenally. Both the OP & ED songs are energetic enough to reflect the mood of this anime. They knew how to reveal just the right amount but not too much, almost as if teasing the audience to keep coming back for more. And for more (fan service) you shall return, I guarantee. \\n\\n\r\nJokes aside, when jumping into the world of Keijo, keep an open mind if you wish to really have fun with this anime. Do not take it seriously and just know that it\u2019s an outrageous anime whose main purpose is to make the audience react to its absurdity. If you look at it critically it has several flaws like plot armour, lack of logic and jokes getting overused.  However, it will still wow you with sheer amounts of bizarre unpredictability. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you want to watch an \u201cecchi\u201d show but can still tell your friends that you watched a sports shounen with comedy vibes like OPM & MP100, definitely give it a shot. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. I\u2019m always open to criticism and suggestions and I hope you found this short but supaishi review helpful. \\n",

            "content": "Keijo is a genuinely fun, unique and most importantly \"asstounding\" title. Bad English puns everybody, LeaderTGW (the greatest warriors) always provides them!\r\nBoobs & asses fighting it out on a small floating platform in water in a ridiculous game\u2026 well, sport that only the Japanese could possibly conceive. Keijo was definitely the transition anime needed this year. A break from those magical school battle harem titles, and the \u201coriginal\u201d (Sarcasm*) trapped in a fantasy world or video game titles. Keijo's story is simple, consistent, and most importantly it works. The plot is straight-forward and for the most part follows the original sources story. There are smallbreaks in the story however, these are necessary sub plots filled with training, backstories, and fan service. All necessary in order to keep the story refreshing and engaging.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this story so unique? So appealing? That isn't related to boobs and asses. I'd say that it's the pacing as well as the characters determination to be great at the tournaments. As many before me have already mentioned, the anime skips a few chapters of the manga, and this choice in direction improves the pacing. In addition to this change, I\u2019ve also noticed that some dialogue is cut too. Perhaps a change needed to focus more on action. The intensity and determination of the characters keeps the show interesting. The girls have a goal, and they're willing to subject themselves to weird \"ass\" training methods in order to improve their skill.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the fan-service. Personally I didn't feel that the fan service was rewarding enough. I'm not saying that it's bad; it's just that there was a lack of nudity, and sex appeal. I felt that the direction the fan-service leaned on was comedic rather than erotic. They had to force sexy moments rather than having them happen naturally, and honestly that took some of the pleasure away from the show.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, what was it about Keijo\u2019s story that made me happy? It was perhaps the most \"fun\" title that I've seen in a long time. Over the top explosions and blast from asses that aren't fart related, the action was intense. Overall the story wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought it was going to be. It provided enough entertainment and pleasure for an ecchi title.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Keijo\u2026 Oh boy. Character designs are awful! The character outlines to be more specific. They remind me of a bad vectoring job or rendering done in either Illustrator or Inkscape. The outlines look pixelated and the strokes are disgusting to see with their movements. This took away quality from the action scenes (Special moves) on platforms. A majority of the time, the outlines looked way too big! Hair on a majority of the girls was for the most part poorly done. Hair in anime is always unique and often times define a characters personality and appeal. While the personality part sticks with the character designs in Keijo, the appeal is appalling.\\n\r\n I felt like they went overboard with hair designs. Nozomi's hair in particular reminds me of a cockroach with those hideous antennae. There are way too many character design flaws in keijo and that really hurt the 7/10 score I wanted to give it. As an artist who loves to do vectors and renders it was a complete eyesore looking at the designs.\\n\\n\r\nBackground settings and the environment were surprisingly nice to look at. Water and waves would obviously be the eye catcher. Other things featured in the show like plantations and farms looked pretty nice too.\\n\r\nSpecial effects were amazing. Over the top as I had mentioned earlier. What I enjoy most was that the effects were able to captivate me as well as the manga\u2019s effects did. Special move were great despite the hideous character animation that often followed. Now the subtitles were bad in terms of localizing. I watched Keijo via CrunchyRoll and boy was that a mistake.  I\u2019d say about 85% of the changes that were made, were incredibly cringe-worthy and hurt the quality. In all honesty though, it\u2019s better than nothing. Overall I felt that the animation was vibrant and intense.\\n\\n\r\nIn the sound department, I felt that the voice actors were able to do an excellent job making battles intense and exciting with all their yelling. To be honest, it seemed like with the way the new voice actors dropped their lines, it is as if they were told by the voice director to watch 90\u2019s shounen anime to get an idea on how their character should yell out special moves! Needless to say, I am impressed. Sound effects were about a silver. For the most part I noticed that they were recycled like most are. Lastly, the opening and ending songs. I cannot say that I was impressed with them. They fit the theme of the show and unfortunately that\u2019s about all I can add.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall feelings for the show were low were I first started it. I expected nothing special to come of this series. It was only when I finally decided to read the reactions of others that I finally sat down and gave the show a watch. To my amazement the show is pretty solid and well-polished. As I said earlier there are various changes that could\u2019ve been done to make the visuals look better however, despite how unhappy I was with the designs, the action and comedy is what eventually allowed me to accept Keijo as an 8/10 anime. Overall I was very impressed with Keijo.\\n",

It is the stupidest idea I have ever heard. Girls have to compete only using their breasts and butts to attack other competitors. Nobody can tell me that that isn't the dumbest thing.\r\nKeijo is everything that is wrong with anime. And it is parody gold at its finest. I'm not going to claim that this was the author's intent or that he's a genius for making this show. I couldn't care less what he thinks. Theshow is played so painfully straight that it parodies itself.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is why Keijo is such comedy gold. The competitors take this sport seriously. The audience takes it seriously. There are sports announcers covering it play-by-play and there is an instance where an instant replay is used to judge the outcome of the match.\\n\\n\r\nGirls shout out shounen based attacks that are based off video games and anime. Since they use nothing but their breasts and butts in the attacks, it just crescendos into the most lulzworthy moments where characters utilize attacks like the *shoryucans*.\\n\\n\r\nI really would have hated Keijo in any other context. I don't think the studio that picked it up really put that much thought into it either. The artwork suffers from what appears to be some anti-aliasing effect, which for a hand drawn show is just a \"da fuq\" moment. I'm sure with their vast catalog of ecchi shows they simply saw something with tits and ass and figured, \"looks legit and right up our alley.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhat they produced, however, was one of the best anime comedies of 2016.",

And thus, \u2018\u2019Keijoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u2019\u2019 was born. In this show, Tits and Ass (From now on will be known as T/A as I will be mentioning this a lot) go into a battle royale, pounding against each other in more than a hundred ways with the objective of knocking the bikini-clad girls off a platform to ultimately decide which female has the ultimate\u2018assets\u2019 that could win them a huge tonne of money. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSince this show has a plot regarding \u2018plots\u2019, it naturally divides fans into two camps: The former who think that this show is just a generic borderline hentai that shoves T/A every 5 seconds and thus having a non-existent storyline and cardboard characters, and the latter who are unafraid to claim that they love the T/A so much that this show is a Godsend. Though I share the sentiments of both camps, as the show goes on I came to realize that I am surprisingly, sitting on the fence here. Without a doubt, the show\u2019s concept of using T/A as a sport already springs up the many red flags resembling a money grabbing hentai show, but the way they execute the series is something that I would not dare label as \u2018half hearted\u2019 or \u2018purely for the sake of money\u2019. As each episode went by, I began to feel intrigued and look forward to each airing episode, not PURELY for the T/A (I can\u2019t deny that I am not a pervert here), but for the likeable characters and acceptable story, and most importantly, the \u2018WTF did I just watch\u2019 expression and the laughter that comes along with it. \\n\r\nNote: Surprise surprise, though this show has a shit tonne of fanservice, there is no nudity. In short : no explicit tits or butts, they are always conveniently covered) That is of course, the upcoming Blu-Ray comes and prove me otherwise. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWithout further ado, let us try to analyse this beast. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing much to be commented on here. It does not grind your ears like fingers against a blackboard nor is it something that you would call a masterpiece, Openings and Endings generic pop designed for the modern teen, and since I am a modern teen, I liked it. Music taste is pretty much subjective, so all I can say is that it\u2019s not anything unique and could be easily forgotten once you stopped watching the show, but do give it a listen. Soundtracks are up to standards of a modern anime series, doing its job to create mood and nothing more, with cheerful music for comedic scenes, upbeat soundtracks for the action scenes etc. I could be nit-picky here and say that the variety of the soundtracks is a bit lacking, but hey, a show with T/A as the main highlight, even if Beethoven was playing the Moonlight Sonata in all its glory, I would still be absorbed by the flashy \u2018action scenes\u2019. Voice of the characters are adequate, with the clumsy girls having the annoying high pitched voices (as usual) and the Shounen-Powerup-MC having a loud and confident tone, they just get the job done. (If you are wondering about yelps and the \u2018oohs\u2019 and \u2018ahhs\u2019 whenever one\u2019s T/A is getting smacked, yes, they are there for you as well). (6/10). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: In this type of show which shows the almost bare figure of many females which the male populace would like to claim as waifu, the creators made a good move to make characters of different looks, personalities and T/A techniques (more on to this later). I could draw a simile to how this diverse pool of girls can \u2018almost\u2019 satisfy each and every fetish of the anime community to how customers of a buffet would always find that one dish to fulfil their stomach. You have the big boobed one that always falls down and shows her undergarments, the never give up MC who always fight till the death and wins, the Tsundere friend who always manages to embarrass herself when no one\u2019s looking, the flat chest who is envy of other people\u2019s chest size, the one with the cat ears, the senpai who loves to fondles the boobs of others, the quiet but smart one\u2026. I could go on forever. \\n\r\nBecause of this variety, one could play the game \u2018find the anime trope\u2019 and could potentially be able to fill a whole Wikipedia page with them. This is not necessarily a thing needed to be criticised though, this show KNOWS that they are doing this trashy stuff, it is AWARE that it is predictable, and they are not shy to admit that, because this show doesn\u2019t require complicated characters to run, it\u2019s all about who uses their T/As the most effectively to achieve victory. You don\u2019t need a brain for this, just your eyes. You wanna talk about character development? HA\u2014HA\u2014HA, that hardly exists here, many of them remain the same at episode 1 until episode 12. However, if one insists that there needs to be at least some, the anime creators comply by giving one or two flash backs here and there that lasts for 2 minutes at most for the sake of explaining why X character behaved differently from its cardboard personality and that\u2019s about it. Aside from the MC, only 2-3 can be claimed to have their characters marginally fleshed out, in more ways than one. **coughs at bad pun**. (7/10 for character variety, 3.5/10 for character development). \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: This show is amazingly fluid in terms of animation, there are no glaring flaws that would become a highlight on Tumblr, and though one or two stand still frames are of poor quality ones, the action scenes are well done. In a show where T/A are swirling, vibrating, glowing, charging in super speed, and even shapeshifting, the animators really went all out to complete this show to the extent that although the T/A are already really attractive eye-candy by themselves, I can\u2019t help but be in awe of the many flashy movements and flashy effects that were put together, and, for a moment or two, take my attention from the T/A, and instead focus on the effects of them. A notable highlight to show how the artists really put effort into the show is that during its action scenes when the girls pull out their T/A moves, the outlines of the characters are noticeably thickened which actually shares a similar drawing style to AOT. Not only that, when there is a notable move that makes a huge impact, the drawing style changes to one in which there are multiple drawn lines to show displacement, speed, or even power, as if the panels of the original manga were coming to life and colour. In terms of how the characters are drawn, as previously mentioned, they come in all shape and sizes, A to F cups, red heads to blonds to white hair to the usual black. The pony tail, the twin tail, the short cut, the ribbon, there\u2019s no lacking of options, and most of them are attractive. This show isn\u2019t one to have any noticeable backgrounds whatsoever, they aren\u2019t ugly, but they are not really eye-catching unless you make it a point to notice them. But its fine, the show doesn\u2019t need them, (the bodies of the characters cover half the screen half the time anyway). With T/A being main stars of the show, some might ask: are the \u2018physics\u2019 done well? Absolutely, as farfetched as this show is, things move the way that they are supposed to, unless of course, their special power permits them to defy it. (8/10)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: The flow of the show is of the typical sports-shounen genre. The MC meets friends to partner up with, meet with overpowered mentors, work hard on training, finds new enemies, defeats them, become friends with said enemies, rinse and repeat. It is so generic that you could already tell the outcome of battles, thus rendering all cliffhangers and nervous moments irrelevant. For example: In a Keijo match, one could already predict that the side characters will lose no matter how powerful/strong they are all for the sake of making the MC crash in at the last moment to look good. Vice versa, one could also expect how the most powerful characters in the shows to do a 1v3 to make the whole development of certain characters unneeded since they would win without that development anyway. And lo and behold, the glorious MC making a huge comeback against presumably superior Keijoo players, leaving the characters who witnessed the match astonished, while leaving us stifling a yawn. It\u2019s like the \u2018power-levels\u2019 of the characters are always altered to the liking of the writers, lacking a consistency. Comebacks are nice to see, but with \u2018plot armour\u2019 ever-present, the natural outcome, if following power levels, would be far more refreshing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, the blueprint of the story sucks, but what about the details, that is, the world building of the show? They are magnificent! Never have I seen a fanservice show leave my jaw drop so hard, the nitbits of what makes the whole world of Keijo are absolutely insane, farfetched, that one could think that a prepubescent 12-year-old came up with it. From exercise /training regimes that include using your T/A to pull heavy objects to lectures regarding the anatomy of butts and boobs are all brushed upon. Almost every simple aspect of life from Ice cream, warm ups, ball sports are twisted into a wild Keijoo fashion, and my favourite: the special techniques of the T/A: (I would only name a few to avoid spoiling too much), but here are the cream of the crop, their names are pretty much self-explanatory to what they do.) : \\n\\n\\n\r\nVacuum Butt Canon\\n\r\nButt Gatling\\n\r\nTitty Hypnosis\\n\r\nWedgie Acceleration\\n\r\nAnal Probe Missle\\n\r\nDrill Nipples\\n\\n\\n\r\nOther techniques involve having butts that can singe clothing, butts enchanted by fairy magic, boobs acting as a samurai sword, etc. Some technique names are even parodies of famous animes, and when you hear them shout out their techniques, all the more laughter ensues. \\n\r\n(Plot: 3/10, World Building : 9/10).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe genius mind of the anime creators thought that by combining two trendy genres of the anime medium into one, the show could become a huge cash-cow to be milked for years to come. However, this hugely backfired in more ways than one. The beauty of sports anime is that it is so shounen-esque that it could pump people up, and sometimes even building desire to actually try-out said sport, that happened in Haikyuu, and KnB, could one even dare to imagine whether Keijoo could replicate such an effect? No way in Hell. (If Keijoo becomes a sport in real life I would be moving to Japan immediately though) Besides that, the intense/ drama moments from the shounen anime are not just mundane and predictable, but they could never be taken seriously, EVER. Combining ecchi with sports-shounen negates the appeal of the genres, and thus the show became a jack-of-all trades, a mediocrity. A slight positive to note is that though this is ecchi, the girls hit HARD, it ain\u2019t about the T/A bouncing in slow motion, once they come in contact with a person, they are definitely sent flying, each swing of the butt is like a strong sucker punch, and boy do you see them writhe in pain when they get hit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis show , in spite of all its mediocrity, is one of the most enjoyable shows that I have ever watched.\\n\\n\\n\r\nImagine this: \u2018A Keijoo player is at the brink of being knocked out, but at the final moment, is protected by a partner, the partner then reveals that she enjoys playing with her friends and thus would always protect them\u2019. One problem about this dialogue: As the character emotionally reveals her passion for her friends, we are given a shot where her ass and the ass of the enemies are pounding against each other at rapid rates, not to mention the sound of their springing/bouncing ass dwelling in the background. Sounds like a horrible attempt at trying to be serious doesn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t worry, it is exactly that, its the type of comedy that can be imagined as how one could depict  Martin Luther King giving his epic speech \u2018I dreamed a dream\u2019 in nothing but his underwear, it is THAT kind of funny. It reminds me of the times I laughed with my school friends over sex jokes when we just started  learning the reproduction system  in science class.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis show never fails to deliver what it wants to. So even though it disappoints to be a serious sports-shounen due to poor execution and its never-to-be-taken-seriously concept, it shows the very limits of what anime can do in terms of imagination and creativity, never to be replicated in any other medium. (Enjoyment :10/10).\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019re probably thinking, \u2018what the fuck is this\u2019, and that is exactly the appeal of this show, it doesn\u2019t just escape the confinements of the box that is labelled in, it crushes it through its sheer capacity for craziness. Just as you think that this show couldn\u2019t get any crazier, up comes another aspect of the show to blow your brains once again. I went in thinking that it\u2019s just another To Love Ru/High School DXD that I can just stare at with lust, but out comes the laughter and table pounding that makes my parents think I\u2019m insane. It\u2019s not well thought out, and that is totally okay, the fact that it goes beyond the expectations of many, bringing up things that one could never consider putting onto a storyboard. The phrase \u2018It\u2019s so bad it\u2019s good\u2019 summarizes it perfectly. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTherefore my dear readers who have made it this far, even if you zealously hate fanservice, or perhaps you\u2019re the one that faps to hentai every day of the week, try this show out. It\u2019s a polarizing one indeed, where one could either give it a 1/10 at a drop of the hat, or a 10/10 comparable to the second coming of Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, it is indeed one which will be brought up when you want to think of how crazy anime can be.",

            "content": "I was a bit harsh rating this Anime, but truly and honestly, considering what the animation studio had to work with, Keijo was presented and executed fantastically. At the end of the review I'll put a 'should you watch this'.\r\nStory 5/10:\r\nLets be honest here, I can't imagine anyone watching Keijo for the story because well simply, there isn't one, but it's got a solid premise. Keijo starts off like a sports anime, with a main female protagonist aiming to be the best in the sport but then branches off into more a shounen feel when she is put into an academy to train, goes againstother schools and then develops 'special attacks'. The only genre consistent in this anime is ecchi and comedy with every episode getting more ridiculous than the last- but don't let that stop you from watching it! I'm just saying that story telling isn't exactly Keijo's strong point, so don't watch the anime expecting some epic or heart wrenching tale. XD\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of an ecchi anime series, the art is pretty darn good. It's vibrant, clean and the girls all look super cute! I personally liked the way that they animated the attacks to look really impactful even though they're just hitting each other with their boobs and butts.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nNo gonna lie, the sound wasn't really memorable for me. Like it wasn't bad or anything, but the ost didn't stand out alot in my opnion. The voice acting, however, was superb (if there was a seperate score for this, It'd give it a 9/10) and very expressive and smooth.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10:\\n\\n\r\nI had one major issue with the character design, but I'm honestly not sure whether or not this was on purpose, so I'm just basing it off the point that it wasn't. Let me get this straight, the character designs are beautiful and vivid, with each character's personality distinct. Theres only one tinsey problem though...\\n\\n\r\nI've seen all those characters somewhere else before.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I was joking to be honest. I personally don't like to compare one anime character to another either, but tbh I was naming characters similar to the ones in keijo off the top of my head and it was getting ridiculous. I don't want to name and shame in case I'm wrong, but let's just say I think the author really likes Rosario vampire.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nLow scores aside, I really liked Keijo! There are alot of unique anime this season, and Keijo's definitely at the top of my list somewhere. I think Keijos strong point is it's level of enjoyment, not it's merits as an Anime production where several components are harshly critiqued. \\n\\n\r\nShould YOU watch Keijo?\\n\\n\r\n-Keijo is a show not meant to be taken seriously. I have seen *alot* of weird stuff on the internet, and Keijo still manages to amaze me. You will see attacks which involve nipples, the anatomy of the butt and the pounding of the breasts and if that doesn't sound appetizing to you, Back away now. \\n\\n\r\n-If you want  shounen, comedy, ecchi and fanservice anime which isn't involved in your generic harem or slice of life trope, this show is for you. To be honest with you though, you may need to overlook a few things in order to fully appreciate the fan service.\\n\\n\r\n-Please do not make this your first anime- both for the genre of ecchi and just anime in general. Keijo is an Anime that can only be recognized as fantastic from people who have been exposed to ecchi anime beforehand, and are comfortable with japan's 'weirdness'. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Keijo is an ecchi sports anime revolving around a girls-only fighting sport wherein the participants can only use their boobs and butts to knock each other into a pool. Did that premise catch your attention? If so, good. You're in for more than you bargained for.\r\nI actually didn't even watch this when it released. Around the time of the third episode, my girlfriend introduced me to the show. Since then, it became one of very few seasonal anime I watched as it released. As of writing this review, I have just viewed the final episode and can safely say this is one of my favoriteanime. If you want an in-depth look at why I feel this way, stick around.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has been making considerable waves since its debut in late fall 2016, and has become one of the most polarizing shows in recent years. The fans rave about the show \"saving anime\", while others see it as nothing more than mindless fanservice trying too hard to take itself seriously. Let's take a look.\\n\\n\r\nGoing along with the premise, Keijo follows 18-year-old Nozomi Kaminashi, a recent high school graduate who begins competing in the sport to support her poor family. Much like another Xebec-produced show, Zoids, Keijo is one big competition, with battles happening each episode for the sake of a competitive sport. It is a very faithful adaptation of the 2013 manga, which is something any anime fan can appreciate. Although the first episode skips a large portion of the story and does infact cut out some of the world building and character development (I own some of the physical manga, and the first four volumes are condensed in to episode one) the show very closely follows the manga after this.\\n\\n\r\nI could describe nearly every aspect of Keijo as \"a breath of fresh air\", but that would get redundant, so let's cover the individual categories instead.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe actual story is incredibly simple. Nozomi and her friend Miyata enroll in Setouchi Keijo Training School, compete in the sport, meet new friends and rivals along the way, and grow. Think of it like college football, if you will. This is arguably the weakest part of the show. The enjoyment comes from character development, the dynamics between said characters, and their interactions rather than storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nStill, we do get to explore the history of the sport a bit, and each individual character's story to an extent. I can understand why some of the early story was skipped in the manga, however. The way storytelling is executed in manga is considerably different than it is in anime, as you may realize if you do pick the Keijo manga up. The action scene you see in the first episode doesn't happen for a few volumes in the manga, and that was what drew most viewers in, so overall it was a smart move.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nEarlier this year, I rediscovered my love of Zoids and had to rewatch the anime. To see one of my favorite studios, Xebec, handling this show put a smile on my face. Although they don't use as much CG as they do in other works (it was mostly the land platforms you see the girls fighting on), the character designs themselves are the best I've seen since Gurren Lagann. Fans of To Love Ru will notice the distinct style here. \\n\\n\r\nLet me start by saying the body designs are absolute perfection. One issue I've taken with all-girl shows in the past is their body types. More often than not, they all look like they could snap like twigs at the slightest breeze. Keijo offers something different. In line with the fact that a competitor's best asset is their rear end, no expense was spared here; these girls have it going on in the back. As someone who likes big butts (and he cannot lie), these designs definitely stood out. It doesn't stop there, either. Just about every girl has a different body type. You've got the classic slender ladies (Miyata, Rin), to the more well-rounded curvy gals (Nozomi, Aoba), to downright thick (Hanabi, Non) and beyond. Muscular girls, statuesque, amazionian, BBWs, there's someone for everyone in Keijo. \\n\\n\r\nThey're drawn in a sharp, thickly outlined style that unsurprisingly brought back memories of the Zoids cast. However, the art especially shines during the battle scenes. The show demonstrates an incredibly good understanding of anatomy and doesn't exaggerate itself too much. That is to say, the characters themselves. Cuz if we're talking about the moves they perform, Keijo doesn't know the meaning of \"exaggerated\"! If I had to complain about one thing, the last episode seems to have spent its budget mostly on the big fight between Nozomi and Maya, as some of the characters look rough and low-detail compared to previous episodes. \\n\\n\r\nIt's an absolute blast to watch the races. The backgrounds and environments are quite lovely as well, from the crystal clear waters of the pools and rivers, to the lovely view of nature seen from their bus. Overall it's everything I like about animation and character design; you can really feel the weight of every movement!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nNo complaints here. The opening theme, DREAMxSCRAMBLE, became an instant favorite, which I even listened to in public a few times. It embodies the positive, passionate tone the show exudes. Then you have the end theme, Fantas/Hip Girlfriends, another light positive tune that sings about growing stronger together, set to a scene of the girls retrieving swimsuits. It's even performed by the Japanese cast of the show itself! The rest of the background music fits the mood to a T, especially the more action-oriented themes, which never fail to get me pumped for the next race. Each attack has tons of hard-hitting feedback, standard fare for the ecchi genre with smacking and rubbery stretch noises. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest compliment goes to the voice cast of BOTH the original Japanese and dub cast. Another issue I often take is that many female characters sound simply too young. Adult women that sound like lolis make a show hard to watch, but like many other all-girl shows (Madoka Magica, Love Live) the cast brings it home with unique voices fitting of a grown-ass woman. Japanese singer Lynn lends her voice as main character Nozomi, and puts a ton of energy and vibrant passion into the voice, especially during battles. Rena Maeda manages to strike a balance between cute and serious in her performance as Hanabi Kawai. \\n\\n\r\nEarly into the show's airing, a dub was also produced. Amber Lee Connors, a former fan dubber working with TeamFourStar, was cast as Nozomi here and manages to capture her rough-around-the-edges attitude very well. Seasoned dub actress Alexis Tipton brings out Aoba's reserved personality, while newer voices keep things fresh, like Kristen McGuire adding some girlish charm to Hanabi. I strongly recommend both formats, although I think the sub wins here, if only for Hibiku Yamamura's performance as Mio Kukasai, although Michelle Rojas does a great job sounding almost orgasmic in the dub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nLike Zoids before it, this is (other than the over-the-top fight scenes) where Keijo shows its stuff. This is where I have to mention that the show utilizes its 12 episodes better than many other shows of a similar length, showcasing some amazing time management. There's a \"main\" cast of eight characters, and believe me when I say every last one of them gets their chance to shine, and even then some girls outside of that bunch get some great moments. \\n\\n\r\nI'll use my favorite character, Hanabi Kawai as an example. She's introduced as one of the strongest competitors and comes off as extremely competitive and borderline sadistic. Imagine my surprise when she developed into the most lighthearted and optimistic character in the show! After the first episode, she isn't shown fighting (one fight happens offscreen, granted) and takes the role of providing commentary and exposition in each race. Many fans consider Keijo the girl version of the ever-popular Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, and I can definitely see the parallels peppered throughout the show, such as Hanabi essentially filling Speedwagon's role (there are infact direct references to Part 3 of the manga/anime, for the record). She becomes something of a friendly rival, believing in the others and later expressing her strong desire to use the fame she accrues from the sport to find a boyfriend. However, when she does return to the battlefield, she proves not only to be just as strong as ever, but instrumental in the victory of the final battle. \\n\\n\r\nJobbing (a term used in pro wrestling to refer to a previously-established powerful character being defeated by a new character for the purpose of showing just how powerful they are) does not exist in Keijo as it does in most action-centric anime, and that's one of the show's strongest points. Outside of battle, character interactions are fun to watch and can range from heartwarming to oftentimes downright hilarious. Just about every character comes off as three-dimensional and fleshed out, as much as they could be in twelve episodes. This is more than a lot of longer shows can say for their cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThere was very little about Keijo I didn't have fun with. After picking the show up three episodes in, it was quite the fun occasion to get to watch each episode Thursday night. In addition to watching the show both subbed and dubbed, I have watched this with three of my good friends, all of who enjoyed it. Being one of the few shows I watched as it released, Keijo instilled a childlike wonder in me that I have not felt since the days of old-school Toonami. I now know what it feels like when people anticipate a new episode of their favorite show, weird as that sounds. As of writing this, the dub has yet to finish, and you can bet I'm going to follow it to the end just like the original. It's the very definition of a \"fun\" show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nEven if you truly dislike Keijo, it's a show which is harmless at best. It's cute, fun, girly, positive, and lighthearted. It's more than just a sexy fanservice show. It promotes friendship, teamwork, personal growth, and especially good sportsmanship. I bet you didn't expect a show like this to have a good message, did you? Nagisa (one of the teachers) reminds the girls of the Keijo motto, \"Only Land\". This refers to the idea that players should treat each other with utmost respect, as equals when in normal social situations, and to save competition and rivalry for the races taking place on the Land itself. This is not my favorite anime of all time, but it earned its spot in my top five and managed to surprise me in more ways than one. I hope more people give this a chance despite the occasional detractor, because that joke about Keijo saving anime might hold more merit than you think!",

And truthfully the fan-service is few and far between after the first set of episodes. \r\nKeijo is one of the few animes in recent years that I've notice properly build up tension unlike some aspiring shonens, can attach distinct personalities to each character and develop them respectfully, but most importantly take the ironic tension of a sports anime, let along ea beach sport, and dial itup to an 11.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and perspective is mostly on point, sound track is nothing special but useful, and it's great to watch if you're looking for something fast and fun.",

This mixes the sport and ecchi genres together and I feel like the producers pulled this off perfectly. Keijo is an anime with great artwork and sound and I enjoyed every episode thoroughly. The development of the girls from room 309 was rather fast paced but helped setup a perfect final ending to the series. The music seemed to fit every moment very well especially during battle scenes towards the end of the season. Speaking of the battle scenes, I feel the artwork of some of the abilities was astonishing especially when two opponents collide (this is very evident during the season finale.)\\n\\n\r\nI really hope that they announce season 2 and it looks like they plan to as the finale set a second season up perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 can't wait to purchase the box set.",

The answer, without a fucking doubt, should be ass. Why? A baby can live without sucking its mothers teat but can it exist without an ass? No. Of course it couldn\u2019t.The ass is important to humanity because it is humanity. Without ass there is no you, no me, no anyone. And thus we arrive a the importance of ass.

            "content": "Ok, so \"Keijo\" literally means \"Competitive Girl\" which is also known as 'Hip Whip Girl. a Japanese sports manga series by Daichi Sorayomi. It has been serialized in Shogakukan's sh\u014dnen manga magazine Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday since July 2013 and has been collected in fourteen tank\u014dbon volumes. An anime television series adaptation produced by Xebec premiered on October 6, 2016 and was concluded just this week. Frankly according to sources both the manga and this anime isn't selling well, geeez what an ass-wipe kind of story that the asshole Daichi  Sorayomi thinking when he came up with this manga? Ok so  it isn't uncommonthat all Japanese manga or anime has that exaggeration of what a character can do to the point that what they do defines the laws of Physics, anatomy and body kinetics.....and in this anime, yes it was all about the  the girl's ass where we can say that Daichi Sorayomi is an ass-man, and what studio have the knack for it's lewd and shameless animes, well, it's Xebec the creators of the \"To Love Ru\" franchise, though I'm one of those who simply watch this anime for the booty and the swim suit fanservice, I don't have any love for this anime, soooooo:\\n\\n\r\nStorywise, ok since this is one of studio Xebec's ecchi based anime, we can forget everything, the plot and the climax....they don't make it here, in fact , one would be more focus on the what the characters can do with their booty that how the story develops, so it was a Pathetic 1.\\n\\n\r\nArt, well, the attire is right for the occasion, I give them that, but, the it fell short on the fanservce, since we don't see any uncensored nipple service and some panty shot, but then again the maillot and the bikini does make up.....a bit for us guys to enjoy them eye candies, and that's as good as it gets, so it's a good 7 for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound, all that whoosh, boom, thud and all that effects clearly doesn't make anything , all it does was to get the guys' lust into overdrive, so clearly very poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters , ahhhhhhh who the fuck cares about Nozomi wanting to be the riches Keijo pro, and  Sayaka Miyata who was a Jodo Champ, Kazane Aoba who can tell an ass by just touching it and btw it kinda makes us guys jealous especially if one is still yet to get laid,  Non Toyoguchi whose butt is soft that makes the guys wanna bury their face in to it and  Mio Kusakai's boobies where every guy wishes he can fondle. Now I don't know about them other reviews, but let's face it, the real star of this series be it in manga or anime were, the swim suit, bikini, asses, boobs and camel toe, so for the reviews to even give details the characters doesn't have any merits. No offends, but to me, the characters here were just a bunch of bimbos that creator Daichi Sorayomi fantasizes about and there is no doubt in my mind that , those characters represent the cutest girls that he lust about and somehow , he can never have them in real life and can only drool at them, poor guy, I feel sorry for the guy for his Pathetic (1) ideas about them bimbos (Characters).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, watch this doesn't make it a chore, rather it is something that you can skim or have the choice to watch it all or skip some episode, bottom line there isn't anything despite of the final battle between Nozomi and Maya, one would not give a damn whether who wins or looses either way, it's all about the BUTT. So I'm giving it a fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Pathetic, even though sex sells, creator Daichi Sorayomi should be better off making something like hentai than something like this, cu'z it ain't selling well.  But hey, if you wanna watch it then watch at your own discretion,  cu'z frankly this anime/manga is created for us guys to lust our sexual fantasy, wishing that them bimbos do those things to us, \\n\r\nseason 2?????don't even think about it. Fool.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n Shady, Aftermath\\n\r\n(Look at them bitch! Ha, yeah!)\\n\r\nThere they go shaking their ass on the pool\\n\r\nBumpin' and grindin' that butt\\n\r\nThe way they grindin' their rack\\n\r\nI think they're losing control\\n\\n\r\nThey get buzzed, they get bump, they get crunked, they get fuuuucked up\\n\r\nHit the pool don't forget ones get they're body rubbed\\n\r\nThey got fucked, they get sucked, they get drained, shit pooped\\n\r\nPasted, blasted, racked up, showen some pussy\\n\r\nHit the changning room, show your body\\n\r\nGit in your bikiniiii, got a routine\\n\r\nKnowing still got a few chunks on your shoestring\\n\r\nShowing I was sooo ready till the beat vibrated\\n\r\nthey got revibrated as soon as them Bitch gyrated\\n\r\nAnd hips and licked them lips and that was it\\n\r\nThey had to get their ass some training.    \\n\\n\r\n Shake that ass for us, shake that ass for us\\n\r\nCome on girls, shake that ass for us, shake that ass for us\\n\r\nOh girls, shake that ass for us, shake that ass for us\\n\r\nCome on girl, shake that ass for us, shake that ass for us\\n\\n",

            "content": "I will start out this review by saying I'm not a huge fan of the Ecchi/Harem/Fanservice genre in general. I prefer a romcom over an ecchi anime 90% of the time.\r\nThat being said, when I get \"plot,\" I like my \"plot\" with lots of plot, so that it's not all about boobs and there's actually some story involved. This anime did an EXCELLENT job of creating characters with stories, stories that mattered and that I cared about, not just filler backstory.\r\nThe shows concept was absurd, (I mean really, boob/butt wrestling?!), but very well executed. Instances where clothing came off were very well censored. It wasobvious that it was censoring, yet not out of place (like the convenient light rays that we're all so familiar with.) The standard types of censoring were plasma ray type effects, and hair.\\n\\n\r\nThere was an excellent amount of comedy, yet it wasn't a full fledged comedy, nor was it full of corny or overused jokes.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around 4 girls who are roommates in \"room 309,\" aka \"the empty room.\" It follows them as they progress from relative keijo scrubs to being elites. Each character has a backstory that is not absurdly long, nor unnecessarily convenient, and is actually quite plausible. In the later half of the story, the show shifts from being primarily random slice-of-life type events (training, slacking off, random conversations, etc.) to being a little more serious about the story, which revolves around training for a major event. (Event name withheld due to possible spoiler.)\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I will deduct points from this for is the fact that it does have semi-frequent cliffhangers in the middle of battles, important conversations, game changing training, etc.\\n\r\nWhile this is not a flaw per se, I'm not a fan of cliffhangers in the slightest (It results in me binge watching things for hours), thus the point deduction. If you enjoy cliffhangers, you can go ahead and make the score 8.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile not the MOST interesting characters I've ever seen, (that would have to go to Durarara, dang every character was so complex like wtf), they did have interesting but subtle backstories that made you care about them. They also all had very unique personalities, some of which were perfect fits, some of which were entirely incompatible, and most of them had to work on teamwork to work well together, but once they did so were extremely effective as a team. Nozomi is a very ambitious girl, yet somehow does not fall under any \"dere\" category that I can think of. She has a tremendous amount of drive to do what she want's, while still being realistic. She is willing to bend the rules and pull strings as necessary to do her very best. Aoba is a strategic type of keijo player, acting relatively weak and unintelligent, then ambushing opposing players right when they think she's down. Rather than going in guns blazing and bragging about her ability, she keeps a fairly low profile until the time is right. Maybe I just like her because I have the same mindset, I don't know? Miyata is not really a dandere per se, but she's the closest fit to any \"dere\" category of anyone in this show. Seriously, talk about breaking stereotypes, this show exceeds at it. Non is the clumsy, slightly ditzy girl on the team, but she can be very effective when needs be, although most of the time that effectiveness is entirely accidental.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime's trace lines are very noticeable. While most anime trace lines are a single, consistent thickness, these trace lines vary in thickness depending on the angle of the stroke, almost as if they were illustrated with a fountain pen. It looks very good. It is up there with No Game No Life and Durarara in terms of excellent trace lines and art in general. Another thing I would mention is that this anime has very high frames per second. While most anime appears to be animated in 30 or 48 fps, giving it a sort of choppy, jumpy, old look, this appears to be animated in 60 fps. It is excellent quality, to the point where if you download an HQ version and import it into Adobe Premiere with 60fps settings, there is a difference in every frame, unlike some anime which have the same image 2 or 3 frames in a row.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has excellent sound. Not only are the OP and outro good, the mic quality for the voice over in general is awesome. Please keep in mind that I was watching the Japanese dub English sub version, (so I can't comment on the quality of the dub.) But on the sub anyway the sound is excellent, from the songs, to the character's voices, to the effects of boobs smashing into butts. (Never thought I'd be saying or typing that lol.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs stated at the beginning, I'm not a huge fan of ecchi. I don't hate it, it's just that I don't watch pure ecchi shows. But this did have a few good fanservice moments that even I can't ignore. That, combined with the awesome story, the way that such a comical and absurd concept is played off so well, and the fact that no sh!ts were given about physics makes this a 420 out of 69 for me. (No, but for real, 10/10 would watch again.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 [Overall Decimal 9.65/10]\\n\\n\r\nI loved this show. Binged the whole thing in about 6 hours, and dayum it was a 6 hours well spent. And anytime I google \"{series name} season 2\" before I even mark it as finished on MAL, I know it's a keeper.\\n\r\nThis was a thoroughly entertaining show, with comedy, ecchi, story, suspense and buildup. Can't wait for a second season, if and when there is one; and without a shadow of a doubt this was one of the top anime of the season!",

            "content": "While seemingly destined to the lowest tier of fanservice, Keijo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\nactually manages to be surprisingly entertaining and fun.\r\nI don't think this requires a long, point by point review. Just know that the VA is neat, the usual art and sound effect standards are also here for a 2016 anime. I'll give a plus for the butt fights which actually are understandable as the action is clearly depicted without imprecisions.\r\nEntering Keijo you might expect butts and tits and nothing else, and you'd be rather surprised at two things:\r\nFirstly, I think the anime is very coherent in its own world. The main character has this quality that mostanime MCs lack: she's not in for a noble cause or some great adventure, she's in it for the money. She's greedy and wants to get filthy rich and that's it. This simple and relatable position for most characters makes Keijo quite a lot of fun as nobody in it seems anything else than human. It is rather amazing how entertaining it gets just from that.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the makers are definitely self-aware and know that this cannot be taken fully seriously, but unlike some rather poor parody shows, they've managed to make a solid balance between what needs to be pictured as serious and what doesn't.\\n\r\nThe fights will be depicted seriously, as will character decisions and reactions, but at the same time they will invent all sorts of goofy butt techniques and extend the goofyness to the point Fate Stay Night's Unlimited Blade Works becomes Unlimited Butt Workings and Attack on Titan gets a rather interesting butt-oriented remix. \\n\\n\r\nThe mix of relatable characters, understandable fights taken seriously, and very silly butt stuff, makes the entire show really fun.\\n\r\nLots of fanservice shows cater to the viewer's fantasies and ego. It's always about showing him what he wishes could exist. Keijo dodges that low-brow bullet gracefully and instead sits comfortably on the idea that you can make an anime about butts and still make it logical, entertaining and relatable. It's not here to praise your ego or celebrate your private parts, it's just a fun little fight anime with butts in it. Even the visual part of the fanservice is rather sheltered.\\n\r\nOn a small complaint note, as a tits man, I wish there'd be less butt techniques and more chest ones. \\n\\n\r\nBut overall, I recommend Keijo as a simple, well-done action/humor anime with lots of asses in it. It's been far more entertaining than I'd have expected and everyone around me also seems to have been enjoying it just as greatly.",

            "content": "\"Mankind. Back when we still walked on all fours, we always had in front of us...the butt. Then, from the time mankind started walking on two legs, we stopped having butts stick in our faces all the time, and in their place, what appeared in front of our faces...were boobs!. Woman grew larger breasts to take the place of the buttocks. The original source of life is the buttocks! Boobs are just a substitute! Boobs are nothing more than a pale imitation of the buttocks!. If asked what you'd rather have, a copy or an original, naturally, I would choose the original!\" - Kiyoshi fromPrison School\\n\\n\r\nLA: Well if you say it like that Kiyoshi, Keijo!!!!!!!! must be like Citizen Kane to you.\\n\\n\r\nIt is one of those animes where they have a crazy and all out weird premise (that being Keijo...think boob and butt wrestling) but take it to serious extremes with the characters taking it utterly seriously like an extreme sport atmosphere and that, LA just fell in love with it's seriousness to the insanely intentionally ridiculous premise, because seriously....ASSology and Booblogy lectures, Butt themed attacks like Butt Gatling and Vacuum Butt Cannon and a hierarchy class within the sport of Keijo itself, yes it's quite obvious this is blatantly LA's guiltiest pleasure of Fall 2016 and LA doesn't care what anybody says about it.\\n\\n\r\nCompounding how batshit crazy serious (and as the side effect ridiculous) Keijo takes itself, it's also because of how it takes this crazy fanservicey sport with how it takes the sport terminology to how the \"fighting types\" do, such as the main cast group of Nozomi Kaminashi, Sayaka Miyata, Kazane Aoba and Non Toyoguchi. Sayaka Miyata is the speedster type and has a pretty good rivalry towards Rin Rokudou voiced by Rie Takanashi, Kazane Aoba is the tactical group type and can easily tell their opponents fighting style by touching their butts (seriously) to Non Toyoguchi who is the literal softy...she-she-she she has a soft butt that's it but can reflect the more steel butt variants, finally we have the main protagonist Nozomi who uses a One-Hit Kill attacks, to evolving to balancing out to be both an agile tanker. As much as Keijo is just a crazy premise and \"might\" be fanservice overload, but with how they use this sport and actually talk about how the sport functions in a VERY serious yet ridiculously funny way and the fanservice isn't \"overload\" per say and sure fanservice is ABOUND in this anime, but the \"fanservice\" is \"integrated\" properly into Keijo to the point LA can see that Keijo just doesn't \"put\" fanservice there \"just because\", instead integrates the fanservice into the sport a la tactical butt attacks and fanservice isn't the SOLE focus of the series, it's the sport itself and it's variety of butt fighters and LA just LOVES how they prides itself in execution of the utter ridiculousness atmosphere and how serious it takes Keijo as a serious sport (to the point of having many of the major to minor characters to have differing and varying body types in which it affects their fighting style) and that meshes so well that brings out it's appeal, not just dollar store fanservice from typical fanservice anime. If anything it reminds LA of Prison School, but not under the extreme vers. of a highschool romance plot, but in a serious sport setting instead.\\n\\n\r\nOk, taking all this in (if ya want to), let's change our focus to the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with Kazane Aoba and Non Toyoguchi, they are both shy in some form, but with their Keijo powers, they more or less develop themselves as great players with their powers, Non with her soft butt, Kazane with her Gilgamesh ripoff mimicry attacks (no seriously) and even better as a duo (Kazane as the strategist and offensive player, Non as the defensive player tanking to protect Kazane), Kazane if anything gains her character development to both evolve her powers and open herself up to everyone, LA felt that Non was more or less having the same development plotline but as a support to Kazane. The more majorly defined main cast would go to both Sayaka Miyata and Nozomi Kaminashi. Sayaka Miyata has GREAT character investment, something LA NEARLY missed out on, nonetheless, Sayaka has parental issues with her leaving judo for Keijo and compounding this, she too is shy with her new friends (besides Nozomi). Her investment is well worth it considering what a way she goes out on a la Keijo battle bringing this issue into the forefront. Finally we'll go to Nozomi, who just wants to be the a Keijo Queen for the prize money. At first she's a hot-blooded, head first main protagonist and an underdog even on her own school, however like most shounen sports anime, she quickly becomes the ace, but not with some form of obstacles which comes from her own limited butt powers and her along with Sayaka (and by extension Kazane) quickly brings up her own character development in the form of trying to her improve herself by covering all grounds (too powerful in strength, then work on speed vice versa). LA's favoruite character would go to Nozomi and fine she's slightly bland in some respects but LA found her genkiness and seriousness endearing, second place would easily go to Sayaka. Come the East-West War arc, the opponents Nozomi's gang fought against to be in the Elite class, she and the gang and heck the entire Elite class gains a bit of camaraderie into being the best Keijo school in Japan and sure it's quite obvious that the opposing Keijo school has a slight bit of \"rivalry for rivalry sake\", nonetheless, the entire \"team battles\" the East-West War definitely gave the sense of camaraderie which gave not only the characters development as a group (and powers), but individually as well. \\n\\n\r\nEven outside the main characters and even their school, the opposing school does gets some bit of development if you count \"their powers are their personality\", though the only one that properly got \"what their powers is\", and \"their reasoning to win\" goes to Maya Sakashiro due to her essentially being the \"final boss\" in a ways and really her \"character development\" made her both a formidable opponent and an interesting character as to WHY she wants to win. But to backtrack a bit, during Nozomi's gang period of trying to become Elite class, their opponents get the same \"powers = personality\", though they get slightly more in-depth as to why they want to win or want to Keijo in the first place (it makes sense due to the East-West War later on, trying to develop them further), it's nice character development placement and helped characters who were once opponents to strong-willed allies to Nozomi and the gang.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Xebec, well from the batshit sensebility of the anime, LA will easily say during the \"races\" nearly EVERY SINGLE race were brilliantly animated and quite detailed like a shounen anime and because of that, it quite easily pumps adrenaline to the majority of the Keijo Races. Character designs are quite diverse as LA said at the beginning of the anime review, all with many body sizes, even to the over-exaggerated character \"accessories\" to the more obvious differing boobs and butts which makes the cast really lively. However where the greater detail goes to Keijo races, there were some instances quite rare ones where the facial animation to some of the \"butt animation\" felt like slightly off-model in some cases, but not to the point of being blatant about it, but it's a compromise for the greater detailed Keijo races for the most part so it can get an easy saving grace for LA. Xebec going full-shounen in a fanservicey anime is quite frankly a dream come true for fanservice fans and it quite frankly delivered in an animation standpoint even with it's discrepancies. Mind you as much as the fanservice is used in proper execution and there are some ass and boobs shots, the anime actually never shows the full breast or full ass and does some good improvisation on censorship when the attacks goes full crazy working to it's advantage for it's fanservice even further. Again, a focus on it's actionized-plot and it's characters than it's fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nLA really doesn't talk much about the \"sound\" in most reviews, but LA has to say when boobs clashes with butts or boobs, LA just loves how the impact is sooo \"satisying\" itself to even the static sonic boom sound effects, it really makes the sound department really going all out, just like the crazy and ridiculous Keijo battles themselves, but that in itself allows the battles to be amazingly done and just feels like a bomb just got released after ever battle. The sound effects in Keijo was just GREAT.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, the voice cast was amazing in this anime, with Lynn who voiced Nozomi being LA's favourite voice actor just for her sheer genkiness and high-toned \"shouting\" vocals overall. Really the vocal cast for Keijo went their all with this one with everyone having a chance to shout at the top of thier lungs for the most part, but if there were any distinctions LA would point out, it would be M.A.O and Kaede Hondo as Sayaka and Kazane respectively along with Saori Oonishi as Non obviously due to them having main character statuses towards them, but nonetheless they have the same strengths that Lynn underwent, though under their archetypes like deadpan snarker and \"only normal one here\" Sayaka to the actual deadpan shy one Kazane to the Kansai shy vocals from Non. The Keijo opponents also gets needs to be taken into note for LA, from Shizuka Ishigami as Kotone Fujisaki due to her \"don't care\" to yaoi fangirling vocals, Rena Maeda as Hanabi Kawai due to her genki moe vocals turn full ax crazy vocals when on the land and finally Maya Sakashiro voiced by Ayako Kawasumi from her really shy vocals to her again more ax crazy vocals. Overall what can LA say but the vocal cast is AMAZING with no one seiyuu doing a dull performance.\\n\\n\r\nHaving seen the English dub by Funimation and to be honest it was very well cast, with Amber Lee Connors as the every genki Nozomi Kaminashi and her having the \"Kansai accenting\" similar to Lynn had fit Amber's vocals quite well and to be frank, Amber Lee Connors was LA's favourite dub actor because of it. Felecia Angelle and Alexis Tipton as Sayaka and Kazane respectively did well with their wispy and \"pseudo-deadpan\" vocals but like Amber Lee Connors, they fit into their roles quite well, if Amber Lee Connors wasn't LA's favourite, Felecia Angelle would have easily taken it. Sarah Wiedenheft as Non along with Alex Moore as Rin Rokudou has a bit of the accenting that is somewhat there and a little bit distracting at times and LA knows in the Japanese that they got it too, but Non it was for comedic purposes although Sarah's Texan accenting was showing but that was the point, LA really didn't know what to think about Alex Moore's accenting, but it soon was ignorable and LA nitpicking to the point LA quite enjoyed Alex Moore as Rin even with her accenting. If anything LA could go through all the Funimation dub cast to this but even with all the nitpicks LA might take towards this dub, the dub cast is GREAT with the same extremities that the Japanese took considering the nature of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nLA gets it as much as this is LA's unabashed guiltiest anime for Fall 2016 heck 2016 in general, but LA gets it, this anime just might not be for everyone, from how batshit \"stupid\" this anime is and you could easily say this is exploiting fanservice. Nonetheless, for LA...LA just did not care, the batshit \"stupid\", rather for LA made the tone and atmosphere of the anime all the more focused, it's an anime where girls uses their boobs and butts...like another words, you \"DON'T\" need to take it soooooo seriously and WOULD you take it sooo seriously if LA even said this statement?..you wouldn't, as for fanservice, well again for LA, it didn't feel exploited as it's intentionally and oddly enough the boob and ass shots didn't feel intentional, unless it was used for comedic moments. Agree or not, since this is LA's review, well these elements improved the anime instead of being a detriment.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending or more or less the final race was just AMAZING, from the shounen-esque animation and great impactful sound effects, the final episode did kinda go into the uncanny valley slightly but still, making a final clash between Maya Sakashiro and Nozomi Kaminashi was an amazing way to go out on.  \\n\\n\r\nKeijo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! is LA's most guiltiest anime for 2016 and was LA's second favourite anime for Fall 2016, but nonetheless, from the great animation in the Keijo races and colorful character designs and \"powers\" to the somewhat ok \"underdog main protagonist sports anime\" and using the fanservice in proper execution and not in your face and embraces it instead. LA wants a second season, no joke and considering what possibilities the ending gave us it could. LA haven't seen something this refreshing under the fanservice banner in quite some time and Keijo quite honestly delivered it and with LA honestly saying it's LA's guiltiest anime for 2016 AND LA's second favourite anime for Fall 2016 that's saying something.",

            "content": "To start off Keijo is indeed going to be one of my all time favorite guilty pleasure anime, and actually in the top  anime of the fall season, but all the same, DO NOT keep my bias in mind.\r\nFor story is gets a 6, although its technically original in the concept of women fighting with there breasts and butts, its got all the regular concepts from sports anime, athletes training to be the best, the athletes having something to prove, a main protagonist with way to much natural skill, and lastly the inevitable factor of the protagonists, and their team being the under dogs.\r\nForart it gets a 7, there isn't much to say really, the show has nice art, nothing crazy but earns the extra 2 points that keep it at a 7 instead of a 5, with the fights usually very well choreographed and the \"special abilities\" of the athletes being pretty funny, over the top, or just plain appealing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nFor sound it gets a 5, again not much to say, the sounds all fit, and work with the show, the voice acting is solid and has a good amount of emotion to it, but nothing really blew me away.\\n\\n\r\nFor character it gets a 6, the characters personalities are all very basic, you get the normal tropes, such as strong silent, op protagonist, always happy \"the glass half full\", the works, but with that said not a whole lot of character development outside of there skills in the show improving. \\n\\n\r\nFor enjoyment the show gets a 10, I loved this show, and had fun the whole way through, it dose not take its self seriously and is just an overall good ride, check it out if you like fan service, and over the top action, and just have fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this anime a 8, that may seem high for my scores above, but its really enjoyable, and is practically making fun of itself the whole way through, IMO, its a breath of fresh air, if you are looking for something enjoyable, and just wanna kick back and relax.\\n\\n\r\nSee you on the Land!",

            "content": "This review may contain some spoilers.\r\nStory (1/10): \r\nThe story tells of the journey of 4 girls in the world of Keijo, a sport that uses breasts and butts to fight, the objective is to throw their opponet out of the base, which is a platform that is like a giant float that floats in the water, there are two ways to win: when the opponent is thrown from the base and falls into the water, or when she loses by knockout.\r\nThe story of keijo besides being ridiculous does not make any sense.\r\nWell, why does not that make any sense? Because who really are strong inkeijo are THE MAIN CHARACTERS, a sport anime is based on overcoming right? The main characters start at the lowest level and try to improve over time, right? Not with keijo. What is the point of having a certain potential, if this one is already overcome in the first challenge? The west school lost to the east school 10 times, but when the protagonists who were beginners arrived all of that changed, it does not make any sense, the east school was supposed to be one of the greatest challenges, something difficult to overcome by the size of the invincibility and talent that the competitors had, but the protagonists breaks this invincibility in the first attempt to overcome it, really the school east is invincible... Keijo demonstrates that it is not a sport anime, so what is left? The ecchi, that's what Keijo is, an anime totally focused on ecchi with an illusory premise of a sports anime, I do not even want to comment on the scenes of \"drama\" that Keijo has, trying to be serious with a premise of a fight using breasts And asses, are you kidding me? It was better to have done an anime totally focused on comedy, it would make more sense with a premise as stupid as that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation (3/10): \\n\r\nThe design of the characters is poor, you notice heavy clothes, hair, face, badly pixelated, looks like it was 144p, horrible and strange, I do not know if it was due to lack of time, but it's no excuse to leave the finished art wrong , The animation of the \"fights\" is simple and sometimes strange, it focuses on the faces of the characters, you only hears the sound of \"blows\", The breasts of the characters get bigger than they really are, just like the ass, I found the color of the \"powers\" extraordinarily colorful, What saves is the \"fights\" that are at least decent to see, but nothing very impressive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack (2/10): \\n\r\nThe OP is decent, at least it gives a little hype to the anime. ED is horrible, annoying and boring. The sound effects are horrible, it seems that popping sounds that sizzle, too annoying, is something that makes \"fight\" scenes worse than they already are.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2/10): \\n\r\nKaminashi Nozomi: She loves Keijo, likes to face strong opponents (not that strong), has a very strong relationship with Miyata Sayaka and just that... This is the development of the main character of Keijo, exactly ZERO, backstory? Who cares? She's cute, has big boobs and a great ass, does not need a backstory or a decent reason to want to be professional in the sport, she wants money and strong people to face, this is the protagonist of Keijo.\\n\r\nShe cuts the wind with her ass...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMiyata Sayaka: She loves Keijo, likes to face strong opponents (not that strong), wait? You already read this, right? She is basically the same thing, apart from having a backstory, she changed judo by Keijo, because she loves keijo. End of her\u00b4s backstory, that's all.\\n\r\nShe is fast and agile, when she puts her may glued to the butt gets more agile, that's her ability...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAoba Kazane: Has nothing to talk about her, apart from being smart and very strategic in \"fights\", and having a Gate of Babylon of butts, she is the shy of the 4 main characters and maybe the only one that I really found decent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nToyoguchi Non: She's stupid, boring, annoying, has no reason to exist. Her ability is to have a butt and soft breasts that recaptures the \"attacks\" of the opponents, she does absolutely nothing useful besides serving for fanservice and ecchi scenes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10): \\n\r\nStupid comedy, drama that makes me laugh more than the anime comedy, fights up interesting to see, ecchis idiot scenes, well, already gave to realize that I did not have any enjoyment while watching.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (2/10): \\n\r\nKeijo is just an anime made for ecchi and fanservice, an original but stupid plot, idiot characters that seem more sex dolls than at least decent, since it has no focus for me to be interested in them, horrible soundtrack, animation at least Descente in the \"fights\" and an stupid comedy. I recommend seeing with your friends just to laugh how stupid it is.",

            "content": "Imagine living in a world where the most popular sport is played by cute girls in bikini IN A WATER BATTLE ROAYLE....using only their butts and breasts. Yup, that's basically Keijo!!!!!!!! for you.\r\nAs the 8 exclamation marks might suggest, its an over the top anime that mostly focuses on the sport or the echi in it. Speaking of which, this show is no  Haikyuu!! with its action intensity that will make you go out and play volleyball, nor Kiss x Sis with its lewd intensity that will make you go fu... \r\nnever mind that.\r\nThe show follows a girl with the name Kaminashi that startstraining at a camp to be the best at Keijo and achieve her dream of being a professional. Later on it is revealed that there's a rivalry between two schools, one of which is Nozomi's. She is set to defend her school's pride and show what she is capable of with the friends she has made throughout the way. As you can see, the plot isn't original at the very least (a plot that can be put on any sports anime and it will probably work), but that is not the strong side of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show shines with how beautiful the sceneries and characters look. While having a lot of action scenes, which suggests a lot of frames needed for them to look good, none of the budget was spared in that aspect.\\n\r\nWhile the music isn't something extraordinary and most of the time you could barely notice it, it does its job fine and doesn't distract you from the anime itself. One thing to note is the music in the opening. For the whole 12-episode run I was not able to make myself skip it even once because of how fitting it is and sets you in the mood of watching some girl-on-girl action on a water platform (yes, music is capable of such things). \\n\\n\r\nWhile the opening hypes you up, you start to wonder what the characters are like. And to your belief, they aren't as flat as you would guess from an ecchi that its sole purpose is to show girls bash their butts towards one another. Throughout the series, you sense that the characters have changed at least a bit after every battle they have and they learn a lot with the help of their friends. There's something unique in each character's design and personality that mixes well when we take into account their goals/past. For example Miyata, Kaminashi's first friend and rival, wants to prove to everyone that she has made the right choice of pursuing keijo after abandoning training judo under her father's guidance, but her complex about her bosom size is a hindrance, while simultaneously a boost when she decides to encourage that side of hers.\\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the most important part: the enjoyment you will/might receive whilst watching the show. As you could have guessed by now, keijo will not make you see the world through a new pair of eyes, it could certainly make you do that through laughter. To fully enjoy it, your brain should definitely be turned off and just expect anything to happen and a good time is promised. How will you not laugh or question what even is happening if quotes like \"...you must take your butt to the absolute limit\" or \"...she's called ass-eater Nanase at school!\" are thrown nonchalantly every possible moment? Another thing is the name of some of the attacks. I swear, the creative department should've gotten a raise after inventing such classic techniques such as \"hypno tits\",\"assteroid afterglow\",\"tit-fang attack\" and most importantly \"vacuum butt cannon\".\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the anime is good enough for me to recommend it while having one thing in mind: don't overthink what is happening, just accept it at it is.\\n\r\nWhile it is not a masterpiece by any stretch or would it be remember as a classic in the not so distant future, Keijo could definitely fill your spare time and have a great one. \\n\\n\r\nAs for recommendations, there are three routes to take, each depending on what you liked in the anime:\\n\r\n-sports route- if you liked what you saw but wondered what it would be like, but with boys and with less action, the same season that brought Keijo brings you Yuri on Ice as well.\\n\r\n-over the top action route- There was no way to put this here after watching the last episode, but Kill la Kill. The final battle itself is a reference to Kill la Kill\\n\r\n-ecchi- there are far more 'ecchier' anime than Keijo, but I will give it props for not being the entire focus of the anime, just a way to catch the viewers eye. If you want 'true' ecchi, try Highschool DxD on for size!\\n\\n",

            "content": "First thing first. You might question why this series had so many exclamation marks on its title. I have no idea. Second, I watched the whole anime while turning my brain off for maximum enjoyment, so my viewpoint is basically from a brain-dead guy who watches this anime for shit and giggles (or more accurately, for boobs and butts). Thirdly, this anime is not for everyone, so some might find it to be jarring. Forth, I might use a lot of words like boobs, breast, butts and asses, so bear with me. Now that we get that clear, let us have a review on Keijo,a national treasure of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime had a relatively simple, plain plot. It's boobs and butts the sport, with characters fighting with each others to be the best throughout the whole story. As such, one does not have to use much brain cell that is left to understand the story because it is pretty much direct and self-explanatory. Most of the time it is predictable, but that does not hinder it from being entertaining. It is just absurdly fun because it's just plain ridiculous. Who would have thought that a sport using just butt and boobs will be so intense? The name and the way the tecniques were executed are just out of this world. Meteor Hip, Vacuum But canon, Gate of Bootylon? You name it. Also, in case you noticed, there are a lot of references from popular anime where they changed it to suite the Keijo theme, which is always a plus. The more the anime progress, the more ridiculous it become, to the point that it's just plain stupid. Yet since by the time you progress that far, you might not care anymore since the brain is already in an inactive state. In the end, the story itself become rather negligible, and all the anime is worth is its fancy action and creative way of executing it. Also, I haven't read any of the manga, but I've been told that a lot of parts had been cut off just because the number of volumes the manga had. As such, I can't really make any comparison or elaborate much on that.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, Keijo features a huge array of cast with voluptuous, fit body shape of all kind. The main character, Kaminashi Nozomi is your generic \"I will become the best and very rich\" type who speak with a dialect, which is a nice touch. There aren't really other noteworthy traits from her but at the same time she is not bad character wise. Her other friend, Miyata Sayaka is more level-headed character with a bust complex. She is given enough development and decent enough to watch. There is also Aoba Kazane who is a more timid, smart girl and your usual klutz Toyoguchi Non with soft, squishy part, where all of them share the same room altogether. All the other characters are there just to support the main casts, and aren't given enough development which is understandable given how many the characters were in the anime and having to put all of them in a single cour.\\n\\n\r\nKeijo!!!!!!!! have a rather decent animation and art, which makes up for the poor storyline. The usage of sharp, flat colours with defined outline makes it pleasant to watch. All the action scene are very fluid and fun to watch as a whole.The damage inflicted each time the hit connects feels painful, and the way the body move is smooth and flow wonderfully. The usage of cinematic camera, as well as well placed camera is praiseworthy. The studio knows its priority, and that's always a good thing. The music is average to say the most. Most of the ost used fits well with the scene, while the OP and ED is fun to watch and listen to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Keijo!!!!!!!! is a really fun and enjoyable anime to watch, given that you denies all the logic and reason when watching it. It is a perfect anime for boobs and asses connoisseur who want to see what such magnificent body parts could achieve more. It is not an anime for everyone tho, people who despise fanservice might hate it to the core, dissing it for its ridiculous, poor story and absurd theme. But in the end of the day, it is a fanservice anime, and I can say it does its job well done.",

Just thinking about it makes my spine hurts but that's the point of \"Keijo!!!!!!!!\": it thrives in its own ridiculousness. With this show, you either like it or you don't. So I would suggest you to watch the first episode and what you see is what you get. \r\nFor me, I thought this show was good and really enjoyable. The show lies between being a parody of sports and martial arts anime with all of the girls' move being named every time they use it. The fight scenes are one of the best oneI have seen so far and the art work with their use of sexy, thick, black, border-outline is wonderful. The character designs are great; however, if you're looking for some kind of good character development then turn away from this show because it has little. It sometimes tries to add some depths to it's character by suddenly throwing flashbacks during the fight scenes I find kind of annoying; I watch Keijo!!!!!!!! because of the sport Keijo itself.",

            "content": "Keijo!!!!!!!!, with all 8 exclamation marks being absolutely necessary, is an outrageous show about swimsuit-clad women fighting each other with their butts and boobs in a kind of sumo-wrestling parody. Sounds outrageous, right?\r\nThe most outrageous thing about Keijo!!!!!!!! is how touching it can be.\r\nMake no mistake, Keijo is bonkers. But instead of simply filling the screen with butts doing battle, a lot of work has been put into the little things. We follow Nozomi, a somewhat typical protagonist, that is, a ridiculously arrogant yet free-spirited soul, as she attends Setouji Keijo Training School, an academy specifically for Keijo. However, what I was not expecting atall was how dedicated she is to improving - almost an entire episode was used to let her explore her weakness in the ring; pulling turnips with her hips to improve her speed. \\n\\n\r\nThis aspiration is not unique to her character alone, however. Put into Room 309 with the other expected-drop-outs, the four girls of the room, Sayaka, Non and Kazane, come together to beat the low expectations of them. The group use Kazane\u2019s smartness but must overcome her shyness first, and it\u2019s surprisingly human how they become friends and allow her to come out of her shell. But, unlike some shows where character development is for nought, Kazane continues to use what she\u2019s learned throughout the rest of the show, most notably when she teams up with and leads a couple of Keijoers she doesn\u2019t know to attempt to beat the school\u2019s number 1 Keijo player.\\n\\n\r\nThe underlying use of subplots in this show is superb. Sayaka, who is undoubtedly the 2nd most important character of this show, is an ex-Judo champion, even having represented Japan. Quitting Judo to pursue Keijo, she has a lot of expectations to live up to, both internally and externally. Watching her overcome these was inspirational. Watching her father finally coming to understand her dreams conflict with his own and accepting that, was touching. Need I remind you this is a show about clashing butts?\\n\\n\r\nThe battles themselves are exceptionally creative. In fact, the reason I started watching this show was seeing a picture of Kazane\u2019s \u201cGATE OF BOOTYLON\u201d power and giggling so much I simply had to get some context. Power moves are crazy fun, such as Kotone\u2019s Cerberus-butt and \u201cTitty Hypnosis\u201d, and allow for constant surprises in the the tense fights. The use of crazy sounds such as machine guns, explosions, rubber-bands and high-pitched cringing slaps makes you feel the prominence of every attack - and it hurts.\\n\\n\r\nOf the most impressive aspects of this show is the friendship. As each character of Setouji is pitted against each other, every time the will show veer you to root for a certain character, either through prior character development, underdog stories\u2026 you name it. But later, you will be rooting for the character you once wanted to see booted off the platform - simply because we\u2019ve seen them change for the better. It\u2019s inspiring, and a little awkward to have my heart tugged from side-to-side by the show\u2019s strong writing, when it draws from women fighting with butts.\\n\\n\r\nThe most surprising thing about Keijo!!!!!!!? The fanservice isn\u2019t even that prominent. The character designs are varied - such as their overweight former-champion for a teacher, the body-builder shapes, the overly-defined-hourglass curves and the more regular straight bodies with varying sizes of prominent features. Though, I must say, if you don't like muscley girls, you won't like the girls of Keijo. Perhaps the show lingers for too long looking at a certain angle, but it never feels particularly like camera-angles are decided by a pervert. They feel more like a sports show.\\n\\n\r\nBecause that's what it is. A ridiculously good sport show, with a crazy concept, a unique sense of friendship and a hilarious script that you're doing yourself a disservice not to watch. If only for the giggles.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nLouis R\u00e9ard is credited as the inventor of one of man\u2019s greatest creations: the bikini.\r\nHe apparently based the name for his unconventional clothing on the Bikini Atoll where nuclear testing occurred. And, when you think about it more closely, the dude\u2019s a genius. He essentially invented public lingerie for women. They are less see-through and laced than their undergarment girlfriends, but they serve the same function of hoisting chests and concealing groins in a sexy manner.\r\nThe bikini also serves another purpose: to give onlookers a wonderful view of the behind. Looking at butts is nodoubt swell, but Keijo!!!!!!!! (that\u2019s eight exclamation points for those counting at home) proves that they can be used for more than just sitting and pleasure.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nKeijo (dropping those exclamation points for the time being) stars Nozomi Kaminashi, a young woman hoping to make it big in the brand-new sport that has got everybody talking: keijo. Using her butt, boobs, and body, Nozomi, along with her best friend Sayaka Miyata and many other keijo-women-in-training, does what she can to make her dreams of wealth and fame become reality.\\n\\n\r\nMost people, before they begin the show, ask a fair question: \u201cWhat the heck is keijo?\u201d To answer this question, it\u2019s best to look at another franchise that does something similar: the Dead or Alive video-game series. More specifically, Dead or Alive: Xtreme Beach Volleyball features a mini-game titled \u201cButt Battle.\u201d In short, two women fight to push each other off their platform with nothing besides their backsides.\\n\\n\r\nIn Keijo, take this concept and turn the dial up to eleven.\\n\\n\r\nMultiple competitors battle simultaneously. That platform morphs its properties and topographies. Boobs are added to each woman\u2019s arsenal. Infighters, outfighters, and counters denote different fighting styles. Wealth, fame, and glory await those skilled and driven enough. The rules of keijo remain about the same \u2013 only feet can touch the ground, falling into the water indicates a loss \u2013 but to deem keijo as merely a \u201cbutt battle\u201d doesn\u2019t do the sport any justice.\\n\\n\r\nBut these traits only get that dial to ten at most. To crank it beyond the limit, Keijo likewise breaks its own limits, bending reality and believability with the introduction of a key component: power moves.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character has a signature ability or set of abilities that both defines them as a person and elevates keijo past just a bunch of women shifting their backsides at one another. Sayaka perfected her \u201cW-Acceleration,\u201d boosting her speed to immeasurable levels to cut through space-time without a second thought. Hanabi owns the \u201cButt Guillotine,\u201d slamming her derriere from above with enough force to decapitate any unfortunate soul who meets her cheeks. And Nozomi, the main protagonist, obviously uses the strongest technique of them all, the \u201cVacuum Butt Cannon,\u201d a rotating, whirling mass of energy that insanely endangers the user yet decimates any foes (and clothes) in its path.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, from the rules to the structure to the powers, it all sounds silly, right?\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s because it is.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Keijo does well is taking this silliness and playing it straight. Beyond straight, what with its monologues on fighting to reach the top, the overly detailed explanations, and the seriousness in their approach to strategy. So straight in fact that, despite the stupidity of the sport, the anime likens itself to others in its given genres. The battles become intense bouts where special abilities collide, winning is the ultimate prize, and friendship among rivals remains as steadfast as ever. Just with less shots on net and more butts per shake.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yes, Kazane using her \u201cGate of Bootylon\u201d, a fatefully reminiscent and entirely absurd hidden power, atop interconnected floating planes is as ridiculous as it reads. But when Kazane doesn\u2019t want to let down her teammates after all their support, and the prospect of becoming champions is on the line, her subsequent \u201cBoob Dunk\u201d against the opponent\u2019s \u201cLeft Perky Pile Piper\u201d turns this scene into a dramatic and important ordeal.\\n\\n\r\nWith butts and boobs driving the narrative, the other sexual acts don\u2019t feel out of place. Sayaka feeling up Nozomi\u2019s buttocks is her physically detecting the progress she has made. And the figure-eight hip rotations the women perform are simply one piece to their training regimen. Ecchi content of this kind feels like a natural extension of the show itself, leading to lewd situations that make a surprising amount of sense in context (and more than arousing in perspective).\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say the anime doesn\u2019t include some extra ecchi events as appetizers and side dishes. Because it totally does. Kusukai feels up Nozomi on more than one occasion for the fun of it, and Sayaka standing in front of the mirror, playfully saying \u201cBounce, bounce!\u201d, only exists to give her more sexy screen time (which should never be argued against).\\n\\n\r\nSimilar thoughts can be said for the keijo bouts as well. For, no matter how dire the plot gets, it\u2019s still hard to not laugh at the flying butts and the the silly names for the power moves. For example, the Suraga twins cause Murata to sing a butt-inspired variation of \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle Little Star\u201d after their \u201cAssteroid Afterglow\u201d distracts her.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, Keijo\u2019s ability to deliver a \u201cserious\u201d narrative, built on a foundation formed from a ridiculous premise and booty for days, gets taken seriously. A feat in and of itself. One could even claim that the anime (and thus the mind behind the show) has some subtle commentary on what it believes is the best feature of the female body: nipples. After all, the three races in the East-West War were each decided by neither butts nor boobs but nipples.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the ending is a bit strange, how they all pretty much go their separate ways (save for Sayaka and Nozomi) as they crawl into the big leagues. Also, no deeper themes beyond the typical perseverance and sportsmanship ones are explored. And, truth be told, the novelty of the whole premise has waned after twelve episodes.\\n\\n\r\nStill, Nozomi says it best after her win in the East-West War. In some nice full-circle writing on the anime\u2019s part, Nozomi drifts slowly deeper into the water, echoing the same words that shortly followed her first lost and that started this whole tale: \u201cKeijo is amazin\u2019!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAnd nobody else can phrase it better than that.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nIn an ecchi anime like Keijo, it\u2019s important to have attractive character designs and arousing moments. For the most part, the anime delivers the milk and the meat.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the designs of the characters first, they don\u2019t all have the same level of nuance, but many achieve that needed attractiveness. Varied hairdos and colors, different sizes for their assets, and hot bathing suits of the bikini and one-piece variety.\\n\\n\r\nNozomi\u2019s design is particularly interesting thanks to its parallels with her character. She has the Goldilocks physique \u2013 a bust and backside that are not overly big or unduly small but oh so right \u2013 that goes along with her main-protagonist status while her double ahoge atop her head indicates doubly her overall silliness.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the anime doesn\u2019t have the most impressive visuals around. That\u2019s because the setting itself doesn\u2019t change too much, and a structure floating on some water is not exactly exciting. Plus, the actual animation worsens over time. It\u2019s pretty fluid near the beginning of the season, but, by the end, it\u2019s clear that the resources behind the scenes have dwindled. There\u2019s even a moment in episode ten when Sanae\u2019s mouth movements blatantly fail to synchronize with her voice.\\n\\n\r\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that the characters stand around a lot when not battling, explaining everything that is currently unfolding for the audience.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, the anime puts effort elsewhere to make up for the stale setting and the lacking movement. For instance, Keijo almost always goes overboard with the delivery of its power moves. Imaginative scenes often play out, huge words and letters dominate the screen, and a flurry of swinging hips and flashing colors further the pizzazz. The anime also includes, on occasion, a comedic style for the reactions and the moments that are clearly meant for laughter.\\n\\n\r\nMost importantly, Keijo emphasizes the women and their bodies. Frontal shots of their chests, low shots of their butts, and full profiles provide both sides of the goodness, giving the audience that arousal they have been looking for.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nKeijo fills its space with as many butts and boobs as possible.\\n\\n\r\nNo one\u2019s assets are more important than those of Nozomi, the main protagonist. Nozomi loves keijo and money. Thus, to her, pursuing the top spot and becoming the so-called \u201cprize queen\u201d of the sport makes almost too much sense.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very first episode, it\u2019s clear that Nozomi has a lot of strength, a lot of passion, and a lot of heart. Her flips and momentum give her a spinning edge that, while not yet refined, proves her worth on the \u201cbattlefield.\u201d Then, despite losing out on one of the coveted spots in the Elite Class, she reaffirms why she fell in love with keijo, experiencing the strength of other fellow fighters. And, all the while, her happy-go-lucky, energetic, and affable personality keeps her spirits high and attracts the friendship of those around her.\\n\\n\r\nAfter her, Sayaka, Kazane, and Non become a solid team and even better friends, Nozomi accidentally uses the monstrous \u201cVacuum Butt Cannon,\u201d a move so powerful that it could potentially injure the user permanently. Wanting to harness this power to reach her goal, Nozomi wears a UTM \u2013 a rubberized suit that constricts the body \u2013 for a month straight, training her muscles and hips to handle the power of that move.\\n\\n\r\nShe succeeds in using her newfound power against Kotone, the wielder of Cerberus. And, alongside her closest friends, she moves into the Elite Class. During their training camp, though, her instructor, a pro keijo player named Shirayuki, tells Nozomi that she has a weakness that she must correct if she ever wishes to fight professionally atop the land.\\n\\n\r\nOne thousand turnips later, Nozomi controls the inertia of her hip swings, giving her thicker butt the \u201cButt Flash\u201d into \u201cMeteor Hip\u201d combo and demonstrating once more the dedication she has towards honing her body and her craft. The culmination of her season-long efforts showcases itself in the final round of the East-West War. Marking her first spot in the history books, Nozomi defeats Maya and with her the unstoppable East. Nozomi not only claims the championship for her school but also proves to everyone that the pro scene is about to be shaken up by one of the best players of all time to grace its ranks.\\n\\n\r\nNozomi\u2019s climb is filled with tough obstacles and important self-realizations. She trains harder than anyone on her quest to be the best, and she proves that she is time and again. When taking a step back, though, her character arc cannot exactly be classified as exciting. She isn\u2019t a woman with a personal conflict she must overcome, and she doesn\u2019t start her journey from the absolute bottom. I.e., Nozomi is nice and dedicated but not much else.\\n\\n\r\nYet she is, for she brings something vastly worthwhile: positivity.\\n\\n\r\nShe\u2019s obviously a positive person in nature with her happy smiles and general kindness. But such positivity goes further. Her lighthearted behavior alleviates the seriousness of keijo, letting others understand that the sport is as much about having fun as it is about winning. Her friendliness not only brings her closer with her \u201crivals\u201d like Kotone and Usagi but also forms a tighter bond among the entire class. And her drive keeps the spirt of the sport alive, heralding in a new chapter in the world of butts and boobs and battles.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, Nozomi is far from a well-written character, but her ability to embody what keijo is all about more than makes her fit as the star of this show.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar thoughts can be applied to a couple of the other cast members. That is, they aren\u2019t the epitome of writing thanks to Keijo injecting backstory only when it is necessary, but they bring their own flavor nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nSayaka abandons judo despite her father\u2019s wishes. Her time with keijo gains her newfound friends and greater strength as she pursues her dream of stardom. And, in the end, her father comes to support his daughter. Sayaka represents the idea that choosing one\u2019s own path in life is vital for leading a happy life.\\n\\n\r\nMaya never had anyone rely on her or look her way until she met her instructor. From then on, she refused to back down no matter what. Nozomi forces Maya\u2019s second personality, Kaya, to emerge to protect herself from the pain of loss. Through Nozomi\u2019s few choice words, though, Maya comes back to properly finish her duel. Maya represents the idea that losing isn\u2019t the be all, end all that life may make it out to be.\\n\\n\r\nThese characters and even the ones that don\u2019t receive a whole ton of attention also arguably have their most important trait: the power moves. Once again, for many of the women, the parallels between their powers and their personalities indicates thoughtful construction.\\n\\n\r\nNon gives the gift of comedic relief with her clumsiness and falls (that \u201cdon\u2019t really happen\u201d). But, in keijo, her soft, pillowy bum acts as the ultimate supporting tool, defending those in need of assistance.\\n\\n\r\nKusakai is obsessed with cute girls, and Hanabi is head over heels for hot guys. When they fight, though, Kusakai\u2019s manipulative nature unfurls, and Hanabi\u2019s killer instinct takes over, making themselves out to be anything but attractive.\\n\\n\r\nKeijo does make hefty mistakes despite the representations and parallels it develops. Shirayuki, the \u201cMissile Lady of Kyoto,\u201d gets forgotten about after their training camp. The villains in East-West War don\u2019t have enough build-up to make them feel like worthy opponents. And Non arguably doesn\u2019t get enough time or attention, considering her main-character status and her spot as one of the four friends in Nozomi\u2019s group.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest oddity, though, is Kazane. She majorly loses not once but twice during the season. In both cases, the anime chalks it up to near misses \u2013 Kusukai is forced to use a forbidden move, and Sanae barely touched the water last. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem except for the fact that the anime ends before she has a chance to officially win. Her losses without a follow-up win go against Keijo\u2019s own mantras. How hard work and dedication eventually pay off in the long run. Apparently, not so for Kazane.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Nozomi\u2019s positive purpose and the show taking the time to establish other characters and connections keeps the cast from at least falling over.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nKeijo, perhaps surprisingly, backs its scenes most often with strong orchestral scores. They not only up the seriousness of the anime but also provide those feelings of triumph and thrill that support both the sport and the entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also doesn\u2019t let up on its flurry of sound-effects. The butts and the boobs do smack into one another. But the explosions, drills, cartwheels, drops, and teleportations. All sounds with obscene weight that fit the over-the-top the premise and are perfectly at home amidst the ultra-powerful and super-serious abilities.\\n\\n\r\nListening to the show\u2019s opening track, it achieves the same fun and seriousness that defines the content it precedes. The on-beat referee whistle and the back-and-forth \u201cHey!\u201d cheers in the background invite playfulness, and the scary, deliberate drop near the halfway mark spells out the fact that keijo isn\u2019t always for laughs. The OP even has a catchy beat, vocal harmonies, a fuller second half, and a lyrically cute start and finish. It\u2019s one butt that should be touched.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track, titled \u201cFantas/HIP Girlfriends,\u201d goes all lighthearted, almost slice-of-life in its presentation. Techno beats and sounds create the foundation, the women (formerly) of room 309 all sing together, and the first half offers three-step lyrics that are simple yet fun. Not a stellar ED by any means, but it\u2019s still worth a listen.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while the cast of Keijo is as large as the butts therein, not many notable voice-acting performances are provided. However, Lynn as Nozomi uses a dialect that adds charm to her character and thus ups her aura of positivity.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIn the Great Debate of Butts Versus Boobs, I argue in favor of the buttocks.\\n\\n\r\nYes, I am what society colloquially refers to as an \u201cass-man.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAs such, the beautiful butts brought to this bountiful buffet were bootylicious. Never had I seen an anime place so much emphasis, so much importance on the round, plump backsides before me. The small waists. The big hips. The glorious thiccness. I was enraptured by these butts (to say the least).\\n\\n\r\nMy top three butts were easy to choose (and they go in this order): Sayaka, Nozomi, and Shirayuki. Simply put, I couldn\u2019t get enough of them.\\n\\n\r\n(Also, Sayaka\u2019s maybe-possibly-implied yuri feelings for Nozomi were more than welcome.)\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s all the anime needed personally in my eyes, but it also delivered something crazy yet truly fun. All the power moves were hilarious and cool. The comedy was lighthearted and well-timed. The battles were intense and silly.\\n\\n\r\nAs I wrote way earlier, the writing in the anime is not complex let alone thorough. In fact, it barely passes the competent line. But, to me, that doesn\u2019t matter here. Instead, what this anime did was remind me how a show doesn\u2019t always need amazing characters, dramatic plotlines, or profound themes to be worthwhile. With its premise, its comedy, and of course its butts, the anime was extremely entertaining, and that\u2019s all it really had to be.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the anime will probably never see a continuation given how its source material met a premature end. Nevertheless, I walk away from this anime feeling more than content and wholly satisfied \u2013 and with a renewed vigor for the butts I love so much.\\n\\n\r\nKeijo!!!!!!!! is even wackier in anime form than it is on paper, but that leads it towards ever higher praise. The ridiculous sport played straight, the attractive designs, the positivity of Nozomi\u2019s character, the orchestral score, and the massive amount of massive booty create something that deserves to be ogled just as much as any nuclear bikini.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, a wacky premise played straight makes the narrative as intense as any hockey game\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, while the setting is visually uninteresting, and the characters stand around a lot, attractive designs, flashy power moves, comedic styling, and emphasis on the assets showcase thrills and arousal\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Nozomi\u2019s positivity encompasses the spirit of keijo, the other cast members highlight motivational mottos and parallel powers, but Kazane\u2019s arc is treated rather poorly\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, okay ED, good OST, okay VA performances, and nice sound effects\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, butts are better than boobs\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "There is always that one anime in a year where people claim that they are or will be the reason that \u201cAnime is saved\u201d. One of those shows ended up being\u2014Keijo!!!!!!!! (Yes, the name has eight exclamation marks)\r\nMost people, however, joke about how Keijo saved anime, and it eventually turned into a meme. Where as I believe that Keijo actually did save anime\u2026...I\u2019m not even joking right now.\r\nNow, before you think I have shit taste, let me clarify the reason Keijo is a great anime. \r\nFirst, let me get a few things out of the way, and that is of course, the haters of thisshow.\\n\r\n\u201cOh my god, this anime\u2019s story is horrible! 1/10\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cIt has too much ecchi, 2/10, I hate it.\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cIs this anime serious? 2/10 worst anime ever made.\u201d\\n\r\nI can\u2019t believe people actually take an anime like Keijo seriously. Solely for the reason that, Keijo doesn\u2019t even TRY to be serious itself. The overwhelmingly stupid plot is overwhelmingly stupid on purpose.\\n\r\nDo you really think that the author is actually like \u201chey, this is a very good idea! This story is going to be super well written.\u201d he was rather like, \u201chey, this is a very good idea! This story is\u2014\u2014horribly stupid! It\u2019s going to be funny as hell!\u201d \\n\r\nThe people who hate Keijo are people who take everything seriously, they actually claim it\u2019s not realistic or the plot is stupid, without realizing that it\u2019s like that on purpose. I mean, just look at the title of the anime-Keijo!!!!!!!!  Just right now, can you tell me something\u2026...odd with the title. Yes, I\u2019m talking about the exclamation marks. \\n\r\nEight exclamation marks, huh? You\u2019ve got to admit that this have never been done before. Some people think that the author just smashed his head on the keyboard when writing the title, but let me tell you how wrong you\u2019re on that.\\n\r\nThe overuse of the exclamation marks are simply a parody of the overabundance of anime titles that have so many exclamation marks.(K-on!!, Haikyuu!! ,durarara!!, Angel beats! etc...)\\n\\n\r\nWe haven\u2019t started talking about half of Keijo and yet we know how amazing it is in terms of presentation. My opinion, the title is hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the plot. No, not that kind of plot, I mean actual plot. Girls fighting with their boobs and butts in swimming suits\u2026..is that stupid? Yes it is. Is it a very badly written plot? No.\\n\r\nBut the reason Keijo is great, is because the plot is so stupid, yet the characters take everything so seriously. I mean, a sports anime about fighting with boobs and butts only...\u2026.you don\u2019t expect any girls to participate or even be super serious about a sport like this do you? Well, girls in Keijo are quite serious when it comes to this sport.\\n\r\n\u201cWha\u2014? How does she still have this much power left?\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cSince childhood, my dream was to be the best Keijo player!\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cI worked so hard for this match!\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cIf you use this technique, you might never be able to battle again.\u201d \\n\r\n\u201cBasically, I can steal butt techniques and put them in my arse-nal.\u201d\\n\r\nThese are actual quotes from the anime. A Keijo match, is like a game of death because of how god damn serious the characters are about the sport.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this anime is just top notch. The names which they give the moves are creative(vacuum butt cannon) and the amount of puns in this anime are just wow (asstronomy, boobology, buttock on titan, etc..)\\n\r\nThis type of comedy that Keijo uses is absolutely hilarious and it\u2019s, in my opinion, some of the best humor out there. \\n\r\nLet\u2019s get more into this anime, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 \\n\r\nStupid? Yes, however it\u2019s very unique. It\u2019s a parody of fighting-shounen, ecchi and sports anime. The way the characters talk in battles parodies the whole \u201cwith the power of friendship, nothing can stand in our way!\u201d and \u201coh my god, she\u2019s fast!!\u201d and also, \u201cyou can still stand up even after my vacuum butt cannon? Impossible!\u201d \\n\r\nWhen the characters fail a match, they suddenly turn into the cliche character that goes \u201cit\u2019s all my fault\u2026.I\u2019m good for nothing..\u201d \\n\r\nmany people exaggerate how bad the plot is, even though this anime is actually decent when it comes to writing. But many people also fail to understand that it\u2019s one of those anime that doesn\u2019t try to be above average, because that\u2019s the whole joke. \\n\\n\r\nI will just point out one of the funniest moments in this show\u2026..Sayaka\u2019s father.\\n\r\nThe reason that was there, was to parody the whole \u201cMy father is against the sport that I love, so they come and watch a match of mine and then immediately, they are convinced that it\u2019s a good sport and they will finally let me continue on with playing the sport.\u201d This in my opinion was brilliant and funny! \\n\r\nBecause it\u2019s true that so many sport anime use this cliche just for some drama, so the fact that Keijo also parodies this is brilliant.\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t the only funny moment in the show, but this one was gold.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now with the ecchiness of the show. Simply put, if you hate ecchi anime, then this is not for you. However, that\u2019s not to say this anime is like every ecchi anime ever, this is one of the only ecchi anime where without the PLOT, there would be no plot. Basically, the story IS the plot\u2026.are you confused yet? \\n\r\nThere is excessive use of fan service in this anime and you might get horny from episode one to around episode seven, but from there you\u2019re already into the story and you already forget that there is even any ecchi in this series, you now root for the characters to win and you get very excited when they win a match. (Keijo fans from episode one to episode seven: Wow, I love boobs. Keijo fans from episode eight and onwards: oh my god, this battle was so good! I liked the ultimate technique that nozomin used! Oh and I almost forgot, there were some boobs and butts as well\u2026.not like I care..)\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve watched many anime in the past then you know there are two types of ways that anime uses fan service: positive use of fan service, and negative use of fan service. Surprisingly, Keijo falls onto the positive use of fan service because the fan service is a necessity for the plot, where as something like Mirai Nikki has the most pointless fan service that added nothing to the story. That, is negative use of fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7.6/10 \\n\r\nDefinitely the strongest part of the show. The characters each stand out on their own and they are very memorable and likeable. The main character, nozomin, is again a parody of the good old \u201cshouty mouty protagonist\u201d of shounen and sport anime. But the protagonist isn\u2019t the only good character in the show, no, no, no, no. You underestimate Keijo my dudes. Every other character in the series gets their screen time and their own moments and each have their own goals, techniques, likes and dislikes, personality and much more. The characters also have a lot of development in the show.\\n\r\nLet me just talk about Sayaka for a second. (Well, I won\u2019t talk about how she is my waifu here because it\u2019s embarrassing) but she, is my favorite character in the series. I actually rooted for her all the way from the start of the series.\\n\r\nFor an anime to be able to make me go so far as to spending my energy rooting for some characters in an ecchi-comedy sport anime is just, wow.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/art style: 8/10 \\n\r\nVery good and fluid animation with very good character designs and I didn\u2019t have any big problems with the animation or the art style. Because the fights were actually very well animated, but if only Madhouse was the one behind this anime, it would have made the ecchiness much funnier because if you\u2019ve seen Highschool of the dead, then you know what I\u2019m talking about. How come an anime like HOFD has fan service animated like that, while Keijo is left for xebec to animate?\\n\r\nThe animation wasn\u2019t bad, not at all! But it could\u2019ve been SO MUCH better.\\n\\n\r\nAudio: 6/10\\n\r\nNot much problems with the voice actors.\\n\r\nAs for the opening, it was good, not great. The ending was also the same.\\n\r\nThe soundtracks were actually mediocre for a sports anime, but that may just be me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI am not the biggest fan of ecchi because most anime use it wrong, but if they use ecchi like Keijo, then I would be glad to check them out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nI know I praised this show a lot and yet I gave it a 7/10, but in my rating system, a 7/10 is actually very good. I put this show very high on my list because it\u2019s simply fantastic with its humor and was enjoyable all the way through.\\n\r\nSo yeah, if you\u2019re into sports/ecchi/comedy/shounen, then I advise you to check this anime out\u2026...it\u2019s great.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Keijo\r\nFor my rating system I did not use the 1-10 scale. I used the 1-5 \"The Little Man\" Scale. For more information check out my profile.\r\nStory(4)\r\nAlthough some may not agree with me giving this show so much points for its story, still I think this is reasonable considering the original concept of the show and the lack of big flaws it has. The humor that comes with the concept is also quite good.\r\nFor that concept we have the sport which is basically a form of Sumo on water, except the athletes can only use their Boobs and Butts.With that there comes the obvious fanservice. However,unlike other shows Keijo!!!!!!!! does not use the fanservice as a tacked on feature with Keijo!!!!!!!! the fanservice is a core element of the story and without it the show would not make sense. In that aspect the show is surprisingly self-aware of what it is.\\n\r\nIt is also one of the few (other example would be Food Wars) shows that have a lot of fanservice but at the same time have no fantasy setting.\\n\r\nThe storytelling itself is still a basic Shounen Sports anime type. We have a school(because there always need to be schools in anime for everything), training and afterwards matches with rivals.\\n\r\nAlthough the show has a lot of positives when it comes to storytelling, it also has some negatives for example, since the anime did not adapt the early chapters of the manga there is no real buildup for the relationship between Miyata and Nozomi.\\n\r\nThe worldbuilding also could have been better if we could have gotten more infos about the Pro-Scene.\\n\r\nThis adaptation is done by studio Xebecwhich also did the To Love Ru-Franchise and Love Hina, because of those they are  quite experienced when it comes to adapting Ecchi source material.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (2)\\n\\n\r\nThis is the second time I mention the name Hayato Matuo in my reviews. The first time it was for Drifters and there I praised the overall Soundtrack, this time I need to be a bit harsher.\\n\r\nFirst off the opening and the ending felt ok, but they were not memorable and that is also the biggest problem with the whole OST. There was not a single piece which I found outstanding. It was even worse, for most parts it not only was generic but it also felt too tame for a show like this. If it would have been more epic, it could have amplified the scale of the attacks a lot.\\n\r\nFor the Seiyuu's since this was a more comedy orianted show there was not the biggest range of emotions to be displayed to begin with. However since some of the characters were showcased having an accent there was a certain knowledge about those accents requiered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation(3):\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation there is to say that the quality was rather inconsistent. There were some battle scenes that really looked fantastic. However, not all the battle scenes had a high level of quality. Most of the scenes looked good, but could have been done better. Some of the movements also looked a bit clunky. This is necessarily due to a high amount of animated movements. The more details you add to those scenes the higher the cost of the end product. Maybe the studio did not want to invest too much money in this series and so cut some of the budget here. Which leads me to my next point. The animation for not so important scenes was, to be fair not too good. There were some inconsistencies like in one scene the bikini top is torn and in the next it isn't anymore and then it is again smaller stuff like that. Also, when there were not so important scenes, characters in the background were not well animated. Besides that the backgrounds were for most parts boring and could have been better with some more colors.\\n\r\nFor my last point the character models looked good. They were standart and not to detailed, but I liked them.\\n\r\nAlso some details for the attack moves they used thicker lines to highlight them I thought that was quite neat.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(3):\\n\\n\r\nHere I need to state something in advance. Normally I would rather go and talk about character depth and layers of characterisation in this segment, but for this show I rated more on the fun that the different characters brought with them.\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are the typical kind of quirky people you come across in anime. With that being said, the main character is quite realistic when it comes to her goals and why she wants to play Keijo.\\n\r\nFor the other 3 characters of the main cast 2 of them felt in their own ways good, however the third was a bit to much of a comedic relief and had no other big function.\\n\r\nThe cast of the supporting characters was also rather big growing from episode to episode. Most of them had one or two things going for them, but those things were a bit over-the top stylised so that they stood out of the masses and felt unique. With their quirky personalities there also came their special moves or their own techniques. All of those things made the supporting cast really fun and I liked most of them. Sure they were as far away from being realistic as possible however that does not mean they were not entertaining.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4):\\n\\n\r\nKeijo is fun. That is the first thing that comes to my mind when I think about this show. It oozes with creativity in its setting it's specific over-the-top attacks it's diffrent lands and all types of strategic advantages they use.\\n\r\nThe cast and the storytelling were, on the other, side not the most original or layered examples in recent history, but both served it's purpose. The characters were for the most part likable, (some where even a bit memorable) and the story even though it was cliched was uplifted by the sheer ridiculousness of the concept. Overall I really enjoyed the show and would hope for a second season.(Eventhough they caught up to the source material and since the manga is a monthly release there will be no second season anytime soon.)",

            "content": "It\u2019s easier these days to sacrifice certain aspects of a creative endeavour in order to appeal to a larger audience. In past months we\u2019ve had  video games censor themselves to avoid outrage by a section of the population and anime is constantly being censored to allow for wider distribution. So it\u2019s refreshing when a series parodies this censorship, as was the case with Shimoneta, or disregards it, as is the case with Keijo!!!!!!!!\r\n[A ridiculous sport]\r\nKeijo!!!!!!!! Is an ecchi sports series adapted from a manga of the same name and brought to the screens by the animation studio Xebec. Xebec are also the studio behindthe popular comedy ecchi series, To LOVE-Ru and that experience comes through in Keijo!!!!!!!! The story is based on the sport of Keijo, a gambling sport in which battle against one another with their butt and breasts, and revolves around a group of girls who are training to become professional Keijo athletes. Kaminashi Nozomi is a brilliant and hardworking gymnast who\u2019s attracted to the better paying sport of Keijo. But she must first climb the ranks of her school and region before she becomes a professional Keijo athlete. \\n\\n\r\n[Unbridled excitement with the occasional disgust]\\n\r\nKeijo!!!!!!!! Was an immediate sensation when it started airing on the 6th of October, 2016; it was as if people had been waiting in earnest for a show like it. The warm reception was inspired by the show\u2019s honesty; Keijo!!!!!!!! Was what it said it was. It didn\u2019t try to hide its absurd premise behind some intricate reveal, its main characters were young women who were often seen in their swimsuits and weren\u2019t shy about it, and best of all, there were no male-female romantic relationships involved. It was simply a show about athletes - no more. But Keijo!!!!!!!! Wasn\u2019t without its critics. \\n\\n\r\nThere were publications that loudly criticized the show for its depictions of women despite its keen focus on the sport alone and its diverse cast. There were fans who criticized its excessive use of fanservice and its furthering the poor perception of the anime medium by \u2018outsiders\u2019. That the show did damage to the anime medium is left to be seen but the criticism didn\u2019t stop it from gaining popularity with each new episode.\\n\\n\r\nAudiences waited for each new episode because the show was sure to deliver; it rarely got boring. And like most sport anime, it didn\u2019t need a deep plot to keep the audiences engaged.\\n\\n\r\n[A strong emphasis on teamwork]\\n\r\nThe plot of Keijo is a simple and common one: an enthusiastic youngster seeks to become the best at a particular sport. That\u2019s the basis of almost all the sports shows; the better shows often weave personal relationships into the plot. The plot also has common elements: the lead character starts as an underdog and the story features energetic battles with epic swing turns, battle analysis and the lead overcoming huge odds through teamwork. These common elements not only help audiences identify the show\u2019s genre but provide room for the greater shows to excel through their execution. And it is in the execution of the element of teamwork that Keijo shines.\\n\\n\r\nThe sport of Keijo begins with the contestants being positioned on a platform, known as the \u2018land\u2019 in the middle of a pool. The goal is to have the contestants battle each other until all but one of them remains on the platform and is declared the winner. It\u2019s easy to see how the mechanics of the sport encourage teamwork and the show emphasizes this as much as it can. For example, the girls of Setouchi, the school in which Nozomi trains, are taught to be aware of the positions of their teammates; the show culminates in a team-based battle and there\u2019s a character that\u2019s formidable within a team but average otherwise. This emphasis on teamwork is made more remarkable by the diverse cast of characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\n[Compelling lead cast but weak supporting characters]\\n\r\nEach of the athletes in the show is an individual, designed with a particular trait in mind. Some are big and burly and possess moves that rely on strength; others are small and (not) dainty and possess speed-based moves. There are exceptions, of course, but the character designs are simple to understand. For some of the characters, it\u2019s easy to tell what their special moves are just by looking at them. It\u2019d be difficult to cite examples without spoiling anything. Yes, even though the show is hardly mysterious, there are beautiful moments when a character reveals their hidden strength and quickly becomes a fan favourite. Although there are a lot of characters to focus on, the show handles its leads excellently. All but one of the four main characters are compelling.\\n\\n\r\nKaminashi Nozomi is the designated main character and deserving of the role. She\u2019s bold, outspoken, brash and more powerful than the average Keijo athlete. But she\u2019s also hardworking, surprisingly creative and an inspiring leader. Miyata Sayaka is one of the smaller characters but complements this with hard work and her experience as a professional judo athlete.  Toyoguchi Non is the archetypal clumsy teammate who\u2019s a surprisingly powerful solo player and an oft invisible support. Aoba Kazane is shy and not as powerful as the other three in solo matchups but is an impressive team player. The main characters clearly fit the archetypes you\u2019d expect from a sports show but they are provided with more depth as the show progresses. Aoba\u2019s growth is one of the more notable developments.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the show doesn\u2019t treat its supporting cast as well; only one of the other athletes gets as much screentime as the lead characters and she doesn\u2019t change at all. Nonetheless, all the characters are designed to be unique and this is enhanced by the bright and sharp art of the show.\\n\\n\r\n[Impactful art]\\n\r\nThe art of Keijo is bright, colourful and mostly done in warm tones which evokes the cheery mood of the show. But a combination of its framing and use of light make the action more impactful; the framing of attacks focussed slowly on their point of impact. One of the most pronounced aspects of the art and animation was the highlight of a special ability, often before it hit, that also had the name of the ability in a flashy font. These scenes were also complemented with wild special effects and animation that took the form of the ability\u2019s source model. For example, the move \u2018Shoryucans\u2019 has the character mimicking an uppercut with her breasts. But this pales in comparison to the most popular move in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe build-up and execution of the Vacuum Butt Cannon is the prime example of the excellent art direction of the show. The camera follows Kaminashi, keeping its frame solely on her as she twists and turns. The twists are further elaborated by threads of light that follow the movement of her butt. The camera then follows her as she flips and eventually jumps. Then it zooms into her butt, which is highlighted with a bright glow, and follows it as it makes impact with her opponent. But the scene is incomplete without the sound effects that accompany her twisting, flipping and the impact of her butt.\\n\\n\r\n[Booming sound effects]\\n\r\nKeijo!!!!!!!! Is an action show that relies on its sound effects and they don\u2019t disappoint. You can feel the impact of physical attacks from the sounds they make; they go so well with the special moves, especially when they\u2019re revealed. From thunderous butt slams to whirling legs, you can tell what kind of move is being performed by listening to the sound effects alone. You can almost visualize an attack from the sounds it makes - even with your eyes closed. These sound effects sometimes accompany epic background music.\\n\\n\r\nKeijo\u2019s ridiculous premise and it\u2019s shameless characters make for a fun and exciting watch. However, it is not without its flaws; a major one being the dip in art and animation quality towards the end of the show. But these are forgiven for the bold brilliance that is Keijo!!!!!!!!",

            "content": "Oh wow. I heard that this is good, but I did not expect it to be this good.\r\nFunny, happy, intense, lighthearted and entertaining.\r\nBasically, imagine that you take Azumanga or Yuyushiki. Then you turn it into sport anime. Then you add secret techniques with power comparable to one punch man. Then you add fanservice. Then you base the whole thing around butt and boob jokes. That'll be keijo.\r\nBased on ridiculous premise (there's girl-only sports with very unusual fighting rules), when you first hear about it, you'd think it is another cheap attempt to cash in on fanservice, but when you actually watch it, you realize thatit is more than this.\\n\\n\r\nDetailed breakdown below:\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nDespite ridiculous premise, it loosk like a good sport + slice of life + comedy + fighting anime. Protagonist has a goal, and strives to reach that goal, and meets many colorful characters in the process of training. There are few references to some older anime, I've caught at least two of them, but I suspect there may be more of them. Despite very fanservicey premise, anime looks almost innocent, because every single character in the series tae their sport seriously. That makes situations that happen funnier. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNicely done modern anime, better than \"standard modern anime\". Characters animations looks great in motion, there are no \"budget cutting tricks\". Character style is somewhat simple, but they're all more or less unique and well drawn. Looks good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nMusic complements the story and events of the anime very well. Soundtrack is more or less standard cheerful type, but it matches the anime perfectly, pretty much at all occurrences.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThey are quite stereotypical, meaning everybody more or less correspond to some archetype, but they're very well done, and even if you recognize a stereotype, interactions between characters are very entertaining. To be honest, the atmosphere of inter-character communications strongly reminded me of Azumanga or Yuyushiku. Protagonist is a quite close to the \"simple/friendly/girl archetype\", but she's amusing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nHavent' had this amount of fun for quite some time, and pretty much watched last episodes on the edge of my seat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe only reason why someone would want to avoid it if they absolutely can't stand butt/boob jokes (there are a LOT of those) or has aversion to butts. Despite premise that looks like it was built for fanservice, the anime has fairly innocent feeling about it. \\n\\n\r\nHighly recommended. I think that anime coudl be interested to fans of many genres (ecchi, comedy, sports, fighting).",

            "content": "First and foremost: what most people don't realize is that Keijo!!!!!!!! is a PARODY, and while at that - a HUGE PARODY. Anyone taking a show that uses terms such as BOOBology, ASStronomy and RACKupressure so seriously is going into this with the wrong mindset.\r\n> So why is Keijo!!!!!!!! a parody?\r\n -It presents more superpowers in 12 episodes than one can even dream of having in a superpower-shounen anime, and to add to the originality that the author needed to accomplish this - it's all driven by BUTTS and BOOBS.\r\n -The thing is: Keijo!!!!!!!! does all of that BUT involving female body parts...clashing... andmaking sword sounds, exploding, serving as a shield or a gattling gun, all while making references to JoJo, Attack on Titan, Fate/Zero, etc. Do you still think this show isn't self-aware? Ok, moving on. \\n\\n\r\n-Many people backfire saying that it presents the most clich\u00e9 tropes in sports anime, from mid-battle flashbacks to overthinking any situation in the middle of a match. \\n\r\n-The thing is: Keijo!!!!!!!! does all of that BUT with all of the bery bery sad sad backstories being TRAGIC because of events involving... BUTTS AND TITS. Pretty touching and heartwarming, indeed. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\n You are not supposed to cry tears of sadness watching the characters' lame backstories and you are certainly not supposed to feel like the characters' powers make any sort of sense even in any way, shape or form, actually, you'd be better off trying to imagine how bizzare it would be to have any sort of sexual experience with any of the cast of this anime... and I mean it.\\n\\n\r\n It's also worth mentioning that while Keijo!!!!!!!! (yeah you figured I love me  them exclamation marks!!!!!!!!) is not listed under the \"parody\" nor \"comedy\" genres, it got me (and 99% of the people who watched it) laughing out loud in every. single. episode. Oh, and add quite the healthy cringe to the mix - it happened.\\n\\n\r\n I want more Keijo!!!!!!!!, and I want it fast.",

            "content": "\"Keijo is great!\"- Nozomi\r\nNow to be fair with this review I'm going to be grading this show on it being a FANSERVICE show.\r\nTHE STORY was mediocre but when going into this show you already know it's not going to be stellar. It almost tried to have a story at the end but failed. This show never really tried to have a story, which many other fanservice shows, have tried WAY too had to accomplish and I have to commend it for that.overall story : 6\\n\\n\r\nTHE ART in this show is decent at times and horrendous at others. I took one day to watch this with no sound or subs and just to look at the art. You can tell where they cut alot of corners and sometimes the people in the show are so f*cked up you want to manually fix them yourself. The style is never consistent and begins to get really frustrating when its apparent.\\n\\n\r\n                                                             overall art: 5\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS in the show are varied and act almost like real girls would (some of them at least). I liked how you got know some of them more than others. The main was a bit bland but the side characters you make up for it. \\n\\n\r\n                                                             overall characters: 9\\n\\n\r\nTHE ENJOYMENT of this show is varied on your tastes but I did actually like this show. It didn't have much to it and I watched it just to cool down after watching more serious shows from this season. This show never takes itself too seriously and it was perfect for the ridiculousness of the fanservice which was almost a parody of itself. The comedy of the show is genuinely funny in some aspects and I found myself laughing at some of the jokes they had. Overall this shows is just something you watch to relax to or to sing along to the VERY catchy OP and ED. \\n\\n\r\n                                                            overall enjoyment: 8\\n\\n",

            "content": "That moment when they tries to make every dumb moves, turns into one fucking epic ass transformation or battle that makes no fucking logical sense at all lmao. But you really gotta admit, no matter how fucking dumb, and fucking stupid this show is with its moves and random insertation of naming of their moves. The animation, artstyle, random epic sound effect that you usually hears in hollywood movie? (if you've watch it, you gonna hear it when the purple hair girl appears in ep 1), OST, and the fucking special effects on their butt, boobs, head, random glow of light on them, insane speed,and da legitimately insane intensity of this show in this ecchi series. Well frankly speaking, no matter how great it was with the fight scene, i can't help but to literally laugh and grin like crazy when this show is so fucking ridiculous. I even fucking cringed when they make all of the character's cloth disappear, or just some perverted, horny ass lesbo grabbing each others boobs and butts. This anime would've been fairly good, but the fanservice tick me off so much i just have to give this shit a 6. But hey, the weirdness of this show and the seriousness that the voice acting, the glorification of the sport is definitely something that is a joke in itself. If you people takes this anime too seriously, you would only feel like this anime is an offend to women. However, this shit is riduculous in itself, who the fuck gonna takes this show seriously. And all em feminist complaining about how the media culture only represent women as slim and sexy. But this anime has a full complete packs of size and body shape, like fat, masculinity, slim, big butts, small butts, big boobs, small boobs, manlike face etc. \\n\\n\r\nBut they acted out as if this was a completly normal thing too lmao. That's the comedy in it. Because the show is dumb, and they takes it so seriously as if it was a normal sport, or just like any serious shounen. This anime is literaly funny af lol. Some people's premise would go like this, sports with boobs and butts = dumb. That's true and they're not trying to pretend that the idea of it is not dumb. They seriousness is what makes this show so fucking hilarious and interesting to watch. Not for boobs and butts in particular. But for me it's the animation.\\n\\n\r\nI laugh when their butt and boobs crushes into one another. I laugh when a swimsuit was able to grab a hold of another person's swimsuit by using the power of grip (keep in mind how slippery a swimsuit is) that came from their boobies. I laugh when i thought boobs were butt. I laugh when i recognize all of the character's power or moves are a parody to other existing characters in the anime community. I laugh when a girl's pony tail works like a doggy tail, and I laugh when the anime is so stupid with its intense training that would cramp your butt and backs forever if you keep doing it in real life. It makes no sense but the shit is legitimately funny af, and that's the point of stupidity in any humorous show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut despite how low my rating is, the fights in this show is godly amazing. The animator and the staffs really did put their biggest effort into making this one. I barely see this much effort in an anime before, unless it's a very popular series in the manga/light novel community, but the quality of animation and art consistency was amazing. And if you guys notice on the intro or op, im pretty sure that's the gate of babylon that's controlled by Gilgamesh in the fate series lmao. What's this? Im i suppose to expect butts coming out of it? lmao. Like a spear or sword butts projectile maybe? But ofc, despite the clearly a fucking copied from other moves from other shows (like one piece, fate series, etc.), there are some originality in those too. Well that's the point of a parody show tbh. And the name of those moves are so risible that you can't have but to instinctively laugh at it.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say that this anime isn't worth of your time to watch, the only reason that im still watching this show was purely, and mainly because of how the fight scene has drag me in. If you really hate this anime because of how stupid, dumb, and riduclous it's. I recommend that you should still check out all of its butt fights and boobs fight. Because the animation and OSt in those is just too sick. But if you're a 2016 feminist who change the word feminism to something else, or you just hate ecchi (either men or female) since it's just sound dumb and unrealistic. I would definitely agree on that point on basis, however, if you're not one of those people who can't accept everything that they sees, no matter how dumb it's. Then i wouldn't recommend this to you. And this would prolly be one of my first review where i spam the word boobs and butts everywhere lol",

            "content": "Is it possible to write a review without any ass puns? Butt of course! (D'Oh!)\r\nStory:\r\nThis is a sports shounen anime like every other...BUTT with an all female cast. And not only that, it is full of fanservice, tons of it. Now the question is, is that all Keijo has to offer? Surprisingly not. The girls take this sport seriously, like they would do any other sport. Keijo never tries to cover up the fact, that it wants you to drool over the well-developed teenage girl bodies, but it also tries to make itself a serious sports story. On top of that, we have insane powermoves straight out of an over the top shounen, which (thanks to the nature of this anime) are the most hilarious thing about Keijo. I'd say the story works as well as you allow it to.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe fights (or as they call it, races) are full of energy and quite spectacular to watch. However, there are some noticeable animation flaws, which I personally don't mind very much, butt I know that many people have major issues with these. The character design is okay, the girls could look a bit more distinct, especially since they are mostly running around in uniform swimsuits.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening song is awesome. The ending isn't quite as good, but still solid. Voice acting was good in general, though nobody was really able to do a standout performance (and I'm saying this as a fan of Rie Takahashi).\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThere are a lot of cute and/or badass girls in Keijo that you should have no hard time choosing your favourite. The cast as a whole is good enough to work, though I feel like this would've worked even better with more unique characters. I'll exclude Nozomi from this though. She is your standard shounen main character, but female and willing to show off her body. Which leads me to another slight criticism I have: they don't seem to mind showing a stadium of thousands their titties if it means victory. That felt a little awkward (yes, I understand that this is an ecchi anime).\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAll criticism aside, Keijo was an insane amount of fun to watch. I enjoyed the fanservice, I was rooting for my favourite girls to win and I laughed my ass off (hehe, ass) at all the over the topness. Keijo is the epitome of what some consider \"brainless fun\". This anime does not try to be the next Evangelion or Madoka or whatever, it wants to provide entertainment and goddammit, does it succeed. Absolute recommendation for everybody (unless you think female bodies are sexist, in which case you can go die for all I care).\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverass:\\n\r\n7.4/10",

            "content": "\"Ass, tities, ass-n-tities\"get it that DJ Assault rap cuz this anime is indeed about...yea you got it ASS-N-TITIES !! When I first heard about this first thing that came to my mind was \"only in anime\" something like this would exist. Believe it or not but the sports genre on anime is one that I haven't gotten into. It's not that I was never interested but rather I never knew any notable one to watch. So ur probably asking why tf did I choose Keijo as my first sports anime. Well to be completely honest it's cuz it's short. I felt why not get thisseries over with since finishing it wouldn't require a lot of time spent. It's important to keep in mind that the anime doesn't cover the entirety of its manga which probably explains its short length, so unfortunately we don't get the full story. So how does Keijo hold up does it handle its absurd concept well or does it abuse it ??***contains MINOR spoilers***\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:6/10\\n\r\nA shameless concept that was pretty well handled. The story is very straightforward with a shonen like plot where the protagonist wants to be the richest Keijo player in the world. It isn't complex nor deep by any means as it mainly focuses on the sport itself. It explores themes that you would expect in a sports show such as teamwork and sportsmanship. The fan service here is emphasized to the extreme and it really dominates the tone of the series. But what I really appreciate is that its not subtle about it, it knows what it is and it weirdly makes the anime seem less sexual. Becuz of this it surprisingly gives it a refreshing approach. The sport itself kinda pokes fun at sports as it shows you how absurd sporting events can be and keep in mind the females really take this sport seriously despite the obvious absurdity of the sport which is pretty cool actually. The comedy is both over the top and satirical. Each player has their own special move and some are parodies off other anime. For example there are moves called \"Hip of Babylon\" and \"Buttack on Titan\" Im sure most of you can guess where those are from. Where the story really suffers is outside the sport. When the athletes aren't competing they're just training for their upcoming matches. The story mainly just focuses on the sport and some character backgrounds and it just isn't enough depth. It's basically a standard shonen tale that gets to the point and that's really it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8/10\\n\r\nOverall the animation was pretty impressive. It uses boldly colorful art direction that perfectly fits the tone. The race scenes were taken care of well by the animators and it's where the visuals truly shine. Also ofc there's a lot of breasts and booty shots and it does become a lil too much but then it's understandable since that was the primary focus of the show's visuals. Whenever the boobs and butts clashed there was some nice fluidity for the most part. It does a good job at staying faithful to the mangaka's artwork for sure. What really impressed me about the art was the variation of the female body types. You have girls who are slim, girls who are thicc, girls with heavyset appearances, and some who are muscular. A lot of characters look good and are pretty distinct and while fan service is the main focus they do a good job at making them appealing. I did notice some animation errors towards the latter half which is disappointing cuz for a very short series u would think avoiding this would be easy. When it came to the non race scenes there was a lack of attention to detail which proves that the races were where animators put more work into. Overall as a guy ur hormones can be very tested watching a series like this lol.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7/10\\n\r\nOverall this are was decent but nothing special. I have to be honest I didn't find the music to be great at all most of the background tracks were forgettable which is disappointing of course. However not all of the music was like that, the show's OP \"DREAMxSCRAMBLE!\" is a cute song that's full of energy and it was a perfect choice to fit the show. The ED \"Fantas/HIP Girlfriends\" was okay it was a pop song sang by a female group with nice voices but the lyrics were kinda dumb. As for voice acting both the English and Japanese versions were solid. A lot of the actresses brought charm to the characters although the dialogue can be a lil corny. I thought the Japanese version was slightly better due to the comedy. There was a scene where a character uses fourth wall humor that was funny but dub version changed it and wasn't as funny. In general both casts did good tho.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7/10\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell this anime uses a female dominate cast, They're rarely any males here with only a few exceptions(not that Im complaining.) The characters are very likable it's hard to find someone to dislike here cuz most of them are charming and committed to their sport. There are only a few characters however that get explored and it's the major characters. The main character Nozomi Kaminashi is energetic girl who has a generic great goal of becoming a rich Keijo player. She's not that memorable since she's very standard and has no complexity but due to her lively personality she was enjoyable and was involved in a lot of fun races. Nozomi's bestie Sayaka Miyata was imo the best character. She has a more composed personality but she has the most interesting backstory out of the cast. Overall her development was great and due to her smaller stature her battles were more strategic which led to creative battles. What bothered me was that there were tons of side characters that got zero attention which is a shame cuz some of them seemed interesting. A lot of the females really took these absurd sport seriously and it really makes want to learn about their love for the sport. The show's short length heavily effected this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict\\n\\n\r\nPros\\n\\n\r\n+Overall a very fun series that handles its premise well\\n\r\n+Has a likable cast that's fun to watch and has sweet moments\\n\r\n+Uses satire humor that can be very funny\\n\r\n+Fun matches that are creative and have good storytelling\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\\n\r\n-Has absolute zero sense of shame\\n\r\n-Nozomi isn't much of a memorable protagonist\\n\r\n-Outside of the matches the story can be boring\\n\r\n-Side characters weren't given enough depth\\n\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Favorites\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Miyata, Kazane, and Maya\\n\\n\r\nArc: East-West War\\n\\n\r\nRace: Miyata vs Nanase\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion is a shameless series that makes you ask yourself, \"does an anime like this really exist?\" Despite the heavy fanservice and ridiculous premise I'd be lying if I said this wasn't a fun series cuz it definitely was. It's a sports anime that put a lot of thought into the sport itself with a lot of creativity and tbh if it chose to add a lil more depth into the story this could've had a lot of potential. It take place during the high school years of the players and I wish it was longer so that we can see how they would end up. Unfortunately the short length was due to the manga artist being forced to cancel the manga which is too bad ofc even so the anime didn't cover up the remaining chapters. It's one of those anime where if you wanna see more of the story you would have to go to its original material to see for yourself. As for recommendations I actually don't have a particular title in mind but if you love sports and tons of boobs and booty thrown at ya then this is DEFINITELY the perfect series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSub or Dub Recommendation: Sub",

            "content": "Keijo!!!!!!!! I am too choked up to say anything about this eromanga, so let's getting get this thing rolling by stating the obvious: the manga and 12-episode anime are pure, unapologetic fanservice done for the sake of fanservice, not for tying up some loose ends due to shit animation or manga chapter quality, albeit the art certainly won't win any awards. Also, this manga is a borderline hentai and is so wonderfully absurd that they even introduced a school, most notably shown in the anime, to study the art of unlocking your ten-assity in order to enter the pro scene. Briefly speaking of the anime,through the course of its 12-episode run, I was stewing on how asinine it was; however, I quickly admitted to myself that that was my guilty pleasure of 2016. Shifting gears to the manga, I had a different experience with it entirely. I am fully aware that the mangaka faced some backlash from Shogakugan when he was asked to wind down the manga even as the anime aired and subsequently got his manga cancelled in the March-April 2017 time frame. Regardless of the circumstances, I see no reason for the mangaka to have rushed so much as to give us nearly cardboard cutouts of characters, like the Gouketsu (i.e. the Five Butts), each given superpowers with a hand wave and no real, relatable backstory. I read up to 156 chapters of the manga translated, but finished it up with the raw manga chapters since no one ever wants to translate as chapters are released and the characters were so shallow and predictable that I could nearly understand all of the dialogue from the visual context alone. After I finished the manga, I was stewing on how utterly insipid the ending was. The manga lacked a satisfactory sense of closure since there weren't any memorable, thoughtful exchanges between relevant characters we got to understand more in depth from earlier story arcs. My main gripe with the manga's ending is that it omits any plot points that show how the Gouketsu had any influence on Nozomi's CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. The anime at least had a development arc for Nozomi's character and how the power of teamwork and friendship influenced her win. This manga should have ended at the point the anime chose to end it; instead, it was dragged out and padded with a lame follow-up plotline that ultimately drove this manga into the ravine of cringeville. I think this mangaka didn't deserve to be treated so unfairly, but the manga getting cancelled was probably for the better, considering it took a crash-and-burn turn to the road to cringeville. I am disappointed as a fan of the anime that this manga having potential as a wonderfully absurd fanservice shanked itself by squandering its one strength: novelty.",

            "content": "----------\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\nThe following review is completely spoiler-free, and is meant for users who are curious about whether to watch the show or not. While I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself!\r\n---------\r\nPositives\r\n---------\r\n- Unabashed and Full Frontal\r\nIt would be doing a disservice to the show to say that fanservice is ALL it is, as Keijo is so much more. Butt, you can't deny that this showis not afraid to go above and beyond with their \"appreciation of the female form\". Look, Keijo is a show that focuses on boobs and butts. It uses them for comedy, characterization, special moves, you name it. If you can't handle that, steer clear. If you think that's hilarious/no problem (like myself), jump right in.\\n\\n\r\n- Surprisingly Competent Shounen\\n\r\nKeijo is billed as a Shounen parody, which is accurate. However, I was extremely surprised to find that it still holds up as a very well made shounen on its own! Yes, there are some obvious parodic moments, butt there are legitimately compelling characters, abilities, and matching visual prowess to make for its own compelling show!\\n\\n\r\n- Compelling Characters\\n\r\nIt would be so easy for a show like this to cop out on its character design; Emphasizing bodily traits instead of evolving personalities and nurturing team-oriented relationships. Keijo does not cop out. Characters' body types are brought up seldomly in conversation, often only used to contribute to that character's fighting style and techniques (which is relevant to the story, not the fanservice). I loved the cast of characters completely regardless of how they were portrayed physically, and was completely satisfied with the wide variety of fun, vibrant characters displayed.\\n\\n\r\n- Fearlessly Over-The-Top\\n\r\nOne of the fun things about Keijo is that it doesn't do anything half-assed. Keijo goes full-ass, then charges that ass up to 1000% to unlock their hidden bloodline trait. Everything mentioned above is completely overblown and over the top, without feeling hokey or unnecessary. Whether it be its parody elements, its gratuitous close-ups, or its crazy shounen battle sequences, Keijo holds nothing back and will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions.\\n\\n\r\n- Bonus: Appropriate Ages\\n\r\nJapan has an obsession with making characters 3-6 years younger than they act or should be. Keijo's characters are 17+, and they look and act accordingly. Thank god.\\n\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nNegatives\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\n- Unabashed and Full Frontal\\n\r\nYou might have noticed that this is repeated from the \"Positives\" section. I want to preface this negative by saying that I am unashamed of watching over the top fanservice. Sexual humour, and sexuality as a whole (with or without comedic elements/purposes), is no problem for me. With that in mind, Keijo was sometimes a bit... much. There were a few legitimate moments where I felt taken aback at how far the show stretched the line between safe and adult. There are definitely a few scenes and shots that made me completely facepalm, or simply ask myself: \"Am I actually watching porn right now?\"\\n\\n\r\n- Light on Parody\\n\r\nI might be wrong on this, but I didn't actually feel that this show did enough to parody the shounen genre. The fact it centres around bewbies and bewties certainly gives everything a bit of a \"silly\" feel regardless of how hard they try to do serious things, but I didn't feel like they were really trying to add other parody elements. There was one excellent bit of parody in the final fights with Rin (no spoilers, of course), but otherwise I find it hard pressed to call this anywhere near to an actual parody. It's way, way closer to just a ridiculous shounen, as opposed to a show parodying a genre.\\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nKeijo is... complicated. It's a really hard show to review because it ultimately hinges on its biggest draw: its bodacious premise. It doesn't let up, it doesn't give in, and it is not afraid to shove its naughty bits in your face. If you can handle that, then this show is lots of fun! It's clever, ridiculous, hilarious, and legitimately well made. Its animation, sound, character design, and story arc are all put together well. I can't deny that it was very entertaining to watch, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, I also can't deny that it is by far the most sexually charged shounen that I've ever watched, and it can be intimidating in its forwardness at times (even for someone like myself who rarely minds that kind of thing). You don't have to be a prude to find the stuff that Keijo does off-putting, which makes this an incredibly polarizing show. Many, many people will pass on this show, and many more will drop it. But if you don't mind being a little bit of a perv for some good entertainment, then let me be the first to welcome you to pervy heaven. Your room is on the left, leave your shoes at the door. We're not animals, after all.\\n\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nFinal Rating\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nWhile it makes for nice averages and wonderful sorting, when it comes to reviews I personally do not like direct numbering systems. Instead, I am to answer the question: \"Would you recommend I watch this show?\". Specifically, I like to answer that question for both those familiar with the show's genre(s), and those new or interested in the genre(s). So,\\n\\n\r\nIf you can handle gratuitous sexuality as a gateway to great shounen entertainment, you should absolutely watch this show. Leave your shame behind, and enjoy the ridiculousness. It's okay.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are tentative about that, perhaps try the first episode. You'll quickly decide for yourself whether its your type of show or not. You don't have to like it. It's okay.",

            "content": "Summary/Overall - 7\r\nThis show is the ultimate guilty pleasure.  It succeeds as a parody of shonen fighting tropes, and as a comedy with a mostly straight-man style of humor.  Silly people are doing silly things--but with a completely straight face the whole time.  And it's hilarious.  \r\nThe show is actually pretty creative with its premise, and has moments of great animation.  There is some needless and tasteless fanservice in the show, but I'd say that at least 85% of the sexy stuff actually serves a purpose and deserves to be in the show.  It's really easy to just laughat some of the ways the characters use their boobs and butts, rather than be put off by it.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nThe story is serviceable--nothing more than it needs to be to get the show running.  Girl enters a Keijo training academy, starts training, and faces off against strong rivals.  That's it.  That's all it needs to be, but it's also unambitious.  Because of this, the show can start to drag sometimes in the more \"serious\" scenes, due to the novelty of the premise wearing off after a while.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are animated surprisingly well.  The art does a good job of conveying what's going on at all times, and serves the humor well.  The main downside in this category is that the character designs are very plain and unmemorable.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nNothing special.  The voice acting is pretty good and can sell comedic moments.  It's funny listening to the characters talk so seriously about their butt combat sport.  Sounds effects can make some of the impact moments funny as well, like when a character has a squishy butt or a butt of steel.  The opening and ending themes are basically forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\r\nThe characters are mostly as plain as the character designs.  They are basically shonen fighter tropes and pretty one-note.  The creativity displayed in their individual powers, as well as the voice acting, is where all of the charm comes from, which is still fairly limited.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nThis show is funny, and not too bad to look at either.  There is genuine creativity in the execution of the completely silly premise.  I was impressed that they varied the platform in the middle of the pool between battles--they could have easily just kept it as a generic platform each time.  And the variety of attacks the girls hit each other with is also interesting and hilarious.  They even change up the swimsuits quite a bit.\\n\r\nThe writing of the jokes is really solid.  The typical shonen banter in the middle of fighting is usually a drag on fights in other shows, but in this one it's genuinely hilarious to hear characters say stuff like \"I'm getting my butt kicked\" or \"you have yet to understand the true nature of my butt!\".\\n\r\nThe show starts pretty strong but can start to weaken in later episodes due to the novelty of the premise and the jokes starting to wear off.  I would imagine that this show was probably more fun to watch once per week while it was airing, rather than in a one-sitting binge session.  I also think the show probably doesn't have great re-watch value because of this.",

            "content": "NO SPOILERS BELOW\r\nStory 7/10:  \r\nThe story doesn't exist for much more than to create an excuse for the show to focus on anime butts.  The weird thing is that it kind of works.  The structure of the story isn't anything you haven't heard before but what's strange is how aggressively shonen this anime feels.  The special moves, the tournament arc, the main character with a natural affinity for a special forbidden move that could destroy them if they don't learn to harness its power properly.  If you ignore the anime butts and pretend they are using fists it's the moststandard shonen you could imagine.  Jury is still out on whether or not this is a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10:  \\n\r\nThe art style is pretty standard but, as I stated, this is a shonen and part of that is having good fight scenes.  In that regard the fight scene animations are pretty good.  Nothing over the top but they weren't lazy in this regard either.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10:  \\n\r\nFairly average, not a whole lot to say about this one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10:  \\n\r\nFairly average diverse cast of different cute anime girls who you and your friends can debate that timeless question \"who is best girl\" with.  I will say that they aren't boring characters, just typical.  They are interesting enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:  \\n\r\nIf you are looking for a series anime with a plot or some sort of deep philosophy to push you will not enjoy this.  If you can shut your brain off for a a little bit and just enjoy the spectacle that this is I think you will be very surprised with the quality that is brought overall to this show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10:  \\n\r\nThis is something that I like to call \"popcorn anime,\" not particularly filling but still good.  I'd recommend it if you like dumb fun things, because that's what this is, dumb and fun.\\n",

I believe I can safely assume that anyone who is attracted to this show expects it to be comedy. And yes, it is total comedy with some not so serious moments.\r\nArt: meh....not average, but not astounding. No unnecessary fanservice. Heck no fanservice at all, I say, except for that one episode with a 3 second tentacle scene. (Yes, there are boobs and asses, but most of the time the story will take your attention away from it)\r\nCharacter: deeply thought out characters,but it's not the characters that draw me to the anime. It was the plot and comedy. And Yes, plot not 'Plot' \\n\\n\r\nSound: Good enough I suppose. I watched both dub and sub. They were equally good. However in the dub they rephrase most lines to take out dirty jokes. If you watched the subbed, at one episode you would see the subtitle 'He came.....*not gonna give spoiler*....' The 'came' here given the context was a really dirty and *beep* joke.  (beep cause of spoiler alert)\\n\\n\r\n   *To all you dub lovers, you don't have to stop your devotion. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9. Gintama (I gave it enjoyment 10) made me laugh harder. This show is certainly worth the watch if you're looking for a good laugh. And it doesn't make you want to binge either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 (the score I wanted to give it). But going by the subscores I've given Keijo!!!!!!!!, mathematically, it's 8. \\n\\n",

If you removed the tits-and-ass gimmick and replaced it with any other activity, you would end up with a normal, and very mediocre sports anime.   This is the show's big weakness; it would have done well to accept is status as a completely stupid series and went full-on with it and tossed in some unpredictable gags; but no, it had to try and be \"cool\".   \r\nAs a \"serious sports anime\" it fails completely on every aspect :\r\n - No real build-up to the battles, so nodrama\\n\r\n - No tension since you don't care who wins\\n\r\n - You can predict the outcome of pretty much every fight\\n\r\n - The animation isn't very appealing because no matter how fluid it is, swinging your ass around has few aesthetic qualities\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are incredibly weak, completely one dimensional and serve only as a vessel for their specialized tits-and-ass gimmick.  You won't care about or like any of them.  It's almost insulting how they try to include some 20 second flashbacks here and there as if to say \"HA! See we DID have backstories!\".  They are every bit as vapid as anything else in the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the show succeeds is its comedic appeal.  The gimmick seems to inherently provide an endless supply of easy but functional gags.  Keijo has its moment of genuine brilliance, especially when it borrows a mechanic from other popular animes and parodies them.  But for the most part you will be laughing in exasperation at just how stupid everything is.  And that, i suppose, is entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nVisually, it's fan-service galore, as you expect.  But within one episode you will be complete desensitized to it.  It's never really erotic, just stupid and over-present.  Overall it has a little bit of value as eye-candy, but generally these girls do nothing for me.   \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest tragedy is that an apparently high quality orchestral soundtrack was wasted on such a mediocre piece.  At least i think it's good?  Since most of the time it's so quiet you can't hear it.  The staff really thinks that characters constantly shit-talking each other on the battlefield is more exciting than dramatic music.  Oh well, i'm sure they know better than i do.  \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, watching this was not a COMPLETE waste of time, but i will certainly not be watching any sequels.  I would rather recommend that you watch an excerpt or two of some of the battles and you will have seen everything there is to see without wasting 4 hours.",

The entire show is exactly as stupid as the synopsis makes it sound, but it's extremely fun and entertaining.\r\nI'll do the category breakdown but I've already said everything you need to know. I loved watching this show, ridiculous as it was.\r\nStory: It's a sport genre show. There is no \"story\". Main team tries to defeat other team, with training sprinkled in. In thiscase it's the main team vs the east team. idk their names cause they don't matter.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was good. It really did a great job of keeping me interested in the show, despite the insane stupidity going on.\\n\\n\r\nSound: ... I got nothing for this one. I liked it I guess\\n\r\nCharacter: This is no Haikyuu but the characters were pretty good. Each character introduced was memorable for their own traits and quirks. On the other hand, there were way too many different important characters that you really don't need to care about. The main girls were better than average sports shows though so Id say 7 is fair.\\n\\n\r\nIll break down the enjoyment category for this one because it's important. This show is pure stupidity. There is no consistency and their attempts to explain the insanity going on in the races is comical at best. But holy cow was this show a blast to watch. I can honestly say that I am looking forward to watching and laughing at the next season if it comes out. I recommend giving this show a try if you have some time to kill.",

            "content": "Welcome to the world of KEIJO!!!! An international well-known sport of... you guessed it! Boob and Butt war! Now sit back, relax and enjoy this not so ecchi version review of the show! The show Keijo is a show as you'd expect it to be, a literal pvp battle using only butts and boobs. Its unique storyline was what piqued my interest (ahem... mostly innocent) to watch such a show as it is getting much rarer to see a UNIQUE plotline in anime in recent years.\r\nPlot 7/10 \r\nThe main selling point about this show is all about the battles! The battles are nothing short ofinteresting and every battle keeps you entertained from start to end, and never fails to deliver any satisfaction and excitement in any of the episodes shown. Every aspect of the battle is something to be admired. From the wide variety of interesting battle styles and move-sets (yes, battle styles) to the creative designs and ideas of Land (battleground name), all of them blew any expectations i had of the show out of bounds (get it? xD). The show transformed what would seem to be an ordinary butt shoving competition into something way more exciting, in every aspect of battle (battleground, moveset, battle type) and their never ending stream of suprise movesets keeps any audience on their toes and eager to see what comes next, making the show a hype stream from start to end. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, as entertaining as the battles go, that's about it, i'm afraid. Other than the interesting battles, there's not much going in in terms of plot. Sure, there's a specific goal in mind for the anime and it is a simple one indeed, to be the number 1 Keijo player in the world, and.... that's it. It presents nothing else to the story. Sure, there were some backstories here and there but the battles overshadow them so much they don't appear important at all and all the other plot lines excluding battle wise are nothing much to be said or... cared for that matter. But since the anime is all about battles anyway, it doesn't really stand out much.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be REALLY honest, i gave it  5 partly because of my own inability to digest the inconsistencies of the character designs. Disregarding their bloated hairstyles (for me, it's just an art style to get used to), the part that really gets to me is how much a lot of the characters are different. No, not different in the sense they have different personalities but it mostly has to do with their body structure. Of course different girls have different body structures but some of the characters are so vastly different from the others that it's like they are from different anime shows. Example: Most of the girls are the same with slightly different bust and chests but some of them are so buffed and manly, they don't even look like they have butts. This concerns me because the difference in characters make me feel like they don't fit together at all, like they are drawn by 2 different authors and forcefully mashed together into a collab anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing really stands out with the music. Battle music is pleasing, the opening and ending songs are standard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis ties in with what i mentioned in the plot subsection about the plot not being anything much other than battle fuelled. In my opinion, the reason that is is because of the character development. As i have said, the battle is what made the anime. And as such, there is a considerable lack of decent character development. Even though there isn't any flaws with any of the characters, there just isn't much going on with them that could make anyone sympathise with them or even care much. Even when they provided some of the character's backstory, it just doesn't welcome any affection for them because they just aren't well developed throughout the story, and feels like it is inserted through sheer force. But, other than that, there isn't any real flaws with any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, i really enjoyed watching the show. Casual, simple and entertaining. Not to mention a unique storyline and lots of surprise attacks keeps me well satisfied throughout the show and doesn't feel boring. If you just feel like watching something casual, or are just here for the fan service, you should give it a try, couldn't hurt ;)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I am reviewing Keijo as if it is meant to be satire and not taken entirely serious. I feel Keijo was meant to be a comedy with ecchi, but the ecchi not being too sexual and more comedic.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is good. The story is not anything special. It\u2019s simply about a girl trying to rise to the top and she goes to a Keijo training school in hopes of making her debut. In the training school, they go through many hurdles by the exercises and the elite class students. The terms for the special moves are rather funny. The training exercises they have to doearly on in the series are questionable (illogical).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters elevate themselves to the East-West war, and you meet a new cast of characters from the rival training school. With the East-West war beginning, things get even more retarded (ex. a judo body slam with a nipple).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have their archetypes, yet they are distinctly weird in their own way (ex. Aoba can analyze and copy an opponent\u2019s moves by groping their butt.) The main characters aren\u2019t too over powered, and it would be boring if they didn\u2019t have to try. The production crew or the original manga artists could have made Nozomi, Miyata, Aoba and Non overpowered from the beginning, starting out in the elite class and being at the professional level standard already.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme isn\u2019t very memorable or catchy. It does amp one up for the upcoming events of the episode (as I think any sports anime should). The ending theme is simply a chill down song, but it\u2019s not as good at the opening in my own opinion. The music as they battle is usually symphonic in a way to fit with the battles, but it really depends. I don\u2019t remember the tracks that well.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Keijo has a nice style to it. It has sharp crisp varying linework and nice cel shade and airbrush coloring as well. In the last couple of episodes during the East-West war, the art gets a bit \u201crough\u201d. What do I mean \u201crough\u201d? Well, you can clearly see that mid ground characters have uneven faces, no toes and almost no detail. I will assume the deadlines were getting tight, and I hope they fix the problems in the DVD release.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Keijo for the comedy value of the ecchi. It is very weird and I like weird. I feel some of the dialogue could have been more interesting (in certain conversations with certain characters). Otherwise, the logic from my brain has been drained and turned into a butt.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend if you\u2019re looking for something that makes sense, then you\u2019re definitely in the wrong place. How did you even get here to this page? If you want an ecchi anime that the ecchi isn\u2019t portrayed in an intensely sexual way, then this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s all! \\n\\n\r\n-  plumapplejuice\\n",

            "content": "(This is my first review, so I apologize if it sucks.)\r\n At first glance, this anime didn't seem like my cup of tea. Young woman using their large bosoms and dairy airs to knock people off a platform in the middle of a pool for sport. Utterly grotesque. Then one day I stumbled upon a promo video for the DVD on YouTube, and I became slightly intrigued. Though I still had my guard up, I watched episode one just to see what all the talk in the comments were about. To my surprise, it was actually pretty darn good, and I mean that in anon sarcastic way. The plot isn't the best, but once the really awesome butt-fighting scenes and character development gets rolling, I wasn't even paying attention to the plot anymore (\"I'm talking about boobs\"). The animation is top notch and the voice acting is decent as well (I watched the dub). If your thinking about watching this anime, one thing to keep in mind is, don't take it seriously. The butt-fighting moves are unrealistic (in a good way). I went into it like that, and soon found that it's more of a perverted action comedy than a slice of life sports anime. Overall, I enjoyed this anime, and I don't think you'll find one quiet like it. Thank you.",

            "content": "Navigating through any social media outlets during this anime season, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to not find any gifs or screen-caps of anime girls in swimsuits strutting their stuff. No, everyone didn\u2019t suddenly become obsessed with ecchi overnight. It turns out, girls clashing their booties and boobies makes for an explosively exciting sport. And this is exactly what Keijo!!!!!!!! is all about.\r\nKeijo is a professional sport where girls compete on a ring floating over water to push their opponent off with nothing but their butts or boobs. The competition is intense. For 18-year old Nozomi Kaminashi, she wants nothing more than to be the prize queenof Keijo \u2014 a prestigious position of vast fortune and fame granted to only the very best player in the world.  Nozomi is hoping to use this wealth to help her struggling family out of poverty.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s be honest here. I don\u2019t think anyone goes into Keijo expecting to be knee-deep (or ass-deep for my fellow pun lovers) in a thought-provoking narrative. What you see is what you get; fierce battles with over-the-top signature moves, an ambitiously overeager protagonist aiming for the stars, and ridiculously humorous training arcs all guised under butt-loads of fan-service. In that regard, it\u2019s not for everyone. But if you can get past the fan-service, what you\u2019ll find is an immensely entertaining and creative series that will have you rolling for hours. Seriously, you have a girl whose special ability entails hypnotizing you with their boobs to render their opponent useless. Or an ass vacuum that can rips a person (or their clothes, more likely) asunder with violent winds. Or even a wedgie that, the deeper it rides, the closer to the speed of light a person achieves. These outrageously random abilities make it so you have absolutely no idea what\u2019s coming next. One thing is for sure, the writer for Keijo stretches the abilities of this show to the absolute limit.\\n\\n\r\nEven while Keijo is a satirical piece, there are still elements of the series that will take you pleasantly by surprise. For as prototypical as the cast seems, Nozomi and her friends are all fun characters. Throughout the course of the show, they show an immense amount of growth as they foster teamwork and and tackle personal issues to overcome their problems. Are you ever really surprised by the results of their matches? Not necessarily, but the series isn\u2019t about that. It\u2019s about the journey of this group of friends and the hilarious happenings along the way. Keijo is just the vehicle that drives it home. It helps that Nozomi is a surprisingly likable protagonist, as one cannot help but be sucked in by her drive to be the best and the compassion she has for the friends surrounding her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI think it\u2019s also worth mentioning that the art in Keijo is nothing to sneeze at. While the character designs are very simple, the animation is rather fluid. The art style itself is nice to look at, incorporating thick bold lines to make the characters pop in a way that is arguably similar to that of Needless, except without the sharp angles. These bold lines come together with dynamic angles and speed lines to make battles explosive.  It almost feels like you\u2019re playing Street Fighter when a signature move is freeze-framed with overlaying text.\\n\\n\r\nAs a small aside, the bulletin boards used during battles remind me of those used in earlier Pokemon series, when Ashe visits the elite four.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Keijo was surprisingly enjoyable. Is this series for everyone? No, absolutely not. But those who can see past the tropes and fan service will find a terribly entertaining show that\u2019ll have you laughing until it hurts. What helps make Keijo stands out is that it doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously and that\u2019s precisely what makes it so darn funny. You have characters pulling off all these crazy antics that are so hard to believe and yet, they\u2019re dead serious about their goals and aspirations. For a brief moment, it\u2019s even possible to forget you\u2019re watching a sport about butts and boobs. Well, at least until you see a girl use her hardened nipple to throw her opponent overhead. Then it becomes obvious that this series is a satire on Shounen through and through. Anyway, If you\u2019re looking for something more along those lines this season, then perhaps a slower show such as March Comes in like a Lion or a light-hearted piece like Yuri!! on Ice is more up your alley.\\n\\n\r\n-- Palpable =D\\n\\n\r\nFor more reviews like this, you can visit my blog at palpableemotion.wordpress.com",

            "content": "So people think Fan Service is bad and useless? What if we give them a show that''s 100% fan service?\r\nI swear that's how \"Keijo!!!!!!!!\" was born...\r\nNow, don't get me wrong, even though that was probably the concept behind this show (and the original manga as well), it pays off. The anime community is used to big boobs, to cleavage shots, to big butts and not only using that experience but taking it to the next level was a very good idea. Because even though it creates a straight forward plot and avoids getting deep into the story, this way of doing stuff makes \"Keijo!!!!!!!!\" avery enjoyable show to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is weak, no doubt about that, and you probably won't enjoy this show if you're looking for something with a deeper story. Why? Because it's just not here. There are plenty of options if you're looking for that out there, but this show won't quite cut it for you. So why is it entertaining to watch? Because it's dumb. The concept, the way the characters deal with the challanges, the way they practice, the way they talk, and even the anime clich\u00e9s that they implement. All of that makes for a show that lacks a deep plot but still gets a lot of views, simply because it is entertaining. If you take your mind off of your \"This has a deeper meaning, this action will be part of the bigger plot\" mode, you can (and you probably will) enjoy this show a lot, because that's the way it was meant to be watched.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this show is satire.It makes fun of how sexual anime shows can get and the clich\u00e9s we as a community keep having to sit through show in show out. Do I mind these clich\u00e9s? Absolutly not, for the most part. They're something that's unique to anime and I laugh whenever they show up again (and again, and again...). But I do know they exist, and \"Keijo!!!!!!!!\" takes that knowledge and makes fun of it by exaggerating it to the point of having hardcore anime fans clicking off saying it's too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe key element here is: Fan service can be bad, it can hurt your show and it can get people to click off. But that fan service is the useless kind. It's the fan service that producers get into their shows to grab people's attention when they feel like the show could use something to grab the viewers other then the plot. But I feel like \"Keijo!!!!!!!!\"'s fan service is part of the satire, and because of that it is very important and absolutely needed. It's not too much fan service because, by definition, it's not even fan service. It's part of the story. The story itself IS fan service, and that's not only okay, it's amazing.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts: \"Keijo!!!!!!!!\" isn't the next big thing, or the best show in 2016, but I think it's a very enjoyable show to watch and I do recommend it if you're looking for something light on plot to just enjoy yourself and laugh a little.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nPS.: What's up with the EIGHT exclamation marks?",

            "content": "What's that? Were you expecting some kind of third rate show? Perhaps something poorly animated? Or something that's outright crude? Well, surprise!\r\nHoming butt missiles, speed boosting wedgies, Unlimited Butt Works, and asses made hard like steel!\r\nKeijo!! plays less like a sports anime and more like a traditional battle shounen... only with butts being the weapon of choice, of course. A spunky main protagonist with promising talent is dead set on being the best of the best. They enter some sort of training ground and are swiftly enough dealt with by a stronger opponent that remind them where their place lies. Instead of being disheartened bydefeat, they get back up and train harder for the next encounter. They then continue pushing themselves to their limits and prepare themselves for the upcoming presumed tournament. A straight forward and simple setup, just like what you've seen before from the genre (tropes included). But what makes Keijo!! notable and quite sharply separates it from the rest of the usual schlock, is not necessarily what it does well, butt simply what it doesn't do wrong. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no bait and switch tactic, no grandiose pretentious speeches to mask the lack of a substantive narrative, no infantilizing melodrama, ect. Certainly, the otherwise eye-rolling yet attention grabbing premise has the more cartoony aspect of it put to full use and steadily ramps up it's absurdity with each episode. All, surprisingly enough, with good pacing and a lack of streamlining of it's ideas. It does away with all the unnecessary contrivances precisely by sticking to a simple plot structure and thus creating a strong foundation. And while it pulls it's absurdity with a straight face, Keijo!! as a whole is not at all serious. Much like it's characters, it strays away from being mean in spirit. After the battles the characters all prove themselves to be amiable, always coming back to show their enjoyment of the sport. Along with it's outlandish butt and breast slapping glory, it is also splurged with ridiculous but totally engaging dialog. It maintains a consistent level of quality uncommon in shows within it's own genre. Plenty of episodes end on a perfect note, too, sincerely keeping you craving for more. This is indeed something even your average anime routinely fails to achieve. That aside, there a few dips in the quality of the animation itself, and the characters are largely animated with thin to thick sketchy outlines. Obviously, the limits of it's budget are in display, butt it more than makes up for it with the occasional savory anatomical precision of the gluteus maximus! \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, quite contrary to expectations, should you be an ecchi enthusiast, you might actually be disappointed to know that Keijo!! does not offer the kind of service you've become accustomed to.  It's fanservice is still ubiquitous, but quite tame especially when compared to it's lewder counterparts. In fact, it seems like the kind of show that should've aired at least half a decade ago. And even back then we had shows like Queen's Blade, Panty & Stocking with Garter-belt, as well as another show by the same studio like To Love-Ru, ect. All of which are raunchy-er than keijo!!! by several magnitudes.  \\n\\n\r\nBut Keijo!! doesn't care to fulfill your gratuitous-nipple quota, it launches it's menacing butts in your general direction with the sole intention to obliterate everything in it's path! Keijo!! is not fool's gold, it is a shining example of how ecchi should be done. If more ecchi followed Keijo!!'s example, perhaps the genre as a whole would at least receive less negative reception and not be treated with little more than passing apathy. You don't have to be an ecchi fan to submerge yourself in Keijo!!, it should prove itself to be a refreshing endeavor with the usual elements working harmoniously for once. \\n\\n\r\nIt might just be an ever so small gem, but it is to be cherished. One cannot simply deny that Keijo!! is both sexy, and awesome! \\n\\n\r\nNot unless, of course, you happen to be a... dishonest cretin.",

            "content": "Story wasn't very good or had much depth but I don't think the show aims at that. The whole sport of Keijo is cool, the rules are quite simple to understand and sounds like an sport that could actually work in real life. This is one of those animes based on tournaments and fights rather than developing any real story. We have the main character, no one notices her and everyone is looking at the cool and popular characters, but the mc is extremely positive and strong and slowly it becomes the strongest character. This show can be divided in 2, the parts where thecharacters compete, and the parts where the characters train to learn new techniques and be stronger for the competition parts. Quite clich\u00e9 but works well.\\n\\n\r\nArt was quite good, fights were very impactful, overall characters were well drawn and the sound effects during the fights were amazing and made everything more epic. The last episode's animation was aful and had so many quality drops, I assume it will get fixed on the blu ray versions. Opening and ending weren't very memorable, watched them once and skipped. OST was kinda generic, nothing memorable from it either but it fitted the scenes well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were plain, but again I don't think the show was trying to make a complex background for each one, the only one that got some backstory was Maya, but wasn't very convincing, it looked more like a resource to make the main character look good helping her with her traumas, rather than trying to give any depth to the character (which considering finding images of her on Google thrown almost no results, shows it will probably be gone on the following chapters of the manga). The main cast of 4 friends were all clich\u00e9s, we knew nothing about none of them and there wasn't anything unique about them at all. Again, I'm not saying this is required for every single show, but the characters are not the strongest point of this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a good show to watch if you are bored. The fights are well animated and entertaining, the attacks and moves get more and more ridiculous as episodes go by, and characters, although plain, are likeable and well designed. Don't hype this show because this is not the best show of the year, but it is definitively one of the most entertaining and fun to watch.",

            "content": "Keijo!!!!!!!! is a sports/fighting anime where girls get ahead using their behinds and knock their opponents around with their knockers.\r\nThe art is good and generally clean. There are some issues in the later episodes with the animation, but it's only noticeable if you pause at certain points. The sound is fine. I can only remember that one sound clip they play at the episode title card; the rest is forgettable.\r\nThe premise of Keijo!!!!!!!! is something I'd like to say is stupid and ridiculous, but I love it. The girls must use their boobs and butts to either knock their opponents off their feet or overboardinto the water. As a man who is a fan of boobs and butts, there was no way I could dislike Keijo!!!!!!!! Well, the storyline is actually pretty cliche. We follow the journey of Nozomi through Keijo academy, where she learns to utilize her assets to their full potitial. Wait, I meant potentiass. F***. Anyways, she gets better, learns a signature move a la \"shadow clone jitsu,\" and is determined to be the very best, that no one ever was. The battles themselves are entertaining and creatively done.\\n\\n\r\nAh, the characters of Keijo!!!!!!!! Of course, there's the main posse of Nozomi, Miyata, Toyoguchi, and Aoba. Though there are 50 or so students in the class, we only get in-depth background on a handful of them. The rest are defined by a single character trait. For example, Toyoguchi is clumsy, Mio Kusakai loves cute girls, Kotone Fujisaki loves BL, etc. Can't say there's much depth to most of the characters, but what Keijo!!!!!!!! lacks in quality, it makes up for with quantitty. Heck, we don't even learn much about the main girl Nozomi or her background, but we love her anyway. Right?\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you're looking for inspiring life lessons, evolving plots, or introspective moments, Keijo!!!!!!!! is NOT for you. If you like cliche sports/fighting animes with training montages, powerful techniques, and cheesy motivational speeches, then Keijo!!!!!!!! is that plus all the boobs and butt you can ever want.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would rate Keijo!!!!!!!! a 7, but the hilarity and guilty pleasure factors raise it to a solid 8!!!!!!!!\\n",

            "content": "One of the reasons why I find the anime medium as alluring as I do is in part because of its inherent creativity. This may sound strange, considering that the general consensus amongst heavy consumers of the medium is that most modern anime is rife with trite, overused tropes and overused storylines. Carbon copies of previous successes, duplicates of tried and tested formulas that end up feeling vapid, lifeless, and downright boring. \r\nBut I insist, the anime medium is special and unique, and full of so many original ideas that have inspired a variety of award-winning, blockbuster hits in the west. From Satoshi Kon inspiringthe likes of Inception, to Mamoru Oshii inspiring the likes of the Matrix, regardless of the state of anime today, it\u2019s undeniable that the medium is capable of ideas that may never be conceived in the west.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Keijo is one such idea. \\n\\n\r\nHonest with its absurdity and rife with boob and booty shots, Keijo is very entertaining. Despite what its Twitter page would like to persuade you to believe (>Keijo is a serious sports drama) the show\u2019s first and foremost priority is nothing other than to entertain you. If you find the show boring then that\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s unfair to criticize the show for lacking \u2018depth of character\u2019 or impacting the \u2018history of the medium\u2019 when the show is not trying to do either of those things. I\u2019m writing this seemingly conclusive denouement at the beginning of my review because Keijo\u2019s honest simplicity makes it nonsensical to criticize the show for anything other than whether or not it was entertaining. If you found it entertaining, then the show did it\u2019s job and nothing I or anyone writes in a review can change that.\\n\\n\r\nThe same way Food Wars is practically One Piece disguised as cooking show, Keijo is also a battle shounen disguised as a\u2026 well, Keijo show. As Food Wars tends to abandon all logic as often as it wants, Keijo does the same (as if it\u2019s premise is not illogical enough). Vacuum Butt Cannons, titty hypnosis, asses harder than steel, booby lasers, butt stands, whatever you can imagine this show will match that. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. It\u2019s utterly perverted. It\u2019s also a ton of fun, and really, that is all that can be asked and expected from this show. As long as it delivers that much, then what\u2019s the harm?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are as trite as they can get, but honestly what else would you expect? Color-coded archetypes peppered in at every corner of the show never challenge your expectations. A black-haired, outgoing and air-headed female protagonist; a white-haired, calm, collected and cool-headed supporting character; a brown-haired, talented but awfully conservative country girl; a blonde-haired, big-breasted overtly sexual upper echelon of the Keijo school\u2026 and so on so forth. The writers are incredibly transparent with their intentions and often shy away from offering you a character arc that shows any semblance of heart. \\n\\n\r\nReferring back to what their Twitter page would like you to believe (>Keijo is a serious sports drama), the drama aspect of the show is laughable, and should never once be taken seriously. As soon as you do so, you\u2019ll lose out on enjoying the show. The drama facet of the story is shoehorned into the narrative in order to haphazardly construct a meaningful conflict, but you\u2019ll be naive to buy into it and take it as seriously as the show wants you to. \\n\\n\r\nSince the show is already securing itself as the best fully-fledged out purely fan-service title, why not take the time parody other titles too? Attack on Buttitans, Gilgamesh\u2019s Gate of Bootylon, Keijo leaves no show untouched and it\u2019s hilarious! Drawing on meta-humour like that and parodying some of the most popular franchises in the medium only further drives home how entertaining Keijo is.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is rather memorable, I especially love the color palette as I find it quite appealing. The drawing of the cast\u2019s booties and bosoms is also rather accurate, sans the occasional chest monstrosity present of course. A lot of thought was put into the sound design as well, when boobs cut the air and butts collide, the sounds are impactful, and do a great job of conveying the true, earth-shattering force in which their pudenda metaphorically cross. As far as the audiovisual experience goes, I didn\u2019t notice any glaring problems and found it to be a smooth visual experience. \\n\\n\r\nAll that really matters when watching Keijo is whether or not you enjoy yourself. Did you smile a bit? Did you get playfully aroused? Did it eventually force a chuckle out of you? Answered yes to any of these? Then the show is more than fine. I certainly wouldn\u2019t recommend this to anyone excessively conservative and nor would I recommend this to anyone with negative preconceived notions of the anime medium, but to a field-tested, seasoned anime veteran who\u2019s simply looking to enjoy their anime consumption, then Keijo couldn\u2019t be more of a first choice. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was informative and helpful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Keijo is a fairly unorthodox show, starring a notso generic setting with young maidens enrolling in a high school (well, it\u2019s supposed to be a high school but is actually a sports training facility more than anything) where ladies fight with their breasts and bottoms. The important distinction here being, of course, that it\u2019s not a worthless harem and while the show is clearly fanservicey, it has a clear purpose in the rather, um, spectacular showings (including some pretty sweet action scenes) going on.\r\nThat paragraph alone tells you whether you will or will not enjoy Keijo, which (suffice to say) is completely reliant on yourability to suspend your disbelief enough to accept the, uh, internal logic of the show as well as the absolutely absurd premise and battles.\\n\\n\r\nThe story works out fairly simply, with the various leads enrolling in a school/training facility to learn how to master the, ehem, sport in question and become professionals. There is nothing particularly striking or different about it once the battles subside; the show is fairly generic in its quiet moments and while that isn\u2019t a bad thing, the action scenes are clearly the highlight of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the action scenes, they\u2019re an incredible amount of fun, extremely well choreographed (in more ways than one) and never felt anticlimactic or dull. The strategies are completely ridiculous, ranging from making a butt look like boobs to calling a butt Cerberus to literally parodying the ever so infamous gate of Babylon move to whip out infinite butts (a personal favorite). While the action scenes never look bad, there is a very noticeable drop in animation quality as the show goes on, and it clearly shows in the last few episodes, where it\u2019s clear that the studio was saving budget for a spectacular final showing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality looks decent but nothing spectacular, only looking straight up great during the action scenes, where there is a lot of fluent movement and really nice looking CGI effects. The artwork looks distinct and nice, but is also nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are generally likeable but very basic, which while isn\u2019t a bad thing doesn\u2019t leave much room for them to develop (which isn\u2019t the purpose of the show, sure, but a review is a review). Their interactions are loads of fun and even had me chuckling from time to time, but mostly when about the absurd setting and not when they\u2019re interacting with each other as characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Keijo isn\u2019t a show for everyone; those who do find the premise \u201cinteresting\u201d will find an incredibly fun show and solid timewaster, while those who are unable to suspend their disbelief will not enjoy it. Both are perfectly acceptable opinions and it boils down to what you, the viewer, wants to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThank you very much for reading this review, any and all feedback would be appreciated.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Keijo is a pretty simple concept. Female players compete to be the last person standing on the Land. The only catch is that they can only use their breasts and butt to knock each other off, because well, Japan.\r\nYou\u2019re probably thinking the same thing I was at first. How on Earth are they going to fill twelve episodes with this? No matter how much you love silly humor, twelve episodes of fanservice-fighting with moves that are getting more ridiculous by the minute will bore everyone eventually. I had serious doubts they would manage to fill up hours with something that sounds like it was thoughtup one drunk night out. But those thoughts were quickly brushed aside as the series progressed. \\n\\n\r\nKeijo is smarter than you give them credit for at first. Although the general concept never changes and the outcome of all the fights is as predictable as it gets, there is more going on. We learn about the different types of fighters, anatomy, teamwork and different types of Lands. The boring circular ring is quickly left behind for special types ranging from a giant floating castle to two airplanes and even a jungle-type Land. Although the MC stays pretty much cardboard, many of the other characters transform along with the Lands. We learn what drives them to pick up this silly sport in the first place. For some it\u2019s simple money, fame or attention from hot looking guys (although there are no male characters to be seen anywhere), but others have deeper reasons. They want to fight to prove themselves, to make their dad proud, to put their village on the map or just because they want to beat their rivals or even the demons within themselves. You never question who will rule the Land in the end, but the anime does a good job of making you care about the reasons that brought all of them there in the first place. And it\u2019s always fun to see what crazy tactic they\u2019ll pull out of their asses in next battle. And yes you can take that literally in some cases.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all that, Keijo is also a flawed story. Conflicts arise on paper-thin grounds and evaporate by shaking hands after battle. Clearly, they care a lot more about the inner conflicts of the characters than conflicts between them, because in the end, everyone is a happy girl who is friends with everyone. The MC is also pretty boring. Her whole reason to pick up Keijo is built on quicksand and that\u2019s a shame. They could have really done more with this. But maybe it\u2019s a good thing they didn\u2019t take things too seriously.\\n\\n\r\nAs an ecchi, this show really knocks the ball out of the park. I consider myself a bit of an expert on ecchi, so I was worried at first. I know only a few studios that can pull off ecchi well and Xebec is not one of them. Their only real ecchi show is the famous To Love Ru, which, although very popular, suffered the same problem most ecchi shows have: fundamentally unlikeable spineless MC who's about as dense as you can get and a plot that doesn\u2019t really go anywhere. In ecchi, it\u2019s very easy to burn yourself, so when Xebec announced a new ecchi show, I wasn\u2019t about to watch it.\\n\r\nHowever. IMS made Masou Gakuen HxH and Hundred around the same time and TNK was busy on the Seven Deadly Sins, but neither of these seemed to match the rather strange popularity of a silly sports anime about fighting with breasts and butts. So what was going on here? \\n\r\nDid Xebec pull it off? The dream of every studio that makes ecchi? Did they make something that did not feel like another copy-paste exercise? No, that wasn\u2019t possible.\\n\r\nExcept, it was.\\n\r\nKeijo has thrown everything out of the window with the premise of the show. There is no need to find stupid excused for ecchi-scenes, it\u2019s right there in the premise. Of course ecchi scenes will happen, they are fighting in bikinis with their breasts and butt. Not only that, but by the same logic, we can leave behind our stupid male MC, his tsundere girlfriend, his little sister and his childhood friend altogether. So while the ecchi stays pretty tame, it\u2019s not a problem because we\u2019ve never seen this before. We\u2019ve seen the accidental boob-grope a million times before, but a girl using her breasts to bash someone in the head and knock them in the water, now that is a welcome change from traditional ecchi. So yes, it works. But it only works for twelve episodes because the story isn\u2019t interesting enough to keep going beyond that, and the \u2018new\u2019 part of it only stays original for one season.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, is Keijo worth picking up? Depends. It belongs to three genres (ecchi, comedy and sports) and all three are there to carry along the plot. Unless you hate fanservice, sport-animes, an inexplicable female-only cast or shounen-style fights with the power of friendship, I would say go for it. It will drag you along for twelve episodes with a permanent grin on your face. You can say whatever you want about it, but they sure did their best to make it as entertaining as possible without once slipping.",

It isn't.\r\nThe anime does a great job of having a sport about butts and breasts without it being about the butts and breasts. Now, the premise of the show may sound absurd- and it is. That is where Keijo!!!!!!!! excels, in its complete absurdity. Every episode goes further than that which came before and it works incredibly well.\r\nThe very presence of tits and asses is comedic rather than lewd. Every time booties and boobies are mentioned, it's either a very serious discussion about the sport or some kind of absurd comedy/parody.\r\nThe charactersaren't anything special, but they do possess a surprising amount of depth and they feel quite down to earth. Their motivations may not be the most complex, but they are very human and real.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a fun, simple, anime with great animation and fight sequences, Keijo!!!!!!!! will provide.",

            "content": "TL;DR:\r\nThe whole joke of this anime is, that it takes itself so serious even though it's obviously total trash. Unfortunately this joke becomes boring rather quick. Besides this, you get a bad Shounen and a mediocre Ecchi.\r\n-----\r\nBesides the setting, Keijo is picking up so many overused Shounen stereotypes that it could have been a parody of the genre: Characters getting power-boosts mid-fight, semi-tragic character backgrounds getting explained mid-fights... You know the drill.\r\nMost characters (including the MC) are poorly written and/or have no real purpose except for giving you the feeling that this show has more than like 5 characters. The only real \"backstories\" (Sayakas andMayas) have been done millions of times before.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the MC really quick: She wants to become the worlds best Keijo player. That's it. No background and no character progression except her learning new overpowered special-moves.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is rather simple and many parts feel like there were revised over and over again. For example the anime introduces us the girls which share the dorm with the MC and it seems like they are about to form some kind of team against other competing students. A few episodes later all the former competitors are now friends and they're fighting together. Huh? The direction of the story doesn't make much sense and feels really rushed. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOk now, let's finally get to the point though:\\n\r\nYou are not watching this for the story, do you? You probably want some laughs about butts and breasts hitting each other and hope for some good fan-service.\\n\r\nLet's talk about the comedy first: While there are some good gags, there are mostly (IMO not so) funny named special-moves. Think of \"super-titty-twister\" or something. The anime takes itself really serious, which is funny at first once you remind yourself that you are watching girls trying to push each other from a platform using only their breasts and butt. The joke however became boring to me. Why don't have some character(s) who is aware of how stupid the sport of Keijo is and point that out? \\n\r\nThe ecchi was okay-ish. My problem is, that there is so much ecchi on screen continuously that you can't really get excited about it. It's rather hard to find some scene without sexy bikini grills. Keijo is always trying to do something even more lewd than before and surprisingly doesn't even fail in doing so (looking at you, Shimoneta).\\n\\n\r\nSo, would I watch it again? Hell no. Do I regret picking it up as a seasonal anime at some point? Could have been worse.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nYou know when I read the description I was curious to see what this anime would do and i was expecting it to be fanservice galore which it was, but it had other surprising things\r\nThe story concentrates on Nozomi Kaminashi who wants to become the next national champion of Keijo a game where women knock each other around with their breasts and butts.\r\nAt first the story felt like the usual fanservice stuff that i have seen before, but the more it went on it got more interesting because there is actually more to Keijo than just women hitting each other with their breastsand butts there's actually a kind of honor if that even is the right for it because these girls do take it very seriously and you actually want to support them throughout the show when their going up against their rivals, I'm also surprised that you could make Breast and butt battle moves sound epic however there were a few that were jokes of other animes.\\n\r\nI did enjoy the main group of girls try to become good at Keijo since they started out as the worst because of their lack of teamwork then the more they try the more you want to back them up and want them to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were actually well developed, they can be funny, but serious as well especially when it comes to the keijo matches.\\n\r\nNozomi the MC was very positive, determined and whenever she made a mistake or tried to learn a new move that required a lot of training she never gave up until she had mastered it and she also cared about her friends too making her a very likeable MC.\\n\r\nSayaka who is Nozomi's best friend lacks in the breast department, but makes up for it in the butt area because she is a former Judo athlete and she uses this to her advantage when she fights her opponents, she's also a mixture of a Kuudere and a Tsundere which for her actually mixes well and there are a few moments where she is a pretty funny character.\\n\r\nKazane is the shy one of the group and hardly talks, but is probably at some point the most badass of the girls since her power of sorts is OP, but out of all the girls she is the one who gets the most losses so you feel sorry for her most of the time.\\n\r\nNon is a girl from the country and is incredibly, there was a great where she accidentally puts one Sayaka's underwear instead of her own, but her soft backside helps her take any attack from her opponents making her a worthy opponent.\\n\r\nThere are other side characters and some did actually stand out for me like Mio, Hanabi, Rin and Kotone whose personalities were very fun or scary depending on their mood since these girls are very serious, but they provide a lot of laughs and seemed very well done supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe Artstyle was ok it was definitely bright at times, but the way the powers were shown in the anime was pretty damn good and looked epic which is surprising since these powers come from the strength of the girls Breasts or Butts.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sport aspect which is Keijo itself was actually pretty good the matches were very entertaining and when the girls were training there was some pretty fun moments too when they trained with Kyoko Shirayuki who helped Nozomi and the others improve their techniques and fighting style.\\n\r\nThe teachers were pretty good and the one who stands out is Nagisa who was a former Keijo prize queen who injured herself from a move that Nozomi has learned and she helps her to master the move and use it properly so it doesn't destroy her chances of winning.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course there is the fanservice now at first for like the first 3 episodes it felt pretty ridiculous, but as the series went on it improved and became less stupid and more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall this was a surprising anime I thought it was just gonna be pointless fanservice, but there was actually some good character development and was pretty entertaining so if you like women battle with each other using their breasts and butts then you might like this.",

Not only was i amazed, i was shock how good this series was. I got addicted to it and watched it all in days. I watched the dub version scrubs.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nStory was good and Nozomi really stood out. Her character develpment really shined and instanteneously gravated toward me. Not only that, her cheerful and perceiving attitude to become the best keijo player really was Outstanding.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nArt was okay. The animation during the fight scenes were well drawn. THe whole anime was living with bright colors.I give them a plus for having such special effects on well drawn out moves. Those moments were really awesome to watch and see.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound was outstanding. Only reason its not a 10 its bcuz the soundtrack could have been better inside the anime, still though the action scenes pumped me up.. The OP and ED were addicting and unskippable.**\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were never forgetful. Every single one had the personalities and had their own special moves that fitted their personality. Favorite ones have to be Kozomi, Sayaka with her white hair self, Mio with her pervy self(really hilarious), and then Maya. Maya really surprised me and became a favorite of mine. Her development at the end of the series really was great and i have to commend the devs and im looking forward to her in s2.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment was a 10. I couldnt stop watching and was addicted. Every episode was amazing. There was never a dull moment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series combined ecchi and hyping fking characters in sports up really well. My first shounen sport series, and will continue to keep watching this genre. Not only was it a joy watching their gracious bodies, but IT ACTUALLY HAD PLOT! Loved everything about it.\\n\\n",

And that's honestly the only thing that really matters, is how enjoyable it is.\r\nA anime can have the worse story in the world with meh characters, and that doesn't matter if it ends up being enjoyable.\r\nThe thing that made Keijo work for me is that while the concept of girls fighting only with their boobs and asses is absurd, it never felt to me that it had to rely on fan service.\r\nKeijo does have a story that is pretty simple to follow. The main character wantsto enter the professional world of Keijo and be the Prize Queen. As you watch it you see her go in the training academy for Keijo and learn about the sport which they actually have rules for.\\n\\n\r\nAs you keep watching you can see that there is something to Keijo that is developed to the intricates of the fighting style that really isn't related to fan service at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe techniques the girls use range from just parodies of other animes/culture to their own style that can make some sense if you are willing to acknowledge what it is and not disregard it cause \"boobs and ass\" fighting.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I did have with the show is that I honestly could not remember the characters names at all, probably because they are too Japanese? Maybe done on purpose but who knows.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Keijo is honestly worth watching. 12 episodes only won't take your whole day and you may find it funny and enjoyable.\\n",

            "content": "Full Review on: tarp.webs.com\r\nFirst Post. First Review. Let's do this.\r\nStory\r\nThere is no story.\r\nThe End.\r\nI spent a good 6 episodes of Keijo searching for something that wasnt there. A plot.\r\nKeijo has no plot. Its basically about Kaminashi Nozomi, who wants to be the Pirate Ki....I mean, Prize Queen, which is apparently the title for a very good Keijo player, and she has no mentioned incentives for wanting this whatsoever, besides a mild mentioning in the first episode that it might be for the money.\r\nSo what is Keijo? Keijo is a female-only sport  that requires player to knock each other off from a platform floating ona pool using only their breasts and butts. Only in Japan, right?\\n\\n\r\nKeijo should be watched as an unspoken parody. Did the studio mean to do this? Idk. But its best if you do.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was nice during the fight scenes. I liked how the censorship was in the form of DBZ like light energy. But during the conversation moments, there were a few places where it could have been done better. Good for the most part, but still choppy in some places.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs were likeable for the most part. But 99% of the characters had no character development . They were mostly very 2 dimensional characters, and not easy to relate to, defined only by some quirks they had.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, among this there was one character  that received some special attention and stood out among the rest to become my favourite character of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSayaka-chan best girl. Nuff Said #NoLoli\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nExecution\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show was good. No races lasted for more than half an episode. The humour was a bit hit or miss. There was little forced humour and it was genuine. Its hard to make me laugh and the most it got outta me was a nose exhale, but i can see how it would be funny to a lot of people. If you still think its not funny, see how serious they're taking themselves and you'll be rolling on the floor in no time. I guarantee it.\\n\\n\r\nAll the jokes were crude, but funny nonetheless. The person who named the moves should be given an award. Goddamit.\\n\\n\r\nButtack on Titan? Gate of Bootylon? Shoryucans was my favourite. xD\\n\\n\r\nThere was no end the strange-ass techniques used by everyone.(No pun intended)\\n\\n\r\nExecution: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of me shitting on this anime throughout this article, I actually enjoyed it. Depends on you though.\\n\\n\r\nDo you like well-endowed girls(for the most part *wink*) ramming at each other providing fan-service each step of the way?\\n\\n\r\nThen, BOY, is this the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nIt could have been something better. But it wasn't. No, its not a masterpiece that will make you re-evauate your life (not even close bitch) but I believe its still worth a watch. I've seen shiitier and it was probably one of the best shows of its season anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all, shows like this are the saviours of anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This is not like most typical anime action/comedy/ecchi series were it falls to the category as unnecessary fan service.\r\nIt when the creator are not confident about themselves or just there cause \"Funny I guess\", but if you take this show as it is, then you would surely enjoyKeijo like me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot- 8/10 (Compelling and Pretty Ridiculous) Keijo plot and drama wasn't too special, just your normal plot out there. Making a sport where girls try to throw each other off a floating platform by only using their butts and boobs must be a genius.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art- 9/10 (Created in the name of fan service) This show have really great animation & All-out TNA Jojo Bizarre action sequence. \\n\r\nI was mind blown, and I like the characters design and the sport itself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters/Development- 8/10 (Every characters have pro and cons) \\n\r\nI was worry this was an anime whose plot and characters would fall flat because of too much focus on fan service, but not really, these characters have a justify, traits, and have athletes dreams & skills.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound- 7/10 (There no memorable songs, but great voice acting) \\n\r\nI never listen to the dub version, I prefer jap with sub instead (I watch both version). The opening music is really cool, silly, and edgy but I like it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10 (My eyes shaped hearts and excitement gets me off guard) Keijo is really entertainment, funny, and over the top ridiculous. \\n\r\nI never been smiling for excitement or laughing so hard since \"Prison School\", but my head is spinning.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9/10 (It the best fan-service anime, but not prefect) \\n\r\nBest concept, Best MC, Best storyline (good), I didn't expect to be this super surprise or laughably breath taking for air. This anime is just as promising and hoping for another season and I hope it never end. \\n",

            "content": "This anime was a surprise, a good one. \r\nAfter I read the synopsis and saw some footage I thought to myself: \"Another series with High School DxD / Infinite Startos type of ecchi is being aired... BORING!!...\" and boy was I wrong.  I think the only reason Keijo was listed as ecchi is because girls fight with their \"natural weapons\" (boobs and booty), they don't even show nipples, not to mention almost sex scenes (you know what I mean), this reason raised my overall rating  of the anime.\r\nNow, the story was a pretty average one, a cliche, that's why I rated it with(6). An average girl want's to become a pro keijo player and \"surprisingly\" has talent. With the power of firendship she is able to make everybody her allies. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and the sound are both rated with (8). Here I can't say very much, they both complement each other pretty well. In the \"art\" department there are some flaws, for exapmle swiming suit which repairs itself from one scene to another. Other than that, I'm pretty satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nThe charcater design is rated with (9). Every character is well rounded, with one exception, Nozomi (she seems to be able to overcome everithing with the power of will, but she is not as overpowered as.. mhm Natsu or Naruto). As I stated above, the story is pretty cliche so I will let this one slide.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, my personal enjoyment (10). I have to admit I had lots of fun watching \"Keijo\", and I enjoyed it to its fullest. A laid-back, funny anime which presents a new sport playable only by girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall rating I give to \"Keijo!!!!!!!!\" is (8) which marks this as a good anime, and I recommend watching this if you want to see a laid-back, with no emotional implication series.\\n",

            "content": "Keijo is an anime that doesn\u2019t take itself seriously, and neither should you while watching it.\r\nGoing into Keijo, I was aware of the bizarre premise I was getting myself into. An anime about a water sport involving the usage of your butt? Unheard of. Me watching this kind of series? Also unheard of.\r\nSo, while watching this anime, I made sure to shut off my brain and try to allow myself to find enjoyment in this show. Surprisingly, I left the series with some kind of fulfillment. Or maybe a loss?\r\nStory\r\nThe story of Keijo has almost the same vibe as any typical sports anime - andwith this vibe it does not stop us from wanting to cheer on the main character: Nozomi Kaminashi, an aspiring Keijo player who is obviously going to be a skillful Keijo player (because who would want to watch a sports anime with a regularly skilled athlete?). The storyline of the series is very predicable, which makes it feel extremely dry and like you could probably just read an episode summary and be totally fine. Although the plot isn't very interesting, the normality of the crude sport is what makes it hilarious. You don't watch Keijo for a promising and deep story line, you watch it for the \"plot.\" (wink wink)\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nKeijo is an art in itself. Being an ecchi series, it's evident that you're going to boobs and ass an exceeding amount. However, to the degree the studio took it is hilariously entertaining. There were some moments were I couldn't stop laughing at how weird things were getting. Although containing a bland storyline that can just be googled, one chooses not to because experiencing the crazy art style and comedic boob/ass related Keijo techniques is the fun of the series. Without the art, Keijo would just be \"that weird anime,\" not \"that weird anime that was surprisingly enjoyable yet arousing.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment\\n\r\nThis show was a very enjoyable show. The story wasn't interesting, nor were the characters or sound design, but the atmosphere and lack of seriousness the show has is what makes it watchable.\\n\r\nShould you watch Keijo? Short answer: Yes. Long answer: Yes, but watch it sped up 2x so you don't feel like you're spending 5 hours watching a sports anime about anime girls bumping asses and tits.",

            "content": "(Some spoilers, but eh, it is Keijo!!!!!!!!) I'm not what most of the reviewers seem to think the target audience is for this show; as a straight woman. HOWEVER, This is one of the most entertaining anime's I've seen this year. It is just so ridiculous and self-aware that I can't help but be entertained. \r\nThe Keijo matches are very reminiscent of a big DBZ fight and are filled with every shonen trope under the sun, with Fate/stay and hunter x hunter references among others. Think of two glowing butts colliding and seeing which wins out, among some transformation sequences and other neat tricks (wedgiesmake you go faster!) The fact that they're using their breasts and butts to do so just adds to the hilarity. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not really sure what to say about the accusations of no character development? I've seen plenty. I guess if you've only seen a few episode it might seem like the case, but they have to portray their characters first before the development can get started. Some **spoiler** examples: Nozomi finds a motivation for Keijo besides money, Sayaka learns the value of her friendship with Nozomi and copes with the judgment of her father for abandoning Judo, and Kazane overcomes her shyness,\\n\\n\r\nWhile the anime absolutely spends some time catering to the male gaze, the lack of any major male characters in the show really makes it easier for me to appreciate. They aren't all outshined by the generic male main character or trying to win over his approval/affection, which is refreshing in its own way. And I really appreciated that a show in which will attract a predominately straight male audience by its premise alone made its viewers watch two guys kiss (they know what they're doing).\\n\\n\r\nI encourage those who are unsure about watching Keijo to simply approach it with a sense of humor and an eye for references. Put is simply, Keijo!!!!!!!! is The Colbert Report of anime.",

            "content": "The idea in Keijo!!!!!!!! I think is the perfect fit for an anime format where no idea is too crazy, on top of that despite the sport being fictitious, I felt that the world created around the idea was well-fleshed out(tehehe flesh). Of course there were a lot of fan-service in the anime. On a show where girls in their swimsuits who used their butts and boobs to win a match, only a fool would think otherwise, and yet despite a myriad of these fan-services I think that what is in the center; a story about a group of girls who are busting their buttsout(tehehe) trying to overcome their shortcomings and believing and following their dreams of becoming a professional athlete, is a breath of fresh air from the usually male-dominated genre. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot move along very nicely. Usually in animes where the battles are very intensive, the other part of the plot would feel tedious or get boring really fast, but when I was watching this show I didn't feel it at all.\\n\\n\r\nNow about the sound, there's not much to be said, the background music fit nicely with the scene being portrayed and at some parts I think they were using like a live orchestra type music which reminded me of Family Guy. Why did I give it a 10? Because the sound effects for the skills were hilarious! Seriously, it cracks me up to see a butt makes a sound similar to a firearm.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it's pretty much the same quality as other new anime out there, I didn't find any problem with it at all.\\n\\n\r\nNow, why I think this anime is a masterpiece (mASSterpiece, tehehehe) because it managed to combine several aspects which I like from other anime so harmoniously. That is from the sport genre and the fighting genre. You get that competitive vibe you would get from a sport genre anime from it and also that fighting vibe from the skills that the characters develop and how the arena where the characters fight kind of change, opening new types of strategy, unlike other sport anime where the arena is usually the same. Plus usually when it's a sport anime, the setting would probably be in an academic school so the sport would be like an extra activity in the lives of the characters, but in Keijo the sport itself is the main choice for the character instead of an additional option so it made a lot of sense why they are trying so hard.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I kind of feel that the development feel somewhat lacking, they were pretty much archetypal but in a good sense. But I seriously think that the main character could do with some more elaboration because I feel that the supporting characters have more background than the main character and the focus kind of shifted on them instead.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I enjoy Keijo thoroughly, it's an easy watch and you don't get too hung up on the characters too much, the story is light and you could just relax and let go when watching this anime, also the references in the show were pretty funny.",

            "content": "Story- the story of keijo is to be considered pretty much as \"dumb fun\". there is not much to go about it other than that it's a sports anime, but with the added use of having it be women butt battling in a floating arena. they do attend a school that's main focus is to teach these girls in order to prepare themselves for the world of keijo, but it has less focus on studies and more focus on sports practice. however what really makes the show is the plain absurdity of the entire plot. just look at the fact of what i have justsaid; that some sport so ridiculous will become a lucrative sport enough that they have schools dedicated to it, it's just so ridiculous. of course with the sport there is swimsuits and with swimsuits there is fanservice, but it's never in your face about it because it's always there and never feels like it's trying to be sexual.  on top of all that is the insane powers and abilities  that each player brings to the table. not only are they hotting each other with their butts and breast, but they they are firing air cannons and smacking each other at the speed of sound, they are teleportation and hypnotizing each other all through the power of their butts and breast. this show obviously isn't one to be taken seriously, but the character do which only makes the story even more admirable to the show.  however in the long run the show is just about girls going through practices with a tournament at the end and that's pretty much it. 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\ncharacters-  the main character is Nozomi, with here main support characters and room mates being Sayaka, Kazane, and Non. there are also more side characters in the show from her schoolmates, mentors, and students from other schools. all characters in the show have very minimal amount a depth into them, but each character is given the right amount of screen time they deserve. you get enough time to know them before they overstay there welcome. there is some decent development from the main four characters such as Kazane going from a shy girl all they way to being able to give commands during the fight. all the characters interact will with each other and work and grow as a team.  6/10\\n\\n\r\nanimation- the art and animation aren't anything great but are able to do the job well. this isn't some amazing animation spectacle but more of what you can find from a current shounen anime and it works well because this is a shounen. the character design look decent, all of the characters look cute for the most part,  and they all have a unique or mundane look depending on their character and that's just swell. the background is decent enough from the classroom, to training grounds, and the tournament arena with a little nitpick on the out of place CGI models.\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\r\nsound- the voice acting is done very well, nothing to complain about from there. no character voice felt odd and it brought the right personality to the characters. the soundtrack i something to be left desired as it is mostly forgettable, but not bad for me to hate it\\n\r\n6/10\\n\r\nenjoyment- this anime was one hell of a show. it was so ridiculous and absurd that it is. i can find anything to hate about the show, but of course i have little to give great praises about as well. 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\noverall- everthing from story, characters, animation, and sound are above average, and was a decent joy to watch\\n\r\n6.5/10\ufeff",

I like such easy and fun story and it feels so consistent and well written.\r\nI realy got no complains and that is rare for me. Well, maybe art could be better but i realy don't even want to complain about it because it is fun to watch as it is.\r\nSo yah, this anime is not only fun to watch for people that dosnt likedramas and just want want to enjoy a fun show that will energise you but it has also something epic about it, like it feels like this anime will become a shinning example for other animes that show us that animes about sport can be fun too.\\n\\n\r\nAs for me, it is the first anime that is surely about sport, that i enjoyed.",

We got our MC Nozomi Kaminashi who want to reach her dream, get money becoming famous. There were some backround Story on some Characters, but not on all.\r\nSo i gave them a solid 6 because, on the one hand it was a normal motivation, you have the plot-twist with Sayaka Miyata and her Father and some other nice things. The Characters were neither flat or deep.\r\nThe Story was continues and the Characters developed....and weretalking about battleling in a Swimsuit here^^\\n\\n\r\nSound 7 Enjoyment 10\\n\r\nWhat i really liked about this Anime were its Sound and enjoyment. These references and jokes were hilarious. It was worth watching just for the ASSTACK on Titan ^^ The opening is catchy and i liked it okay. The music during the fight Scenes where ok. There fitting but, nothing super epic here.\\n\r\nComing back to the enjoyment part, this is a thing about Humor. THERE ARE SOME CRINGY scenes but overall it was hilarious as fck. I loved the homage about sports animes, with the Special moves and all that stuff, wich brings me to the next point:\\n\\n\r\nART 8\\n\r\nTHe fights where pretty cool. The mamaged to draw it, that it doesnt look tooooo unrealistic (despite the Fact where fighting with our Breasts and Butts...) The colors where bright, the quality good and the food was good too. Nothing to complain about here.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, of course its a Fan-Service Show, but thats what i like about it. There is a Story. The Fan-Service, is part of this Story. Not like some other Animes, with random Pantie shots etc.... Keijo is played on the \"land\" around Water. The Story is more likely based on the fact they all nearly wear nothing ^^ And still it manages to find a balance, between the WTF moments and the Humourous, Funny lovely Moments. So YEa overall it was a good show. 7 Points here.",

            "content": "Never before have I watched an anime that has made me this physically angry and frustrated. Sure, I\u2019ve watched anime that has bored me to tears (Ergo Proxy) or I just didn\u2019t like (SAO) but never before had I watched an anime that made me physically angry and just frustrated at how low some shows would go for a quick cash grab. I mean I\u2019ve watched fan service anime before for example High School DxD and Prison school. Sure DXD was pretty bad but it had a pretty good story and the characters were fleshed out. Prison school had a great story, great characters, wasextremely funny, and even though the fan service was ridiculous and repulsive at times (think of a high school anime directed by Sacha Baron Cohen) it wrapped things up nicely in the end and I was pulling for the main characters the entire story. Here there is none of that.\\n\\n\r\nHere the story is absolute trite. Some slut with a ridiculous accent named Nozomi Kaminashi wants to be the best Keijo player in the world. No background is given on said girl or motivation that\u2019s the story. In this terrible anime there are no deep thought provoking questions that one might ask oneself such as \u201cwhat is the meaning of my existence?\u201d \u201cWhat is the pursuit of one\u2019s dream?\u201d \u201cIs man formed by nature or nurture?\u201d You have none of that just fan service disguised as comedy. You have moves called ass guillotine and vacuum butt cannon. I mean yeah it was funny the first two times all the butt and tit jokes but after 100 times it just becomes annoying. There is a freaking school that actually teaches this absurd sport (in the show). Why hasn\u2019t anybody in the anime actually questioned why such a dumb sport exists and why people are watching it? Also I wouldn\u2019t hate this anime is the story wasn\u2019t actually taken seriously. Everybody here takes this sport seriously I mean they have an academy for it. If someone would question the ridiculousness of this crap in the show I would actually have somewhat minor enjoyment of the anime possibly.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound are good I\u2019ll say. Animation is fluid during fight scenes and jiggle physics are good (can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying that). The girls are pretty to look at; they all have different physiques and powers.\\n\r\nCharacters well they are just terrible. They\u2019re good looking but none of them are fleshed out and none of their motivations are explained in anyway. The secondary character Sayaka Miyata was a once great judo fighter who decided to switch to Keijo. Her dad is disappointed by this switch and he\u2019s seen as the bad guy what the fuck? Another character Mio Kusaki who\u2019s really hot has a ridiculous fighting technique called titty hypnosis and no I\u2019m not kidding sadly. I saw a YouTube clip where they\u2019re having a Keijo match and this girl is getting attacked by tentacles what the serious fuck that makes no sense at all? It wasn\u2019t some fan made parody or hentai it was actually in the show. It just came out of nowhere.  Also they have the nerve and audacity to make fun of real science like astronomy and call it asstronomy you get it? Also boobology is mentioned as well. The teacher in the academy was giving a lecture about such asinine subjects. How dare they insult a science that has brought us countless revelations and defecate on the work of greats like Aristotle, Einstein, Copernicus, and Galileo. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is one of the worst anime I have ever seen. It\u2019s stupid, it\u2019s vapid, it\u2019s ridiculous, not funny at all, and the story goes nowhere. It is filled with stupid shounen clich\u00e9s that have no originality and so much fan service that it will give you a headache. I would not recommend this to anybody at all maybe horny teenage boys. This was terrible and this show is one of the reasons that people cringe when you tell them you watch anime. Forget great shows like Bebop, Berserk, Monster, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Death Note this is what older people think when you tell them you watch anime. It displays every negative stereotype about it with absolutely no substance or character driven focus at all. I find it abhorrent that such material exists. Shows like this set the standards of anime back decades showing that almost anybody can make an anime. This show also sets back women\u2019s fight for equality by decades displaying women as nothing but brainless sex objects for entertainment. I hope studio Xebec burns to the ground for this. After seeing their catalog it seems to me they have made nothing noteworthy or even good. The only okay show they have made was Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne which was still trashy as fuck in content (lesbianism, torture, meaningless religious symbolism). Everything else they made is terrible and repugnant on every level; worst animation studio in history. This anime was terrible and I hope the creators are ashamed of themselves for making this.\\n",

            "content": "This show honestly defied all expectations I had of it, which is to say I absolutely expected nothing out of it from the start.  I am not a fan of fan service in anime since most times I want to enjoy a series for its story instead of its tits and ass.  When I first heard of Keijo i think my jaw almost dislocated with how fast it dropped.  A show where well endowed girls battle each other in skimpy bathing suits with their butts and breasts?  It might have been the most ultimate level of fan service I've seen inan anime that wasn't a hentai.  My curiosity got the better of me and I'm honestly glad it did because I had so much fun watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nLet me start off by saying that not everyone will like Keijo for what it is and that is completely understandable.  Many will look at the trailer or read a summary, say \"this shit is stupid\" and then move on.  However, I believe that Keijo's overwhelmingly ridiculous concept is what makes it so enjoyable to watch.  It doesn't try to be a super serious show with a super serious plot it just simply wants to make you laugh and by god does it achieve that with flying colors.  The story and characters are good enough for you to pay attention to them but simple enough that you don't get too invested which is exactly what a show like this needs.  If a show about girls fighting with their tits and ass tried to make you care about the story and characters more than you know you should then you'd honestly end up caring about the whole thing even less.\\n\\n\r\nThe main story behind Keijo is that its a professional sport (like basketball or football) where a group of girls with large breasts and butts, stand on a shaky platform in the middle of a large pool and battle each other to be the last one standing.  Players can only attack others with their butts and breasts and will lose if they either fall into the water or fall onto the platform.  The main character is Nozomi Kaminashi, a very energetic 18 year old girl who wants to be the best Keijo player and thats it.  She has no sad backstory or any other complex reason, she plays Keijo because she likes it.  For a show like this that's honestly all we need from the main character because, lets be honest, we're not really here to know all that much about her.  Each character has their own personality, which helps you identify them, but they aren't too complex.  A few characters have backstories but they aren't too deep that it would complicate the story.  The fact that the characters are identifiable yet simple makes us not care too much nor too little about them.  It has us know who they are while still mainly focusing on the main part which is the ridiculousness of the sport itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe funny thing about Keijo is that even though most of the techniques used in the sport will have you rolling on the floor in a fit of laughter, its not that bad of a battle shonen.  Seeing as the characters can only attack with their breasts and butts, I wasn't sure how engaging the fight scenes would be but I was shocked to find out that it was actually pretty good.  The animation is pretty great (probably better than a show like this deserves) and some of the techniques in the show, although heart stoppingly hilarious, are animated extremely well.  You also do want to see the main character succeed and its shown in the very beginning of the show that even though she is good at the sport she is nowhere near the best and still has a lot to learn.\\n\\n\r\nOf course people who love anime fan service will love the hell out of this show but if you're someone who loves to laugh at ridiculous things or someone who likes to watch \"so bad that its good\" movies because of the bizarre choices that the movie makes then I think you'll get a real kick out of Keijo.",

            "content": "I Just completed \"KEIJO!!!!\" and man japan keeps impressing me everytime. I didnt knew much about this anime when It was released or even when it was announced. And I only felt the curiosity and urge to watch this because I saw a youtuber that mentioned this a couple of times and bet to another youtuber to watch it if he lost it. I thought it was funny and decided to give it a shot. I can describe this in 2 ways: \r\n1- \"TITS AND ASS!\" \r\n2- \"BUTS AND BOOBS Z\" \r\nBecause the fights and action part of it its cool like \"Dragon Ball Z\".Of course the animation is well done cause 2016 its hilarious 2 just the concept that you only see asses colliding most of the time with a little boob action there and there. So if your Straight and a bonafide ASS-MAN like myself than you should give KEIJO!!!! a shot its good to pass the time. I advise anyone who read this to add this anime into there plan to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: if your a BOOBS-MAN you still got some of the good stuff even though not as much as a ASS-MAN gets but theres a good amout of it there.",

            "content": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\r\nFirst impression, I never thought it would be possible that there was a show that I actually was looking forward to 100%.\r\nAnd it actually gave me exactly what I wanted.\r\nStory,6/10\r\nOver 100 years ago,\r\na sport was played With skill and honer, so many have played \r\nOnly the mightiest of Warriors have played this sport.\r\nThey risked there very lives and dreams in order to be the best,\r\nThe fallen would be Crushed and forgotten,\r\nBut the winners would have there names and deeds sung though the very halls of VALHALLA itself.\r\nBut where not talking about that sport,\r\nWe are talking about a sport that isway more important.\\n\r\nThe sport named kejio  where girls fight in a pool only using them tites and ass as weapons of battle.\\n\r\nBasically a mix between dead or alive extreme and water polo.\\n\\n\r\nJoin Nozomi Kaminashi a very talented gymnast who plans to fight her way to the top in order to get her family out of poverty,\\n\r\nWhile making  new friends and meeting new rivals on her path to becoming a kejio master.\\n\\n\r\nSo as a lot of you can guess this is probably one of the most ridiculous premises  for a story  I have ever heard of to date,\\n\r\nAnd despite  all that it actually decent for a story which I have to turn off my Brain  for in order to watch it,\\n\r\nNow I am also not saying that's its savor of anime or  it's the cancer of anime like a lot of people are saying it is, \\n\r\nAlthough I feel that those take those stances are kind of loosening the point of it.\\n\r\nBut if I am being completely  honest the only thing this saved me from was my complete boredom because watching this anime season was draining.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut the story for all intents and purposes kejio is of its self is just one giant  meme a joke.\\n\r\nWhich doesn't require much thought than the usual,  \\n\r\noh look there dong something over the top with boobs and ass again.\\n\r\nAnd there some sort of plot that keeps it going.\\n\\n\r\nNow One can  argue that it exploiting  woman and all that other p.c culture crap.\\n\r\nOf course I feel that a very little nit pick.\\n\r\nBut I would like add a  counter point,\\n\r\nThat sex sells and that not going to change anytime soon,\\n\r\nUnless all the sex drives just disappear all out of no where.\\n\\n\r\nPlus I would like to add that this show isn't always about fan service.\\n\r\nit also about following your dreams and ambitions,\\n\r\nWhile having fun on the way,\\n\r\nAnd honestly that makes it more interesting and actually relatable.\\n\\n\r\nAll though I was more  watching it for the pure abserdy of it all.\\n\r\nI mean how can I not treat it was such.\\n\r\nIt's a story based around a spot with girls slamming there asses into each over. \\n\\n\r\nNow I have been mostly positive.\\n\\n\r\nIt's time for the negatives.\\n\r\nNow even I do find it extremely funny,\\n\r\nI feel at times that it looses stream at times and the joke starts to become less funny as it goes along.\\n\\n\r\nI would also like to add    that the pacing is quite off  at times,\\n\r\nLike there some parts like In the first few episodes which kind of went a bit to fast and there where other time where the pacing slows down because there trying to make up for a fast pace,\\n\r\nIt really find it hard to keep  to a steady pace.\\n\r\nI also think that could toned down on the talking and info dumps,\\n\r\nthe first episode we where explained the basics and how the game was played,\\n\r\nBut than  later on in the same episode they repeat the exact same thing.\\n\r\nWhich is bother some when I came here to see crazy over the top bull shit.\\n\\n\r\nThat other that that there really nothing much else to say.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe main character  Nozomi.\\n\r\nI would probably say she a very fun led to follow.\\n\r\nWith her very I wouldn't say interesting,\\n\r\nBut very energetic personally  that kind of grows on you over time.\\n\r\nAnd also very determined to follow her dreams which  makes her quite relatable to any one who trying to follow your dreams. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters.\\n\r\nAre very fun and kinda over the top.\\n\r\nAnd actually have some sort of personality.\\n\r\nWhich is always a plus.\\n\r\nThere not the most interesting cast,\\n\r\nBut are very fun to follow  and that's how they should be. \\n\\n\r\nBut there really much else to them than that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt,7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation looks very polished and dynamic.\\n\r\nIt also has very nice flash to it.\\n\\n\r\nIt had some really great boob and ass shots.\\n\\n\r\nIt has a very over the top style \\n\r\nWhich adds to the fight scenes to any run of the mail activity.\\n\r\nWhich it makes over the top.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters design are quite nice,\\n\\n\r\nSound, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe op and ending I actually quite like which actually shocking because I general very fussy when it comes to sougs I like.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the kick ass  op and nice ending the rest of the ost is pretty forgettable.\\n\r\nThe ost was done by matsuo hayato who has done the ost for drifters and cyborg 009.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub and sub are both fine.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment,6/10\\n\\n\r\nI feel what really made me enjoy this anime.\\n\r\nWas the fact that is show is so unapologetic about how sexual and over the top is about every thing,\\n\r\nThis show doesn't give a fuck and I found that aspect of it very endearing.\\n\r\nAnd also the fact that is show feels like it was made to have fun.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nIf your looking for something insane   and over the top then kejio is definitely what your looking for.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a SJW or someone that doesn't understand that this is just for fun.\\n\r\nOr don't like fan service  or any of the elk then probably don't watch this \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Had a clear personality as someone who just loves the sport as well as having her own unique way of talking made her stood out more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nRecommend to people who enjoy other Ecchi anime and people who like Sports but don't mind ecchi or fan service type moments.\\n\\n\r\nNot recommended for people who dislike sports or ecchi anime and not recommended for people trying to get into those genres as a first time type of anime.\\n\\n\r\nIts an anime that kinda knows it is going over-the-top in most regards and enjoys itself doing so. Although not the saviour of anime as some people would say (for Fall season 2016), its certainly not one that should be hidden away and put out of its misery with a bullet. \\n",

If you can not appreciate Butts of Babylon you can't watch this. \r\nStory: 10\r\nA bunch of colorful young women go to butt fight college, where they meet the future generation of Butt Fighters and battle to be the number one hot chick in all of Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball 3. \r\nArt: 10\r\nXebec knows what to do with ladies.

This is butt battle only the necessary, PLEASE!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nWhile it has a lot of fun songs and sounds they neglected one thing. The sound of booty clapping. Shame.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThis is the most diverse cast of country butt tacticians. From the main character to the rival school cast. Each with a different way of that one mode in those DOA games fighting. My personal favorite, Mio Kusakai with the power of perverse hypnotism using all of her assets.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nIf you could turn your brain off and stop whining about whether The End of Eva was good or not you will definitely enjoy Keijo. I found myself jumping with joy and disbelief at every genuinely hype moment. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.8/10 or 10/10\\n\r\nThis is anime of the year.",

            "content": "Keijo is a fan service/ sports comedy anime focused on the titular competitive sport where the female players go against one another on a floating platform called a Land where they use either their breasts or butts to try either knocking their opponents off the Land or have them fall to the ground. The series mainly focuses on a skilled gymnast named Nozomi Kaminashi who wishes to enter the sport to become wealthy enough to get her family out of poverty and is trained in the ins and outs of the sport before she can go pro.\r\nAs you might surmise from the anime\u2019s premise, Keijo\u2019sgimmick is mostly an excuse to show off as many fan service shots as it can get out of its female cast and the series is certainly rife with enough of it. Close camera shots of boobs and butts, girls undressing, bathing scenes, skimpy bathing suits, and suggestive predicaments are pretty much the norm throughout Keijo\u2019s 12-episode run. If there\u2019s a plus to this though, Keijo is actually pretty tasteful for the most part with showing off its fan service as its female cast are drawn well enough to be pleasant on the eyes, having a variety of body types, and the series doesn\u2019t resort to gross-out humor for its naughty moments.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose if there\u2019s a positive to Keijo, it would be that the series knows how ridiculous its premise is and relishes in it. The Keijo matches are rather creative in showing some rather ridiculous attacks that the characters make use of with their butts and boobs against opponents. It milks sports anime tropes to show how overly enthusiastic some of the characters like Nozomi can be in their devotion to training and improving within the sport, including showing off the mentioned ridiculous attacks with their butts and boobs.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately though in regards to depth, Keijo doesn\u2019t have much beneath the surface. As mentioned, it is still milking sports anime tropes and its premise is still an excuse to milk fan service from its female cast. The female cast mostly follow anime character types you would find in one form or another, as any backstory on them is mostly window dressing in a superficial attempt to give them motive for their participation in Keijo.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I\u2019ll give some kudos to Keijo for knowing not to take its premise too seriously and relishing in it, it is still a fan service title that doesn\u2019t have much going for it in terms of depth beyond over-the-top sports action with boob and butt attacks coming from its mostly attractive female cast. Fan service anime fans are likely to give this a watch. But if you\u2019re looking for any deeper depth to your anime, then I\u2019d avoid watching Keijo.",

            "content": "It\u2019s hard to give a reasonable score to something that achieves a goal of being extremely entertaining but under examination is incredibly stupid. Does one judge it as a completely entertainment-focused installment with the trade off of not thinking critically about the material? Does one go the exact opposite route, sticking to pure, cold, subjective criticism at the risk of completely overthinking the subject and losing the intended meaning. Either way, Keijo!!!!!! Is certainly unique in its subject matter, if not in its themes.\r\n\tAnimation for a show focused solely around boobs and butts generally isn\u2019t stellar,but Keijo defies that notion with a feel much morefocused on the guise of being a sports show. Plenty of scenes use colorful, flowing animation to show increases or levels of ability, more in line with an action series that one focused on ecchi pool battles. The effort put in to make signature moves unique and distinct between characters helped to emphasize there differences on a very obvious level that supported the overall progression of the show. As a sports series, the theme of growth and improvement actually went hand in hand with the increasingly intense coloring and animation techniques, giving a physical representation of the progress the main cast made.\\n\\n\r\n\tLike the animation, the sound design for Keijo felt pulled out of shonen battle series rather than a sports show. The whole series is filled with upbeat and intense themes to accent the many competitions that make up the bulk of the series events. There are a few notably normal background songs used for traveling and city exploration, but otherwise Keijo had a very particular soundtrack that kept ramping up as the stakes of the show increased. \\n\\n\r\n\tCharacter development and defining features was a large but welcome surprise. Each character is differentiated first in look and then in style of movement and mannerisms. It would have been easy to have each embody a single trait or simple personality, but the cast runs the entire spectrum of humble to arrogant, energetic to reserved, and capable to beginner in a fashion that allows for each one to have growth while also managing to hold their own unique style during Keijo competitions. Priorities for who gets the most development and screen time felt mixed based on those considered to be main or supporting characters, but more time for developing side characters ending up working out well in this case. A great degree of emphasis was placed on individual improvement, whether on or off camera, and it was refreshing to see victory come from hard work and dedication.\\n\\n\r\n\tAnd the great sticking point of the show comes from the plot. Yes, the characters are well rounded and learn new skills to improve themselves. Yes there are a great variety of situations overcome with improvisation and individual assessment in a very believable session. There is even time alloted to the competitors to the main cast to make them sympathetic and present competitions as a fair competition of will and skill rather than a battle of good and bad. There is just one factor that drags down the rest of the otherwise well-executed story\\n\\n\r\nKeijo is, without reservation, completely, mind boggling, cringingly stupid from the outset. It's a beautiful thing to see the straight faced attempt to make the sport seem like a serious event when its little more than an excuse to have fanservice in every episode. The special moves characters use also have a slow power creep from merely being names for moves to full on super powers and occasionally making things into a \u201cwho can scream the loudest competition\u201d as characters smash their butts together. The effect is amazingly entertaining, but almost too dumb to bear. Keijo is a special case of something so bad it\u2019s good, and is certainly worth a watch for the sheer entertainment value and as a lover of spectacle.\\n",

First half was development, second was just pure action.\r\nArt\r\nThe art is nice, as all characters are easy to look at. As a total though there was not much significance in the art, but the very pretty girls to look at. The water was pretty stunning though.\r\nSound\r\nAll I can think of is, what was the sound for the butt's slapping as well as the boobs? On a more seriousnote though there is not much significance to the sound; except for the uses within fights.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nAll characters had there defining trait and they were ok in terms of quality. None were outstanding details, which made me not fall in love or connect to a feeling of any of them. There special moves were defining something extremely funny though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nKeijo is a bad show, but don't we all just love trash anime. This anime is so bad though the concept of it is so absolutely hilarious I couldn't stop watching til' the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThis show is not for everyone, but if you like anime butts and boobs go for it. If you are trying to sit down and enjoy a good laugh and don't mind the previous comment then it is an enjoyable watch. By no means is this show critically acclaimed, but it is definitely hilarious and as a concept deserves praise for doing something so ridiculous.\\n",
