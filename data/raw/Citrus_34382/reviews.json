            "content": "Citrus is another one of those school shows that go out in mass every season, is the adaptation of a relatively recent manga that is being posted until today, do not expect the anime to have a closed end or even a second season, the anime has nothing beyond being a HOMOSEXUAL ROMANCE, and this is also becoming something more common in fiction. If the show is so normal and mundane, why should I care?\r\nThe answer is simple, you should not.\r\nThis anime has a story that feels forced on several times and that no one would see for itself, what people really want here isthe yuri sexualization, the Fanservice scenes and the cheap drama, \"What's the matter with that?\" You must be wondering, and quite simply, works of fiction should NOT be categorized as better or worse depending on the general taste, this does not work, and that is also why the qualification system of that site also does not work to measure the quality of a series .\\n\\n\r\nArt in general was made to serve as a luxury, a differential, since ancient times they made magnificent sculptures and paintings and full of detail that only served to be placed in a corner to adorn a palace, was extremely difficult to enter the world of arts and have a recognized name. You know why? It is because people of the time not only had passion for what they did but also struggled to do a job that they could be proud to show to people.\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you like this show, I want you to answer the following question:\\n\\n\r\nWould you show this show to any of your relatives?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer is no, and you do not have to feel guilty about it, not even the staff or maybe the creator of the manga would have the courage to show it to the family, that's because they're not writing to people, they're writing it for them , they like to watch cute little girls kissing, and consequently, the mentality of the people who attend these shows is the same, no matter if the show needs effort or little effort to be done, what matters are the things that attract the viewer to see it, what people want is not what people need.\\n\\n\r\nIf the anime script was good by itself, I would not have much of a problem with FanService or crap like that, but that's not the case, this is an anime that is built around these moments and not an anime that has those moments, and this is not hard to notice if you pay attention to the show. Why did the mother forget such an important detail as telling the protagonist that she would have a sister? Why of all the possible people in school did her sister have to be just what she saw kissing the teacher? Why did the black-haired girl not stay at her grandfather's house instead of going to the protagonist's house? Why did the black-haired girl not ask the protagonist to deliver the cell phone to her instead of taking her strength from her pocket? How did the director not know about your new granddaughter? Was not he curious to see her or at least ask for a photo?\\n\\n\r\nThese are doubts that went through my mind during the anime, the answer to them is very simple, it is because the anime needs the hottest moments to get people's attention easily, like most anime this season, but it happens that the construction of these moments does not even make sense or depend on various conveniences, I even believe that some conveniences are important for some works, but in this case they are only there because we need the moments that are the consequence of these.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does not know to be realistic, although the world-building of the series always indicate that this is a normal thing that happens in our world, it does not follow the logic nor the complexity of our world, the characters are empty, the protagonist is the stereotype of Gal, the black haired girl is a serious student who often serves the stereotype of kuudere, the protagonist's friend is only there to be gentle, other characters do not matter or act in the stereotypical way in which they should act (as well as the director and the evil teacher who serves as a plot-device), they are not complex characters and rarely will you see them in a list of favorites.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I wanted to emphasize in the inaturality of the anime is its romance. Is it serious that a Gal girl becomes a lesbian so quickly just because of a love at first sight or something? This CAN happen in real life, but in a work of fiction this is just a forced and cheap excuse for the script to continue and you do not have to write a more complex script about love and its consequences, works of fiction are not to be \"\"realistic\"\", they should be made to perceive the author's effort in the marvel work of his, just as in the past.\\n\\n\r\neverything in this show is as easy and simple to write as possible, people probably know this, people will not come here looking for a great story with an impressive development or nothing like that, people will give in to their fetishes and will see FanService of two girls loving each other, not because it's good, but because that's what they want, this is the biggest mistake of this anime and many others, the reality will only stop being that way if people start to change their way of thinking and demanding more of the media they themselves consume. Good evening.\\n",

            "content": "Citrus is a series that is tragically misunderstood; a story with far more substance and depth than word of mouth would lead you to believe. Not long after this show started airing, it\u2019s become easy for people to write off any element in the story as a means to arbitrarily wring out some voyeuristic lesbian action, rather than stopping to think of the purpose it actually holds for the narrative. When a sexual assault occurs, viewers assume that it\u2019s romanticizing such an action and therefore condones it. When an emotional barrier props up, it\u2019s assumed to be nothing more than a way of piling onmore drama. These premature assessments are commonly made when shows like this are perceived as simple fetish material, framed as horribly misplaced criticisms that leave Citrus in an undeservedly contemptuous light; as a guilty pleasure unworthy of further analysis or appraisal. Citrus is not mere fetish material, does not promote or romanticize sexual assault, and provides layered and well-developed characters whose actions are realistically influenced by both internal and external conflicts. A bittersweet feeling perpetuates as we follow naive teenagers consistently characterized as those who are lost and confused, behaving in ways that are less than ideal, but are hurdles along the way of a gripping and emotionally compelling tale that is certainly rough around the edges, but well worth the ride.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a common conjecture about Citrus saying that it treats sexual assault as a form of love and the blossoming romance is in the form of Stockholm syndrome, and both these things are wholly untrue. Firstly, while the actions of Mei Aihara undeniably walk on the borderline of sexual assault, none of these instances are framed as romantic or mutual in any way. The first of these depicts Yuzu struggling while Mei lashes out her aggression. Following this is a low shot with Mei, spitefully uttering \u201cthat\u2019s what it felt like\u201d in response to Yuzu\u2019s innocent curiosity about Mei\u2019s romantic affair. Nothing about this is painted in a positive, approving light. Subsequent events like this are blatantly shown to be a byproduct of Mei\u2019s misconception of how relationships work, or a means to vent her frustration. The sheer discomfort is emphasized through both the cinematography and the expressions of the characters involved. This does not mean nefarious actions like these are excused, as the story never does. Yuzu always retaliates to these actions once she regains control over herself during these events. Depiction and endorsement are not the same thing, a fact that should always be considered with regards to a story like this. Another thing to address is this: the assaults are by no means the foundation of the leads\u2019 romance, and that is a myth that should have passed long after this show had aired. Yuzu develops feelings for Mei long before the first assault occurs, which is most evident during the scene where she is lost in thought about witnessing Mei being kissed by Amamiya. Her focus is squarely on Mei\u2019s behavior and what kissing must feel like for her, with Yuzu\u2019s own attraction to Mei not even apparent to her. Overall, when proper attention is brought to the characters\u2019 actions as well as the framing, it becomes clear that the criticism of Citrus romanticizing assault holds no truth whatsoever. To see so much criticism founded on this misinformation is disheartening to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nCitrus and its content is highly reliant on context and characterization. Just as these confused adolescents struggle to understand each other and themselves, wondering who and what to believe, viewers are left on their own to base judgement on characters\u2019 behavior and what they say, save for some frequent monologuing by Yuzu. And even then, her own thoughts aren\u2019t always reliable. Content that comes off as questionable or discomforting to certain viewers is perfectly explainable through indirect characterization, a method of storytelling that challenges the brain beyond just relying on narration and monologues to provide answers without viewer effort. Viewers share frustration and confusion with the characters themselves, and the payoff is all the more rewarding because of this. The character Mei Aihara exemplifies this most of all, as she is a person whose subtle mannerisms bring light to a personality misshapen by the worst of circumstances, and very applicable to reality.\\n\\n\r\nMei is a character with practically no conception of right and wrong, let alone the idea of consent, and has never been shown, or had any experience of, what a true romantic relationship is like. The only proper relationship she has ever had in life was with her father. After he left, Mei felt as if she was being abandoned by the only one she was ever truly close to. It\u2019s clear that prior to where the main story begins, Mei has had no emotional support ever since her father\u2019s absence. She is used and neglected by her grandfather, is constantly taken advantage of by her fianc\u00e9e, and is under perpetual social pressure to follow her duties accordingly for days on end. \\n\\n\r\nAs a result, Mei\u2019s attitude towards romantic and sexual relationships is completely distorted. Her one and only understanding of love relationships is through physical contact, of which she uses to control people just as she has been controlled herself. This is symptomatic of being in a sexually abusive relationship like she had with her first fianc\u00e9e; she doesn\u2019t value her own body and is incapable of interacting with people normally. In many situations, whether it's a love relationship or otherwise, Mei passively accepts everything that is piled on her with no concern for her own well being, a trait that is consistently apparent over the course of the story. On the other end, her way of taking control of situations is her sexual advances towards Yuzu, who understandably objects to these actions. The main point is that Mei only acts in the way she knows how. This conflict of hers isn\u2019t a singular matter, but numerous elements about her past and how she was raised which come together creating the version of Mei we see throughout the story. Mei is depraved, misguided, and some could even say mentally ill. And again, none of these elements are used to justify Mei's behavior. It's merely a case of cause and effect, one which leaves morality out of the question entirely.\\n\\n\r\nBeing so used to her strict upbringing, Mei frames every scenario as a bargain or exchange rather than a desire, even if she doesn't necessarily intend it. Her feeling obligated to follow in the footsteps of her father to gain his affection encapsulates this quite well. Having received no unconditional love since her father\u2019s disappearance, this is the way of thinking which governs almost all of the decisions she makes. For this reason, she\u2019s perplexed as to why Yuzu bothers to do all these unconditional favors. The answer to this is simple: Yuzu cares about Mei. Unconditional love is a foreign concept to Mei, and this trait continues to subconsciously affect her even long after she has experienced the true virtues of a love relationship. (*cue the beginning of episode 10*)\\n\\n\r\nThe psychology of Mei is one of the main things which the story lives through, and is one of Citrus' most fascinating aspects. As frustrating as her actions can be at times, the consistency of her character and the relatability of her plight makes her highly sympathetic, and as such Yuzu\u2019s efforts to make things right for her, however reckless and brash, are very admirable. When you consider everything I've previously stated, it turns out that Mei has every reason to act and behave the way she does. Her attitude and behavior are both realistic and morbidly consistent when acknowledging this perpetual turmoil she lives through.\\n\\n\r\nMei\u2019s problematic, manipulative behavior is not only addressed as such, but is also a conflict in itself. Discomforting scenes that people insist to be mere sleaze and titillation always leaves a negative effect on characters involved. Mei\u2019s first assault turned Yuzu\u2019s pending lust for and curiosity of Mei into a maelstrom of confusion and hysteria. Repetition of these acts behind the scenes gave us Mei Aihara as we know her. A certain character who does this to another results in the victim avoiding that character extensively.\\n\\n\r\nThe way Mei gradually becomes more open to Yuzu about her feelings and personal issues, is a cathartic and satisfying affair in and of itself, and it\u2019s kept at natural pace throughout.  What\u2019s truly commendable, however, is how many instances of her development are deliberately presented for us to infer on our own, rather than being told directly and explicitly. Here\u2019s one particular example of this:\\n\\n\\n\r\n**SPOILERS FOR EPISODE 7 AND 8 BEGIN HERE**\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\nThe moment Mei truly develops romantic feelings for Yuzu is at the end of episode 6, and the exact moment she realizes these feelings is episode 7 when Matsuri forcibly kisses Yuzu out in the open. This is all indicated through her sudden change in behavior compared to before. She is now less grim in her expressions around Yuzu, and looks slightly more sentimental. Her actions convey this even further, such as the way she compliments Yuzu for the meal that was made. The day after that, Matsuri is shown to be envious of Mei continually deriving attention from Yuzu at the expense of Matsuri\u2019s, causing her to shove off. This causes Mei to feel guilty, having created distance between Yuzu and one of her closest friends. This is where she first experiences the baggage that comes from being in love.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n**SPOILERS END HERE**\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe reason this works in service to the narrative is so viewers are put into the perspective of Yuzu herself. She struggles to understand Mei, using signs in her behavior to understand what she feels. Mei is deliberately presented just as enigmatically as she is to everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nWith so much about Mei already covered, it\u2019s only fair that the other heroine, Yuzu, is given the same treatment. Yuzu at the start has an idealistic view of the life that lies before her. She acts with unrelenting confidence in almost all occasions, expecting everything to go smoothly and perfectly in line with what she envisions. I think I speak for most people when I say that when we were young teenagers, our ways of thinking were hardly any different. We\u2019ve had strong ambitions of our own, believing we could achieve them all without entirely knowing the reality of certain situations. Of course, like most teenagers, the decisions that Yuzu makes are not always wise. Quite rarely so, in fact. She often does things, with or without good intentions, unperturbed by any potential consequences they could raise. Her greeting with the chairman is a particularly good example of this. Having become a new addition to his family, she approaches him expecting to be welcomed with open arms. Instead she\u2019s scolded for her meddlesome behavior and unruly fashion choices.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, one of the primary things on her mind after learning about her mother\u2019s remarriage is how much wealth and privilege she has attained, even shamelessly announcing her status to the whole academy through a mic. By the time her feelings for Mei are fully realized, her infatuation with her new status as the chairman\u2019s granddaughter seems to have disappeared without a trace. Her pursuit has entirely moved on from material gain to the well being of Mei. This signifies growth of her character, but is also a mark of good character writing. The sudden absence of this character trait tells us simply and immediately that Yuzu has matured and come to terms with what actually matters.\\n\\n\r\nAs for her relationship with Mei, Yuzu is on a constant struggle to comprehend her feelings. She knows that something is amiss about Mei, invoking a feeling of concern. At other times, she wonders if what she does hurts Mei more than it helps. This confusion is a result of their inability to communicate with each other effectively and coherently, mimicking typical romance between teenagers more than people seem to realize. Yuzu doesn\u2019t understand Mei, and by extension doesn\u2019t know how to act around her. The two of them had been raised in completely different conditions, and thus operate and communicate differently from one another.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s obvious that Yuzu has an unfaltering love for Mei, but one obstacle she must overcome is resisting the urge to give in to her superficial desires, and pursuing what is realistically best for Mei in the long run. At one point her only choice is to put her love for Mei aside and to treat her as a sister. Although she does all these things selflessly she still has a degree of self-preservation, in stark contrast to Mei. What Citrus does well is distinguishing the superficial aspects of love from the emotional aspects. Crushes aren\u2019t developed through logic, and our own real life experiences prove as much. What this series explores is the multitude of consequences that come with loving someone. In this case, it\u2019s dealing with the complications of being in a love relationship with your step-sister.\\n\\n\r\nDifferentiating perceptions of love are what pervade a majority of the cast in Citrus. The students at Aihara Academy all knowingly grew up in an environment where sexual experimentation is a normality. Of course I can\u2019t speak from experience, but to my knowledge this mimics reality in Japan. Referred to as Class S, it\u2019s common for girls in school to have crushes on other female classmates, forming bonds with them. These bonds could be described as romantic, but the sexual aspect of the attraction is out of the equation entirely, assuming they\u2019re straight. It\u2019s telling that a Japanese audience would have a far better understanding of this kind of story, and the positive reception of Citrus in Japan compared to the west is evidence of this.\\n\\n\r\nHarumin really emulates this concept more than the others. She is essentially a direct foil to Yuzu in how sexual relationships are perceived. For Harumin, particular actions between couples are a source of curiosity. By contrast, Yuzu thinks about what these actions mean for the relationship. The most obvious example is arguably when the two eavesdrop on Amamiya\u2019s phone call. However, one other particular moment drives this home more than any other. Harumin discovers the yuri incest manga Yuzu was reading. Fascinated, she puts herself in a scissoring position with Yuzu. She\u2019s so confident in her heterosexuality that doing this means nothing to her. Yuzu on the other hand recognizes this as an expression of love, and thus is highly discomforted by this scenario. This is largely presented as a comedy moment, but it does a lot to signify the differences in their characterization. It also benefits in a way from being depicted in such an over-the-top manner.\\n\\n\r\nHarumin acts as a companion to Yuzu all the way through to the end, but in reality she isn\u2019t able to truly understand what Yuzu is going through, regardless of how much she thinks she does. This is also the reason Yuzu decides to take on these tasks by herself, because she\u2019s the only one who truly understands. We can also assume that she keeps it to herself in fear that Harumin wouldn\u2019t accept her for being in such a taboo relationship. After all, this is why she keeps it a secret to Matsuri and anyone else outside the school campus.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from the characters, I bear no hesitation saying that the plot of Citrus is undoubtedly its weakest aspect. Although the events it strings together can catch viewers off-guard, maintaining a dash of unpredictability in the whole adventure, it all too often relies on contrivances. Coincidences in fictional stories aren\u2019t inherently a bad thing. The reason I can accept the reveal of Mei as Yuzu\u2019s new sister is because it\u2019s so early in the story. In fact, it\u2019s arguably made better for the fact that it\u2019s coincidental, as it comes as a shock to both the audience and Yuzu herself. However, the numerous contrivances beyond this point become harder and harder to swallow as they come by. The way that some situations are arbitrarily resolved through circumstance, rather than on behalf of a character, doesn\u2019t do the plot much favors either.\\n\\n\r\nEach story arc in Citrus presents a barrier in Mei\u2019s psyche which is resolved with every passing conclusion. Every resolve is satisfying in its own right as it brings Mei further out of her shell whilst bringing her and Yuzu closer together. It\u2019s apparent that new characters are introduced to fill a certain role in these affairs, but the focus on Yuzu and Mei is unrelenting and the characters serve their purpose quite well. To start with, Himeko \"Twindrills\" Momokino at first appears to be quite the villain, but she actually shares traits with both Yuzu and Mei, and even has strikingly similar motivations. Like Yuzu, she has an unfaltering love for Mei, arguably in a \u201cromantic friendship\u201d sort of way as opposed to sexual attraction, and goes to great lengths to claim her affection. Like Mei, she is both dedicated to her job and remarkably strict with school regulations. Her intentions are what make her a rival to Yuzu, and then later bring them to a resolve. They wish the best for Mei, but are oblivious to her true feelings. Matsuri is a character acting as a parallel to Mei. Only instead of closing herself off, she seeks attention. In the worst ways. Her rebellious nature and sinister antics make her a worthy addition to the cast. It\u2019s not done just for the sake of it though. It\u2019s a situation where Mei sees her own self and is willing to make amends for someone Yuzu is close to.\\n\\n\r\nThe arc with the Tachibana sisters is considered by many to be the weakest arc in the series, and I am no exception. While it serves its purpose well and the payoff is rewarding, it isn\u2019t put together nearly as well as the others. I think what it sets out to do doesn\u2019t warrant new characters to be introduced into the middle of the whole dilemma where their intrusion can be seen as more frustrating than serviceable, especially when those characters lack depth. The situation between Mei and Yuzu at this point is already complicated as it is, so piling more characters on top of these complications is more of an annoyance than anything else. I think other less irritating methods would have served the function of this arc quite well without having to bring the sisters into the mix. It also doesn\u2019t help that in this arc, conveniences pile up even more than in any other, even attempting to sidestep this with \u201cfate\u201d and \u201cdestiny.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before though, the payoff is largely worth it in the end. It\u2019s not necessarily a case where the abundant problems in this arc can be forgotten, but rather forgiven. This arc is an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise great story overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue of Citrus is also worth commenting on. It\u2019s no Shakespearean writing, but it feels natural and works in service to whatever is going on. The characters\u2019 lines are filled with personality and subtext which makes conversations feel alive. Characters are also quick to point out irony in another\u2019s lines, making the exchanges even more human. Certain moments in dialogue are quite significant and memorable for how expressive they are and how it piles emotion into the situation. The scene where Mei and Yuzu are on a bench on a cold winter day is a good example.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, I think it\u2019s finally time to traverse into how Citrus fares in the audio/visual department. Regarding the visual front of the Citrus anime adaptation, it\u2019s very solid in its own right, but also has its shortcomings. Obviously it would be unreasonable to expect the level of quality in the manga\u2019s art to be fully translated into a costly animated product, especially with a studio like Passione. I will say one thing though. One of the main things which I believe gave the manga so much of its charm and made it so appealing to many, was how expressive the characters are. Characters, especially Yuzu, would regularly emote and make different facial expressions for many situations. This also happens to the anime to some degree, but not frequently enough to where it captures the manga\u2019s original charm. It\u2019s much rarer in the anime for characters to deviate from their default expressions, making the experience somewhat more sterile. Perhaps this was to cut down on budget costs, or it was a design choice on behalf of the director. Whatever the case, I find it to be a disappointment. Additionally, the animation quality at times leaves much to be desired, which I can only hope will be rectified in some degree in the upcoming BDs. One of the fronts I was most impressed by in this adaption was the soundtrack. It genuinely surprised me with how good the music was in this adaptation. It\u2019s vibrant, diverse, and well-utilized most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nSo that concludes my review of Citrus. The story at large is quite rough around the edges with its frequent use of coincidences. It\u2019s also arguably flawed in how many things are framed as a formulaic routine. With a new girl continually intruding on the situation, it\u2019s admittedly easy to feel some degree of frustration. The core story however, with the two main leads, remains very strong. Various facets of their character are explored well and brought to a satisfying resolve. That said, there are many loose ends in the story yet to be tied up, in which case I can only hope a second season will be made eventually to adapt the rest of the source material to complement the anime-viewing experience. All things considered, however, Citrus is a great anime overall. One of the things which motivated me to write this review was to address the criticisms this show had been receiving. If you have already seen this anime, and anything I\u2019ve said gave you something to think about, then perhaps it deserves a second viewing. For a show so widely shunned as being a lesbian fanservice show, the story of Citrus is one that anyone, gay or straight, male or female, can relate to on any level.",

            "content": "Tinseltown has been coming under fire as of late. Celebrities' misdeeds are being exposed publicly on a weekly basis like a new sporting event. The #MeToo movement giving a platform to voice sex scandals that have gone unnoticed for far too long. Scrolling through your timeline, plastered on the TV screen, announced over the radio during daily commutes, the subject matter of countless memes, the focal point of water-cooler conversations; no matter where you turn, there it is. Accusation after accusation. Transforming popular figures into pervert pariahs overnight. Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Bill Cosby, Louis C.K., Dustin Hoffman, Brett Ratner, James Woods, Bryan Singer, CaseyAffleck; an endless potpourri of bigwigs\u2014the 21st Century witch hunt in full swing. No one is safe. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while all of this is going on, halfway across the globe, there's Citrus, minding its own business as it idly trolls along turning sexual assault into a provocative byproduct of step-sisters \"bickering.\" While people are pooling together with torches and pitchforks in hand, shining a light on any sexual misconduct occurring in the dark recesses of the entertainment industry, Studio Passione persists with the biggest \"whatever bro\" shoulder shrug. What the rest of the world concerns itself with isn't going to stop them from showing girls casually molesting each other on their scheduled programming. It's actually pretty impressive. Fucked up, but impressive nonetheless. I guess you could extend that sentiment to Japan in general. Creating \"fucked up shit\" in a carefree manner has become something like their calling card:\\n\\n\r\nHas mass-shootings and domestic terrorism been a hot-button issue? Well here, have some Inuyashiki. Concerned with gender politics? Don't worry, we got you covered with Skirt no Naka wa Kedamono Deshita. \"If you want it, we got it.\" seems to be the motto, as they peddle anything and everything in the endless pursuit of creative freedom. Which brings us to latest foray into the \"fucked up shit\" unofficial canon, Citrus. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the land that gave us distinct high-school dramas like Orange, we're handed Citrus, the undesirable fruit.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime tells the tale of\u2013 oh, who are we kidding? It's about sexy-time with female characters. It's all lip service unless it \"services the lips\" of the females involved.\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty average-looking too, the ugly kind of average-looking.\\n\\n\r\nHoards of CGI models in green linen jackets. Flat buildings without detail, walls bare of personality. Real-life inspired locations washed of any distinct features. Stainless steel structures, straight shapes stretching on endlessly without purpose, without care. Floorboards and walkways copied and pasted into an endless loop of lethargic worldbuilding. A kind of artificial sheen to everything. Devoid of human touch, the undeniable look of computer-generated polish. Clinically sterile and evenly lit. The feeling of being done to the bare minimum. Uninspired. Uncaring. Unconcerned with anything unless it's \"sexy-time,\" and even then, it's barely a passing grade. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone has dark hair and moves forward in a unified step as if puppets to their boring world. A lifeless march towards an all-girl school, a place where our Yuzu would be attending. Yuzu Aihara is the rowdy rebel, our ball of \"life\" in a world lacking it, and unfortunately our main lead as well. The unlikable side character in any other show given a chance to take center-stage to problematic results. Makeup caked on, strawberry blonde hair puffed up, cleavage out in the sun, skirt hacked up, buttermilk tan, all manner of frilly things, school outfit altered beyond recognition, a personality as loud as her appearance; a self-proclaimed gyaru and a shameless attention-seeker at that\u2014this is \"much deep\" cuz spunky gurl in a world of conformists.\\n\\n\r\nAnd standing as her polar opposite, there's Mei Aihara, a soon-to-be molester dressed up as a Mary Sue. She suffers heavily from PerfectGirl-syndrome: honor-role pupil, top of her class, student council president, poised, admired by everyone, the chairman's granddaughter, built like a walkway model, good at literally everything she does. She probably farts out Chanel No. 5 too. You get the drill, she's as interesting as wallpaper. Perfect to a sickening degree. Well, that's all before she decided to turn her new step-sister, Ms. Rowdy Rebel, into her personal play-thing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd who better to bring this together than Takeo Takahashi, a man that's equally known for his hentai contributions as he is his \"safe for work\" content. \\n\\n\r\nCitrus certainly has that kind of attribute to it. That sort of sleazy undercurrent that flows throughout every moment, well-intention or otherwise. Camera-panning that ogles the female form without concern for respecting boundaries. Narrative threads meant to help audiences relate to the cast quickly expedited to get to the next sexual encounter. Endless monologues for every characters' dilemma\u2014subtlety isn't allowed in this universe. A sense of objectification, even if it's in regards to actions expressed with consent. Nothing is ever pure. Everything smeared with the fingerprints of hedonistic high-gloss. \\n\\n\r\nEven smut like 2017's Scum's Wish, at the very least, had small spurts of respect displayed for its cast, occasionally loosening its vice grip to allow a chance to express feelings openly. By comparison, everything in Citrus feels bought off. An act of slave-like procurement over the characters' bodies that's too readily apparent to ignore. Awkward half-chubs spurred on by involuntary stimuli. In a meta-sense, we're also made victims of visual misconduct (go figure). It's the kind of eroticism that arrives quickly and leaves you feeling dirty. \\n\\n\r\nAn anime that will have a heated shower scene where non-consensual groping occurs, then follow it up with this dialogue exchange:\\n\\n\r\n\"No!\"\u2013Yuzu pushes away in abject horror\u2013 \"Why are you doing this!?\"\u2013her eyes closed, as she stands there naked and vulnerable.\\n\r\nMei innocently answers back without hesitation, a tone of motherly matter-of-factness:\\n\r\n\"Because you looked like you wanted me to touch you.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe scene ends, never to properly address the disturbing exchange again. \\n\r\nAs long as the money shot was secured and a few man-tents were pitched, nothing else matters. \\n\r\nThis is the kind of \"feeling dirty\" I'm referring to. \\n\\n\r\nI love perverted content as much as the next guy, but sometimes, what Citrus attempts to do is genuinely off-putting. Sexual harassment shouldn't be confused with love. And if it is, a level of accountability needs to be put in place to avoid idealistic handwaving. But this is a show that thinks that if it holds a \"this is wrong\" PSA after it indulges in sexual misconduct, that it's suddenly not culpable of wrongdoing. An anime that sells Stockholm syndrome as a shot of Cupid's arrow. Where fighting sexual harassment with sexual harassment is treated as an actual solution. Serious issues trivialized to create marketable eroticism and comedic gags.\\n\\n\r\nAny act of earnestness is completely lost in a title devoid of finesse. After a while, you sort of just roll with it. Jokes at the expense of serious issues. Illogical reasoning made by characters to justify their actions. You might even buy into the lack of audiovisual effort as a part of the \"theme\" to contrast everything against Yuzu's personality. Of course, you'll be wrong, as even her living quarters and look has been rendered flaccid, lacking in any sense of creative vitality or noticeable effort. It's all very surface-level. Pedestrian sleaze that isn't arousing enough to keep the Kleenex nearby nor respectful enough to genuinely stimulate discussions regarding the content on display. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's perhaps this show's biggest downfall in a nutshell: it's vanilla, but a souring type of vanilla. \\n\\n\r\nA type of middling existence occupied by works of far more distinction than itself. If you're interested in the taboo themes that this anime addresses, there's no need to compromise with inferior goods to get your fix. There are better alternatives out there for those actually seeking integrity (Koi Kaze) or far more titillating eye-candy (Scum's Wish). Why settle for vanilla in a world full of flavor just waiting to be discovered? Is Citrus entertaining? Sure, at times. But when 17-minutes of content is glazed over just for 3-minutes of \"sexy-time,\" and the \"sexy-time\" itself is neither well-animated or concerned with addressing the elephant in the room that surrounds its content; at that point, what you're left with is a show whose sole purpose for existing is left dead in the water from the moment it dives in.",

            "content": "Citrus challenges today's anime standards by introducing interesting topics like \"How cringy can character dialogue become in an anime until I drop it?\" and \"Is it sexual assault if I kiss my step sister without consent...and get away with it?\"\r\nThis is by far the worst anime I've seen this year and I'm just 4 episodes in. Dialogue doesn't feel natural at all, exposition is thrown in my face every second and characters don't make any sense.\r\nThe pacing of Citrus is way too fast and we never get any real sense of knowing how to feel about a moment. There is a scene where Mei kissesher sister in the first epiosde without her consent and it feels super uncomfortable but next episode, the main character pretends like this thing was super romantic, not literally, but this is what it feels like.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is also something we should talk about. It commendable that the director actually changes the clothes of the main character multiple times, which isn't done as often as you might think, but the actual animation is piss poor and the art still suffers from time to time. It's also sad that nothing about this animation seems to have any personality.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the topic of Gay bait. Is this show some gay bait for people that browse through tumblr and twitter 24/7? Yes. Yes it is. Instead of developing a genuine, natural romance between two highschool students that happen to be girls, we get some of the most rapey, uncomfortable Yuri scenes I had the displeasure to watch. It is amazing how people are willing to justify abusive and toxic romance as long as it's gay.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a shitty gay Telenovela in anime form, then boy, is Citrus the anime for you.",

            "content": "Some spectators consider themselves sophisticated, modern and avant-garde. However, when they become aware of some social taboos, they change their mind and create a disapproval towards some topics. One example, the lesbian romance. Citrus has potential but fails with some distasteful scenes as described below. \r\nThe Ugly: The story mistake love with rape and forces affection from a lame sexual assault. In this world, Weinstein\u2019s behavior would be considered romantic and not the act of a sick predator.\r\nThe Good: As the plot progress you can observe the protagonists\u2019 insecurity, problems, and feelings. \r\nThe Bad: Unrealistic begin. Some characters are not well developed because the timeis not enough to let them grow.\\n\\n\r\nCitrus introduces a homosexual storyline where we can see a lesbian nexus, yet you don\u2019t need to fear it. No matter your gender, you can enjoy some parts of the narrative. The plot isn\u2019t as bad as some writers want us to believe, but it\u2019s not surprising either. Besides, the series begins with some weird and awkward moments that sink the possibility of a good romance, and I consider them fictional and unrealistic. On the other hand, Citrus emphasize the inexperience and the doubts in a relationship and tries to establish a link between the protagonists. In some scenes, you can sense the character\u2019s feelings. Sadly, in this modern era the taboo persists, perhaps for a woman, it is easier to tolerate this type of bond. Finally, Citrus is a Yuri anime, if you cannot bear this kind of affinity, it is better to stand aside and ignore the adaptation, or you might end up disappointed.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn\u2019t as marvelous as you can expect, the author sometimes mistakes rape with love, though. Also, the only way explored to conceive the romance is through the physical force. For example, it is ridiculous comparing intimacy with a sexual assault under the diplomatic motto \u201csince I love you, I can obligate you to adore me.\u201d In a real world, this concept will be judged as rude and out of place, it will generate repulsion, a restriction order and could end with a visit to the jail. Those actions could lead the spectator to misinterpret the characters\u2019 feelings and leaves the personal problems, fears, doubts, the lack of experience, and psychological aspects in the missing objects box. In the case of Yuzu, she does not know how to approach Mei, so the storyteller merely throws her over Mei literally, and the latter doesn\u2019t hesitate to assault Yuzu. Can you accept it as a romance? Furthermore, this keeps happening during all the adaptation. If you read the manga, those scenes aren\u2019t intrusive, you can pass them faster but in the anime the director focus and prolong them. Call it fanservice, hentai or sexual harassment; it does not fit the feeling setting momentum.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, this erroneous idea creates a false meaning of a lesbian link. From my perspective, a lesbian is like a straight; the relationship rules are alike. Why does the author use a weird and a wrong approach to initiate the attraction? Thus far, the plot fails on producing a good start for the romantic connection, it just leads the characters to a forced rape, deceiving the spectators with a cheap and fake drama.  \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the narration improves as it advances. I am not considering Citrus as a masterpiece, but the progression is acceptable. As the series continues, we can observe the inexperience of a usual acquaintance, the doubts, the pain, the suffering of the protagonists delivering the audience a better development and a different perspective. While the story picks up, it still has some defects such as the recurrent fanservice. If the social taboos do not slant the viewer, you could enjoy Citrus, though.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the lack of sense at the beginning ruins the possibility of a more vibrant narrative, a palpable romance and leads to the audience\u2019s boredom. Going further, you can notice some pacing problems. You need to be honest with yourself because some characters were just placed to fill a scene. The casual spectator will only watch the first episodes and decide if skipping the show. Since the issues appear from the start, Citrus will be readily considered a bit grotesque, a raw passion and a potential drop.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the overused sexual assault as a \u201ccomedy\u201d (for some) or as a \u201cromance\u201d change the plot and the enjoyment. If you can survive those scenes, you can see the character\u2019s authentic feelings. Honestly, I like Citrus manga, but the anime has been highly criticized by some unpleasant development that leads to a different meaning. In conclusion, you cannot compare intimacy with ravishment, and you cannot exploit the sexual assault to propel a romantic or comedic moment. For some viewers that scenes show affection, for others is a rape. In my case, SOME are sexual abuse and unnecessary. Lastly, the twelve episodes present a portion of the story and not all the published material and the most significant parts of the series still on the source.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\\n\\n\r\nYuzu. In the beginning, she displays some atypical feelings for Mei. Since she has no experience in love or relationships, she could fool the viewers with her naivety, show an emptiness and a similarity with a mundane generic girl. However, as the story progresses, we can see her emotions, problems and real doubts.\\n\\n\r\nMei. Some can judge her as a cold and expressionless robot. Since she is the school president, she might look strong. Nevertheless, inside she is baffled and seeks to follow her dad\u2019s steps. She will give up everything to keep alive her family legacy and traditions. Also, she cannot communicate her emotions and has vast inexperience in the relationship area. Thus, always leads her to mistake love with sexual assault or perhaps she just enjoys doing that. \\n\\n\r\nMatsuri. I consider her introduction misplaced. From nowhere she arrives and creates some problems just because Mei needs an opponent. Her feelings for Yuzu are vaguely explained.\\n\\n\r\nSara: Added in a similar way to Matsuri but her nature is the opposite. She is Yuzu\u2019s rival, and her sentiments appear almost instantly. \\n\r\nThe rest of the characters help the narrative progression such as Harumi and Himeko. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound\\n\\n\r\nTechnically speaking, Citrus has a beautiful animation, clean and fluid with excellent drawings catching your attention. Despite the plot issues, you will enjoy it. The camera angles and planes blend well with the narrative and the emotions; they focus on the details. One negative aspect, the unnecessary fanservice scenes. You could misinterpret them and will sink the real story.\\n\r\nThe series has good sound. They give us a remarkable OP and ED. Honestly, I like the OP, the tune and rhythm combined with the lyrics create a fabulous composition. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nCitrus isn\u2019t an anime for all tastes. The social taboo may make the observer indispose from the beginning. However, after some episodes, the story improves, and you can feel some character\u2019s emotions. I like some aspects of the plot. It isn\u2019t perfect and has a weird unrealistic start letting you with a big question mark, \u201cis it going to be worth my time?\u201d Thus, in combination with the \u201csexual assault\u201d scenes could lead your apathetic side and make you drop the series. Finally, the manga is superior. It shows a significant evolution with better pacing. I understand, sometimes most of the spectators avoid this genre, but if you reached this point of my review, perhaps you could watch the anime and read the source to feel Yuzu\u2019s emotions in a more desirable approach. I wanted to give Citrus a high score my conviction prevents me. I cannot accept the constant use of a sexual assault as a romantic or comedic filler that impacts the plot negatively. As I said, Citrus isn\u2019t for all the tastes. \\n\\n\r\nLastly and talking in general, you need to be broad-minded and don\u2019t bury a show just for a sexual preference. You can criticize but don\u2019t stigmatize the lesbian topic. If you dislike the story, skip it.\\n",

            "content": "If I got a dollar every time this show featured a kiss scene, I\u2019d probably be filthy rich now. No, not really but you have to admit, there\u2019s almost an absurd amount of kissing in this show known as \u201cCitrus\u201d. To me, this show is a modern example of a trashy soap opera made with the intention of cash grab. \r\nAdapted by the manga of the same name, Citrus is one of the few series in recent years that decided to take on the idea of lesbianism and turn it into a modern day drama. In anime form, it\u2019s defined more as yuri/shoujo-ai. As someonewho has read parts of the manga, Citrus focuses on the concept of female relationships. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t really express any hope after reading the manga. This anime adaptation set off red flags from the start and isn\u2019t able to fix them. It\u2019s a shame really. \\n\\n\r\nDiving into this show may feel a little uncomfortable at first if you\u2019re not used to this type of genre. The first few episodes makes it clear that there\u2019s more going on between main characters Yuzu and Mei. Although they don\u2019t have similar personalities, it\u2019s shown that Yuzu feels an uneasy attraction towards Mei after getting into some compromising positions with her. Throughout the show, the both of them engage in many activities that adheres to lesbianism. The anime doesn\u2019t hide the fact that there\u2019s seems to be mutual attraction as each episode ventures on. Other characters gets involved in their story but the main focus is on this pair. And to be honest, it feels pretty embarrassing to watch. The show tries to be a love story but instead filled with laughably bad dialogue and clich\u00e9s. I also can\u2019t remember the number of times I shook my head at how their relationship developed. That\u2019s actually what holds the show back a lot. Relationship dynamics in Citrus dances with an immense amount of teenage feelings and attempts to make it seem complicated. However, it ends up being washed up with little value and doesn\u2019t seem to know what to make of its characters. \\n\\n\r\nIndividually, Yuzu and Mei aren\u2019t actually bad characters. At least from a realistic point of view, Yuzu is a normal girl who wants to explore romance and grow up. She\u2019s also a bit of a daredevil and isn\u2019t afraid to speak her mind or help others when in need. On the other hand, there\u2019s Mei with a personality as cold as the snow. My impression of Mei is someone who would be incredibly difficult to be friends with. Her values are high standard and she never seems to let people get close to her, with perhaps the exception of Yuzu. We also get some background story about the two characters in later episodes to make viewers understand them more. However, that\u2019s pretty much the extent of it. Yuzu and Mei are basically carrying this show while other characters are hardly worth talking about. I mean, there\u2019s Yuzu\u2019s best friend Himeko but she gets annoying every time her mouth opens. Harumi Taniguchi\u2019s borderline obsession with Mei is incredibly obnoxious to watch. Oh and who can forget about Matsuri? It seems the show tries to make the audience hate her as much as possible. The Tachibana sisters introduced in later episodes are hardly likable either with their oddball personalities. The point is, most of these characters are one dimensional and hardly develops. In fact, I would say the characterization in this show really shoots itself in the foot with how certain episodes conclude. And that\u2019s too bad really.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the characters and story, it seems Citrus loves to service the fans. While it\u2019s not as explicit as some scenes in the manga, there\u2019s quite a bit of kissing in the show. If you fancy make out scenes and yuri fan service, then this might be the type of show for you. I\u2019m not going to lie though, it can be a bit of guilty pleasure at times. However, it gets tedious fast and after you\u2019ve seen it a dozen times, it almost feels senseless. That being said, Citrus does do what it\u2019s intended to do: bring out teenage feelings from characters and making a trite soap opera out of it.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing to smile upon Citrus, it would definitely be the visual quality. To put it simply, the show is vibrant, colorful, and is full of life. The character designs are attractive and really enhances the feminine charms of the cast such as Yuzu and the Tachibana sisters. The way characters expresses their emotions is also highlighted through the choreography that\u2019s hard to ignore. In many ways, the technical quality of Citrus is a sight for eyes to feast on. Whether it\u2019s the fan service or characters themselves, it\u2019s definitely there to impress.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not too much to go on about soundtrack as both theme songs gets its point across with the teenage drama style performance. However, the character voice mannerism is what makes some of the characters feel consistent with their roles. Yuzu is the most prominent example as she often speaks her mind and has a voice to match with her personality. Mei has a much colder voice tone that reflects her reserved persona. However, there\u2019s also other characters that I can hardly stand whenever they speak. In particular, Matsuri\u2019s voice sounds like she\u2019s a 12 year old. Get ready for the ear plugs\u2026\\n\\n\r\nBy the time I finished Citrus, I had to question myself why the anime is even called that. The literal definition of Citrus is a type of fruit that has somewhat of a sweet and bitter flavor. Does that stand as a personification of the show\u2019s themes? Who knows but I honestly find this show more than just bittersweet. What could have been a chance to make monumental history turned into a sour experience. \\n",

            "content": "Potential spoilers for the manga below...\r\nFirst - ignore all the hate directed at Citrus online. Give it a chance and make up your own mind. Other reviews and discussions will mock you for enjoying something they call trashy and melodramatic. They mock you for being entertained by something they have deemed so basic and depraved. And yet, after you've watched a few episodes you're thinking, 'why do I like this so much and why do I want to see more if everyone says this is garbage?'\r\nIt's because Saburouta is punching WAY above her weight on Citrus. It's like someone took Jane Austen and plonked herdown in modern day Japan and asked her to write a yuri manga. Yes, the very thing that all those haters will mock you for seeing in Citrus that they claim doesn't actually exist - the excellent writing, the deep character development, the touching emotional content - really is there, and it's been written quite purposefully and skillfully.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin, let's put aside that this is yuri for the moment. Yes, you know it is, I know it is, everyone knows it is. But the point of Citrus is absolutely not the fact that it's yuri. Saburouta could have written this story with two asexually reproducing spores as the main characters and it would have been equally as compelling. The fact that it's yuri is not implicitly fan-service, and if you've read the manga you will know that Saburouta dishes out the fan service in such tiny servings as to lack any nourishment whatsoever. More on why this is an issue in a moment. \\n\\n\r\nLet's get the other elephant in the room out of the way - the non-consensual sexual content in the first episodes/manga issues. Remember that this is a work of fiction and the reader is not meant to condone or approve of the actions of any of the characters. This is the classic dramatic question of, \"is evil something you are or something you do?\" To begin with, Mei has been taken advantage of, used, and basically treated like an automaton by dear old gramps ever since her Dad left (we'll get to that later). At the beginning of the story, there is no Mei - there is just a robot that does what needs to be done in the name of the Aihara family. She has no mother, no father, and the only affection she has ever known has been the cruel affection of the jerk teacher that she was arranged to marry even though he was planning on leaving her once he had the academy. She has literally never had a proper emotional relationship with anyone, and all she understands is the use of physical affection as a means of controlling others, as she has been controlled herself. But yes, you say, Mei should know better. She should know the difference between right and wrong! Oh really? Who taught Mei right from wrong? That's right, no one! She's acting out the only way she knows how. And, by the end of episode nine after the run-in with Matsuri - shock of all shocks, Mei has learned right from wrong because never again in the entire series do we see Mei act this way. And guess who teaches Mei wrong from right by her actions - Yuzu does.\\n\\n\r\nI'd also like to address the actions of Matsuri that a lot of people have a problem with - don't forget that Matsuri is just a kid. Remember being a kid? Remember how bad your judgement was, and how you did a lot of stupid things that people called you out for? Again, you say, Matsuri should know right from wrong. But again, who taught her right from wrong - her workaholic, absent parents? Right. Matsuri isn't capable of understanding the consequences of her actions, something that Yuzu points out to her several times. \"Relationships are not a game\" and \"love does not come as easily as it does in a manga\" says Yuzu to Matsuri. Matsuri is similar to Mei (as Mei informs her on the train, and why Mei forgives Matsuri so easily) in that Matsuri is literally a kid alone in the world. But instead of closing herself off to the rest of the world like Mei did, Matsuri sought out attention - the bad kind - online with her \"clients\". Mei isn't joking or being self-sacrificing when she tells Yuzu \"that girls needs you\". Mei understands more than anyone, despite Matsuri's actions, that Matsuri needs a source of goodness and love in her life. This is why Mei says that Yuzu is \"one of those meddlesome people who give you love even though you didn't ask for it\". By the end of episode nine, Matsuri has very subtly grown as a person and again, never does any of that bad stuff again for the rest of the series (so far). \\n\\n\r\nLet's get to the relationship between Yuzu and Mei. They are, quite literally and figuratively, the yin to the other's yang. And let's get one thing out of the way right now - Mei and Yuzu are as gay as the day is long from the outset. This is why I said this story could have been about two asexually reproducing spores - the fact that they are gay has nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing to do with this story. Why do I say this? Because neither Yuzu or Mei are struggling with their sexuality, ever. Being gay is so natural to them that they never question it. Need proof? Remember the scene where Yuzu is reading the sister manga, and Harumin (who wins as best friend in a manga/anime ever btw) suddenly scissors her. Yuzu *freaks out* and Harumin says \"this book shows positions for two women\". Why is Harumin so casual and Yuzu so freaked out? Because to Harumin, that position means literally nothing other than a curiousity - Harumin is so confident in her heterosexuality that she can do that without worrying what it means. Yuzu, on the other hand, is mortified because scissoring means something completely different to her - it means an expression of love, an expression of love she one days hopes to share with Mei. Which is what makes it such an uncomfortable situation with Harumin, for whom she has only a friendship type of love.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Mei, well, Mei is just super gay. And this is where Citrus is worth a deeper look and a rewatch or two. The thing you need to know about Mei is that she falls for Yuzu *for real* in episode eight. You know after Yuzu takes Mei to say goodbye to her father, Shou? After Mei sees Matsuri awkwardly kissing Yuzu in the street? Yeah - right there. That's where Mei falls for Yuzu. The cute little finger twidding scene with her stuffed bear followed by the passionate hug of Yuzu - right there. And here's where the central conflict of the series begins: Mei simultaneously loves Yuzu but also wants to push Yuzu away because of all the baggage that comes with loving Yuzu. Mei is pissed off with herself for being in love with Yuzu, and every interaction for the rest of the anime/manga is an expression of the internal love/hate that Mei has for Yuzu. This is what makes the story so bittersweet - we love Yuzu, Yuzu wants Mei to love her, Mei wants to love Yuzu, we want Mei to love Yuzu, but....Mei just can't allow herself to do that. If you've ever been in a similar situation, you know what's up.  \\n\\n\r\nBut back to the gayness. Saburouta never asks us to question that they are gay, as is the case with most \"will they or won't they\" yuri - we are meant to accept it as easily as the both of them do. So Saburouta has taken the standard yuri trope and cast it aside.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that Saburouta very purposely drew Mei and Yuzu as lesbians from the outset for the very reason that this anime/manga is getting so much hate - she wanted to remove the ability of the audience to fetishize the relationship between Yuzu and Mei. For the typical yuri audience, this is anathema - it defies the whole reason they read yuri in the first place. Citrus is, as its core, a very cute and bittersweet love story that most people - gay, straight, or otherwise, can relate to. \\n\\n\r\nIn Yuzu, Saburouta has created one of the most likeable, and dare I say loveable characters in manga/anime. Yes, her earnestness and plucky, can-do, kampai attitude is a standard trope, but there is way more to her than that. She actually shares a lot with Mei and Matsuri, parental attentiveness-wise. Her Mom is cool but absent, and new Dad Shou literally married her Mom just so that Mei would have a place to live away from gramps and he's off who-knows-where-doing-who-knows-what. The very first scene of the anime/manga is Yuzu hanging out with the slutty mean girls doing the teen-sex-talk thing. Yuzu desperately wants to belong somewhere, even if it is pretending and exaggerating with the nasty gyarus. She is the light to Mei's dark, again, literally and figuratively. Where Yuzu is overflowing with kindness, love, goodness, and understanding, Mei is a completely dark and vacant empty vessel. Over the series, you watch as Yuzu's love flows into Mei and completely changes her. But what about Mei, what does Mei do for Yuzu? Let's face it - Yuzu is a scatterbrained airhead. She acts without thinking, she has very little personal discipline, and would be distracted by a squirrel playing outside the window. For Yuzu, Mei is a much-needed reality check. When Yuzu is off floating around in teddy bear clouds, Mei is the one who is there to make sure her feet don't get out beyond reach. And Yuzu realizes this and also changes her behavior to be a more diligent student (with mixed results). The two of them are inextricably intertwined and their lives cannot be complete - at all - without the other.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why Citrus, and Saburouta, are absolute genius. The subtlety, the way that you can go back and rewatch past episodes re-read past chapters with present knowledge to unlock the motivations of the characters is brilliant.",

            "content": "It's still pretty early which is why this isn't much of a review yet as it's more of a first impression for the people interested. \r\nThe reason I'm writing this is because I'm really satisfied with how well the adaptation came out. Don't get me wrong, I'll evaluate it as an anime not as an adaptation but I just want to say that it really stood out to me how the anime made the setting pop out more than what the manga did. I never really felt the surroundings in the manga and I'm really glad with this since it holds an importance in theshow. It also stays faithful to the source material as of now but again, it's still too early to end it there. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTo begin, this show is about romance. Lesbian romance. \\n\\n\r\nNow with this kind of stories, people like me usually watch it for the sexual fantasy and stuff. It's more about the characters so It doesn't really need to have a mind bending plot. It does have some sensitive themes if that concerns you. With that said, it does a good job on executing it's story. \\n\\n\r\nWe have this girl; Yuzu, who is very enthusiastic about being a gal and even lies about having boyfriends to her friends but she gets transferred to an all-girls school because her \"mama suddenly found a new papa.\" On that school she meets other characters but most importantly Mei, the intriguing student council president/grandchild of the school chairman/the betrothed in an early age character (trust me, this is not a spoiler.) They started on the wrong-foot pretty quickly because of their conflicting personalities but what they don't know is that they're connected much closer than they think. We find more and more things about Mei through Yuzu and boom, character development. \\n\\n\r\nIt gets spicy very early but it doesn't feel rushed or forced and there's nothing I can really complain about. That's just the scenario but the pacing itself is fine along with the direction. It kinda feel like a k-drama. The use of lighting, the backgrounds, blurring or shaking camera shots, I love how they use the light behind Mei to hide her face when she stood up then showed her expression afterwards as she walks away. I can tell that the studio respects the manga and is really trying all they can to not just merely copy what's drawn in the source material. The art style really captivates me because it's not overly detailed but it looks so good. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't outstanding or anything but it doesn't have to. It's good enough for a drama show and the studio knows what it needs to emphasize. Like that scene where Mei searched for Yuzu's smartphone In Ep 1. That scene wasn't just to grab (no pun intended) attention, it's actually important because that's the reason why Mei left such a huge impression on Yuzu when they met. I really like the occational dynamic camera movement too like those in the OP. The show can look good even without that but they still went for it and that's always good to see. The music is fine but I don't have much to say about it really, there's some good ones like the one played during Yuzu's bath in Ep 1 but nothing that stands out. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is helpful or anything but I like the show so far that's why I'm persuading people to give it a try.",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended for those that have already finished watching Citrus and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. \r\nWhen sisters meet unexpected sparks fly and an unlikely romance blossoms \r\nBased off a popular manga series of the same name Citrus is a Shoujo and romance anime that takes place within a school setting and gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if you not only find yourself welcoming in a stepsister into your family from your mothers new marriage but also the actions thatcan happen if you were to fall in love with the stepsister that you just welcomed into your family. While Shoujo animes aren\u2019t usually a genre that I'm really interested in when looking at the premise as well as the background source material that it makes use of I felt that the series itself certainly sounded interesting. Interesting enough in that I decided to give the series a chance. The first episode of the series I felt did a great job of introducing both the setting of the series which is the school and of the two main characters Yuzu and Mei. In particular, I felt that the sense of rivalry that developed between them from that moment was interesting considering how later events would play out. Looking back, I'm glad that I decided to give this series a chance as the series was one that I really enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story of the series takes place at a famous and popular all-girls school situated in Tokyo that is well known for is strictness and conservative nature and follows the life of Yuzu Aihara a newly transferred student that moved to the city to join her recently remarried mother. As Yuzu, a fashionable and fun-loving girl transfers to the school and encounters the conservative and strict nature of the school she encounters the schools beautiful but strict student council president Mei Aihara who whether through fate or destiny is also Yuzu\u2019s new stepsister. While clashing with Mei both in school and at home Yuzu soon learns that attraction and hatred just like love and hate are two sides of the same coin. As Yuzu and Mei clash with each other they also start to learn more about each other and slowly but surely the two start to bond and get closer with each other and slowly cross the line that divides the sisters and become something more. While slowly bonding with her new stepsister Yuzu as she gets used to both the school and the city also meets and makes a number of new friends while also encountering ones from her past. These include the arrogant but understanding student council vice president Himeko, the cunning and deceptive Junior high school student Matsuri and the Tachibana sisters Sara and Nina who while having differing personalities also have a close and loving bond between them. The overall story of the series covers roughly the first four volumes of the source material. \\n\\n\r\nYuzu \\n\\n\r\nYuzu Aihara played by veteran seiyuu singer Ayana Taketatsu of Sao and Youkoso fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A bright, fashionable and fun-loving girl by nature Yuzu at the beginning of the series was a newly transferred student that had just moved to the area to live with her mother who had remarried. While carefree and positive Yuzu was also someone that had a lot of self-confidence but did not let that make her arrogant and instead was something of a free spirit being both positive and friendly to everyone that she meets. As a result of these traits Yuzu was someone that was able to make friends easily and in this, it can be seen that she\u2019s someone that\u2019s very loyal to her friends and would work hard to help them and support them when they need help while hating it when she is unable to help them. While relaxed and carefree by nature it can be seen that Yuzu is also someone that can get serious at times especially with regards to helping her friends with their problems a side of her that I felt was a great contrast to her relaxed nature and fitted well with the two sides concepts that the series makes use off. In line with Yuzu\u2019s carefree and free spirit type personality Yuzu is also someone that is noted to hate being constrained by rules especially those that restrict in how she should dress. This stems mainly from the fact that Yuzu is someone that believes that it\u2019s the right of high school girls to be able to dress and act the way that they want in order to take advantage of their youth and any rules that prevent that will only be a bad thing for them. In line with this aspect of her personality Yuzu while mostly being someone that prefers to not stand out is also someone that\u2019s also bold enough to make her views on subjects that concern her known even if she was to face censure when doing so. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Yuzu gets to both know Mei better and encounter and befriend more characters in the school Yuzu\u2019s personality gradually starts to change as she finds her life becoming more intertwined with that of Mei. At the beginning of the series Yuzu while carefree was also someone that was rather stubborn with her beliefs and often had arguments with people that had different views to her. As the series progresses this side of her personality gradually changes, and Yuzu begins to show more consideration to others while trying to rein in her more brash behaviour and try to think of the consequences of an action before doing them. This change is best shown in Yuzu\u2019s willingness to admit her own mistakes and attempts to take responsibly for her actions and any effects that it had whether on the school or her friends. At the beginning of the series, Yuzu and Mei did not have the best of relationships or the best of first encounters and it can be said that their first feelings on meeting each other as sisters for the first time was hated and dislike rather than happiness and joy that would be the expected. Unlike Yuzu\u2019s carefree and freethinking nature that values independence Mei\u2019s personality, in the beginning, was the complete opposite being rule-bound, and strict which Yuzu applied to both Mei and her family. As the series goes on and they get to know each other more this feeling of antagonism gradually softens, and Yuzu starts seeing and treating Mei as family. As the series goes and Yuzu gets to see and understand the pain that exists within Mei she becomes somewhat determined to break through the shell of sadness that Mei has erected around herself fighting hard to get through to the real Mei that was behind it in a determined attempt to give her what she had craved the most in her life which was love and a place where she can belong too. As a result of this journey, the bond between the two gradually grows deeper as Mei slowly opens herself up to Yuzu\u2019s determined attempts to help her and in the process creating a deeper relationship between the two that Yuzu never expected. The character of Yuzu I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed as the series went on. Its been a while since I had seen Ayana Taketatsu in a lead role, but I felt that she did an excellent job of portraying the character of Yuzu. \\n\\n\r\nMei \\n\\n\r\nMei Aihara voiced by veteran seiyuu Minami Tsuda of Guilty Crown fame is one of the main characters of the series. The new stepsister to Yuzu Mei\u2019s personality and attitude is markedly different from Yuzu in more ways than one. An attractive and intelligent girl by nature Mei is the very image of a cool beauty that deals with every situation with calm and logical solutions that hint at her level-headed nature. A quiet and composed girl Mei is someone that believes fervently that rules are the very pillars of society and that without it society would only be in chaos. This is a belief that Mei believes greatly and tries to inspire the students of her school in her capacity as student council president. While a quiet girl by nature Mei, however, is not unsociable and indeed while most people assume that she\u2019s rather aloof the truth of the matter is that Mei can also be friendly to those that she has befriended and can be surprisingly understanding of others while being courteous and polite to those that she doesn\u2019t yet know. From the beginning of the series, it can be seen that Mei is someone that\u2019s very hardworking and takes her duty as student council president seriously. Indeed, she is the type of person that would try to do everything by herself and be unwilling to bother others with it even if it was their role to help in the first place which shows her dutiful and determined nature. To many of the students that she manages Mei is someone that is cool, level-headed and efficient that makes it hard for them to approach however the reality of this is that Mei while certainly cool and efficient is also someone that remembers those that have helped her in some way a side of her that I really liked.  \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and more of Mei\u2019s personality is revealed beneath the calm and composed attitude that she projects to her fellow students Mei is, in fact, someone that lives in constant pain and isolation and is someone that doesn\u2019t trust others easily. Rather it can be seen that Mei is someone that tries to push those that try to know her away. As a result of having lived alone for much of her life in the beginning of the series it can be seen that Mei like Yuzu needed time to get used to the fact that they now had a much larger family than before and while the relationship between Mei and Yuzu and her mother was somewhat distant at first this gradually changed as the series went on in line with the deepening bond that is forged between them. While hinted on in the beginning as the series progressed it become apparent that Mei\u2019s relationship with her family was rather strained and while she feels indebted to her grandfather who had raised her this also acted as a constraint for her life as well as it limited the freedom that she could have within her life. However arguably the main issue that had caused Mei\u2019s heart to be constrained was, without doubt, the strained relationship that she had with her father which caused her to work fiercely to protect the school even to the point of causing her life to become nothing more than a set of performances. After making peace with her father and fixing this Mei\u2019s attitude gradually began to soften and she begins to break out of her shell and not just be more open with her feelings but also learn to place her trust in others more. At the beginning of the series, Mei\u2019s relationship with Yuzu was that of wariness which was somewhat understandable and kept her distance from her. But as the series progressed on and she gets to see and understand Yuzu\u2019s personality a bit more this began to change. After overcoming many challenges together Mei\u2019s attitude towards Yuzu begins to change becoming more positive and open-minded and less formal in her dealings with Yuzu showing the improving bond between them. While still retaining some of her aloof nature Mei\u2019s personality gradually begins to thaw and begins showing her more honest and warmer feelings towards Yuzu openly unlike before. The character of Mei was an interesting one as her personality while contrasting greatly with that of Yuzu was the result of problems that was caused by family-related issues that ended up constraining her life which I felt was appropriate as it matched well with the theme of family and bonding by breaking through the wall that someone has erected to protect and hide them. I felt that her seiyuu Minami Tsuda did an excellent job in portraying the character of Mei. \\n\\n\r\nMatsuri \\n\\n\r\nMatsuri Mizusawa voiced by veteran seiyuu Shiori Izawa of Asterisk wars fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is an old friend of Yuzu. A 2nd-year junior high school student Matsuri at the beginning of the series behaved somewhat like an old friend to Yuzu being overly attached to her while still maintaining an innocent charm that was unique to her. On the surface, Matsuri was a kind, caring and polite person that seemed to value friendships and bonds. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and more of Matsuri\u2019s personality is revealed it can be seen that beneath this surface Matsuri\u2019s personality is very different. Beneath her surface personality, it can be seen that Matsuri is someone that is cunning, manipulative, and deceitful and will use every available means to get ahead of others as long as victory is hers. In addition, Matsuri has also shown to be rather possessive of things that are considered dear to her such as her role as Yuzu\u2019s little sister. At the beginning of the series, Matsuri was shown to have a rather warped view of what friendships and indeed what a relationship is as she took neither of them seriously and viewed them as something akin to a game. In this, she treated both as something that she can take advantage off to allow her to survive in society while at the same time pushing away things like love and warmth that is a result of the relationships that can form between friends. In a way, Matsuri\u2019s personality, in the beginning, was very much like what Mei had been experiencing at the beginning of the series. As the series progresses and Matsuri see\u2019s the depth of the relationship that exists between Yuzu and Mei and after seeing the truth of what she was missing Matsuri\u2019s personality gradually starts to change becoming friendlier and more open with her feelings while trying to understand what real friendship is by forming her first real friendships with others. \\n\\n\r\nHimeko \\n\\n\r\nHimeko Momokino voiced by veteran seiyuu Yurika Kobo of Youkoso and Seiren fame is one of the main support characters of the series. A member of an upper-class family on account of her impressive and elegant hairstyle and the shops that she frequents Himeko true to her status is a self-confident, determined and somewhat stubborn person by nature that serves as one of the school\u2019s vice presidents and as a result assists Mei in her duties as student council president. A childhood of Mei Himeko is someone that while arrogant is also someone that believes in rules and order and would often pursue rule breakers with vengeance which is often used for comical effort within the series. While arrogant and confident in herself Himeko is also someone that cares deeply about her friends and can be quite perceptive when it comes to sensing when something is bothering them.\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the series, Himeko had an antagonist like relationship with Yuzu as the latter seemed to enjoy breaking the very same rules that Himeko see\u2019s as important to both the school and herself. As the series goes on and Himeko\u2019s personality is gradually revealed it can be seen that Himeko\u2019s feelings towards Mei go beyond that of what can be considered a simple friendship. In fact, it can be seen that Himeko has a lot of pride in serving as not just Mei\u2019s vice president but also her oldest friend as well something she uses often when she and Yuzu face off. While Yuzu and Himeko remain rivals for Mei\u2019s affections as the series goes on it can be seen that both share the same concern for Mei as each other and indeed when it comes to Mei\u2019s well being it can be seen that both would drop their rivalry to help her when needed something that I felt was nicely done.  \\n\\n\r\nNina \\n\\n\r\nNina Tachibana voiced by Rei Matsuzaki is one of the main support characters of the series and one of Yuzu\u2019s friends that she encounters while on a school excursion to Kyoto. A high school girl from another area Nina is the younger among the Tachibana sisters and very different in attitude to her sister. A kind, caring and intelligent girl Nina unlike her sister has a rather laid-back personality and is the kind of person that will not worry needlessly about things that have already happened. True to her laid-back personality Nina is also someone that is really forgetful as well. Nina\u2019s most prominent trait is without a doubt her tall physical height which I find to be pretty surprising for a high school girl.  Despite Nina\u2019s laid-back personality, it can be seen that Nina has a very deep bond with her sister and is very loyal to her to the point that she\u2019s willing to act as the villain if it means that her sister is able to have happiness. \\n\\n\r\nSara \\n\\n\r\nSara Tachibana voiced by veteran seiyuu Hisako Kanemoto of Food Wars and Gate fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Yuzu\u2019s friends having met and befriended her when they met in Kyoto. A high school girl from another high school Sara is the elder of the Tachibana sisters. A cheerful, positive and considerate person by nature Sara is someone that unlike her sister Nina is someone that prefers to not waste time pondering on something and prefers to strike it out in one-go kinda like a boxer and as a result is also a bold, brave and determined person. While bold and daring Sara is also someone that\u2019s perceptive of others feelings and is the kind of person that will let go of something if it would help others despite the pain that she will feel showing off her good nature. Because of this, however, Sara Is shown to have a dislike for people that give up too easily as she feels that if you don\u2019t go all the way then all you did was take half steps that ended up creating nothing. \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nThe animation for the series I felt was pretty well done with both the school and the uniforms for it being both well designed and detailed. The character designs for the series main characters I felt were also well done and were faithful to the source material to which I'm thankful. Music wise the series OST as well as the opening and ending themes I felt were excellent and did a great job at conveying the different emotions and feelings that each scene featured. Voice acting wise I felt that the main cast did an excellent job of portraying their respective characters. In particular, I felt that Ayana Taketatsu, Minami Tsuda, and Yurika Kubo did a fantastic job of portraying their respective characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nOverall Citrus was an anime that I really enjoyed watching and I felt that its main strong points were its premise, story, characters, animation and voice acting and its unique use of romantic relationships to heal the hole that had formed within someone\u2019s heart. The main premise of the show naturally is the encounter between Yuzu and Mei after Yuzu moves to the city and the subsequent escalating relationship that they forge between them. The decision to make an all-girls school as the series main setting I thought was an interesting move as though increasingly rare in this day and age single gender girls have the ability to create unique environments that can have the effect of both providing an effective place for students to learn and progress but at the same time trap them beneath layers of responsibility. One of the main themes that the story makes use off is that of the relationships that a family can have and the effect that this can have on members of that family. The decision to make use of the stepsister concept an idea unique to parents that have remarried I felt was a move well done as it not only gave the pretence for Yuzu to move to Tokyo to join her mother but also meet her new stepsister Mei as well. While Yuzu and Mei may not have had the best of first encounters watching the two of them try and come to terms with one another\u2019s existence within their lives was interesting as until they met each other each had thought that they were alone within the family. This gradual process of getting used to being sisters contrasted well with the romantic aspect of the show. The romantic aspect of the show I felt also did a great job at making use of this theme of family as while developing feelings for each other Yuzu and Mei also in the process started to explore the many wishes, desires and restrictions and responsibilities that lay within them that stopped them from achieving the things that they desire. This exchange of feelings as with everything is two sides of the same coin and just as Mei is able to see the hesitation that lay within Yuzu she too is able to see the many problems that Mei hides within her heart problems caused by both a carefree father and an overbearing grandfather that when combined with the school almost suffocates Mei in responsibility and trapping her real feelings in a place where few can reach. The desire of Yuzu to both understand and open up Mei\u2019s closed off heart and expose her true feelings I thought was a great use of the family theme as it provided the perfect key to open up Mei\u2019s closed off heart and provide her with the very thing that she was missing in her life which was that of family warmth. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Citrus was an interesting anime that made use of an interesting premise and a unique way of forging a romantic relationship that can be used to open someone\u2019s closed off heart while simultaneously reminding us that while society can be a harsh place trying to take too much responsibility by yourself and not letting others see your true feelings can be a bad thing. Sometimes its worth it to maybe stop one day and have one long talk with someone that you trust and not hide them anymore. In terms of final score, I think Citrus certainly deserves a score of 10/10. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Garbage. \r\nFrom a director who brought us such great hits as, Creepy Rape Hentai, and the abysmal, So, I Can't Play H!, comes an adaptation of the manga Citrus. (He also did Spice and Wolf). \r\nCitrus tells the story of Yuzu Aihara who starts attending an all girls school. There she meets Mei, a girl who is the complete opposite of her. While Yuzu is a fun, impulsive person, Mei is humorless and takes everything serious. Yuzu returns home one day to find that Mei is in her house. Her mom has gotten remarried and forgot to mention that Yuzu now has a stepsister, asyou do, and that sister turns out to be Mei! Wacky hijinks ensue, like sexual assault. Not just any sexual assault though! Lesbian sexual assault. \\n\\n\r\nMei gets on top of Yuzu and kisses her against her will. This is a massive problem for obvious reasons. The relationship between these two characters is rapey for a lot of the series. They often touch each other without the other one being comfortable with it. These two fail to communicate. They both make assumptions about each other and never just ask the other what it is they are thinking or want. They share a bed, it should be easy to start a conversation before licking one another. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue, OMFG the dialogue, kill me now. \"What did the kiss mean?\" asks Yuzu. You were sexually assaulted, that's what it means.\\n\r\n\"How does Mei feel?\" ASK HER. For the love of God your problems have such simple solutions, you privileged fucker. Also there is a line where Yuzu says something like \"its not exactly normal for two girls to be kissing each other\". Maybe that's a bad translation, but if not, come on Yuzu, it's 2018, we don't think that no more.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the dialogue is some of the worst of this season I did find myself liking Yuzu. She isn't a bad person and is trying hard to make things work between her and Mei. Mei on the other hand is a massive bitch. Like your mom, but more attractive and lesbiany. She is selfish and repeatedly hurts Yuzu, while Yuzu is doing her best to help her. She spends most of her time irritated. She isn't a fun character to spend time with. She's still better than the bland supporting cast though. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters purpose is to make things complicated between Yuzu and Mei. They have no believable motives, I hate hate hate hate them. The plots involving them is so incredibly predictable too. You know whats going to happen from the moment they are introduced. There is one good side character though, Harumin, who is a good friend to Yuzu and is kind-hearted. It's a shame that the anime doesn't contain more scenes with Yuzu and Harumin just hanging out, it would help distract from the shitshow of a romance going on. \\n\\n\r\nThis review has been rather negative so I'll write some more nice things. The animation is good and.......\\n\\n\r\nSo anyway, would I recommend Citrus? No. \\n\r\nOverall Citrus fails at what it sets out to do. It is a romance anime that starts with sexual assault and only gets marginally better as it goes on. There are some enjoyable moments and it is far from the worst anime ever made.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed Citrus or want a fun lesbian anime then I recommend Revolutionary Girl Utena: The Adolescence of Utena. If you want a more serious anime that has LGBT characters then Wandering Son is quite good. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review. If you think I'm wrong about something or have an opinion you'd like to share then feel free to keep it to yourself.\\n\r\nReminder to love yourself and make sure you live the life that makes you happy. <3\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "MAJOR SPOILER\r\nAlright this is a serious review and my first review, but let me say I have read the manga before. Another thing is I don't review this like an idiot who thinks after reading Beserk, Stein, Monster, FMA:B, or any other \"masterpieces\" that they have the philosophers hammer and the alchemist stone. I also rate mostly on enjoyment primarily. All right lets begin. \r\nAct 1; The Story:8\r\nThe story accomplishes what it set out to do, and that is a dramatic story about two lesbian lover who are now sisters. Now let me say this, don't expect this to be a masterpiece in termsof story, pacing, and execution. (Though it's my personal masterpiece) Ep1 spoilers only. The story begins with Yuzu talking to her friends on how she want's a boyfriend. Her luck was awful, as she went to an all girls school. At the entrance she meets Mei, a rather calm and beautiful girl, as she has violated school regulation. She then sifts Yuzu to get her phone and tell her to wash the makeup off. She then encounters another girl who had the same troubles of the school regulation, Harumin. Harumin basically tells her why the students are rather dull and how they were sheltered. They become friends as they are both alike. She then has her first conflict as she sees Mei kissing the same teacher. When she tried to get away, they notice she was nearby from her clumsy mistake. She runs. She then returns home only to be shocked that Mei, the same girl, was her new sister. She seems rather stunned and uneasy on Mei. From there she bugged her until she brought up the incident and asked how can she kiss if she is not genuinely in love and is only doing it for the thrill. This is where I'll end it here as I might get this review taken down for play-by-play and if i spoiled the first major plot point. The show does the drama right, most of the tension is explainable and the execution is generally done well.  The grimes with it's a little fast pace at times, but everything is well done and In My Opinion, great. Though the story is about same sex love, and if your against that then don't watch. As for the yuri scenes, they are mostly explained why it happens, so to put it off as fan service is definitely wrong.\\n\\n\r\nAct 2; Animation and Soundtrack: 7.6\\n\r\nThe animation for the show is Amazing, but some of the original art work from the manga is not shown at the same time. One of the many good things about the manga is the artwork and the anime has shown to reflect that but at the same time have a modern take on the show's artwork. Now more on about the errors in the animation, there are scenes that look wonky. Though the animation has gotten better, there is still scenes that look messed up still, but it was less apparent with it's improvement. The ost fits the show well and are mostly, music to my ears. The VA's have done their part greatly and for their dub counterpart(Dub isn't my favorite thong to listen) they have seem to do justice for dubbers. The op and ed are another thing that I have to give praise to as they really fit the show.\\n\\n\r\nAct 3; Character: 8.3\\n\r\nMost of the characters are really fun and interesting. No character doesn't feel annoying or boring. Personally I like Momokino as her character design and her personality I can definitely enjoy. All the characters have a motivational factor for their actions and their personality are great. Still, there are still some things to push them over for, the characters are great.\\n\\n\r\nAct 4; Enjoyment and Overall: 9 (for enjoyment) 8 (Overall)\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the anime so far as it has been a great adaptation for the series. It really has been my number 3 show for the winter season so far. (#1 is Magus Bride) Overall it gets a 9/10 and my recommendations are Dear My Girl, The Star and The Flower, and Sakura Trick. \\n\\n\r\nFin \\n\r\nSidenote; If you literally reviewed this like a philosopher, then you going about an entertainment media the wrong way.\\n\\n\r\nWhat would you like me to review next, Berserk after 100-200 chapters, Magus Bride, Hajime No Ippo Manga or show, or would you like me to watch your personal favorite show. Comment on my profile and I'll see what are the most popular choice so that I can review it next.",

Typically romance anime's load themselves with misunderstandings but not this show, this show has ascended past such silly tropes. Because this show only can further the plot with sexual assaults. For example Momokino has supposedly been friends with Mei for over 10 years but only decides to do anything sexual with Mei when Yuzu starts being friendly with her. She also goes from being a stuck up bitch to immediately ok with doing that in school grounds. All because her best friendgot a new sister. Wouldn't it only be natural for someone to spend time with someone who just became part of their family. Nope, all logic and reason takes the backseat until we have gotten at least one sexual assault per-episode. Yuri is nice and everything, but that doesn't make it a good anime. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Citrus is a yuri romance manga that started in late 2012 and just recently ended. Although it looks like a second manga called Citrus Plus is planned. I don't know if it's going to follow the same characters nor have I read the manga. Early this year the studio Passione, also behind Rokka no Yuusha, aired a twelve episode adaptation to cover the first part of the story. So, let's see how that went.\u00a0\r\nStory:\r\nAihara Yuzu finds her life turned topsy turvy when her mother suddenly remarries and the pair relocate, forcing her to enter a new school. Things turn awkward immediately when she unknowingly breaksthe rules and finds herself afoul of the young student council president. She returns home for a surprise, she has a new step-sister and it's the same student council president she met earlier, Aihara Mei. To make matters even more awkward, she finds Mei really attractive.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the problems with the series. There are two major ones. The first is that, like Love Stage, it doesn't have a great first impression. I will say, to Citrus's credit, it isn't nearly as bad since the initial encounter between Yuzu & Mei involves a stolen kiss and not attempted rape but it's still not a great way to begin a romance. The big one, however, is more reminiscent of the bad episode from Sasameki Koto. In that episode, we had a young girl act deplorably only to be instantly forgiven with no real consequences and her behaviour was never mentioned again.\\n\\n\r\nCitrus has the same type of thing with a character named Matsuri except her actions are even worse and they span a couple episodes. She's introduced about halfway into the series and decides to try and seduce Yuzu. But first she needs to deal with Mei, which is where the deplorableness comes in. Now, I'm not opposed to having an antagonistic character who's absolutely atrocious as a person but the problem here, and in the aforementioned Sasameki Koto, is that they try to treat the characters as sympathetic. And that doesn't work when you have characters act this horribly. Not without a lot of time and effort put into redeeming them. Which neither series does. Their plots end and they basically say they're sorry and get told not to do it again and that's it.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the positives, I'll give Citrus credit for having romantic content between siblings in a way that's only mildly sleazy, and that's entirely based on the stolen kisses early on. Because it makes sense for two high school kids who are suddenly tossed together as step-siblings to still be attracted to one another. The series also does feature some strong scenes. Some of them are quite funny, and usually involve Yuzu making an ass of herself. While others have a bit of an awkward tension betwixt Mei & Yuzu with enough positivity to make them kind of sweet little moments. The best part, by far, is the whole arc with the twin sisters, Sara & Nina. Those three episodes are where the series gets elevated to fantastic. It's funny because it goes from the low point of the series, with Matsuri the sociopath, to the high point with the twins and it's kind of hard to believe these were written by the same person.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI've already covered the basics of what's wrong with Matsuri's character and the handling thereof. Needless to say, she's the worst character in the series by a wide margin. As for the other characters, there are aspects of Yuzu, Mei and their budding relationship I really like. The awkwardness has verisimilitude. Yuzu's conflicting feelings of wanting to be a good sister but also being greatly attracted to her new step-sister is compelling. Mei's desire to be needed and her drive for exceptionalism versus her uncertainty over how to proceed is also good stuff. But then there's the way things are initiated betwixt them and the way it gives a poor first impression. Harumi is a fun character. Sara is a sweetheart. I also really like what little we get of Mei's relationship with her wandering father. So, quite a strong cast with one very notable exception.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt:\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nHere's one area where I have to give Passione a lot of credit, their artwork is really great. The characters are well drawn. The backgrounds and various world objects look good. The animation flows smoothly. It is a good looking series.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSound:\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nOur main heroines are voiced by Taketatsu Ayana & Tsuda Minami, two strong actresses who deliver fantastic performances. We've also got Kubo Yurika, Kanemoto Hisako, Fuji Yukiyo, Matsuzaki Rei and some others who are really good at what they do. Even Izawa Shiori, voice of the worst part of the series, doesn't perform badly. She just got stuck with a shit character. Takahashi Ryo put together a strong soundtrack for the series.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the obvious budding relationship betwixt Yuzu & Mei, Mei's childhood friend blatantly has feelings for her. Yuzu has some kind of flirtatious moments with Harumi but a lot of that is Harumi teasing Yuzu after seeing her yuri manga. Sara's whole arc revolves around her developing a crush on Mei who she refers to as \"her destiny.\" In short, this is one of those series where the only important straight character seems to be Yuzu's mum. And I wouldn't exactly be surprised if the latter part of the manga introduces her female \"friend\" who seems to always visit while her husband's away. Which he always is.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of things to like about this series. The last arc especially. Unfortunately, it's really weakened by those three episodes heavily featuring Matsuri & by having the relationship begin in a poor way. Would I watch a second series? Well, yes. This may well be like Sasameki Koto\u00a0where the manga gets past the point that made up the seventh episode of the anime and it just stays consistently fantastic afterwards. In which case, the bad part's out of the way. But, by the same token, this isn't a good yuri series thus far. It manages to average out to being decent but there are plenty of better ones out there. I'll give the first series a 6/10. If they do come out with a second one I'll give it a go but I'm not really going to go out of my way to go through the manga or anything like that.\u00a0",

            "content": "Yuzu, which is the name of main protagonist, means a type of citrus fruit in Asia (for all of you wondering what the title means. \r\nStory (5/10): You probably should know that Citrus follows a girl to girl relationship. If that bothers you, fine you can skip and miss out on a romance that many current animes have forgotten. Yuzu, the gal-looking one, gets enrolled in an all-girl high school. Breaking the rules on the first day, she meets the student council president, Mei, who not only turns out to be the school chair's granddaughter and her newly adoptive younger sister. From here, Citrus presentswatchers with two main developments: Yuzu's shift from delinquent to an older sister and Mei's dealing with family problems. To avoid spoilers, let me just say that while there is touching, it is not forced and is much more rooted in innocence and stress. Learning about these characters as the story progresses is not entirely mind-blowing, especially in a high school setting, but it does it and does it well enough. Good. But its not. The last few episodes threw this out and were QUITE disappointing. I am not going to spoil anything but be prepared (5/10).\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): I am not really sure how to explain this catergory. I guess the character designs look good and noticable. What actually makes them great is that they are noticable and not flashy (no yellow hair and orange jump suit, just black/brown ish hair) The background is pretty to look at. Some of the art drops in quality for moments (particularly the eyes) and it takes away from the experience a little, but overall great.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10): I love both the opening and ending themes. 10/10. The series does not really utilize sound, so I have to give this catergory (while reluctantly) a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10): Yuzu just has this rare charisma to her that she is very easy to root for. Her relationship with Mei translates as genuine and with good intent. So far, I enjoy watching her on the screen very much. Mei is OKAY, but I admit that there are some good use of subtle detail. The rest of the cast, however, is generic... well accept 1 who I will not talk about for spoilers :). My favorite part about these characters is that they feel human. Everyone is flawed, and everyone is genuine. Well done for making me care Citrus. The two white haired girls on the cover and opening, however, are pretty unenjoyable. These two additional characters kind of ruined this show for me. If this anime was 10 episodes, I would be more satisfied. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: Go watch Citrus. I think it beats Darling in the Franxx in terms of romance and characters, but you know that's just my opinion. Citrus is good, but its not even close to very good; just watch it to enjoy and don't let the yuri bother you.\\n",

            "content": "Previously on LA's anime reviews, specifically Netsuzou TRap review...\r\n\"Let's just hope Citrus does better...\"\r\nLA's prayers has been answered!\r\nCitrus was a really hyped anime of Winter 2018 for LA but as much as LA has it's problems and ohh boy there are and we'll get to it soon but LA does look beyond this to see one of the better melodrama yuri anime of Winter 2018 and a strong contender for LA's guiltiest pleasure anime.\r\nOk so the major problems with Citrus is quite obvious from the first episode alone and we'll get to right now, Mei Aihara voiced by Minami Tsuda, sexually assaulting Yuzu Aihara voicedby Ayana Taketatsu. This is played up for melodrama and sparked the step-sister yuri relationship because Mei came onto Yuzu. The implications are there but LA can't defend this besides bringing up the catalyst to the entire relationship Citrus is built upon AND we get to know Mei for her not-so pure stoic personality. The next problem is the obvious love rivals our main yuri couple goes through TIME AND AGAIN, from Mei's friend and vice president of the Student Council Himeko Momokino voiced by Yurika Kubo a rival to Yuzu, Matsuri Mizusawa voiced by Shiori Izawa, Yuzu's childhood friend who's less than pure and rebelliously anti-social thus is Mei's rival AND finally Sara Tachibana voiced by Hisako Kanemoto who's in love with Mei (as a love at first sight deal) with Sara's twin sister Nina voiced by Rei Matsuzaki wanting to support her thus both become a rival to Yuzu. Mei and Yuzu goes through soo many love rivals both with their \"factions\" wanting Mei or Yuzu respectively and causing even more melodrama with Matsuri being the worst offender in all this, let's not even get to the fact that Mei's side of the extended family thinks nothing of Yuzu's family that causes LOTS more melodrama. Mei Aihara is also a huge problem to the plot itself, she being anti-social straight-headed and not \"getting social\" cues if her assaulting Yuzu by the first episode is any indication that she's not exactly emotionally accepting, she herself becomes her own obstacle throughout her relationship with Yuzu through the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, so as much bitching about Citrus LA said about it, LA will now start defending LA's flaw points now.\\n\\n\r\nSo the entire sexually assaulting thing, well by intents and purpose LA sees this lazy writing but it does at least shows Mei as an emotionally stunted individual who really doesn't know about love or can't portray it besides sexually as that's all she really knew before meeting Yuzu due to her own personal and family problems dealt to her does make her rather relatable, LA isn't necessarily saying that just because she's relatable now means Mei is a good character but LA does see more than that besides \"sexually assaulting step-sister\". Now the melodrama surrounding the majority of anime from the rival love interests to family coming in to try and stop or split up their relationship, well for rival love interest though this element comes up ALOT in the anime, LA does see what it meant to do, make either Mei and Yuzu develop together be it individually or through their relationship to get to know them a bit better in that respect to show that Mei and Yuzu love each other but they just can't spill it, now having the rivals used MANY times does get repetitive just under differing circumstances but nonetheless the intent and purpose is there and works for the most part to improve our main yuri duo. Now the family issues are also played up as melodrama but this can also be defend using the above. Well the problem with Mei sticks for a while but LA will defend her a bit by saying that she DOES develop with all the rivals and family issues that pops up and again though she remains emotionally stunted throughout the anime, there are little moments where she does try to open up to Mei.\\n\\n\r\nYuzu was LA's favourite character of Winter 2018, LA just can't explain, ohh wait, no it's because she's usually the more intentionally charming and helpful of the entire cast but struggles with her love life and when Mei arrives it just changes her and ALSO tries to help save her, where Yuzu herself soon finds herself if her love for Mei is true or not. This isn't helped by her voice actor Ayana Taketatsu where she herself has been really notable this Winter 2018. Harumi Taniguchi voiced by Yukiyo Fujii was also VERY likable being Yuzu's best friend and she helps Yuzu out like a best friend does to the point LA wouldn't mind a Yuzu x Harumi all things considered if Yuzu x Mei doesn't work out. *ahem* by all intent, LA can really see Yuzu and Mei's relationship bloom through their HEAVY list of trials and tribulations, some out of left field but mostly coincidental. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Passione, the character designs are VERY polished and extremely striking for the most part, not to mention the various outfits many of the characters goes through. The \"yuri\" moments are short and simple but the animation doens't skimp on the details (the only problem being Yuzu and Mei themselves), the backgrounding was decent enough but not really noteworthy, but nonetheless from all this, LA will say that the character designs are the best thing from the animation department and this is probably the first \"good trashy\" anime with decent animation behind it LA has seen.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on speaking of those \"yuri\" moments, yes Citrus does have some *ahem* titillating moments but the furthest it goes is skinship with kissing shown more often than not (and LA doesn't mean the kissing is shown by Mei & Yuzu, it goes to the other characters as well). You'd think LA would be disappointed by this however the implications and some titillation IS there, it's just masked ALOT of the time by the melodrama that ensues earlier or later before the fanservice that DOES detriment the scene but still the intent is there.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, well this anime ALSO has a plethora of idol-esque voice actors backing up this anime cast and uhh did the ADR Director do it intentionally with Love Live and iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls alumni known for their yuri fanbase like having Ayana Taketatsu (which felt like another meta-joke at Ayana herself but this time she's the OLDER sister), Minami Tsuda, Yurika Kubo and Rei Matsuzaki. Add in Hisako Kanemoto as Nayuta Kani from last season's Imouto sae Ireba Ii and it felt like the ADR were in on the joke. Yeah Ayana Taketatsu easily gets best voice actor from LA, NO DOUBT. But LA would like to give a rather surprising voice actor credit to Minami Tsuda in portraying the emotionally stunted Mei.\\n\\n\r\nCitrus has been said to be too melodramatic and not at all yuri, but LA begs to differ as MANY yuri/shoujo ai animes like Yuri Kuma Arashi, Kuttsukiboshi, Sakura Trick and hell LA will give SOME credit to Netsuzou TRap that melodrama helps move the plot and the relationship across it's just HOW they do it and Citrus does it pretty much the same. LA gets that some of the audience would want more \"yuri\" moments than \"melodrama\" but be it slice of life or romance or drama genre. \"Yuri\" and \"melodrama\" for LA is synonymous with one another to one get to know the main characters through their trials and tribulations through a forbidden love and two, without the melodrama the main protagonists relationship would have NEVER grown and finally, no melodrama means no story...coincidental or not. \\n\\n\r\nCitrus is LA's second guiltiest pleasure anime for Winter 2018 (ohh there's a guilty pleasure anime LA found much more guiltier than this), but going by yuri/shoujo ai standards and it not being yuri trash, then yes as much as Citrus HAS ALOT of flaws from the repetitive rivals and family issues melodrama shown and less yuri moments to the main characters of Mei and Yuzu going through their own relationship issues with each other BUT LA can see beyond that to see a very good trashy yuri/shoujo ai anime with those trials and tribulations only growing the main relationship, a likable main protagonist of Yuzu and some interesting characters like Harumi and some good rivals to Mei and Yuzu to test their relationship like Himeko and Sara. Some people see it as melodramatic trash, LA sees it as good yuri trash and better yet, this is one of LA's hyped anime of Winter 2018 that actually followed through with flaws and all.",

            "content": "Citrus is another one of those school shows that go out in mass every season, is the adaptation of a relatively recent manga that is being posted until today, do not expect the anime to have a closed end or even a second season, the anime has nothing beyond being a HOMOSEXUAL ROMANCE, and this is also becoming something more common in fiction. If the show is so normal and mundane, why should I care?\r\nThe answer is simple, you should not.\r\nThis anime has a story that feels forced on several times and that no one would see for itself, what people really want here isthe yuri sexualization, the Fanservice scenes and the cheap drama, \"What's the matter with that?\" You must be wondering, and quite simply, works of fiction should NOT be categorized as better or worse depending on the general taste, this does not work, and that is also why the qualification system of that site also does not work to measure the quality of a series .\\n\\n\r\nArt in general was made to serve as a luxury, a differential, since ancient times they made magnificent sculptures and paintings and full of detail that only served to be placed in a corner to adorn a palace, was extremely difficult to enter the world of arts and have a recognized name. You know why? It is because people of the time not only had passion for what they did but also struggled to do a job that they could be proud to show to people.\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you like this show, I want you to answer the following question:\\n\\n\r\nWould you show this show to any of your relatives?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer is no, and you do not have to feel guilty about it, not even the staff or maybe the creator of the manga would have the courage to show it to the family, that's because they're not writing to people, they're writing it for them , they like to watch cute little girls kissing, and consequently, the mentality of the people who attend these shows is the same, no matter if the show needs effort or little effort to be done, what matters are the things that attract the viewer to see it, what people want is not what people need.\\n\\n\r\nIf the anime script was good by itself, I would not have much of a problem with FanService or crap like that, but that's not the case, this is an anime that is built around these moments and not an anime that has those moments, and this is not hard to notice if you pay attention to the show. Why did the mother forget such an important detail as telling the protagonist that she would have a sister? Why of all the possible people in school did her sister have to be just what she saw kissing the teacher? Why did the black-haired girl not stay at her grandfather's house instead of going to the protagonist's house? Why did the black-haired girl not ask the protagonist to deliver the cell phone to her instead of taking her strength from her pocket? How did the director not know about your new granddaughter? Was not he curious to see her or at least ask for a photo?\\n\\n\r\nThese are doubts that went through my mind during the anime, the answer to them is very simple, it is because the anime needs the hottest moments to get people's attention easily, like most anime this season, but it happens that the construction of these moments does not even make sense or depend on various conveniences, I even believe that some conveniences are important for some works, but in this case they are only there because we need the moments that are the consequence of these.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does not know to be realistic, although the world-building of the series always indicate that this is a normal thing that happens in our world, it does not follow the logic nor the complexity of our world, the characters are empty, the protagonist is the stereotype of Gal, the black haired girl is a serious student who often serves the stereotype of kuudere, the protagonist's friend is only there to be gentle, other characters do not matter or act in the stereotypical way in which they should act (as well as the director and the evil teacher who serves as a plot-device), they are not complex characters and rarely will you see them in a list of favorites.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I wanted to emphasize in the inaturality of the anime is its romance. Is it serious that a Gal girl becomes a lesbian so quickly just because of a love at first sight or something? This CAN happen in real life, but in a work of fiction this is just a forced and cheap excuse for the script to continue and you do not have to write a more complex script about love and its consequences, works of fiction are not to be \"\"realistic\"\", they should be made to perceive the author's effort in the marvel work of his, just as in the past.\\n\\n\r\neverything in this show is as easy and simple to write as possible, people probably know this, people will not come here looking for a great story with an impressive development or nothing like that, people will give in to their fetishes and will see FanService of two girls loving each other, not because it's good, but because that's what they want, this is the biggest mistake of this anime and many others, the reality will only stop being that way if people start to change their way of thinking and demanding more of the media they themselves consume. Good evening.\\n",

            "content": "Citrus is a series that is tragically misunderstood; a story with far more substance and depth than word of mouth would lead you to believe. Not long after this show started airing, it\u2019s become easy for people to write off any element in the story as a means to arbitrarily wring out some voyeuristic lesbian action, rather than stopping to think of the purpose it actually holds for the narrative. When a sexual assault occurs, viewers assume that it\u2019s romanticizing such an action and therefore condones it. When an emotional barrier props up, it\u2019s assumed to be nothing more than a way of piling onmore drama. These premature assessments are commonly made when shows like this are perceived as simple fetish material, framed as horribly misplaced criticisms that leave Citrus in an undeservedly contemptuous light; as a guilty pleasure unworthy of further analysis or appraisal. Citrus is not mere fetish material, does not promote or romanticize sexual assault, and provides layered and well-developed characters whose actions are realistically influenced by both internal and external conflicts. A bittersweet feeling perpetuates as we follow naive teenagers consistently characterized as those who are lost and confused, behaving in ways that are less than ideal, but are hurdles along the way of a gripping and emotionally compelling tale that is certainly rough around the edges, but well worth the ride.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a common conjecture about Citrus saying that it treats sexual assault as a form of love and the blossoming romance is in the form of Stockholm syndrome, and both these things are wholly untrue. Firstly, while the actions of Mei Aihara undeniably walk on the borderline of sexual assault, none of these instances are framed as romantic or mutual in any way. The first of these depicts Yuzu struggling while Mei lashes out her aggression. Following this is a low shot with Mei, spitefully uttering \u201cthat\u2019s what it felt like\u201d in response to Yuzu\u2019s innocent curiosity about Mei\u2019s romantic affair. Nothing about this is painted in a positive, approving light. Subsequent events like this are blatantly shown to be a byproduct of Mei\u2019s misconception of how relationships work, or a means to vent her frustration. The sheer discomfort is emphasized through both the cinematography and the expressions of the characters involved. This does not mean nefarious actions like these are excused, as the story never does. Yuzu always retaliates to these actions once she regains control over herself during these events. Depiction and endorsement are not the same thing, a fact that should always be considered with regards to a story like this. Another thing to address is this: the assaults are by no means the foundation of the leads\u2019 romance, and that is a myth that should have passed long after this show had aired. Yuzu develops feelings for Mei long before the first assault occurs, which is most evident during the scene where she is lost in thought about witnessing Mei being kissed by Amamiya. Her focus is squarely on Mei\u2019s behavior and what kissing must feel like for her, with Yuzu\u2019s own attraction to Mei not even apparent to her. Overall, when proper attention is brought to the characters\u2019 actions as well as the framing, it becomes clear that the criticism of Citrus romanticizing assault holds no truth whatsoever. To see so much criticism founded on this misinformation is disheartening to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nCitrus and its content is highly reliant on context and characterization. Just as these confused adolescents struggle to understand each other and themselves, wondering who and what to believe, viewers are left on their own to base judgement on characters\u2019 behavior and what they say, save for some frequent monologuing by Yuzu. And even then, her own thoughts aren\u2019t always reliable. Content that comes off as questionable or discomforting to certain viewers is perfectly explainable through indirect characterization, a method of storytelling that challenges the brain beyond just relying on narration and monologues to provide answers without viewer effort. Viewers share frustration and confusion with the characters themselves, and the payoff is all the more rewarding because of this. The character Mei Aihara exemplifies this most of all, as she is a person whose subtle mannerisms bring light to a personality misshapen by the worst of circumstances, and very applicable to reality.\\n\\n\r\nMei is a character with practically no conception of right and wrong, let alone the idea of consent, and has never been shown, or had any experience of, what a true romantic relationship is like. The only proper relationship she has ever had in life was with her father. After he left, Mei felt as if she was being abandoned by the only one she was ever truly close to. It\u2019s clear that prior to where the main story begins, Mei has had no emotional support ever since her father\u2019s absence. She is used and neglected by her grandfather, is constantly taken advantage of by her fianc\u00e9e, and is under perpetual social pressure to follow her duties accordingly for days on end. \\n\\n\r\nAs a result, Mei\u2019s attitude towards romantic and sexual relationships is completely distorted. Her one and only understanding of love relationships is through physical contact, of which she uses to control people just as she has been controlled herself. This is symptomatic of being in a sexually abusive relationship like she had with her first fianc\u00e9e; she doesn\u2019t value her own body and is incapable of interacting with people normally. In many situations, whether it's a love relationship or otherwise, Mei passively accepts everything that is piled on her with no concern for her own well being, a trait that is consistently apparent over the course of the story. On the other end, her way of taking control of situations is her sexual advances towards Yuzu, who understandably objects to these actions. The main point is that Mei only acts in the way she knows how. This conflict of hers isn\u2019t a singular matter, but numerous elements about her past and how she was raised which come together creating the version of Mei we see throughout the story. Mei is depraved, misguided, and some could even say mentally ill. And again, none of these elements are used to justify Mei's behavior. It's merely a case of cause and effect, one which leaves morality out of the question entirely.\\n\\n\r\nBeing so used to her strict upbringing, Mei frames every scenario as a bargain or exchange rather than a desire, even if she doesn't necessarily intend it. Her feeling obligated to follow in the footsteps of her father to gain his affection encapsulates this quite well. Having received no unconditional love since her father\u2019s disappearance, this is the way of thinking which governs almost all of the decisions she makes. For this reason, she\u2019s perplexed as to why Yuzu bothers to do all these unconditional favors. The answer to this is simple: Yuzu cares about Mei. Unconditional love is a foreign concept to Mei, and this trait continues to subconsciously affect her even long after she has experienced the true virtues of a love relationship. (*cue the beginning of episode 10*)\\n\\n\r\nThe psychology of Mei is one of the main things which the story lives through, and is one of Citrus' most fascinating aspects. As frustrating as her actions can be at times, the consistency of her character and the relatability of her plight makes her highly sympathetic, and as such Yuzu\u2019s efforts to make things right for her, however reckless and brash, are very admirable. When you consider everything I've previously stated, it turns out that Mei has every reason to act and behave the way she does. Her attitude and behavior are both realistic and morbidly consistent when acknowledging this perpetual turmoil she lives through.\\n\\n\r\nMei\u2019s problematic, manipulative behavior is not only addressed as such, but is also a conflict in itself. Discomforting scenes that people insist to be mere sleaze and titillation always leaves a negative effect on characters involved. Mei\u2019s first assault turned Yuzu\u2019s pending lust for and curiosity of Mei into a maelstrom of confusion and hysteria. Repetition of these acts behind the scenes gave us Mei Aihara as we know her. A certain character who does this to another results in the victim avoiding that character extensively.\\n\\n\r\nThe way Mei gradually becomes more open to Yuzu about her feelings and personal issues, is a cathartic and satisfying affair in and of itself, and it\u2019s kept at natural pace throughout.  What\u2019s truly commendable, however, is how many instances of her development are deliberately presented for us to infer on our own, rather than being told directly and explicitly. Here\u2019s one particular example of this:\\n\\n\\n\r\n**SPOILERS FOR EPISODE 7 AND 8 BEGIN HERE**\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\nThe moment Mei truly develops romantic feelings for Yuzu is at the end of episode 6, and the exact moment she realizes these feelings is episode 7 when Matsuri forcibly kisses Yuzu out in the open. This is all indicated through her sudden change in behavior compared to before. She is now less grim in her expressions around Yuzu, and looks slightly more sentimental. Her actions convey this even further, such as the way she compliments Yuzu for the meal that was made. The day after that, Matsuri is shown to be envious of Mei continually deriving attention from Yuzu at the expense of Matsuri\u2019s, causing her to shove off. This causes Mei to feel guilty, having created distance between Yuzu and one of her closest friends. This is where she first experiences the baggage that comes from being in love.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n**SPOILERS END HERE**\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe reason this works in service to the narrative is so viewers are put into the perspective of Yuzu herself. She struggles to understand Mei, using signs in her behavior to understand what she feels. Mei is deliberately presented just as enigmatically as she is to everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nWith so much about Mei already covered, it\u2019s only fair that the other heroine, Yuzu, is given the same treatment. Yuzu at the start has an idealistic view of the life that lies before her. She acts with unrelenting confidence in almost all occasions, expecting everything to go smoothly and perfectly in line with what she envisions. I think I speak for most people when I say that when we were young teenagers, our ways of thinking were hardly any different. We\u2019ve had strong ambitions of our own, believing we could achieve them all without entirely knowing the reality of certain situations. Of course, like most teenagers, the decisions that Yuzu makes are not always wise. Quite rarely so, in fact. She often does things, with or without good intentions, unperturbed by any potential consequences they could raise. Her greeting with the chairman is a particularly good example of this. Having become a new addition to his family, she approaches him expecting to be welcomed with open arms. Instead she\u2019s scolded for her meddlesome behavior and unruly fashion choices.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, one of the primary things on her mind after learning about her mother\u2019s remarriage is how much wealth and privilege she has attained, even shamelessly announcing her status to the whole academy through a mic. By the time her feelings for Mei are fully realized, her infatuation with her new status as the chairman\u2019s granddaughter seems to have disappeared without a trace. Her pursuit has entirely moved on from material gain to the well being of Mei. This signifies growth of her character, but is also a mark of good character writing. The sudden absence of this character trait tells us simply and immediately that Yuzu has matured and come to terms with what actually matters.\\n\\n\r\nAs for her relationship with Mei, Yuzu is on a constant struggle to comprehend her feelings. She knows that something is amiss about Mei, invoking a feeling of concern. At other times, she wonders if what she does hurts Mei more than it helps. This confusion is a result of their inability to communicate with each other effectively and coherently, mimicking typical romance between teenagers more than people seem to realize. Yuzu doesn\u2019t understand Mei, and by extension doesn\u2019t know how to act around her. The two of them had been raised in completely different conditions, and thus operate and communicate differently from one another.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s obvious that Yuzu has an unfaltering love for Mei, but one obstacle she must overcome is resisting the urge to give in to her superficial desires, and pursuing what is realistically best for Mei in the long run. At one point her only choice is to put her love for Mei aside and to treat her as a sister. Although she does all these things selflessly she still has a degree of self-preservation, in stark contrast to Mei. What Citrus does well is distinguishing the superficial aspects of love from the emotional aspects. Crushes aren\u2019t developed through logic, and our own real life experiences prove as much. What this series explores is the multitude of consequences that come with loving someone. In this case, it\u2019s dealing with the complications of being in a love relationship with your step-sister.\\n\\n\r\nDifferentiating perceptions of love are what pervade a majority of the cast in Citrus. The students at Aihara Academy all knowingly grew up in an environment where sexual experimentation is a normality. Of course I can\u2019t speak from experience, but to my knowledge this mimics reality in Japan. Referred to as Class S, it\u2019s common for girls in school to have crushes on other female classmates, forming bonds with them. These bonds could be described as romantic, but the sexual aspect of the attraction is out of the equation entirely, assuming they\u2019re straight. It\u2019s telling that a Japanese audience would have a far better understanding of this kind of story, and the positive reception of Citrus in Japan compared to the west is evidence of this.\\n\\n\r\nHarumin really emulates this concept more than the others. She is essentially a direct foil to Yuzu in how sexual relationships are perceived. For Harumin, particular actions between couples are a source of curiosity. By contrast, Yuzu thinks about what these actions mean for the relationship. The most obvious example is arguably when the two eavesdrop on Amamiya\u2019s phone call. However, one other particular moment drives this home more than any other. Harumin discovers the yuri incest manga Yuzu was reading. Fascinated, she puts herself in a scissoring position with Yuzu. She\u2019s so confident in her heterosexuality that doing this means nothing to her. Yuzu on the other hand recognizes this as an expression of love, and thus is highly discomforted by this scenario. This is largely presented as a comedy moment, but it does a lot to signify the differences in their characterization. It also benefits in a way from being depicted in such an over-the-top manner.\\n\\n\r\nHarumin acts as a companion to Yuzu all the way through to the end, but in reality she isn\u2019t able to truly understand what Yuzu is going through, regardless of how much she thinks she does. This is also the reason Yuzu decides to take on these tasks by herself, because she\u2019s the only one who truly understands. We can also assume that she keeps it to herself in fear that Harumin wouldn\u2019t accept her for being in such a taboo relationship. After all, this is why she keeps it a secret to Matsuri and anyone else outside the school campus.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from the characters, I bear no hesitation saying that the plot of Citrus is undoubtedly its weakest aspect. Although the events it strings together can catch viewers off-guard, maintaining a dash of unpredictability in the whole adventure, it all too often relies on contrivances. Coincidences in fictional stories aren\u2019t inherently a bad thing. The reason I can accept the reveal of Mei as Yuzu\u2019s new sister is because it\u2019s so early in the story. In fact, it\u2019s arguably made better for the fact that it\u2019s coincidental, as it comes as a shock to both the audience and Yuzu herself. However, the numerous contrivances beyond this point become harder and harder to swallow as they come by. The way that some situations are arbitrarily resolved through circumstance, rather than on behalf of a character, doesn\u2019t do the plot much favors either.\\n\\n\r\nEach story arc in Citrus presents a barrier in Mei\u2019s psyche which is resolved with every passing conclusion. Every resolve is satisfying in its own right as it brings Mei further out of her shell whilst bringing her and Yuzu closer together. It\u2019s apparent that new characters are introduced to fill a certain role in these affairs, but the focus on Yuzu and Mei is unrelenting and the characters serve their purpose quite well. To start with, Himeko \"Twindrills\" Momokino at first appears to be quite the villain, but she actually shares traits with both Yuzu and Mei, and even has strikingly similar motivations. Like Yuzu, she has an unfaltering love for Mei, arguably in a \u201cromantic friendship\u201d sort of way as opposed to sexual attraction, and goes to great lengths to claim her affection. Like Mei, she is both dedicated to her job and remarkably strict with school regulations. Her intentions are what make her a rival to Yuzu, and then later bring them to a resolve. They wish the best for Mei, but are oblivious to her true feelings. Matsuri is a character acting as a parallel to Mei. Only instead of closing herself off, she seeks attention. In the worst ways. Her rebellious nature and sinister antics make her a worthy addition to the cast. It\u2019s not done just for the sake of it though. It\u2019s a situation where Mei sees her own self and is willing to make amends for someone Yuzu is close to.\\n\\n\r\nThe arc with the Tachibana sisters is considered by many to be the weakest arc in the series, and I am no exception. While it serves its purpose well and the payoff is rewarding, it isn\u2019t put together nearly as well as the others. I think what it sets out to do doesn\u2019t warrant new characters to be introduced into the middle of the whole dilemma where their intrusion can be seen as more frustrating than serviceable, especially when those characters lack depth. The situation between Mei and Yuzu at this point is already complicated as it is, so piling more characters on top of these complications is more of an annoyance than anything else. I think other less irritating methods would have served the function of this arc quite well without having to bring the sisters into the mix. It also doesn\u2019t help that in this arc, conveniences pile up even more than in any other, even attempting to sidestep this with \u201cfate\u201d and \u201cdestiny.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before though, the payoff is largely worth it in the end. It\u2019s not necessarily a case where the abundant problems in this arc can be forgotten, but rather forgiven. This arc is an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise great story overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue of Citrus is also worth commenting on. It\u2019s no Shakespearean writing, but it feels natural and works in service to whatever is going on. The characters\u2019 lines are filled with personality and subtext which makes conversations feel alive. Characters are also quick to point out irony in another\u2019s lines, making the exchanges even more human. Certain moments in dialogue are quite significant and memorable for how expressive they are and how it piles emotion into the situation. The scene where Mei and Yuzu are on a bench on a cold winter day is a good example.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, I think it\u2019s finally time to traverse into how Citrus fares in the audio/visual department. Regarding the visual front of the Citrus anime adaptation, it\u2019s very solid in its own right, but also has its shortcomings. Obviously it would be unreasonable to expect the level of quality in the manga\u2019s art to be fully translated into a costly animated product, especially with a studio like Passione. I will say one thing though. One of the main things which I believe gave the manga so much of its charm and made it so appealing to many, was how expressive the characters are. Characters, especially Yuzu, would regularly emote and make different facial expressions for many situations. This also happens to the anime to some degree, but not frequently enough to where it captures the manga\u2019s original charm. It\u2019s much rarer in the anime for characters to deviate from their default expressions, making the experience somewhat more sterile. Perhaps this was to cut down on budget costs, or it was a design choice on behalf of the director. Whatever the case, I find it to be a disappointment. Additionally, the animation quality at times leaves much to be desired, which I can only hope will be rectified in some degree in the upcoming BDs. One of the fronts I was most impressed by in this adaption was the soundtrack. It genuinely surprised me with how good the music was in this adaptation. It\u2019s vibrant, diverse, and well-utilized most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nSo that concludes my review of Citrus. The story at large is quite rough around the edges with its frequent use of coincidences. It\u2019s also arguably flawed in how many things are framed as a formulaic routine. With a new girl continually intruding on the situation, it\u2019s admittedly easy to feel some degree of frustration. The core story however, with the two main leads, remains very strong. Various facets of their character are explored well and brought to a satisfying resolve. That said, there are many loose ends in the story yet to be tied up, in which case I can only hope a second season will be made eventually to adapt the rest of the source material to complement the anime-viewing experience. All things considered, however, Citrus is a great anime overall. One of the things which motivated me to write this review was to address the criticisms this show had been receiving. If you have already seen this anime, and anything I\u2019ve said gave you something to think about, then perhaps it deserves a second viewing. For a show so widely shunned as being a lesbian fanservice show, the story of Citrus is one that anyone, gay or straight, male or female, can relate to on any level.",

            "content": "Tinseltown has been coming under fire as of late. Celebrities' misdeeds are being exposed publicly on a weekly basis like a new sporting event. The #MeToo movement giving a platform to voice sex scandals that have gone unnoticed for far too long. Scrolling through your timeline, plastered on the TV screen, announced over the radio during daily commutes, the subject matter of countless memes, the focal point of water-cooler conversations; no matter where you turn, there it is. Accusation after accusation. Transforming popular figures into pervert pariahs overnight. Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Bill Cosby, Louis C.K., Dustin Hoffman, Brett Ratner, James Woods, Bryan Singer, CaseyAffleck; an endless potpourri of bigwigs\u2014the 21st Century witch hunt in full swing. No one is safe. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while all of this is going on, halfway across the globe, there's Citrus, minding its own business as it idly trolls along turning sexual assault into a provocative byproduct of step-sisters \"bickering.\" While people are pooling together with torches and pitchforks in hand, shining a light on any sexual misconduct occurring in the dark recesses of the entertainment industry, Studio Passione persists with the biggest \"whatever bro\" shoulder shrug. What the rest of the world concerns itself with isn't going to stop them from showing girls casually molesting each other on their scheduled programming. It's actually pretty impressive. Fucked up, but impressive nonetheless. I guess you could extend that sentiment to Japan in general. Creating \"fucked up shit\" in a carefree manner has become something like their calling card:\\n\\n\r\nHas mass-shootings and domestic terrorism been a hot-button issue? Well here, have some Inuyashiki. Concerned with gender politics? Don't worry, we got you covered with Skirt no Naka wa Kedamono Deshita. \"If you want it, we got it.\" seems to be the motto, as they peddle anything and everything in the endless pursuit of creative freedom. Which brings us to latest foray into the \"fucked up shit\" unofficial canon, Citrus. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the land that gave us distinct high-school dramas like Orange, we're handed Citrus, the undesirable fruit.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime tells the tale of\u2013 oh, who are we kidding? It's about sexy-time with female characters. It's all lip service unless it \"services the lips\" of the females involved.\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty average-looking too, the ugly kind of average-looking.\\n\\n\r\nHoards of CGI models in green linen jackets. Flat buildings without detail, walls bare of personality. Real-life inspired locations washed of any distinct features. Stainless steel structures, straight shapes stretching on endlessly without purpose, without care. Floorboards and walkways copied and pasted into an endless loop of lethargic worldbuilding. A kind of artificial sheen to everything. Devoid of human touch, the undeniable look of computer-generated polish. Clinically sterile and evenly lit. The feeling of being done to the bare minimum. Uninspired. Uncaring. Unconcerned with anything unless it's \"sexy-time,\" and even then, it's barely a passing grade. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone has dark hair and moves forward in a unified step as if puppets to their boring world. A lifeless march towards an all-girl school, a place where our Yuzu would be attending. Yuzu Aihara is the rowdy rebel, our ball of \"life\" in a world lacking it, and unfortunately our main lead as well. The unlikable side character in any other show given a chance to take center-stage to problematic results. Makeup caked on, strawberry blonde hair puffed up, cleavage out in the sun, skirt hacked up, buttermilk tan, all manner of frilly things, school outfit altered beyond recognition, a personality as loud as her appearance; a self-proclaimed gyaru and a shameless attention-seeker at that\u2014this is \"much deep\" cuz spunky gurl in a world of conformists.\\n\\n\r\nAnd standing as her polar opposite, there's Mei Aihara, a soon-to-be molester dressed up as a Mary Sue. She suffers heavily from PerfectGirl-syndrome: honor-role pupil, top of her class, student council president, poised, admired by everyone, the chairman's granddaughter, built like a walkway model, good at literally everything she does. She probably farts out Chanel No. 5 too. You get the drill, she's as interesting as wallpaper. Perfect to a sickening degree. Well, that's all before she decided to turn her new step-sister, Ms. Rowdy Rebel, into her personal play-thing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd who better to bring this together than Takeo Takahashi, a man that's equally known for his hentai contributions as he is his \"safe for work\" content. \\n\\n\r\nCitrus certainly has that kind of attribute to it. That sort of sleazy undercurrent that flows throughout every moment, well-intention or otherwise. Camera-panning that ogles the female form without concern for respecting boundaries. Narrative threads meant to help audiences relate to the cast quickly expedited to get to the next sexual encounter. Endless monologues for every characters' dilemma\u2014subtlety isn't allowed in this universe. A sense of objectification, even if it's in regards to actions expressed with consent. Nothing is ever pure. Everything smeared with the fingerprints of hedonistic high-gloss. \\n\\n\r\nEven smut like 2017's Scum's Wish, at the very least, had small spurts of respect displayed for its cast, occasionally loosening its vice grip to allow a chance to express feelings openly. By comparison, everything in Citrus feels bought off. An act of slave-like procurement over the characters' bodies that's too readily apparent to ignore. Awkward half-chubs spurred on by involuntary stimuli. In a meta-sense, we're also made victims of visual misconduct (go figure). It's the kind of eroticism that arrives quickly and leaves you feeling dirty. \\n\\n\r\nAn anime that will have a heated shower scene where non-consensual groping occurs, then follow it up with this dialogue exchange:\\n\\n\r\n\"No!\"\u2013Yuzu pushes away in abject horror\u2013 \"Why are you doing this!?\"\u2013her eyes closed, as she stands there naked and vulnerable.\\n\r\nMei innocently answers back without hesitation, a tone of motherly matter-of-factness:\\n\r\n\"Because you looked like you wanted me to touch you.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe scene ends, never to properly address the disturbing exchange again. \\n\r\nAs long as the money shot was secured and a few man-tents were pitched, nothing else matters. \\n\r\nThis is the kind of \"feeling dirty\" I'm referring to. \\n\\n\r\nI love perverted content as much as the next guy, but sometimes, what Citrus attempts to do is genuinely off-putting. Sexual harassment shouldn't be confused with love. And if it is, a level of accountability needs to be put in place to avoid idealistic handwaving. But this is a show that thinks that if it holds a \"this is wrong\" PSA after it indulges in sexual misconduct, that it's suddenly not culpable of wrongdoing. An anime that sells Stockholm syndrome as a shot of Cupid's arrow. Where fighting sexual harassment with sexual harassment is treated as an actual solution. Serious issues trivialized to create marketable eroticism and comedic gags.\\n\\n\r\nAny act of earnestness is completely lost in a title devoid of finesse. After a while, you sort of just roll with it. Jokes at the expense of serious issues. Illogical reasoning made by characters to justify their actions. You might even buy into the lack of audiovisual effort as a part of the \"theme\" to contrast everything against Yuzu's personality. Of course, you'll be wrong, as even her living quarters and look has been rendered flaccid, lacking in any sense of creative vitality or noticeable effort. It's all very surface-level. Pedestrian sleaze that isn't arousing enough to keep the Kleenex nearby nor respectful enough to genuinely stimulate discussions regarding the content on display. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's perhaps this show's biggest downfall in a nutshell: it's vanilla, but a souring type of vanilla. \\n\\n\r\nA type of middling existence occupied by works of far more distinction than itself. If you're interested in the taboo themes that this anime addresses, there's no need to compromise with inferior goods to get your fix. There are better alternatives out there for those actually seeking integrity (Koi Kaze) or far more titillating eye-candy (Scum's Wish). Why settle for vanilla in a world full of flavor just waiting to be discovered? Is Citrus entertaining? Sure, at times. But when 17-minutes of content is glazed over just for 3-minutes of \"sexy-time,\" and the \"sexy-time\" itself is neither well-animated or concerned with addressing the elephant in the room that surrounds its content; at that point, what you're left with is a show whose sole purpose for existing is left dead in the water from the moment it dives in.",

            "content": "Citrus challenges today's anime standards by introducing interesting topics like \"How cringy can character dialogue become in an anime until I drop it?\" and \"Is it sexual assault if I kiss my step sister without consent...and get away with it?\"\r\nThis is by far the worst anime I've seen this year and I'm just 4 episodes in. Dialogue doesn't feel natural at all, exposition is thrown in my face every second and characters don't make any sense.\r\nThe pacing of Citrus is way too fast and we never get any real sense of knowing how to feel about a moment. There is a scene where Mei kissesher sister in the first epiosde without her consent and it feels super uncomfortable but next episode, the main character pretends like this thing was super romantic, not literally, but this is what it feels like.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is also something we should talk about. It commendable that the director actually changes the clothes of the main character multiple times, which isn't done as often as you might think, but the actual animation is piss poor and the art still suffers from time to time. It's also sad that nothing about this animation seems to have any personality.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the topic of Gay bait. Is this show some gay bait for people that browse through tumblr and twitter 24/7? Yes. Yes it is. Instead of developing a genuine, natural romance between two highschool students that happen to be girls, we get some of the most rapey, uncomfortable Yuri scenes I had the displeasure to watch. It is amazing how people are willing to justify abusive and toxic romance as long as it's gay.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a shitty gay Telenovela in anime form, then boy, is Citrus the anime for you.",

            "content": "Some spectators consider themselves sophisticated, modern and avant-garde. However, when they become aware of some social taboos, they change their mind and create a disapproval towards some topics. One example, the lesbian romance. Citrus has potential but fails with some distasteful scenes as described below. \r\nThe Ugly: The story mistake love with rape and forces affection from a lame sexual assault. In this world, Weinstein\u2019s behavior would be considered romantic and not the act of a sick predator.\r\nThe Good: As the plot progress you can observe the protagonists\u2019 insecurity, problems, and feelings. \r\nThe Bad: Unrealistic begin. Some characters are not well developed because the timeis not enough to let them grow.\\n\\n\r\nCitrus introduces a homosexual storyline where we can see a lesbian nexus, yet you don\u2019t need to fear it. No matter your gender, you can enjoy some parts of the narrative. The plot isn\u2019t as bad as some writers want us to believe, but it\u2019s not surprising either. Besides, the series begins with some weird and awkward moments that sink the possibility of a good romance, and I consider them fictional and unrealistic. On the other hand, Citrus emphasize the inexperience and the doubts in a relationship and tries to establish a link between the protagonists. In some scenes, you can sense the character\u2019s feelings. Sadly, in this modern era the taboo persists, perhaps for a woman, it is easier to tolerate this type of bond. Finally, Citrus is a Yuri anime, if you cannot bear this kind of affinity, it is better to stand aside and ignore the adaptation, or you might end up disappointed.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn\u2019t as marvelous as you can expect, the author sometimes mistakes rape with love, though. Also, the only way explored to conceive the romance is through the physical force. For example, it is ridiculous comparing intimacy with a sexual assault under the diplomatic motto \u201csince I love you, I can obligate you to adore me.\u201d In a real world, this concept will be judged as rude and out of place, it will generate repulsion, a restriction order and could end with a visit to the jail. Those actions could lead the spectator to misinterpret the characters\u2019 feelings and leaves the personal problems, fears, doubts, the lack of experience, and psychological aspects in the missing objects box. In the case of Yuzu, she does not know how to approach Mei, so the storyteller merely throws her over Mei literally, and the latter doesn\u2019t hesitate to assault Yuzu. Can you accept it as a romance? Furthermore, this keeps happening during all the adaptation. If you read the manga, those scenes aren\u2019t intrusive, you can pass them faster but in the anime the director focus and prolong them. Call it fanservice, hentai or sexual harassment; it does not fit the feeling setting momentum.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, this erroneous idea creates a false meaning of a lesbian link. From my perspective, a lesbian is like a straight; the relationship rules are alike. Why does the author use a weird and a wrong approach to initiate the attraction? Thus far, the plot fails on producing a good start for the romantic connection, it just leads the characters to a forced rape, deceiving the spectators with a cheap and fake drama.  \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the narration improves as it advances. I am not considering Citrus as a masterpiece, but the progression is acceptable. As the series continues, we can observe the inexperience of a usual acquaintance, the doubts, the pain, the suffering of the protagonists delivering the audience a better development and a different perspective. While the story picks up, it still has some defects such as the recurrent fanservice. If the social taboos do not slant the viewer, you could enjoy Citrus, though.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the lack of sense at the beginning ruins the possibility of a more vibrant narrative, a palpable romance and leads to the audience\u2019s boredom. Going further, you can notice some pacing problems. You need to be honest with yourself because some characters were just placed to fill a scene. The casual spectator will only watch the first episodes and decide if skipping the show. Since the issues appear from the start, Citrus will be readily considered a bit grotesque, a raw passion and a potential drop.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the overused sexual assault as a \u201ccomedy\u201d (for some) or as a \u201cromance\u201d change the plot and the enjoyment. If you can survive those scenes, you can see the character\u2019s authentic feelings. Honestly, I like Citrus manga, but the anime has been highly criticized by some unpleasant development that leads to a different meaning. In conclusion, you cannot compare intimacy with ravishment, and you cannot exploit the sexual assault to propel a romantic or comedic moment. For some viewers that scenes show affection, for others is a rape. In my case, SOME are sexual abuse and unnecessary. Lastly, the twelve episodes present a portion of the story and not all the published material and the most significant parts of the series still on the source.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\\n\\n\r\nYuzu. In the beginning, she displays some atypical feelings for Mei. Since she has no experience in love or relationships, she could fool the viewers with her naivety, show an emptiness and a similarity with a mundane generic girl. However, as the story progresses, we can see her emotions, problems and real doubts.\\n\\n\r\nMei. Some can judge her as a cold and expressionless robot. Since she is the school president, she might look strong. Nevertheless, inside she is baffled and seeks to follow her dad\u2019s steps. She will give up everything to keep alive her family legacy and traditions. Also, she cannot communicate her emotions and has vast inexperience in the relationship area. Thus, always leads her to mistake love with sexual assault or perhaps she just enjoys doing that. \\n\\n\r\nMatsuri. I consider her introduction misplaced. From nowhere she arrives and creates some problems just because Mei needs an opponent. Her feelings for Yuzu are vaguely explained.\\n\\n\r\nSara: Added in a similar way to Matsuri but her nature is the opposite. She is Yuzu\u2019s rival, and her sentiments appear almost instantly. \\n\r\nThe rest of the characters help the narrative progression such as Harumi and Himeko. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound\\n\\n\r\nTechnically speaking, Citrus has a beautiful animation, clean and fluid with excellent drawings catching your attention. Despite the plot issues, you will enjoy it. The camera angles and planes blend well with the narrative and the emotions; they focus on the details. One negative aspect, the unnecessary fanservice scenes. You could misinterpret them and will sink the real story.\\n\r\nThe series has good sound. They give us a remarkable OP and ED. Honestly, I like the OP, the tune and rhythm combined with the lyrics create a fabulous composition. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nCitrus isn\u2019t an anime for all tastes. The social taboo may make the observer indispose from the beginning. However, after some episodes, the story improves, and you can feel some character\u2019s emotions. I like some aspects of the plot. It isn\u2019t perfect and has a weird unrealistic start letting you with a big question mark, \u201cis it going to be worth my time?\u201d Thus, in combination with the \u201csexual assault\u201d scenes could lead your apathetic side and make you drop the series. Finally, the manga is superior. It shows a significant evolution with better pacing. I understand, sometimes most of the spectators avoid this genre, but if you reached this point of my review, perhaps you could watch the anime and read the source to feel Yuzu\u2019s emotions in a more desirable approach. I wanted to give Citrus a high score my conviction prevents me. I cannot accept the constant use of a sexual assault as a romantic or comedic filler that impacts the plot negatively. As I said, Citrus isn\u2019t for all the tastes. \\n\\n\r\nLastly and talking in general, you need to be broad-minded and don\u2019t bury a show just for a sexual preference. You can criticize but don\u2019t stigmatize the lesbian topic. If you dislike the story, skip it.\\n",

            "content": "If I got a dollar every time this show featured a kiss scene, I\u2019d probably be filthy rich now. No, not really but you have to admit, there\u2019s almost an absurd amount of kissing in this show known as \u201cCitrus\u201d. To me, this show is a modern example of a trashy soap opera made with the intention of cash grab. \r\nAdapted by the manga of the same name, Citrus is one of the few series in recent years that decided to take on the idea of lesbianism and turn it into a modern day drama. In anime form, it\u2019s defined more as yuri/shoujo-ai. As someonewho has read parts of the manga, Citrus focuses on the concept of female relationships. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t really express any hope after reading the manga. This anime adaptation set off red flags from the start and isn\u2019t able to fix them. It\u2019s a shame really. \\n\\n\r\nDiving into this show may feel a little uncomfortable at first if you\u2019re not used to this type of genre. The first few episodes makes it clear that there\u2019s more going on between main characters Yuzu and Mei. Although they don\u2019t have similar personalities, it\u2019s shown that Yuzu feels an uneasy attraction towards Mei after getting into some compromising positions with her. Throughout the show, the both of them engage in many activities that adheres to lesbianism. The anime doesn\u2019t hide the fact that there\u2019s seems to be mutual attraction as each episode ventures on. Other characters gets involved in their story but the main focus is on this pair. And to be honest, it feels pretty embarrassing to watch. The show tries to be a love story but instead filled with laughably bad dialogue and clich\u00e9s. I also can\u2019t remember the number of times I shook my head at how their relationship developed. That\u2019s actually what holds the show back a lot. Relationship dynamics in Citrus dances with an immense amount of teenage feelings and attempts to make it seem complicated. However, it ends up being washed up with little value and doesn\u2019t seem to know what to make of its characters. \\n\\n\r\nIndividually, Yuzu and Mei aren\u2019t actually bad characters. At least from a realistic point of view, Yuzu is a normal girl who wants to explore romance and grow up. She\u2019s also a bit of a daredevil and isn\u2019t afraid to speak her mind or help others when in need. On the other hand, there\u2019s Mei with a personality as cold as the snow. My impression of Mei is someone who would be incredibly difficult to be friends with. Her values are high standard and she never seems to let people get close to her, with perhaps the exception of Yuzu. We also get some background story about the two characters in later episodes to make viewers understand them more. However, that\u2019s pretty much the extent of it. Yuzu and Mei are basically carrying this show while other characters are hardly worth talking about. I mean, there\u2019s Yuzu\u2019s best friend Himeko but she gets annoying every time her mouth opens. Harumi Taniguchi\u2019s borderline obsession with Mei is incredibly obnoxious to watch. Oh and who can forget about Matsuri? It seems the show tries to make the audience hate her as much as possible. The Tachibana sisters introduced in later episodes are hardly likable either with their oddball personalities. The point is, most of these characters are one dimensional and hardly develops. In fact, I would say the characterization in this show really shoots itself in the foot with how certain episodes conclude. And that\u2019s too bad really.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the characters and story, it seems Citrus loves to service the fans. While it\u2019s not as explicit as some scenes in the manga, there\u2019s quite a bit of kissing in the show. If you fancy make out scenes and yuri fan service, then this might be the type of show for you. I\u2019m not going to lie though, it can be a bit of guilty pleasure at times. However, it gets tedious fast and after you\u2019ve seen it a dozen times, it almost feels senseless. That being said, Citrus does do what it\u2019s intended to do: bring out teenage feelings from characters and making a trite soap opera out of it.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing to smile upon Citrus, it would definitely be the visual quality. To put it simply, the show is vibrant, colorful, and is full of life. The character designs are attractive and really enhances the feminine charms of the cast such as Yuzu and the Tachibana sisters. The way characters expresses their emotions is also highlighted through the choreography that\u2019s hard to ignore. In many ways, the technical quality of Citrus is a sight for eyes to feast on. Whether it\u2019s the fan service or characters themselves, it\u2019s definitely there to impress.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not too much to go on about soundtrack as both theme songs gets its point across with the teenage drama style performance. However, the character voice mannerism is what makes some of the characters feel consistent with their roles. Yuzu is the most prominent example as she often speaks her mind and has a voice to match with her personality. Mei has a much colder voice tone that reflects her reserved persona. However, there\u2019s also other characters that I can hardly stand whenever they speak. In particular, Matsuri\u2019s voice sounds like she\u2019s a 12 year old. Get ready for the ear plugs\u2026\\n\\n\r\nBy the time I finished Citrus, I had to question myself why the anime is even called that. The literal definition of Citrus is a type of fruit that has somewhat of a sweet and bitter flavor. Does that stand as a personification of the show\u2019s themes? Who knows but I honestly find this show more than just bittersweet. What could have been a chance to make monumental history turned into a sour experience. \\n",

            "content": "Potential spoilers for the manga below...\r\nFirst - ignore all the hate directed at Citrus online. Give it a chance and make up your own mind. Other reviews and discussions will mock you for enjoying something they call trashy and melodramatic. They mock you for being entertained by something they have deemed so basic and depraved. And yet, after you've watched a few episodes you're thinking, 'why do I like this so much and why do I want to see more if everyone says this is garbage?'\r\nIt's because Saburouta is punching WAY above her weight on Citrus. It's like someone took Jane Austen and plonked herdown in modern day Japan and asked her to write a yuri manga. Yes, the very thing that all those haters will mock you for seeing in Citrus that they claim doesn't actually exist - the excellent writing, the deep character development, the touching emotional content - really is there, and it's been written quite purposefully and skillfully.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin, let's put aside that this is yuri for the moment. Yes, you know it is, I know it is, everyone knows it is. But the point of Citrus is absolutely not the fact that it's yuri. Saburouta could have written this story with two asexually reproducing spores as the main characters and it would have been equally as compelling. The fact that it's yuri is not implicitly fan-service, and if you've read the manga you will know that Saburouta dishes out the fan service in such tiny servings as to lack any nourishment whatsoever. More on why this is an issue in a moment. \\n\\n\r\nLet's get the other elephant in the room out of the way - the non-consensual sexual content in the first episodes/manga issues. Remember that this is a work of fiction and the reader is not meant to condone or approve of the actions of any of the characters. This is the classic dramatic question of, \"is evil something you are or something you do?\" To begin with, Mei has been taken advantage of, used, and basically treated like an automaton by dear old gramps ever since her Dad left (we'll get to that later). At the beginning of the story, there is no Mei - there is just a robot that does what needs to be done in the name of the Aihara family. She has no mother, no father, and the only affection she has ever known has been the cruel affection of the jerk teacher that she was arranged to marry even though he was planning on leaving her once he had the academy. She has literally never had a proper emotional relationship with anyone, and all she understands is the use of physical affection as a means of controlling others, as she has been controlled herself. But yes, you say, Mei should know better. She should know the difference between right and wrong! Oh really? Who taught Mei right from wrong? That's right, no one! She's acting out the only way she knows how. And, by the end of episode nine after the run-in with Matsuri - shock of all shocks, Mei has learned right from wrong because never again in the entire series do we see Mei act this way. And guess who teaches Mei wrong from right by her actions - Yuzu does.\\n\\n\r\nI'd also like to address the actions of Matsuri that a lot of people have a problem with - don't forget that Matsuri is just a kid. Remember being a kid? Remember how bad your judgement was, and how you did a lot of stupid things that people called you out for? Again, you say, Matsuri should know right from wrong. But again, who taught her right from wrong - her workaholic, absent parents? Right. Matsuri isn't capable of understanding the consequences of her actions, something that Yuzu points out to her several times. \"Relationships are not a game\" and \"love does not come as easily as it does in a manga\" says Yuzu to Matsuri. Matsuri is similar to Mei (as Mei informs her on the train, and why Mei forgives Matsuri so easily) in that Matsuri is literally a kid alone in the world. But instead of closing herself off to the rest of the world like Mei did, Matsuri sought out attention - the bad kind - online with her \"clients\". Mei isn't joking or being self-sacrificing when she tells Yuzu \"that girls needs you\". Mei understands more than anyone, despite Matsuri's actions, that Matsuri needs a source of goodness and love in her life. This is why Mei says that Yuzu is \"one of those meddlesome people who give you love even though you didn't ask for it\". By the end of episode nine, Matsuri has very subtly grown as a person and again, never does any of that bad stuff again for the rest of the series (so far). \\n\\n\r\nLet's get to the relationship between Yuzu and Mei. They are, quite literally and figuratively, the yin to the other's yang. And let's get one thing out of the way right now - Mei and Yuzu are as gay as the day is long from the outset. This is why I said this story could have been about two asexually reproducing spores - the fact that they are gay has nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing to do with this story. Why do I say this? Because neither Yuzu or Mei are struggling with their sexuality, ever. Being gay is so natural to them that they never question it. Need proof? Remember the scene where Yuzu is reading the sister manga, and Harumin (who wins as best friend in a manga/anime ever btw) suddenly scissors her. Yuzu *freaks out* and Harumin says \"this book shows positions for two women\". Why is Harumin so casual and Yuzu so freaked out? Because to Harumin, that position means literally nothing other than a curiousity - Harumin is so confident in her heterosexuality that she can do that without worrying what it means. Yuzu, on the other hand, is mortified because scissoring means something completely different to her - it means an expression of love, an expression of love she one days hopes to share with Mei. Which is what makes it such an uncomfortable situation with Harumin, for whom she has only a friendship type of love.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Mei, well, Mei is just super gay. And this is where Citrus is worth a deeper look and a rewatch or two. The thing you need to know about Mei is that she falls for Yuzu *for real* in episode eight. You know after Yuzu takes Mei to say goodbye to her father, Shou? After Mei sees Matsuri awkwardly kissing Yuzu in the street? Yeah - right there. That's where Mei falls for Yuzu. The cute little finger twidding scene with her stuffed bear followed by the passionate hug of Yuzu - right there. And here's where the central conflict of the series begins: Mei simultaneously loves Yuzu but also wants to push Yuzu away because of all the baggage that comes with loving Yuzu. Mei is pissed off with herself for being in love with Yuzu, and every interaction for the rest of the anime/manga is an expression of the internal love/hate that Mei has for Yuzu. This is what makes the story so bittersweet - we love Yuzu, Yuzu wants Mei to love her, Mei wants to love Yuzu, we want Mei to love Yuzu, but....Mei just can't allow herself to do that. If you've ever been in a similar situation, you know what's up.  \\n\\n\r\nBut back to the gayness. Saburouta never asks us to question that they are gay, as is the case with most \"will they or won't they\" yuri - we are meant to accept it as easily as the both of them do. So Saburouta has taken the standard yuri trope and cast it aside.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that Saburouta very purposely drew Mei and Yuzu as lesbians from the outset for the very reason that this anime/manga is getting so much hate - she wanted to remove the ability of the audience to fetishize the relationship between Yuzu and Mei. For the typical yuri audience, this is anathema - it defies the whole reason they read yuri in the first place. Citrus is, as its core, a very cute and bittersweet love story that most people - gay, straight, or otherwise, can relate to. \\n\\n\r\nIn Yuzu, Saburouta has created one of the most likeable, and dare I say loveable characters in manga/anime. Yes, her earnestness and plucky, can-do, kampai attitude is a standard trope, but there is way more to her than that. She actually shares a lot with Mei and Matsuri, parental attentiveness-wise. Her Mom is cool but absent, and new Dad Shou literally married her Mom just so that Mei would have a place to live away from gramps and he's off who-knows-where-doing-who-knows-what. The very first scene of the anime/manga is Yuzu hanging out with the slutty mean girls doing the teen-sex-talk thing. Yuzu desperately wants to belong somewhere, even if it is pretending and exaggerating with the nasty gyarus. She is the light to Mei's dark, again, literally and figuratively. Where Yuzu is overflowing with kindness, love, goodness, and understanding, Mei is a completely dark and vacant empty vessel. Over the series, you watch as Yuzu's love flows into Mei and completely changes her. But what about Mei, what does Mei do for Yuzu? Let's face it - Yuzu is a scatterbrained airhead. She acts without thinking, she has very little personal discipline, and would be distracted by a squirrel playing outside the window. For Yuzu, Mei is a much-needed reality check. When Yuzu is off floating around in teddy bear clouds, Mei is the one who is there to make sure her feet don't get out beyond reach. And Yuzu realizes this and also changes her behavior to be a more diligent student (with mixed results). The two of them are inextricably intertwined and their lives cannot be complete - at all - without the other.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why Citrus, and Saburouta, are absolute genius. The subtlety, the way that you can go back and rewatch past episodes re-read past chapters with present knowledge to unlock the motivations of the characters is brilliant.",

            "content": "It's still pretty early which is why this isn't much of a review yet as it's more of a first impression for the people interested. \r\nThe reason I'm writing this is because I'm really satisfied with how well the adaptation came out. Don't get me wrong, I'll evaluate it as an anime not as an adaptation but I just want to say that it really stood out to me how the anime made the setting pop out more than what the manga did. I never really felt the surroundings in the manga and I'm really glad with this since it holds an importance in theshow. It also stays faithful to the source material as of now but again, it's still too early to end it there. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTo begin, this show is about romance. Lesbian romance. \\n\\n\r\nNow with this kind of stories, people like me usually watch it for the sexual fantasy and stuff. It's more about the characters so It doesn't really need to have a mind bending plot. It does have some sensitive themes if that concerns you. With that said, it does a good job on executing it's story. \\n\\n\r\nWe have this girl; Yuzu, who is very enthusiastic about being a gal and even lies about having boyfriends to her friends but she gets transferred to an all-girls school because her \"mama suddenly found a new papa.\" On that school she meets other characters but most importantly Mei, the intriguing student council president/grandchild of the school chairman/the betrothed in an early age character (trust me, this is not a spoiler.) They started on the wrong-foot pretty quickly because of their conflicting personalities but what they don't know is that they're connected much closer than they think. We find more and more things about Mei through Yuzu and boom, character development. \\n\\n\r\nIt gets spicy very early but it doesn't feel rushed or forced and there's nothing I can really complain about. That's just the scenario but the pacing itself is fine along with the direction. It kinda feel like a k-drama. The use of lighting, the backgrounds, blurring or shaking camera shots, I love how they use the light behind Mei to hide her face when she stood up then showed her expression afterwards as she walks away. I can tell that the studio respects the manga and is really trying all they can to not just merely copy what's drawn in the source material. The art style really captivates me because it's not overly detailed but it looks so good. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't outstanding or anything but it doesn't have to. It's good enough for a drama show and the studio knows what it needs to emphasize. Like that scene where Mei searched for Yuzu's smartphone In Ep 1. That scene wasn't just to grab (no pun intended) attention, it's actually important because that's the reason why Mei left such a huge impression on Yuzu when they met. I really like the occational dynamic camera movement too like those in the OP. The show can look good even without that but they still went for it and that's always good to see. The music is fine but I don't have much to say about it really, there's some good ones like the one played during Yuzu's bath in Ep 1 but nothing that stands out. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is helpful or anything but I like the show so far that's why I'm persuading people to give it a try.",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended for those that have already finished watching Citrus and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. \r\nWhen sisters meet unexpected sparks fly and an unlikely romance blossoms \r\nBased off a popular manga series of the same name Citrus is a Shoujo and romance anime that takes place within a school setting and gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if you not only find yourself welcoming in a stepsister into your family from your mothers new marriage but also the actions thatcan happen if you were to fall in love with the stepsister that you just welcomed into your family. While Shoujo animes aren\u2019t usually a genre that I'm really interested in when looking at the premise as well as the background source material that it makes use of I felt that the series itself certainly sounded interesting. Interesting enough in that I decided to give the series a chance. The first episode of the series I felt did a great job of introducing both the setting of the series which is the school and of the two main characters Yuzu and Mei. In particular, I felt that the sense of rivalry that developed between them from that moment was interesting considering how later events would play out. Looking back, I'm glad that I decided to give this series a chance as the series was one that I really enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story of the series takes place at a famous and popular all-girls school situated in Tokyo that is well known for is strictness and conservative nature and follows the life of Yuzu Aihara a newly transferred student that moved to the city to join her recently remarried mother. As Yuzu, a fashionable and fun-loving girl transfers to the school and encounters the conservative and strict nature of the school she encounters the schools beautiful but strict student council president Mei Aihara who whether through fate or destiny is also Yuzu\u2019s new stepsister. While clashing with Mei both in school and at home Yuzu soon learns that attraction and hatred just like love and hate are two sides of the same coin. As Yuzu and Mei clash with each other they also start to learn more about each other and slowly but surely the two start to bond and get closer with each other and slowly cross the line that divides the sisters and become something more. While slowly bonding with her new stepsister Yuzu as she gets used to both the school and the city also meets and makes a number of new friends while also encountering ones from her past. These include the arrogant but understanding student council vice president Himeko, the cunning and deceptive Junior high school student Matsuri and the Tachibana sisters Sara and Nina who while having differing personalities also have a close and loving bond between them. The overall story of the series covers roughly the first four volumes of the source material. \\n\\n\r\nYuzu \\n\\n\r\nYuzu Aihara played by veteran seiyuu singer Ayana Taketatsu of Sao and Youkoso fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A bright, fashionable and fun-loving girl by nature Yuzu at the beginning of the series was a newly transferred student that had just moved to the area to live with her mother who had remarried. While carefree and positive Yuzu was also someone that had a lot of self-confidence but did not let that make her arrogant and instead was something of a free spirit being both positive and friendly to everyone that she meets. As a result of these traits Yuzu was someone that was able to make friends easily and in this, it can be seen that she\u2019s someone that\u2019s very loyal to her friends and would work hard to help them and support them when they need help while hating it when she is unable to help them. While relaxed and carefree by nature it can be seen that Yuzu is also someone that can get serious at times especially with regards to helping her friends with their problems a side of her that I felt was a great contrast to her relaxed nature and fitted well with the two sides concepts that the series makes use off. In line with Yuzu\u2019s carefree and free spirit type personality Yuzu is also someone that is noted to hate being constrained by rules especially those that restrict in how she should dress. This stems mainly from the fact that Yuzu is someone that believes that it\u2019s the right of high school girls to be able to dress and act the way that they want in order to take advantage of their youth and any rules that prevent that will only be a bad thing for them. In line with this aspect of her personality Yuzu while mostly being someone that prefers to not stand out is also someone that\u2019s also bold enough to make her views on subjects that concern her known even if she was to face censure when doing so. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Yuzu gets to both know Mei better and encounter and befriend more characters in the school Yuzu\u2019s personality gradually starts to change as she finds her life becoming more intertwined with that of Mei. At the beginning of the series Yuzu while carefree was also someone that was rather stubborn with her beliefs and often had arguments with people that had different views to her. As the series progresses this side of her personality gradually changes, and Yuzu begins to show more consideration to others while trying to rein in her more brash behaviour and try to think of the consequences of an action before doing them. This change is best shown in Yuzu\u2019s willingness to admit her own mistakes and attempts to take responsibly for her actions and any effects that it had whether on the school or her friends. At the beginning of the series, Yuzu and Mei did not have the best of relationships or the best of first encounters and it can be said that their first feelings on meeting each other as sisters for the first time was hated and dislike rather than happiness and joy that would be the expected. Unlike Yuzu\u2019s carefree and freethinking nature that values independence Mei\u2019s personality, in the beginning, was the complete opposite being rule-bound, and strict which Yuzu applied to both Mei and her family. As the series goes on and they get to know each other more this feeling of antagonism gradually softens, and Yuzu starts seeing and treating Mei as family. As the series goes and Yuzu gets to see and understand the pain that exists within Mei she becomes somewhat determined to break through the shell of sadness that Mei has erected around herself fighting hard to get through to the real Mei that was behind it in a determined attempt to give her what she had craved the most in her life which was love and a place where she can belong too. As a result of this journey, the bond between the two gradually grows deeper as Mei slowly opens herself up to Yuzu\u2019s determined attempts to help her and in the process creating a deeper relationship between the two that Yuzu never expected. The character of Yuzu I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed as the series went on. Its been a while since I had seen Ayana Taketatsu in a lead role, but I felt that she did an excellent job of portraying the character of Yuzu. \\n\\n\r\nMei \\n\\n\r\nMei Aihara voiced by veteran seiyuu Minami Tsuda of Guilty Crown fame is one of the main characters of the series. The new stepsister to Yuzu Mei\u2019s personality and attitude is markedly different from Yuzu in more ways than one. An attractive and intelligent girl by nature Mei is the very image of a cool beauty that deals with every situation with calm and logical solutions that hint at her level-headed nature. A quiet and composed girl Mei is someone that believes fervently that rules are the very pillars of society and that without it society would only be in chaos. This is a belief that Mei believes greatly and tries to inspire the students of her school in her capacity as student council president. While a quiet girl by nature Mei, however, is not unsociable and indeed while most people assume that she\u2019s rather aloof the truth of the matter is that Mei can also be friendly to those that she has befriended and can be surprisingly understanding of others while being courteous and polite to those that she doesn\u2019t yet know. From the beginning of the series, it can be seen that Mei is someone that\u2019s very hardworking and takes her duty as student council president seriously. Indeed, she is the type of person that would try to do everything by herself and be unwilling to bother others with it even if it was their role to help in the first place which shows her dutiful and determined nature. To many of the students that she manages Mei is someone that is cool, level-headed and efficient that makes it hard for them to approach however the reality of this is that Mei while certainly cool and efficient is also someone that remembers those that have helped her in some way a side of her that I really liked.  \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and more of Mei\u2019s personality is revealed beneath the calm and composed attitude that she projects to her fellow students Mei is, in fact, someone that lives in constant pain and isolation and is someone that doesn\u2019t trust others easily. Rather it can be seen that Mei is someone that tries to push those that try to know her away. As a result of having lived alone for much of her life in the beginning of the series it can be seen that Mei like Yuzu needed time to get used to the fact that they now had a much larger family than before and while the relationship between Mei and Yuzu and her mother was somewhat distant at first this gradually changed as the series went on in line with the deepening bond that is forged between them. While hinted on in the beginning as the series progressed it become apparent that Mei\u2019s relationship with her family was rather strained and while she feels indebted to her grandfather who had raised her this also acted as a constraint for her life as well as it limited the freedom that she could have within her life. However arguably the main issue that had caused Mei\u2019s heart to be constrained was, without doubt, the strained relationship that she had with her father which caused her to work fiercely to protect the school even to the point of causing her life to become nothing more than a set of performances. After making peace with her father and fixing this Mei\u2019s attitude gradually began to soften and she begins to break out of her shell and not just be more open with her feelings but also learn to place her trust in others more. At the beginning of the series, Mei\u2019s relationship with Yuzu was that of wariness which was somewhat understandable and kept her distance from her. But as the series progressed on and she gets to see and understand Yuzu\u2019s personality a bit more this began to change. After overcoming many challenges together Mei\u2019s attitude towards Yuzu begins to change becoming more positive and open-minded and less formal in her dealings with Yuzu showing the improving bond between them. While still retaining some of her aloof nature Mei\u2019s personality gradually begins to thaw and begins showing her more honest and warmer feelings towards Yuzu openly unlike before. The character of Mei was an interesting one as her personality while contrasting greatly with that of Yuzu was the result of problems that was caused by family-related issues that ended up constraining her life which I felt was appropriate as it matched well with the theme of family and bonding by breaking through the wall that someone has erected to protect and hide them. I felt that her seiyuu Minami Tsuda did an excellent job in portraying the character of Mei. \\n\\n\r\nMatsuri \\n\\n\r\nMatsuri Mizusawa voiced by veteran seiyuu Shiori Izawa of Asterisk wars fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is an old friend of Yuzu. A 2nd-year junior high school student Matsuri at the beginning of the series behaved somewhat like an old friend to Yuzu being overly attached to her while still maintaining an innocent charm that was unique to her. On the surface, Matsuri was a kind, caring and polite person that seemed to value friendships and bonds. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and more of Matsuri\u2019s personality is revealed it can be seen that beneath this surface Matsuri\u2019s personality is very different. Beneath her surface personality, it can be seen that Matsuri is someone that is cunning, manipulative, and deceitful and will use every available means to get ahead of others as long as victory is hers. In addition, Matsuri has also shown to be rather possessive of things that are considered dear to her such as her role as Yuzu\u2019s little sister. At the beginning of the series, Matsuri was shown to have a rather warped view of what friendships and indeed what a relationship is as she took neither of them seriously and viewed them as something akin to a game. In this, she treated both as something that she can take advantage off to allow her to survive in society while at the same time pushing away things like love and warmth that is a result of the relationships that can form between friends. In a way, Matsuri\u2019s personality, in the beginning, was very much like what Mei had been experiencing at the beginning of the series. As the series progresses and Matsuri see\u2019s the depth of the relationship that exists between Yuzu and Mei and after seeing the truth of what she was missing Matsuri\u2019s personality gradually starts to change becoming friendlier and more open with her feelings while trying to understand what real friendship is by forming her first real friendships with others. \\n\\n\r\nHimeko \\n\\n\r\nHimeko Momokino voiced by veteran seiyuu Yurika Kobo of Youkoso and Seiren fame is one of the main support characters of the series. A member of an upper-class family on account of her impressive and elegant hairstyle and the shops that she frequents Himeko true to her status is a self-confident, determined and somewhat stubborn person by nature that serves as one of the school\u2019s vice presidents and as a result assists Mei in her duties as student council president. A childhood of Mei Himeko is someone that while arrogant is also someone that believes in rules and order and would often pursue rule breakers with vengeance which is often used for comical effort within the series. While arrogant and confident in herself Himeko is also someone that cares deeply about her friends and can be quite perceptive when it comes to sensing when something is bothering them.\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the series, Himeko had an antagonist like relationship with Yuzu as the latter seemed to enjoy breaking the very same rules that Himeko see\u2019s as important to both the school and herself. As the series goes on and Himeko\u2019s personality is gradually revealed it can be seen that Himeko\u2019s feelings towards Mei go beyond that of what can be considered a simple friendship. In fact, it can be seen that Himeko has a lot of pride in serving as not just Mei\u2019s vice president but also her oldest friend as well something she uses often when she and Yuzu face off. While Yuzu and Himeko remain rivals for Mei\u2019s affections as the series goes on it can be seen that both share the same concern for Mei as each other and indeed when it comes to Mei\u2019s well being it can be seen that both would drop their rivalry to help her when needed something that I felt was nicely done.  \\n\\n\r\nNina \\n\\n\r\nNina Tachibana voiced by Rei Matsuzaki is one of the main support characters of the series and one of Yuzu\u2019s friends that she encounters while on a school excursion to Kyoto. A high school girl from another area Nina is the younger among the Tachibana sisters and very different in attitude to her sister. A kind, caring and intelligent girl Nina unlike her sister has a rather laid-back personality and is the kind of person that will not worry needlessly about things that have already happened. True to her laid-back personality Nina is also someone that is really forgetful as well. Nina\u2019s most prominent trait is without a doubt her tall physical height which I find to be pretty surprising for a high school girl.  Despite Nina\u2019s laid-back personality, it can be seen that Nina has a very deep bond with her sister and is very loyal to her to the point that she\u2019s willing to act as the villain if it means that her sister is able to have happiness. \\n\\n\r\nSara \\n\\n\r\nSara Tachibana voiced by veteran seiyuu Hisako Kanemoto of Food Wars and Gate fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Yuzu\u2019s friends having met and befriended her when they met in Kyoto. A high school girl from another high school Sara is the elder of the Tachibana sisters. A cheerful, positive and considerate person by nature Sara is someone that unlike her sister Nina is someone that prefers to not waste time pondering on something and prefers to strike it out in one-go kinda like a boxer and as a result is also a bold, brave and determined person. While bold and daring Sara is also someone that\u2019s perceptive of others feelings and is the kind of person that will let go of something if it would help others despite the pain that she will feel showing off her good nature. Because of this, however, Sara Is shown to have a dislike for people that give up too easily as she feels that if you don\u2019t go all the way then all you did was take half steps that ended up creating nothing. \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nThe animation for the series I felt was pretty well done with both the school and the uniforms for it being both well designed and detailed. The character designs for the series main characters I felt were also well done and were faithful to the source material to which I'm thankful. Music wise the series OST as well as the opening and ending themes I felt were excellent and did a great job at conveying the different emotions and feelings that each scene featured. Voice acting wise I felt that the main cast did an excellent job of portraying their respective characters. In particular, I felt that Ayana Taketatsu, Minami Tsuda, and Yurika Kubo did a fantastic job of portraying their respective characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nOverall Citrus was an anime that I really enjoyed watching and I felt that its main strong points were its premise, story, characters, animation and voice acting and its unique use of romantic relationships to heal the hole that had formed within someone\u2019s heart. The main premise of the show naturally is the encounter between Yuzu and Mei after Yuzu moves to the city and the subsequent escalating relationship that they forge between them. The decision to make an all-girls school as the series main setting I thought was an interesting move as though increasingly rare in this day and age single gender girls have the ability to create unique environments that can have the effect of both providing an effective place for students to learn and progress but at the same time trap them beneath layers of responsibility. One of the main themes that the story makes use off is that of the relationships that a family can have and the effect that this can have on members of that family. The decision to make use of the stepsister concept an idea unique to parents that have remarried I felt was a move well done as it not only gave the pretence for Yuzu to move to Tokyo to join her mother but also meet her new stepsister Mei as well. While Yuzu and Mei may not have had the best of first encounters watching the two of them try and come to terms with one another\u2019s existence within their lives was interesting as until they met each other each had thought that they were alone within the family. This gradual process of getting used to being sisters contrasted well with the romantic aspect of the show. The romantic aspect of the show I felt also did a great job at making use of this theme of family as while developing feelings for each other Yuzu and Mei also in the process started to explore the many wishes, desires and restrictions and responsibilities that lay within them that stopped them from achieving the things that they desire. This exchange of feelings as with everything is two sides of the same coin and just as Mei is able to see the hesitation that lay within Yuzu she too is able to see the many problems that Mei hides within her heart problems caused by both a carefree father and an overbearing grandfather that when combined with the school almost suffocates Mei in responsibility and trapping her real feelings in a place where few can reach. The desire of Yuzu to both understand and open up Mei\u2019s closed off heart and expose her true feelings I thought was a great use of the family theme as it provided the perfect key to open up Mei\u2019s closed off heart and provide her with the very thing that she was missing in her life which was that of family warmth. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Citrus was an interesting anime that made use of an interesting premise and a unique way of forging a romantic relationship that can be used to open someone\u2019s closed off heart while simultaneously reminding us that while society can be a harsh place trying to take too much responsibility by yourself and not letting others see your true feelings can be a bad thing. Sometimes its worth it to maybe stop one day and have one long talk with someone that you trust and not hide them anymore. In terms of final score, I think Citrus certainly deserves a score of 10/10. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Garbage. \r\nFrom a director who brought us such great hits as, Creepy Rape Hentai, and the abysmal, So, I Can't Play H!, comes an adaptation of the manga Citrus. (He also did Spice and Wolf). \r\nCitrus tells the story of Yuzu Aihara who starts attending an all girls school. There she meets Mei, a girl who is the complete opposite of her. While Yuzu is a fun, impulsive person, Mei is humorless and takes everything serious. Yuzu returns home one day to find that Mei is in her house. Her mom has gotten remarried and forgot to mention that Yuzu now has a stepsister, asyou do, and that sister turns out to be Mei! Wacky hijinks ensue, like sexual assault. Not just any sexual assault though! Lesbian sexual assault. \\n\\n\r\nMei gets on top of Yuzu and kisses her against her will. This is a massive problem for obvious reasons. The relationship between these two characters is rapey for a lot of the series. They often touch each other without the other one being comfortable with it. These two fail to communicate. They both make assumptions about each other and never just ask the other what it is they are thinking or want. They share a bed, it should be easy to start a conversation before licking one another. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue, OMFG the dialogue, kill me now. \"What did the kiss mean?\" asks Yuzu. You were sexually assaulted, that's what it means.\\n\r\n\"How does Mei feel?\" ASK HER. For the love of God your problems have such simple solutions, you privileged fucker. Also there is a line where Yuzu says something like \"its not exactly normal for two girls to be kissing each other\". Maybe that's a bad translation, but if not, come on Yuzu, it's 2018, we don't think that no more.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the dialogue is some of the worst of this season I did find myself liking Yuzu. She isn't a bad person and is trying hard to make things work between her and Mei. Mei on the other hand is a massive bitch. Like your mom, but more attractive and lesbiany. She is selfish and repeatedly hurts Yuzu, while Yuzu is doing her best to help her. She spends most of her time irritated. She isn't a fun character to spend time with. She's still better than the bland supporting cast though. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters purpose is to make things complicated between Yuzu and Mei. They have no believable motives, I hate hate hate hate them. The plots involving them is so incredibly predictable too. You know whats going to happen from the moment they are introduced. There is one good side character though, Harumin, who is a good friend to Yuzu and is kind-hearted. It's a shame that the anime doesn't contain more scenes with Yuzu and Harumin just hanging out, it would help distract from the shitshow of a romance going on. \\n\\n\r\nThis review has been rather negative so I'll write some more nice things. The animation is good and.......\\n\\n\r\nSo anyway, would I recommend Citrus? No. \\n\r\nOverall Citrus fails at what it sets out to do. It is a romance anime that starts with sexual assault and only gets marginally better as it goes on. There are some enjoyable moments and it is far from the worst anime ever made.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed Citrus or want a fun lesbian anime then I recommend Revolutionary Girl Utena: The Adolescence of Utena. If you want a more serious anime that has LGBT characters then Wandering Son is quite good. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review. If you think I'm wrong about something or have an opinion you'd like to share then feel free to keep it to yourself.\\n\r\nReminder to love yourself and make sure you live the life that makes you happy. <3\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "MAJOR SPOILER\r\nAlright this is a serious review and my first review, but let me say I have read the manga before. Another thing is I don't review this like an idiot who thinks after reading Beserk, Stein, Monster, FMA:B, or any other \"masterpieces\" that they have the philosophers hammer and the alchemist stone. I also rate mostly on enjoyment primarily. All right lets begin. \r\nAct 1; The Story:8\r\nThe story accomplishes what it set out to do, and that is a dramatic story about two lesbian lover who are now sisters. Now let me say this, don't expect this to be a masterpiece in termsof story, pacing, and execution. (Though it's my personal masterpiece) Ep1 spoilers only. The story begins with Yuzu talking to her friends on how she want's a boyfriend. Her luck was awful, as she went to an all girls school. At the entrance she meets Mei, a rather calm and beautiful girl, as she has violated school regulation. She then sifts Yuzu to get her phone and tell her to wash the makeup off. She then encounters another girl who had the same troubles of the school regulation, Harumin. Harumin basically tells her why the students are rather dull and how they were sheltered. They become friends as they are both alike. She then has her first conflict as she sees Mei kissing the same teacher. When she tried to get away, they notice she was nearby from her clumsy mistake. She runs. She then returns home only to be shocked that Mei, the same girl, was her new sister. She seems rather stunned and uneasy on Mei. From there she bugged her until she brought up the incident and asked how can she kiss if she is not genuinely in love and is only doing it for the thrill. This is where I'll end it here as I might get this review taken down for play-by-play and if i spoiled the first major plot point. The show does the drama right, most of the tension is explainable and the execution is generally done well.  The grimes with it's a little fast pace at times, but everything is well done and In My Opinion, great. Though the story is about same sex love, and if your against that then don't watch. As for the yuri scenes, they are mostly explained why it happens, so to put it off as fan service is definitely wrong.\\n\\n\r\nAct 2; Animation and Soundtrack: 7.6\\n\r\nThe animation for the show is Amazing, but some of the original art work from the manga is not shown at the same time. One of the many good things about the manga is the artwork and the anime has shown to reflect that but at the same time have a modern take on the show's artwork. Now more on about the errors in the animation, there are scenes that look wonky. Though the animation has gotten better, there is still scenes that look messed up still, but it was less apparent with it's improvement. The ost fits the show well and are mostly, music to my ears. The VA's have done their part greatly and for their dub counterpart(Dub isn't my favorite thong to listen) they have seem to do justice for dubbers. The op and ed are another thing that I have to give praise to as they really fit the show.\\n\\n\r\nAct 3; Character: 8.3\\n\r\nMost of the characters are really fun and interesting. No character doesn't feel annoying or boring. Personally I like Momokino as her character design and her personality I can definitely enjoy. All the characters have a motivational factor for their actions and their personality are great. Still, there are still some things to push them over for, the characters are great.\\n\\n\r\nAct 4; Enjoyment and Overall: 9 (for enjoyment) 8 (Overall)\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the anime so far as it has been a great adaptation for the series. It really has been my number 3 show for the winter season so far. (#1 is Magus Bride) Overall it gets a 9/10 and my recommendations are Dear My Girl, The Star and The Flower, and Sakura Trick. \\n\\n\r\nFin \\n\r\nSidenote; If you literally reviewed this like a philosopher, then you going about an entertainment media the wrong way.\\n\\n\r\nWhat would you like me to review next, Berserk after 100-200 chapters, Magus Bride, Hajime No Ippo Manga or show, or would you like me to watch your personal favorite show. Comment on my profile and I'll see what are the most popular choice so that I can review it next.",

Typically romance anime's load themselves with misunderstandings but not this show, this show has ascended past such silly tropes. Because this show only can further the plot with sexual assaults. For example Momokino has supposedly been friends with Mei for over 10 years but only decides to do anything sexual with Mei when Yuzu starts being friendly with her. She also goes from being a stuck up bitch to immediately ok with doing that in school grounds. All because her best friendgot a new sister. Wouldn't it only be natural for someone to spend time with someone who just became part of their family. Nope, all logic and reason takes the backseat until we have gotten at least one sexual assault per-episode. Yuri is nice and everything, but that doesn't make it a good anime. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Citrus is a yuri romance manga that started in late 2012 and just recently ended. Although it looks like a second manga called Citrus Plus is planned. I don't know if it's going to follow the same characters nor have I read the manga. Early this year the studio Passione, also behind Rokka no Yuusha, aired a twelve episode adaptation to cover the first part of the story. So, let's see how that went.\u00a0\r\nStory:\r\nAihara Yuzu finds her life turned topsy turvy when her mother suddenly remarries and the pair relocate, forcing her to enter a new school. Things turn awkward immediately when she unknowingly breaksthe rules and finds herself afoul of the young student council president. She returns home for a surprise, she has a new step-sister and it's the same student council president she met earlier, Aihara Mei. To make matters even more awkward, she finds Mei really attractive.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the problems with the series. There are two major ones. The first is that, like Love Stage, it doesn't have a great first impression. I will say, to Citrus's credit, it isn't nearly as bad since the initial encounter between Yuzu & Mei involves a stolen kiss and not attempted rape but it's still not a great way to begin a romance. The big one, however, is more reminiscent of the bad episode from Sasameki Koto. In that episode, we had a young girl act deplorably only to be instantly forgiven with no real consequences and her behaviour was never mentioned again.\\n\\n\r\nCitrus has the same type of thing with a character named Matsuri except her actions are even worse and they span a couple episodes. She's introduced about halfway into the series and decides to try and seduce Yuzu. But first she needs to deal with Mei, which is where the deplorableness comes in. Now, I'm not opposed to having an antagonistic character who's absolutely atrocious as a person but the problem here, and in the aforementioned Sasameki Koto, is that they try to treat the characters as sympathetic. And that doesn't work when you have characters act this horribly. Not without a lot of time and effort put into redeeming them. Which neither series does. Their plots end and they basically say they're sorry and get told not to do it again and that's it.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the positives, I'll give Citrus credit for having romantic content between siblings in a way that's only mildly sleazy, and that's entirely based on the stolen kisses early on. Because it makes sense for two high school kids who are suddenly tossed together as step-siblings to still be attracted to one another. The series also does feature some strong scenes. Some of them are quite funny, and usually involve Yuzu making an ass of herself. While others have a bit of an awkward tension betwixt Mei & Yuzu with enough positivity to make them kind of sweet little moments. The best part, by far, is the whole arc with the twin sisters, Sara & Nina. Those three episodes are where the series gets elevated to fantastic. It's funny because it goes from the low point of the series, with Matsuri the sociopath, to the high point with the twins and it's kind of hard to believe these were written by the same person.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI've already covered the basics of what's wrong with Matsuri's character and the handling thereof. Needless to say, she's the worst character in the series by a wide margin. As for the other characters, there are aspects of Yuzu, Mei and their budding relationship I really like. The awkwardness has verisimilitude. Yuzu's conflicting feelings of wanting to be a good sister but also being greatly attracted to her new step-sister is compelling. Mei's desire to be needed and her drive for exceptionalism versus her uncertainty over how to proceed is also good stuff. But then there's the way things are initiated betwixt them and the way it gives a poor first impression. Harumi is a fun character. Sara is a sweetheart. I also really like what little we get of Mei's relationship with her wandering father. So, quite a strong cast with one very notable exception.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt:\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nHere's one area where I have to give Passione a lot of credit, their artwork is really great. The characters are well drawn. The backgrounds and various world objects look good. The animation flows smoothly. It is a good looking series.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSound:\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nOur main heroines are voiced by Taketatsu Ayana & Tsuda Minami, two strong actresses who deliver fantastic performances. We've also got Kubo Yurika, Kanemoto Hisako, Fuji Yukiyo, Matsuzaki Rei and some others who are really good at what they do. Even Izawa Shiori, voice of the worst part of the series, doesn't perform badly. She just got stuck with a shit character. Takahashi Ryo put together a strong soundtrack for the series.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the obvious budding relationship betwixt Yuzu & Mei, Mei's childhood friend blatantly has feelings for her. Yuzu has some kind of flirtatious moments with Harumi but a lot of that is Harumi teasing Yuzu after seeing her yuri manga. Sara's whole arc revolves around her developing a crush on Mei who she refers to as \"her destiny.\" In short, this is one of those series where the only important straight character seems to be Yuzu's mum. And I wouldn't exactly be surprised if the latter part of the manga introduces her female \"friend\" who seems to always visit while her husband's away. Which he always is.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of things to like about this series. The last arc especially. Unfortunately, it's really weakened by those three episodes heavily featuring Matsuri & by having the relationship begin in a poor way. Would I watch a second series? Well, yes. This may well be like Sasameki Koto\u00a0where the manga gets past the point that made up the seventh episode of the anime and it just stays consistently fantastic afterwards. In which case, the bad part's out of the way. But, by the same token, this isn't a good yuri series thus far. It manages to average out to being decent but there are plenty of better ones out there. I'll give the first series a 6/10. If they do come out with a second one I'll give it a go but I'm not really going to go out of my way to go through the manga or anything like that.\u00a0",

            "content": "Yuzu, which is the name of main protagonist, means a type of citrus fruit in Asia (for all of you wondering what the title means. \r\nStory (5/10): You probably should know that Citrus follows a girl to girl relationship. If that bothers you, fine you can skip and miss out on a romance that many current animes have forgotten. Yuzu, the gal-looking one, gets enrolled in an all-girl high school. Breaking the rules on the first day, she meets the student council president, Mei, who not only turns out to be the school chair's granddaughter and her newly adoptive younger sister. From here, Citrus presentswatchers with two main developments: Yuzu's shift from delinquent to an older sister and Mei's dealing with family problems. To avoid spoilers, let me just say that while there is touching, it is not forced and is much more rooted in innocence and stress. Learning about these characters as the story progresses is not entirely mind-blowing, especially in a high school setting, but it does it and does it well enough. Good. But its not. The last few episodes threw this out and were QUITE disappointing. I am not going to spoil anything but be prepared (5/10).\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): I am not really sure how to explain this catergory. I guess the character designs look good and noticable. What actually makes them great is that they are noticable and not flashy (no yellow hair and orange jump suit, just black/brown ish hair) The background is pretty to look at. Some of the art drops in quality for moments (particularly the eyes) and it takes away from the experience a little, but overall great.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10): I love both the opening and ending themes. 10/10. The series does not really utilize sound, so I have to give this catergory (while reluctantly) a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10): Yuzu just has this rare charisma to her that she is very easy to root for. Her relationship with Mei translates as genuine and with good intent. So far, I enjoy watching her on the screen very much. Mei is OKAY, but I admit that there are some good use of subtle detail. The rest of the cast, however, is generic... well accept 1 who I will not talk about for spoilers :). My favorite part about these characters is that they feel human. Everyone is flawed, and everyone is genuine. Well done for making me care Citrus. The two white haired girls on the cover and opening, however, are pretty unenjoyable. These two additional characters kind of ruined this show for me. If this anime was 10 episodes, I would be more satisfied. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: Go watch Citrus. I think it beats Darling in the Franxx in terms of romance and characters, but you know that's just my opinion. Citrus is good, but its not even close to very good; just watch it to enjoy and don't let the yuri bother you.\\n",

            "content": "Previously on LA's anime reviews, specifically Netsuzou TRap review...\r\n\"Let's just hope Citrus does better...\"\r\nLA's prayers has been answered!\r\nCitrus was a really hyped anime of Winter 2018 for LA but as much as LA has it's problems and ohh boy there are and we'll get to it soon but LA does look beyond this to see one of the better melodrama yuri anime of Winter 2018 and a strong contender for LA's guiltiest pleasure anime.\r\nOk so the major problems with Citrus is quite obvious from the first episode alone and we'll get to right now, Mei Aihara voiced by Minami Tsuda, sexually assaulting Yuzu Aihara voicedby Ayana Taketatsu. This is played up for melodrama and sparked the step-sister yuri relationship because Mei came onto Yuzu. The implications are there but LA can't defend this besides bringing up the catalyst to the entire relationship Citrus is built upon AND we get to know Mei for her not-so pure stoic personality. The next problem is the obvious love rivals our main yuri couple goes through TIME AND AGAIN, from Mei's friend and vice president of the Student Council Himeko Momokino voiced by Yurika Kubo a rival to Yuzu, Matsuri Mizusawa voiced by Shiori Izawa, Yuzu's childhood friend who's less than pure and rebelliously anti-social thus is Mei's rival AND finally Sara Tachibana voiced by Hisako Kanemoto who's in love with Mei (as a love at first sight deal) with Sara's twin sister Nina voiced by Rei Matsuzaki wanting to support her thus both become a rival to Yuzu. Mei and Yuzu goes through soo many love rivals both with their \"factions\" wanting Mei or Yuzu respectively and causing even more melodrama with Matsuri being the worst offender in all this, let's not even get to the fact that Mei's side of the extended family thinks nothing of Yuzu's family that causes LOTS more melodrama. Mei Aihara is also a huge problem to the plot itself, she being anti-social straight-headed and not \"getting social\" cues if her assaulting Yuzu by the first episode is any indication that she's not exactly emotionally accepting, she herself becomes her own obstacle throughout her relationship with Yuzu through the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, so as much bitching about Citrus LA said about it, LA will now start defending LA's flaw points now.\\n\\n\r\nSo the entire sexually assaulting thing, well by intents and purpose LA sees this lazy writing but it does at least shows Mei as an emotionally stunted individual who really doesn't know about love or can't portray it besides sexually as that's all she really knew before meeting Yuzu due to her own personal and family problems dealt to her does make her rather relatable, LA isn't necessarily saying that just because she's relatable now means Mei is a good character but LA does see more than that besides \"sexually assaulting step-sister\". Now the melodrama surrounding the majority of anime from the rival love interests to family coming in to try and stop or split up their relationship, well for rival love interest though this element comes up ALOT in the anime, LA does see what it meant to do, make either Mei and Yuzu develop together be it individually or through their relationship to get to know them a bit better in that respect to show that Mei and Yuzu love each other but they just can't spill it, now having the rivals used MANY times does get repetitive just under differing circumstances but nonetheless the intent and purpose is there and works for the most part to improve our main yuri duo. Now the family issues are also played up as melodrama but this can also be defend using the above. Well the problem with Mei sticks for a while but LA will defend her a bit by saying that she DOES develop with all the rivals and family issues that pops up and again though she remains emotionally stunted throughout the anime, there are little moments where she does try to open up to Mei.\\n\\n\r\nYuzu was LA's favourite character of Winter 2018, LA just can't explain, ohh wait, no it's because she's usually the more intentionally charming and helpful of the entire cast but struggles with her love life and when Mei arrives it just changes her and ALSO tries to help save her, where Yuzu herself soon finds herself if her love for Mei is true or not. This isn't helped by her voice actor Ayana Taketatsu where she herself has been really notable this Winter 2018. Harumi Taniguchi voiced by Yukiyo Fujii was also VERY likable being Yuzu's best friend and she helps Yuzu out like a best friend does to the point LA wouldn't mind a Yuzu x Harumi all things considered if Yuzu x Mei doesn't work out. *ahem* by all intent, LA can really see Yuzu and Mei's relationship bloom through their HEAVY list of trials and tribulations, some out of left field but mostly coincidental. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Passione, the character designs are VERY polished and extremely striking for the most part, not to mention the various outfits many of the characters goes through. The \"yuri\" moments are short and simple but the animation doens't skimp on the details (the only problem being Yuzu and Mei themselves), the backgrounding was decent enough but not really noteworthy, but nonetheless from all this, LA will say that the character designs are the best thing from the animation department and this is probably the first \"good trashy\" anime with decent animation behind it LA has seen.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on speaking of those \"yuri\" moments, yes Citrus does have some *ahem* titillating moments but the furthest it goes is skinship with kissing shown more often than not (and LA doesn't mean the kissing is shown by Mei & Yuzu, it goes to the other characters as well). You'd think LA would be disappointed by this however the implications and some titillation IS there, it's just masked ALOT of the time by the melodrama that ensues earlier or later before the fanservice that DOES detriment the scene but still the intent is there.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, well this anime ALSO has a plethora of idol-esque voice actors backing up this anime cast and uhh did the ADR Director do it intentionally with Love Live and iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls alumni known for their yuri fanbase like having Ayana Taketatsu (which felt like another meta-joke at Ayana herself but this time she's the OLDER sister), Minami Tsuda, Yurika Kubo and Rei Matsuzaki. Add in Hisako Kanemoto as Nayuta Kani from last season's Imouto sae Ireba Ii and it felt like the ADR were in on the joke. Yeah Ayana Taketatsu easily gets best voice actor from LA, NO DOUBT. But LA would like to give a rather surprising voice actor credit to Minami Tsuda in portraying the emotionally stunted Mei.\\n\\n\r\nCitrus has been said to be too melodramatic and not at all yuri, but LA begs to differ as MANY yuri/shoujo ai animes like Yuri Kuma Arashi, Kuttsukiboshi, Sakura Trick and hell LA will give SOME credit to Netsuzou TRap that melodrama helps move the plot and the relationship across it's just HOW they do it and Citrus does it pretty much the same. LA gets that some of the audience would want more \"yuri\" moments than \"melodrama\" but be it slice of life or romance or drama genre. \"Yuri\" and \"melodrama\" for LA is synonymous with one another to one get to know the main characters through their trials and tribulations through a forbidden love and two, without the melodrama the main protagonists relationship would have NEVER grown and finally, no melodrama means no story...coincidental or not. \\n\\n\r\nCitrus is LA's second guiltiest pleasure anime for Winter 2018 (ohh there's a guilty pleasure anime LA found much more guiltier than this), but going by yuri/shoujo ai standards and it not being yuri trash, then yes as much as Citrus HAS ALOT of flaws from the repetitive rivals and family issues melodrama shown and less yuri moments to the main characters of Mei and Yuzu going through their own relationship issues with each other BUT LA can see beyond that to see a very good trashy yuri/shoujo ai anime with those trials and tribulations only growing the main relationship, a likable main protagonist of Yuzu and some interesting characters like Harumi and some good rivals to Mei and Yuzu to test their relationship like Himeko and Sara. Some people see it as melodramatic trash, LA sees it as good yuri trash and better yet, this is one of LA's hyped anime of Winter 2018 that actually followed through with flaws and all.",

            "content": "Not a lot can be said of this anime except that it was literally written to fetishize lesbian women. \r\nTo begin with, the story is basically 100% trash. There's nothing really redeemable about it. It's about a girl who basically sexually assaults her step-sister. After a while, her step-sister thinks it's love. That's pretty much it. NOTHING ELSE HAPPENS. Even as someone who indulges in shoujo, I really hate the sexual assault tropes that they try to normalize. \r\nThe art is the only part I have no complaint about. Everyone is gorgeous and the backgrounds are so well done that I wished I could justwatch it on mute half the time. Not to mention that all the characters' eyes were simply breathtaking. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound could have been better. The opening and closing theme were a little annoying and they just got on my nerves. The voices of the characters were alright.\\n\\n\r\nOh god, the characters. There is no development. Whatsoever. The characters are stagnant, fetishized stereotypes of lesbian women (or pan, as it seems in Sara's case) and there's nothing beyond that. After watching this, I feel uncomfortable knowing it probably served as something for people with a lesbian fetish to jerk off to and nothing else. There is no plot or characters pretty much-- this anime exists purely for those who looks for lesbian smut and nothing else. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this. I dreaded watching the episode every weekend as it came out. It was terrible. I watched a lot of airing anime this year (which I usually don't do) and this was always the worst part of my weekend, spent banging my head against a wall and going \"why?\". As one of those OCD people who has to finish all the shows I start, this was torture for me. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if you: like lesbian smut for the sake of having girlxgirl in it, like the classic sexual assault trope, like the pretty art\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if you: are big on consent, were looking for real romance, wanted real plot, wanted real characters/character development, hate fetishism of sexuality\\n\\n\r\nI wish I had read an honest review about this before I started watching. Anyways, have a great day everyone!",

            "content": "Overall.\r\nOverall this anime isn't going to hit a 10 in any category regarding it's quality as an animated feature - frankly, it just isn't. It's not a work of art or a musical masterpiece, it doesn't rely on dynamic aesthetics to hook you. That said the art and sound really aren't bad; just don't expect to much from them, and let them do their job quietly. I feel like the presentation of the characters is a bit exaggerated and clunky, but at the same time it's probable the original subtlety of certain(especially Mei's) expressions would have been quite hard to replicate in animation without riskingbeing overlooked. The cliffhangers kind of annoy me, but that's probably just impatience, and although I'm being especially critical I actually have hopes that this will gain enough recognition to be continued. In the end, this is just a story about a girl, who meets a girl, and how the shit hits the fan. Please enjoy it!\\n\\n\r\n(Before watching this anime I was pretty nervous, as I'm a big fan of the original, but know as a yuri, and with therefore a comparatively small fanbase, this wasn't likely to get the best funding and quality. It was hard to tell much from the PVs aside from the art style, which, although isn't as elegant as in the manga actually turned out alright. I've seen this anime get bashed quite a bit already, which is disheartening, but I decided to watch it anyway.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThere are some slight changes here and there, but so far pretty minor details. I feel like there are a lot more awkward moments than in the manga, but maybe that's just because in the manga I could take my time wincing at Yuzu's cringes ^^\". The episodes are definitely big on cliffhangers, and the original drama in the plot is worthy of korean TV, so if you don't like that then please don't hate on it, Citrus just probably isn't for you - otherwise you will become hooked, as Saburouta is ruthless!\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\r\nThe art, as I mentioned before, isn't anything special, but actually I think it's been adapted pretty well in the simplification for animation, and it's good and consistent, which is a relief. The animation itself seems to be masquerading as a high visual anime (the kind that shows hair shifting in the breeze) but is somewhat clunky, as though it could use more frames for the most fluid movements, and clearly takes shortcuts with layers occasionally, however it's not too bad either. Not something you'll really notice after a few minutes.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nUm, there's no way around it, I was seriously underwhelmed by the OP.\\n\r\n((side note - not to mention the fact that in the opening sequence alone there are probably more kisses than in the first two or three books together... I can see why people are bashing this as fan service now (this isn't the only instance, first example is what should be sudden proximity is now extended groping :/ ??) That makes me kind of sad, because we've now seen everything before we've even begun, and it takes the thrill out of the romance - anyone who has read the manga will know what I mean, because in the manga actual kisses are preciously rare to start with (we'd get like, four a year, seriously war rations for fangirls T^T), and each one represents new progress in their relationship. Well anyway, whether you're about fanservice of not, this isn't an ecchi, so don't expect it.))\\n\r\nAlso, I never expected Yuzu to be that bad at singing ^^\" but honestly it's not that out of character, so I'll let it pass. The ED was better, although it wasn't amazing. \\n\r\n((there is a montage of what seems to be blatantly collaged original art and new sketches, or maybe it's just a careless impression of Saburouta - the faces are good, but in some images pretty much everything else is botched?? It's just the ED though.))\\n\r\nAs far as Seiyuus are concerned, well, it didn't strike me like \"Oh my god, that's Yuzu!\" but it's not terrible either, although it reminds me of Louise from Zero no Tsukaima. Mei's voice seems a bit high in pitch, and even a bit too mature, which was unexpected considering she should sound mature(maybe it sounds aged?), but it's pretty much the same as Yuzu's in terms of whether it fits the character. Harumin's is also a bit mature, but honestly I think it fits best of the three ^^\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nFor newcomers the main characters are pretty much polar opposites - Yuzu is bright and loud, headstrong, righteous and optimistic. She's also quite simple, she desperately wants to fall in love, and her dream is to be a caring housewife. Mei on the other hand is depressed and systematic, tending to accept what is expected of her, without much passion for anything, aside from running the perfect school. I'm sure you've guessed already, but Yuzu's kind and candid, if somewhat idiotic nature slowly starts to warm and heal Mei's heart. I mean slowly. That heart is a glacier so deep in the antarctic the penguins could huddle there all winter. But Yuzu's pretty oblivious in some ways, so she goes and ploughs ahead anyway ^^\"\\n\r\nAs the story progresses we meet new characters, each with their own problems and personalities, and bring something for the girls to learn in order to move forward.\\n\r\nIf I'm comparing to the manga then Mei is probably more expressive, or rather, her expressions are less subtle, and the transitions between her cool and not cool aren't exactly smooth as a result, but she's still generally a very taciturn character; Yuzu...well I think you get a stronger sense of her airheadedness and childish side? The only other character we've met properly so far is Harumin - Harumin is perfect imo, and fits exactly where she should as Yuzu's support (and that unavoidable rogue ship) - it's also nice to see the contrast of her make up when she goes out with Yuzu.\\n\r\nI feel a bit like the importance of Yuzu's mother isn't shown very well in the anime. In the manga it's clear how much Yuzu cares about her mother's happiness, but it's not so clearly understood, which is a shame, because that part of Yuzu's character is probably one of the things that isn't just \"typical gyaru\" that everyone immediately labels her - don't get me wrong newcomers, she's definitely dressed for it, but she has various reasons, which include wanting to be beautiful, but hearing her side it becomes such that she doesn't feel like such a 2D character (no pun intended ^^\").\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nAlthough I can't exactly say this is the height of anime, maybe because I wasn't expecting much from this anime I can definitely enjoy it, I'd recommend this to my friends, and unless something drastic happens I'll definitely keep watching. I'm hoping of course that the anime stays on track, and that I can keep seeing my favourite yuri come to life. I can't believe I'm caught on a cliffhanger when I already know the plot!",

Citrus presented an interesting concept for a romance story. Our Gyaru protagonist (woo!) Yuzu falls in love with her new-to-the-family slightly younger step sister.  The show sets up a plot that would have this couple face the problems that come with this sort ofrelationship as well as Mei's (the younger step sister) obligations to her biological family. If the show stuck to this it could have been something really powerful and probably had a lasting impression on me. The show didn't keep things simple though. Instead the story fell back on the worst kinds of romance tropes with each arc introducing some new character to throw a wrench in the protagonists relationship. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of focusing on a story that was well grounded in reality we delve into strange melodramatic tropes and reasoning's for character actions and it just comes off feeling hollow. Something every romance must do is balance the conflict in it's story. If things get too heavy or absurd than the suspension of disbelief allowed for immersion is broken, or the viewer will get frustrated at characters not acting like sane human beings. Citrus absolutely failed in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED was fairly typical and nothing to write home about and the same few tracks were recycled for the entire show. The art style had a really indistinguishable shoujo look. With a bland visual aspect the story needed to carry this one but the relationships exampled in this story were just plain toxic with the exception of Harumi Taniguchi who was a pretty legit friend in all honesty. \\n\\n\r\nCitrus was like a waiter carrying a platter with a fresh and interesting Yuri romance to my table, but on their way over they kept stopping at other people's tables, forgetting what order was mine and bringing me the wrong thing. I only have so much patience and Citrus really tested it. I completed the meal, but have no intention to come back for more.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ah Citrus, how a disappointment you were. Some of my friends got me hyped up into Citrus after how shitty that NTR Yuri anime were (Netsuzou Trap). I don't know if this anime adaptation just sucks compared to the manga, because my friends kept telling me that it was very good. But after finishing this anime, I'm really doubting it. I'll try not to write spoilers, but you are warned.\r\nLet's start with the introduction: Aihara Yuzu is a \"rebel\" girl that always lied to her friends telling them that she has a boyfriend and that everything is going so great between them, after moving toanother highschool that only features girls (girl only highschool) things starts to change. The main reason why she moved was because her mother got engaged to a man whose father is the director of the school. After being scolded by many girls (of the school committee and teachers) she finds a male teacher that cheers her up. After some events Yuzu spies on that male teacher because reasons, and finds up that he is having a \"private\" time with that girl of the committee that scolded her, and this is were everything begins. I don't remember that much, but I believe that Yuzu after hearing some rumors about their relationship being \"forced\" she went by herself and argue with that girl (which name is Mei) and voala, Mei kisses Yuzu for no apparent reason. (This should give you an idea of how Mei is) Then after some events, her mother tells Yuzu that the daughter of her new father is going to stay at home, and what a surprise, that girl is Mei.\\n\\n\r\nThat pretty much sums up what the first episode were. At first glance, I was okay with that, Yuzu trying to sort her feelings after knowing Mei was her sister and thinking a lot about that kiss Mei gave her. But everything goes downhill beyond this point, why? Well this anime seems to have the most retarded and generic stories ever. Each time Yuzu starts to get closer to Mei, someone appears and slowdowns their \"development\" just to spice that \"drama\"(a very cringe inducing drama I must say) That serves no purpose whatsoever but to destroy their relationship where the one at fault is always Yuzu. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode, this show just gives me even more reasons to punch Yuzu in her face because of how stupid and submissive she is. I mean, being submissive is not a bad thing at all, it is cute in a certain way, but in this case is very infuriating and cringe inducing. Her whole personality is the same as your typical generic harem protagonist. They always want to be nice with everyone. So it doesn't matter if someone does bad things against her, she will stupidly smile at them and forgive them for no apparent reason. I mean, if a \"friend\" of mine comes at me full of jealousy and tries to destroy the relationship I have with someone I like, I would probably be really mad at her while leaving things clear between us, and if that doesn't work, nothing that cutting ties with that \"friend\" won't do.\\n\\n\r\nEven worse, Mei is a fucking bitch, no matter how excused she is, or how sad her background is, she won't be forgiven on my book. Each time Yuzu fucks up, Mei won't listen to her and will go around acting like bitch and submit herself with whoever she finds (in this case girls that comes to \"spice\" the drama), what makes it worse is that Mei harasses Yuzu each time she has the chance which is very cruel for Yuzu who is trying to reach her heart. This is were Yuzu's submissive being ruins everything, If it weren't for that, she would have move on and hang out with someone else, for example Harumin (which is best girl btw), but no, not matter how son of a bitch Mei is, Yuzu will always forgive her. And here I thought that Matsuri was the one that deserved to be hated the most, but that price goes for Mei.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation and Sound department doesn't hold any interesting to talk of. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10: Even if what I said sounded like I were dying by watching this, this anime is quite enjoyable if you forget what is happening. I mean, the fan service itself is enough for that matter if you know what I mean ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10 (more specifically 4,4): Harumin is best girl.",

            "content": "As a manga reader, there\u2019s many things that must be addressed. For one, since it was 12 episodes long, I knew it would end in the shittiest arc possible. I hated it in the manga, I hate it here as well. Second, the adaptation was close to perfect, unfortunately the presentation of certain scenes were overly expressed more than it needed to be. With the 90% Rape and the 10% Consent, I felt a need, a need to think about this again.\r\nLet me get this straight, as of right now, I enjoy the manga. The latest chapters started spicing things up. However, since the animeadapted such a crappy arc in the first place, there comes no surprise to when I say that I hated the second half of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCitrus is a Yuri manga that decided to show up after a long time since its announcement. It\u2019s one of those series where you say \u201cfuck it, there\u2019s yuri.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nWhen I first made my review, I gave it an 8, simply for the fact that I\u2019m biased towards yuri and am basically obligated to watch it for such a reason. But knowing the fact that it goes downhill once the second half begins, just enjoying it for the \u201cyuri\u201d doesn\u2019t become something I say often.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half is what you call exceptional, a girl goes to an all-girls school where her mom remarries and her step sister turns out to be someone of important. Thus the encounter captivates her and gives her the green-light to pursue such a love. But can such a love succeed when all Mei can do is use her hands for anything but love. I understand her situation, I get that her only way of communication can be through sexual acts, but when this continues for a long time with little to no change throughout the series, it makes it harder to take her seriously each time.\\n\\n\r\nI appreciate the mature-ish tone that the anime decided to take, but each time they try to make it \u201cimpactful,\u201d the actual effect decreases each time they attempt this. I also disliked the fact that they try to drag out the story but putting *ahem* \u201cantagonists.\u201d The first time Matsuri showed up, I was pissed, but thankfully later on she redeemed herself a little bit and became more tolerable. Now when Nana and Sara showed up, oh boy I was attempted to drop the manga there and then. Even though Sara and Nana didn\u2019t stay within the main focus for too long, I just disliked the fact that they\u2019re practically insert characters to prolong the conflict as long as possible.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, not everything about Citrus is bad. The art for the anime looks just about the same as Uta\u2019s drawings, which I do appreciate. The voice acting was superb, each seiyuu fulfilled the role perfectly and captured the feelings no matter the circumstance or situation. The music and opening song were fantastic since I appreciate the stuff nano.RIPE makes. The animation was fine but the CGI near the start of the series was really off-putting. Thankfully, this occurs less as it goes on. Those were really my two cents of the series. I didn\u2019t hate everything about it, but boy did it get annoying to watch later on.\\n\\n\r\nCitrus as an adaptation did well. It followed the panels and it showed almost every detail. Unfortunately they extended scenes that were not needed. Even if it didn\u2019t drive off from the original source, there are things that must not be added. It was quite a shame that it ended off at one of the worst arcs possible, however if you do have the time to read past where the anime ended, then I suggest you would. The manga does get somewhat better, but don\u2019t expect it to be amazing. I am enjoying it thus far now. I do have one pet peeve however, I hated, and I mean hated the way they adapted chapter 8\u2019s kiss scene (out of love). That kiss was one of the best in the manga, and it looked awkward and weird on the anime. That\u2019s just me being picky though.\\n\\n\r\nCitrus succeeded in terms of adaptation, but failed in all other aspects. Although it falls flat, I must say that Saburo Uta did one thing right\u2026\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMaking Harumin one of the hottest characters in existence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It is clear that the main focus here is the relationship between the 2 main characters. We have some sidestory sprinkled here and there which is nice. It could be better, but it's enough. The drama is a bit cheap sometimes tho. The backstory is kind of superficial and character development is predictable.\r\n-ART (7-8): Art is slightly above average. Characters have enough individuality, without crazy haircolors and clothing. The fanservice is the main focus.\r\n-SOUND (7): Not much to say, the songs are good, the voice acting is fine.\r\n-CHARACTERS (7):Are not entirely stereotypical. Yuzu is not as superficial as you'd think, Mei isn't always serious and Himeko has a soft side. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9): Ah, the entirely subjective part. I really enjoyed this anime because it is the best yuri I have seen so far. I don't mind the slight incest, because I don't feel it is the main focus. You should definitely watch this anime for the yuri.\\n\\n\r\n==> Overall: 7.5 (8)",

            "content": "After watching and expertly taking notes on the various styles of kiss scenes that the animators deployed on its viewers, my #squad have formally decided that this anime was a Load of Bolognese. Yes, I do know that it is spelled bologna, but a dear friend of mine spells it this way, so I do as well. [Breaking news: she has recently proclaimed herself as dead, so I will continue to spell it as bolognese for the rest of my life in Memory of my dear, dead friend...]\r\nOn a more serious note, the episodes themselves were very confusing. The storyline didn't make quite a lotof sense as we skipped around maybe eight (8) episodes in a span of 5 minutes and jumped straight to the ending. While there were parts that made every gossip in town gasp while whispering, \"Tea......\", there wasn't enough substance for them to continue saying, \"Tea...................\" For instance, when that pink haired girl who looks like that other pink haired girl from dokidokiLiterature club but with a red jacket took a picture of natsumi kissing Meimei, she didn't do anything with the photos (or at least in the 2 seconds we saw her in the parts that we skipped to). We were severely disappointed in the tension build-up throughout this entire episode, as we are all firm believers that if your animation's storyboard is not entertaining in every other storyboard, then your story isn't that entertaining. Period. Take, for instance, Finding Dory. Each time you skip around (as I often do to see if a story is entertaining in short span of time), each scene is as exciting as the last with either a chase sequence, scenery, or general story build up to the final conclusion of actually Finding Dory.\\n\\n\r\nTHe smear frames in the episodes were too long. With our expert OSU eyes, we easily spotted them in half a second and naturally skipped back to the scene to pause and laugh at. Although smear frames are a must for fast-paced scenes, they are not needed when that blonde girl who looked like the main character from Shugo Chara was getting groped as her water bill increased because she never bothered to turn the water off in that one scene in the kitchen. Furthermore, the art style is just. Lazy...? Like why was the dad skinny in her memories but chubby in the photo? Did they get their lore wrong? Or is Meymey's memories just so hazy from being so young that she forgot that her dad was actually a King DUmpling.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the actual character designs are alright. Until about 4 minutes into each episode where they introduce a new character that it looks almost exactly lik a different well-known character. I could list a few RIGHT NOW.\\n\r\n     - I mentioned this before but Natsumi looks exactly like Natsumi from DokiDokiLiteratureClub. Her pink hair with the C-shaped curls are the exact same style as Natsumi's along with her bangs.\\n\r\n     - There's a girl who looks exactly like Teto Kasane, a welll-known vocaloid. She has the same curls (drill style), but her's are \"natural\" apparently. We all forgot her name because she was so insignificant to the plot. Memna?\\n\r\n     -There's a girl who looks like Mema from Anoharana. She looks almost exactly like her and she even has a crush on her older sister, just like in ANo Havana. \\n\r\n     - There's probably more , but we skipped around too much to see any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the next point of topicWOULD be the soundtrack; however, I was watching the entire thing on 2x so I didn't actually get to hear any of the music in the background. Furthermore, I was also laughing and playing a mobile game which ALSO was a rhythm game, so if any of the music did get out of my laptop, it didn't reach my ears. I'll rate it a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd, last but certainly least, the ending. We did not enjoy it. four out of ten.\\n\\n\r\nI lied. I want to talk about the grandpa. Personally, I find it quite distrubing that the grandpa was preparing his legal forms for his will and such after he was hospitalized for his Meymey, but nothing in the show was ever shown talking about it thereafter. They just threw it at us and left. He didn't even die in the end.\\n\\n\r\nI also want to talk more about the ending. After discussing with my excellent consort of trusted advisors, we have reached the conclusion that the ENDIGN was ALSO bolognese. The two main pair walk off into the distance while holding hands and into a white title card that has the less-than-impressive title font in Times New Roman with a clipart of a cut orange in the background. What does that even mean. How are we, as the dedicated viewers, supposed to enjoy this show without even knowing if they have a happy ending or not. Does the grandpa ever die. Does Meyamy eveer succeed her grandpa in taking over the academy. Does her father ever come back and show his daughter the love that she needs instead of just pushing it all on his new step-daughter that he litearlly never seen before that one episode he walked in with a giant bear. Does the Mom ever get a raise after working all day and night at the construction area because we litearlly never see her. Does the two what was it called again AvoHana sisters finally break it off and find healthy relationships that don't revolve around each other because they are literally 10 and 13. Does the AnoHana girl ever come back to life to haunt those 6 people that killed her. Does Natsumi ever break free from  Momoka and be able to develop her own sense of personality and goals in her life even after knowing that she was born from code to fall in love with a stranger out of her own volition. We literally never find out. Chao",

            "content": "*ORIGINALLY UPLOADED MARCH 24, 2018\r\nWinter 2018 brought us an adaptation of an ongoing yuri manga named Citrus, which began publication in 2012 in one of the most popular yuri magazine, Comic Yuri Hime!. Citrus may very well be the most popular yuri manga to date, both in Japan and in the west, just look at MAL\u2019s popularity rankings for proof of that claim. Though highly anticipated by the audience keeping up with the series\u2019 bi-monthly schedule, the anime was announced alongside a similar manga series named Netsuzou Trap, which bore a\u2026 less than satisfactory adaptation in Summer 2017, ultimately putting the yuri community on edgeas we hoped this would be a success.\\n\\n\r\nDid Citrus manage to live up to the hype?\\n\\n\r\nIt is no secret that I am a manga reader of Citrus, and since I first picked up the manga series, I have been nothing but a loyal fan of it, and I\u2019ve cherished it so. That was two or three years ago, and even reading the manga now, I am proud to say it stands among my favorites, even though I am well aware that it isn\u2019t perfect. \\n\\n\r\nBut before I get into this review, I want to tell everyone reading this review to please read through to the end, or just read the end if you can\u2019t be bothered to slog through all of my feelings towards this adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nLet me reiterate; At the bottom of this review, I want to address everyone who was watching this adaptation during Winter 2018 or afterward, manga reader or not. There is where I will share my deeply personal feelings towards this adaptation of Citrus, Citrus itself, and the anime community as a whole. \\n\\n\r\n*This review contains minor spoilers, but the ones that are important I only mention in passing, so chances are, you will forget or not understand the context behind them enough to ruin your enjoyment. Read at your own risk, but there really is none.\\n\\n\r\nPRODUCTION (animation, character designs, music, backgrounds, voice acting, etc.): 7\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get the most superficial aspect of this review out of the way first- I say \u201csuperficial\u201d, but in reality, this may be the most important part of both Citrus and this review. The project was helmed at studio Passione and directed by Takahashi Takeo (Spice and Wolf, Yosuga no Sora, Rokka no Yusha), and while indeed there is a lot of passion to be seen in this production, you don\u2019t even need to read the manga to say that this anime looks inconsistent, tipping the lines between beautiful and downright ugly. \\n\\n\r\nThough I don\u2019t want to keep relying on the manga for comparisons in this review, I have to because quite literally the soul of Citrus and its appeal lies in its outstanding artwork, drawn (and written) by the talented SubaroUta. \\n\\n\r\nBut more on the importance of this distinction later. \\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the character designs are a hot mess. Well, actually they are actually quite beautiful when the animation is consistent, or they\u2019re not moving, or when they\u2019re not blushing! Seriously, I don\u2019t know whose brilliant idea it was to have the blushes be this bright pink that just doesn\u2019t meld with the character designs at all. I\u2019m not a professional artist, and the fan arts that I did a year and a half ago, have more organic-looking blushes than this!\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the blushes look cheap at best and ugly/ cheesy at worse, but that is the furthest thing wrong with the character designs. Though upon first examination (of the trailer, mostly), I felt that the designs for Citrus were meant to animate better by simplifying the designs in order to keep them consistent- it turns out that isn\u2019t the case. The designs on their own will hold, but they aren\u2019t the least bit consistent, especially for the dramatic moments (why?????). \\n\\n\r\nThese two problems on their own may seem like a problem all anime has to face, but this inconsistency easily becomes poison for Citrus. Scenes that were supposed to be gut punches to the viewer or just have a lot of tension are killed by the lack of consistent art and animation. Scenes where Yuzu and Mei are supposed to be really attracted to each other, shows neither of the characters looking attractive!\\n\\n\r\nScenes where Mei is supposed to have a densely emotional moment, or that Yuzu is supposed to feel inspired or serious, the art fails to communicate these feelings to the audience through its artwork, at least not like the manga did. \\n\\n\r\nI would be bashing it more, if it were not for the other aspects of the production though, however, I\u2019m still going to bring this up later. That said, the aspects of the production that makes up where the art utterly fails are (well, the biggest aspect) the cinematography and shot composition (I\u2019m throwing in all the big words right now). \\n\\n\r\nCinematography and shot composition- especially for scenes that work up the romantic tension (or any scene for that matter) are consistently beautiful. Backgrounds and foregrounds are ALWAYS dazzling (especially the school campus and Yuzu and Mei\u2019s house) and they always work to frame the characters in subtle ways. Takahashi Takeo really showed up some of the talents he showed back in Spice and Wolf because his techniques in visual storytelling were not only creative but manage to create a densely layered atmosphere, which compliments the equally consistent music and sound design. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was composed by Takahashi Ryo (ACCA 13, Classroom of the Elite) and he certainly didn\u2019t disappoint, though I\u2019d hardly call any of them \u201cstand out\u201d. That said, the music is really lively when it just needs to be comical, and really somber and nerve-racking when it just needs to be tense. Really got to applaud this guy, but then we also have nano.RIPE performing for the OP which has been one of my favorite bands throughout the years to hear OPs from, and Mia REGINA on the ED.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is solid as well, we have Kirino- I mean Taketatsu Ayana giving a solid performance as Yuzu. Tsuda Minami (Yui from Yuru Yuri!) giving an equally solid performance as Mei, and all the other voice actors did a great job with their roles as well, though I would have to question the choice of Matsuri\u2019s seiyuu. Not that it doesn\u2019t fit her character, but it probably fits too well\u2026 Well, that\u2019s just my preference, I guess. \\n\r\n(I guess I just like to imagine Matsuri sounding like the stuck-up bitch she truly is, but oh well)\\n\\n\r\nThere are some janky CGI character models in the background that look out of place, but nothing about this really affects the viewing experience, so it really doesn\u2019t matter.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the production of Citrus is inconsistent, but I\u2019ve seen worse. Perhaps some of the complaints I threw out here will be fixed in the Blu-ray releases. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 8\\n\\n\r\nOkay, enough singing praises for people you may or may not care about, instead, I want to look at the characters of Citrus. In technical terms, these characters are more or less the same as their manga counterparts. The only differences being that in the anime, the director takes some liberties and adds in many flashbacks and character building moments that weren\u2019t present in the manga, but more on that later. \\n\\n\r\nSo, the characters are more or less exactly the same as far as how they are written... except for one. \\n\\n\r\nMei.\\n\\n\r\nMei isn\u2019t as well written as her manga counterpart. But why? You ask. Don\u2019t they share the same scenes? Aren\u2019t their motivations the same?\\n\\n\r\nMy answer to that is, though you aren\u2019t technically wrong\u2014unfortunately, this is where the consequences of having lackluster art and animation come in. Excuse me for referencing the manga once again, but please bear with me because this will be the last time I go in depth with it before giving my final thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nMei\u2019s character, unlike every other character in Citrus, is brought to life by her art (in the manga). This is an undeniably crucial aspect of her character that the anime didn\u2019t get right whatsoever. \\n\r\nThat is because, unlike all the other characters, Mei is more often silent and doesn\u2019t know how to express her emotions clearly. But thanks to SubaroUta\u2019s brilliant artwork, she can catch the subtleties of her expression even in the most undetailed of scenes. It really gives off the impression that Mei is a living, breathing person- because though the writing around her character would be enough to explain the way she acts, she just ISN\u2019T COMPELLING without it. I mean, no wonder so many anime-only watchers HATE Mei because she ISN\u2019T being represented right. She ISN\u2019T being drawn right. Mei IS NOT a cold bitch that needs warmth, she is a girl that acts like a cold bitch that really wants warmth but doesn\u2019t know how to deal with others giving it to her. \\n\r\nMei is supposed to be an object of affection- Yuzu\u2019s affection and lust, and we\u2019re supposed to see that clearly as Yuzu\u2019s eyes are the ones we are seeing the story through most of the time. So why the heck is Mei off-model most of the time, and hardly ever look sexy? Why aren\u2019t the animators doing everything they can to catch each of her subtle expressions???\\n\\n\r\nBut if they nearly neglected Mei\u2019s character, then they definitely pampered Yuzu. Yuzu is so much deeper then she needs to be, adding tons of characterization and subtleties for her any chance they get. I definitely appreciate the effort put into those scenes, even if it kinda defeats the point of the surrogate protagonist that most girls should be able to relate to (that Yuzu is supposed to be).\\n\\n\r\nSo, Mei is probably a 6/10 character in the anime. She is characterized by being stoic, cold and stubborn, but lacking in the emotional depth that made her a compelling character. They literally ruined best girl. I could go into her whole story now, but I want to save it for later. All you need to know is that whenever pain is inflicted on her, she inflicts pain on others as a coping mechanism. This is explained in the anime, but again, it is hardly compelling. \\n\\n\r\nYuzu is a 9/10 character in general. She is hard-headed and stubborn, but more importantly, she is a go-getter and chases her goals no matter how hard they may seem to achieve. But more than that, she is your average girl, all she thinks about is love, and the connections she makes with others. She\u2019s very versed in social activity, so breaking through Mei\u2019s social barrier one unsure advance at a time makes it seem like the two were made for each other\u2026 Yuzu also isn\u2019t dumb. She may not be academically smart, but she has a way of figuring out the deepest parts of her feelings and acting on them without reservation, even if she can get caught up in her own morals or preconceptions.\\n\\n\r\nHarumi is 10/10 best waifu. I\u2019m kidding. The only role Harumi gets to serve in this adaptation is that she is moral support for Yuzu when she gets down or hung up on things. She\u2019s more like an 8/10, but she really can\u2019t be faulted for it though. She just doesn\u2019t have much of a role, contrary to popular belief. That said, she is fun, funny, and has one of the greatest personalities in the series. Also, she is straight, just clearing that up for the uninformed. \\n\\n\r\nMatsuri\u2026 skip. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters matter, but I don\u2019t want to muddy up this review much further with irrelevant banter, so we\u2019ll just say the rest of them are 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nPRESENTATION: 8.5\\n\\n\r\nThis is the juicy part. In this section, I will be analyzing how the narrative is presented, and how it compliments its production. \\n\\n\r\nFirstly, keep in mind what I said earlier about how well shot-composition and cinematography were used in this anime (though it doesn\u2019t always make up for the awkward artwork). \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the presentation is concerned, compared to the manga at least, everything is much slower and subtler. This is actually a double-edged sword. For instance, because the presentation is much more dense and subtle, the narrative present in the dialogue and action become much clearer to the audience. I don\u2019t think I thought twice about the meaning of any of the words in Citrus before Takahashi made that the focal point of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with this is that a lot of the scenes were meant for an emotional punch in the gut, and the way the scenes are directed in the anime often deliberately try to downplay the drama and flashy character moments for denser, more [mature] scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest shock of the anime was definitely the involuntary kissing scene at the end of episode 1. Many were disgusted at this though, calling it a \u201crape scene\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn\u2019t a rape scene, it was literally the greatest thing the anime did for Mei\u2019s character, along with a few other moments throughout the series. \\n\r\nIt takes full advantage of the animated medium to communicate an integral part of Mei\u2019s character, one that we wouldn\u2019t be fully aware of yet as the audience. That there is something seriously wrong with Mei, and whatever it is, it causes her to inflict pain onto Yuzu. \\n\\n\r\nIt is explained later that Mei is being abused- forced into an engagement with a teacher at her school that only cares about her money; that she is undergoing massive amounts of stress being the student council president; that she has a massive burden that she is forcing herself to uphold for the sake of her family- that being the heir to the school itself; and now she is moving in with a family she doesn\u2019t know or care about because the father she hasn\u2019t seen in god-knows-how-long decided to up and marry some chick she never met. \\n\r\nNow she has to deal with that random chick\u2019s daughter who breaks the rules she has to tirelessly keep up. \\n\r\nAll of this stress culminates in this one scene, and instead of just getting a pain-face like we get in the manga, we see how hurt Mei is through the animation and stage direction. \\n\\n\r\nWe see this scene from Yuzu\u2019s point of view, not really knowing much about Mei\u2019s life outside of what we see throughout the episode. Yuzu confronts Mei, she tries to pressure her by asking about the teacher she was locking lips with before. What\u2019s interesting about this scene at first is how Yuzu uses the same social practices she\u2019s used to, specifically the practices she\u2019s had to endure when asked about her \u201cboyfriend\u201d with her friends, to pressure Mei. She\u2019s basically acting high and mighty like she has Mei wrapped around her finger, and she laments about how a first kiss should be \u201cmagical\u201d. Mei can\u2019t deal with her shit anymore, and in an impulsive, yet calculated move from Mei, she pins Yuzu down and kisses her. \\n\r\nThis here is where the complaints come in, and also where the anime diverts slightly from the manga. \\n\r\nYuzu\u2019s carefully placed lipstick box and other girly accessories are knocked all over the place, acting as a motif for how this kiss literally messes up her world and everything she thought she knew about herself. Meanwhile, Mei, instead of a general kiss, forces her tongue down Yuzu\u2019s throat to teach her what it feels like. This was already a great scene, well-directed and pretty well animated, but the staff goes further by including the next scene, where she stands up- *her face bathed in complete shadow from the lamp behind her, not letting us (the viewer and Yuzu) in on her emotional state- and utters the words \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s like\u201d, before leaving the room. \\n\\n\r\nThis scene makes use of so many background elements, subtle character animations, and cinematic effects to tell the story they couldn\u2019t tell with their limited production values, and this isn\u2019t the only time they do it too. It\u2019s literally in every episode (especially the dramatic ones) heck it\u2019s even in the OP, like the divide created by Mei and Yuzu\u2019s sides of the room as they walk into frame. \\n\\n\r\nIn actuality, the anime does a lot to further to flesh out Mei\u2019s character (a big complaint I made before) and her past, and a lot of it is done by use of this excellent cinematography. But again, she isn\u2019t as compelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is consistent as well, none of the plot points, dialogue or character moments are rushed or drag on for too long, making me think this would be a much more impactful project if the production could only hold sustain itself for the impactful scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime seems to have this motto that \u201catmosphere comes first\u201d, and it certainly delivers whenever the situation calls for it, with the combination of all these elements. \\n\\n\r\nWRITING (Minor Spoilers): 9\\n\\n\r\nWhat is Citrus about? What is Citrus trying to say? \\n\\n\r\nThe reason this aspect is so ill-understood is thanks to the story being initially written to be fast and thrilling instead of slow and dense. However, the writing is still intact, so I want to talk about it here. \\n\\n\r\nSo, Citrus might just be one of the most contrived pieces of yuri fiction to date (as long as we are talking about its premise). It\u2019s as if SubaroUta wasn\u2019t just satisfied with writing a yuri romance, she wanted to also make sibling romance (not blood-related :P), she also wanted to make an \u201copposites attract\u201d romance, she also wanted to make a \u201csocial girl breaks stoic girl out of her shell\u201d romance, she also wanted to write a romance where one girl has blonde and the other has black hair, where every girl in the series is basically a lesbian (except Harumi and Yuzu\u2019s Mom\u2026 I think), where every girl is a sister to someone, where there are actually grown men in the series and a story that makes it seem like the weight of the world and the eyes of society are on the character\u2019s shoulders at all times AND IT WORKS!\\n\\n\r\nCitrus has a very competent narrative, even if we aren\u2019t always allowed to feel the brunt of it thanks to the anime\u2019s interpretation. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some flaws here and there, personally I am not that big of a fan of Matsuri and its myriad of love interests that all just happen to be female as the Yuri God waves its magical wand, but the topics that Citrus covers in its run are all explored in one way or another- at least to the extent that it should be given the type of series it is- not to mention how each topic enhances the growing relationship and *attraction between Yuzu and Mei.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and most importantly, queer (Lesbian) struggles are represented realistically in Citrus. It acknowledges how poorly misconceived the idea of a perfect, idealized romance is in both a queer context and in just in general. If nothing else, the series knows that no relationship should be idealized and furthermore, that none are perfect in an absolute sense. That said, it has so much more to say. Take Mei\u2019s and Yuzu\u2019s relationship with each other for instance, they start off hating each other\u2019s guts, but they learn over time that hate and attraction aren\u2019t too far apart. After they both recognize each other on equal standings and do their best to help each other with their problems, albeit without blatantly saying so (for Mei), the hurdles for them to get together come in different forms. Jealousy is a big part of Citrus\u2019 central plot devices (I call it a device but it actually makes sense), and the way competition with other characters and the idea that you can only claim the ones you love for your own is to put work and effort into it, are ones that are integrated flawlessly into the narrative. \\n\\n\r\nTake the beginning scene in Episode 7 for example, where Mei and Yuzu are studying so Yuzu can get into the top 100 and not get expelled by Mei\u2019s grandfather. This is the scene where Yuzu is so hung up about what the kiss meant in the previous episode that she couldn\u2019t concentrate on her work; this scene literally exudes competition, and this is also the beginning of the arc where Matsuri, the biggest snake in the series, appears. This arc focuses on the constant threat Matsuri poses for this stable yet slow relationship between Mei and Yuzu, as she could break it at any moment if Mei didn\u2019t try to oppose it and claim Yuzu as her own. Mei and Matsuri were literally competing for her affection. \\n\\n\r\nThis theme also benefits Citrus as a semi-incest series, because if it was an actual incest series then the whole point would be blatantly contradictory and hypocritical. Mei and Yuzu were forced to be sisters, and there are many times where both characters are wary of their new roles in society, even though they don\u2019t really think of each other as sisters (because they aren\u2019t). This adds to the sexual tension because they both know they\u2019re not SUPPOSED TO fuck their sister, but the temptation gets the better of them whenever they are alone for more than two minutes, except that beginning scene in episode 10, where Yuzu had the opportunity but chickened out at the last moment. \\n\\n\r\nAbuse and longing are also running themes in Citrus as well, though nothing explicit. Cas far as that is concerned, the core theme that the series tries to get across as well is that often being hurt and longing for more pain usually have a cause and effect relationship, and its only until you realize that what you were longing for will only cause pain, then you need take steps to take it on your own.\\n\\n\r\nBut if I had to pinpoint the biggest message the show was trying to get across among the myriad of themes Citrus (anime) has yet to even explore fully, I would say that it is ultimately about learning to feel for yourself, how to feel for others, and how to reciprocate others feelings in a genuine way. This comes across even in the anime\u2019s finale, when (*HUGE SPOILERS!) Yuzu and Mei reciprocate their feelings and start dating each other.\\n\\n\r\nThough we may never see any of the really good scenes animated unless the studio is passionate enough to continue on with this project (see what I did there).\\n\\n\r\nBut I\u2019ve been holding something back for this entire review.\\n\r\nCitrus isn\u2019t about connecting with others, abuse or pseudo-incest. \\n\r\nCitrus has always been about----------------\\n\\n\r\n*MY FINAL THOUGHTS*:\\n\\n\r\n-----------ATTRACTION.\\n\\n\r\nNot the anime, the manga.\\n\\n\r\nNotice how throughout the entire review I\u2019ve been saying how the anime is much slower and subtler, and the manga is much more emotional and fast. Many have called the manga of Citrus \u201cmelodramatic\u201d among many others for this reason- the artwork is bold, the panel flow is solid and fast, which gives off the impression to many people that this is nothing but a melodrama that just wants to cock block the readership and create conflict for the series to attract mass-appeal. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t true, on multiple levels, but where this adaptation ultimately commits its biggest sin is in failing to translate this CRUCIAL component. In failing to communicate Citrus\u2019 greatest strength and core theme that was communicated solely through the pacing and artwork of the manga. \\n\\n\r\nCompare the climax of Volume 2 to the same scene in Episode 6, where Mei and Yuzu kiss for the first time in a genuine way, with neither being forced to do so. After Yuzu shows sympathy for Mei by crying for her, Mei looks to comfort her, but the next panels clearly show the intense attraction- like a spark (!), that immensely swells and releases for the first time in the series. The next thing they know they are kissing- and the manga has a brilliant way of selling the rapid intensity of this emotion as quick exchanges of uncontrollable impulses.\\n\r\nAnd it isn\u2019t only this scene- this scene was just a payoff in the massive whirlwind of emotions that transpired before it. \\n\r\nCitrus has a tendency to redeem itself in its story structure in its last moments with massive payoffs to the seemingly meaningless endeavors that were built up every four chapters.\\n\\n\r\nEVERY scene is bombastic in its writing, creating a visual flair capable of even getting a gorilla looking for a banana to engage with the story and flip through its pages. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter moments and story beats, SubaroUTA has a genius way of keeping its audience engaged through the constant use of dramatic irony, tension, and authenticity.\\n\r\nDrama and contrivance works its way into the core theme of Citrus because ATTRACTION/ LUST--\\n\r\n-is fast and thrilling (like an addiction)\\n\r\n-is supposed to feel heavy the more it isn\u2019t reciprocated (like the weight of the world is resting on their shoulders)\\n\r\n-is supposed to feel like torment\\n\r\n-isn\u2019t supposed to make sense to the person who feels it (making it naturally confusing and convoluted)\\n\r\n-isn\u2019t supposed to give a sense of clarity until its climax\\n\\n\r\nAttraction and lust is also a universal appeal to pathos. \\n\\n\r\nWithout teenage hormonal attraction being the main focus of the story, it ultimately fails to inspire its audience with all the other subtleties of Citrus\u2019 writing. \\n\\n\r\nCall Citrus trash for having such a shallow theme as its driving plot motivator, but if you take a step back and realize that having its focus on the hormonal attraction between two individuals is not only a valid premise for an engaging *piece of art but is also one so woefully DONE WRONG in other media, especially with LGBT couples, you realize that Citrus has more balls than any other Yuri manga, AND manages to do a 180 and fills itself with exact same meaning as the emotion it is trying to replicate. \\n\\n\r\nCitrus is consistent. \\n\r\nBut more than that, Citrus is mature- even if it doesn\u2019t have the most explicit worldview. Any time that the manga looks like the writing is becoming one or two-dimensional, it reminds us of why we were drawn to the series, to begin with. \\n\r\nLike teenagers trying to find out about the vastness of the world, Citrus poses questions, it sets up problems for itself and though there seems to be no logical answer to any of it- when in doubt follow your heart- is a trope that is constantly misused but is breathed new life when every climax arrives- building on every dramatic scenes before it to give us want we want the most- progression. \\n\\n\r\nNo wonder why Citrus is the most popular Yuri manga right now. \\n\\n\r\nCitrus is a piece of work that inspires, among everything else. Love and inspiration might not be all too different, after all, they both come as a shock.\\n\r\nFor a series that focuses so much on where love begins and ends, how you\u2019re supposed to love and what even is love- in this world where the definition of love is so goddamn ambiguous that we might cross lines without ever being aware of it- the world NEEDS a manga like Citrus. \\n\\n\r\nBut this is where my personal feelings towards Citrus comes in. I first read this manga 2 (1/2) years ago, and I\u2019ve been a devote follower ever since. I read it at a time in my life when I didn\u2019t know how to act on my emotions towards others- and to a large degree I still don\u2019t, just I am aware of it now (I\u2019m just a slow learner). \\n\r\nI used Yuri romance manga and anime to contextualize the feelings I had because I was too scared to face them on my own. Citrus taught me throughout the years that it\u2019s fine to express yourself, that you don\u2019t need to care about what others think, but most importantly it refused to let me feel comfortable. Because these emotions and ultimately life isn\u2019t supposed to be comfortable or safe. It taught me to take risks, no matter how foolish they are, and I\u2019ve slowly been able to adopt this in many different scenarios in my life since then. And I\u2019ve never been happier when I did, in fact, if it weren\u2019t for Citrus, I most definitely wouldn\u2019t know what I want to do with my life right now. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, this anime adaptation of Citrus lacks that same spirit in many ways. In fact, I would have been plenty more satisfied if this anime took the risk by slicing and dicing, ultimately simplifying the story of the manga and ending at Chapter 25 of the manga instead of Chapter 16. Why do I say this? Because by keeping the story intact, rather, slowing it down and keeping it intact the anime manages to completely miss the point, and ultimately miss its impact. \\n\\n\r\nBut that opinion is of a manga reader\u2019s.\\n\r\nThis anime is still solid overall, which segues nicely into my next point.\\n\\n\r\nI feel much of the viewership failed to engage with the series on its own terms. \\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I made this increasingly clear that this project isn\u2019t exactly perfect, but the hate it gets isn\u2019t justified in the slightest, to the point that no one is taking it seriously, even when it's taking its own creative risks FOR TAKING CREATIVE RISKS. \\n\\n\r\nThe creativity in this anime adaptation is astounding, but the viewer\u2019s illogical reaction to it is even more so, at times. Mostly everyone is putting this anime up to an unfair expectation- that either being a mainstream or wholesome romance, one without so much taboo, or they just aren\u2019t expecting any of the drama whatsoever and they don\u2019t know how to cope with it (it seems like not many actually want a deep yuri romance anymore, even if they say they do). \\n\\n\r\nAs for manga readers criticizing the adaptation, especially ones that loved the original source like me, you are also putting it to an unfair expectation by just not getting real with it. Stop idealizing the source material and using it to definitively judge the adaptation. I made comparisons to the manga in this review, yes, but I used my knowledge of the manga as a vantage point to pinpoint aspects of the production that can be called discrepancies. I didn\u2019t use it to write it off because everything didn\u2019t stay faithful to the original source. If I didn\u2019t do so, I wouldn\u2019t be able to explain how the anime\u2019s lack of impact on the community came to be, because the writing literally isn\u2019t fit for a slow and calculated adaptation. \\n\r\nAll the adaptation did with the writing is emphasize different points with a different interpretation, and though there were some consequences with the decisions made, you also have to realize that these points were still in the manga. \\n\r\nThus, you cannot criticize an intentional creative choice for being intentional. You can criticize it for all the unintended consequences, but that\u2019s beside the point. \\n\\n\r\nSo, did Citrus live up to the hype? \\n\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed this adaptation more than any other adaptation I had the (dis)pleasure to experience as my time as an anime watcher. I acknowledge all of the errors made, but I still think this series is solid and deserves to be recommended to others\u2026 after they read the manga. \\n\r\nI\u2019m joking, but please be careful who you recommend it to.\\n\\n\r\nAs for others, judging from the score, it seems many don\u2019t exactly agree. \u201cOh well\u201d, I suppose, but I really hope I convinced some people here reading this that Citrus has value and should be recognized for it. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s recap:\\n\r\nProduction (Art, Animation, Music, Backgrounds, Voice Acting, etc.): 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters (Yuzu, Mei, Harumi, Matsuri, Himeko, Sara, Nina, Dad, etc.): 8/10\\n\r\nPresentation (Direction, cinematography, shot composition, pacing, etc.): 8.5/10\\n\r\nWriting (Plot, themes, motifs, symbolism, dialogue, motives, consistency, etc.): 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTOTAL: 8.13/10 \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not adding my enjoyment because I think this is a reasonable enough score to give this anime, and I don\u2019t feel like swaying it too much past objectivity.\\n\\n\r\nI hope everyone enjoyed my review if you have any criticisms of how I structured it, feel free to drop a comment on my profile to share your ideas with me. I just tried a new structure, so I'm not exactly sure how good it was...\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that, I bid thee a wonderful day.",

            "content": "When I decided to watch Citrus, I had never heard of it before. I\u2019d never read the manga, never heard someone mention the series at all. I just saw the picture, watched the PVs and decided it looked intriguing. I was hoping for a really juicy romance story with amazing characters and a ship I\u2019d support for a while after. After finishing the series, I was not disappointed. Citrus was a rainbow of emotions, it\u2019ll have you laughing at one point, in suspense seconds after, and leave you in tears (in a good way). \r\nStory 8/10: For the most part, Citrus is your generic lovestory. Main protagonist meets the love interest, their emotions get sparked, struggle to comprehend their feelings, soon realize it\u2019s love, and confess, all while the love interest is pursued by other \u201cantagonists.\u201d Despite this, Citrus still manages to stand out from other romance anime. Not only does Yuzu have to comprehend her feelings for Mei, she\u2019s struggling with her first real live being for a girl, a felling she\u2019s never experienced before (as far as I know. As I previously stated, I\u2019ve never read the manga). While there are others who also have feelings for Yuzu or Mei, they\u2019re all valid and (despite already shipping Yuzu and Mei) you kinda end up low key shipping it. As for yuri scenes, while there are a few there aren\u2019t too many that distract from the story which I appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: I loved the art style for Citrus. The colors were so bright, eye catching, and just beautiful. The artists clearly took their time to make each scene as perfect as they could. As an amateur artist myself, I\u2019ve tried recreating these amazingly drawn characters, and can\u2019t come close. While the general art was amazing, it doesn\u2019t come close to the kiss scenes/ romance scenes. There was real emotion on those faces which made it easier to feel for the characters. Eye appeal is one of the most important parts of making a good anime, and Citrus nailed it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: The opening was a super catchy, dancy pop song that almost perfectly represented Yuzu\u2019s personality. Each episode you\u2019d be dancing to the opening, and trying to sing along. The ending, while a bit calmer, also fit very well with the feel of the show. The music in the background was fitting, and was never louder than it needed to be and you could always hear the dialogue over top. The voice actors all did a wonderful job portraying the characters, and filling their character\u2019s voices with necessary emotion. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10: By the end of the season (hope for season 2) I loved everyone, but Yuzu and Harumin were the best from the beginning. Focusing on Harumin, she is the BEST supporting character since, well, I don\u2019t remember. But she\u2019s amazing. Harumin fills the series with humor from her first appearance. But humor isn\u2019t the only thing she brings to the show. She\u2019s an amazing and supportive friend for Yuzu and does NOT get enough credit. Yuzu\u2019s just a perky, waaay extra child but (almost) everything crazy she does is for Mei, and that\u2019s really admirable. I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of Mei at first because of some of her more, how do I put it, forceful?.. behavior with Yuzu, but after learning about her past and what goes on in her mind, it\u2019s easier to sympathize. While I won\u2019t go into them, the other main supporting characters, Himeko, Matsuri, Sara, and Nina are all super unique and each bring something new and important to the story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: If I had to pick a favorite anime of the season, I\u2019d say Citrus in a heartbeat. I don\u2019t usually watch anime in season, I usually wait to binge it, yet I kept up with Citrus. Citrus made my Saturdays special, and I\u2019d be waiting all week to find out what would happen next. The time between waking up on Saturday to the new episode would often be agonizing and I\u2019d spend the rest of the day obsessing over what I just watched. After that last episode, you\u2019ll want to rebinge it and read the manga immediately (if you haven\u2019t already). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this series a 9/10. Go watch this anime now, it will be worth your time. I hope you end up loving it as much as I did, and that this review was helpful.",

            "content": "It was really great to see a Yuri anime with a storyline that didn't make me cringe throughout the whole series. I definitely did cringe at this one too don't get me wrong (\"Mei!\") - but it was a nice enough storyline to keep me enticed and wonder what would happen next. It's your typical slice of life anime without any insane plot, but has a storyline that you can follow easily. If you're looking for something mediocre then this is it. If I could give any critique it's that the relationship was really oversexualized (probably cause it's a yuri anime) but I wish itcould have been more realistic. Also, there is some non-consensual kissing. I think that producing shows like this is really great even if it doesn't deserve a 10/10, especially for the girls out there that like other girls. Of course, if you aren't willing to understand lesbian relationships you're probably not going to like this anime. \\n\\n\r\nWatch if:\\n\r\n - You aren't easily offended.\\n\r\n - you support girl on girl relationships.\\n\r\n - you aren't looking for hentai.\\n\r\n - you like slice of life.\\n\r\n - you don't mind a mediocre plot/storyline.\\n\r\n - you can withstand bold characters.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for taking this review into your consideration :)",

            "content": "Let it be known prior to this review that I am yuri/ecchi/etc. trash. Of the /highest/ calibre. along those lines, this anime was practically made for me and my biases, specifically the sales pitch of a cutie lesbian innocent gyaru, I was 100% I was going to love this show, and for the first few episodes, that idea was solidified somewhat. But lets break things down somewhat to figure out why it ended up leaving me... dissapointed.\r\n-story-\r\nThe story started out promising, as mentioned above. On a very superficial level, I was loving it! but from very early on there was a nagging doubt, something thatwas bothering me. That doubt was how they were going to handle the various elements of sexual harrasment/forced sexual contact. it happens initally quite offhand, which made me pass it off that maybe I just interpereted it incorrectly, but then a few instances later, the show itself brings up this matter and then sort of... drops it. this was certainly one element that let to my dissapointment, since these elements can be extremely powerful literary tools! and if this show that was superficially amazing, ended up being good on a more interesting level as well, then we'd have a really great show on our hands.\\n\r\nOther than those elements- the story never really tries to do anything particularly interesting, beyond \"Hey look, they're GAY!\" which, I mean, cool. but that isnt as groundbreaking as it once was anymore. They introduced some new characters here and there, attempted to pick up the afforementioned harrasment themes and failed again.\\n\r\nI feel like the story would have been fine if it didnt try and fail, and stuck to what it knew it could do, but I do at least commend it for trying in the first place. Nothing will ever get better if people dont try to do something new every now and again.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\\n\r\nIts really rather pretty actually. The animation isnt really anything to shout about, but the style is quite nice, and the end cards are really cool, with a more artsy style that would make a wonderful desktop background. Props to whoever the artists where for that- Im gonna have to look them up actually...\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\\n\r\nVery little too say about it honestly. The OP by nano.RIPE was pretty good, the vocals reminded me a little of HSoTD's OP, which I also liked. The rest of the soundtrack was, forgettable, at least to me.\\n\\n\r\n-Character-\\n\r\nI /love/ Yuzu. She's pure and kind and waaaaaaay to easy to take advantage of sadly. But sadly most of the rest of the characters, to me, are just very bland. Mei has a chance of being interesting- with the attempted stoicism, and the strong but flawed character archtype is an interesting one, but I feel she is criminaly underused as such, I can name, maybe two instances where the elemnts of her character that /are/ intersting are used effectively.\\n\r\nThe side characters are just that, side characters, and in contrast to shows with a great supporting class (AssClass being a fantastic example) these side characters serve to spark 1 interesting interaction between the main couple, and very little beyond that. As literary devices, they're fine.\\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion- \\n\r\nOverall, I feel this show was a severe case of missed potential, its perfectly enjoyable as a generic Yuri, but its failed attempts at being more than that leave a sour taste in my mouth. I respect it for what it attempted, but in terms of my own enjoyment, I can't say it really appealed to me, certainly not as much as I had initially hoped.\\n\r\nI think I can recommend it if you are a hardcore Yuri fan, but not so much if otherwise.",

I feel like some reviews are trying to justify this shit BECOZ GAY.\r\nI understand the LGBT community is an under-represented demographic, but why don't we demand something better than the atrocities we've been receiving recently?\r\nI just want good yuri/BL anime. I don't ask for much apart from 'let them fall in love, believably, and have a relationship that works and doesn't cater to the fucking will-they-won't-they formula, PLEASE'. Bonus points for well-made romantic scenes.But I have been forcing myself through this garbage despite somehow knowing it would never improve. Whilst watching, I was completely indifferent, yet also mildly frustrated. I say 'mildly' as this anime evoked essentially nothing from me apart from the occasional hand-raise in a 'but why?' gesture.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, I feel, are the worst offenders - astoundingly bland and flat, and the protagonist is the only one to have the ILLUSION of a personality. Mei, in particular, is such a baffling idea of a 'character' - dull rapeygurl disguised as a dull cliche honor student. I'm sick of the more recent yuri anime doing this - one character sexually assaulting the other, questionably causing said other to 'fall in love' with them, whilst creating the most uncomfortable viewing experiences possible. We had this garbage with Netsuzou Trap, and I just absolutely despise it. I don't see how people can try and justify this sort of shit instead of demanding more established and healthy relationships.\\n\\n\r\nThe 'relationships' between any of the characters feel forced and monotonous, and I can't appreciate any of them. The 'plot' has no outstanding substance, and there are so many contrived instances of 'but WHY did this happen, exactly?' that is emphasises how unnaturally the anime flows. The actual 'provocative' segments instead become discomforting anti-fap material, despite the obvious intention. The dialogue is boring and cringey. The art/character design is uninspired and unappealing. I don't even recall what the sound design was like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was so bored that I felt strangely detached whilst viewing this shit.\\n\\n\r\nMy disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.",

            "content": "I have never, in my life, felt this compelled to write a review about an anime. I was on board with citrus for the first 75% of the anime, I really was, before I realized why I'd had this weird tinge in the back of my brain that made me ultimately uncomfortable with the entire anime.\r\nIt's not the stepcest, it's not the pushing each other around and pulling at each others clothes although it's still pathetic how yuri and sexual assault go hand in hand in anime.\r\nNo, it was the fact that the main character, Aihara Yuzu, is the classic abusive relationship victim. She's notthe perfect protagonist, and she makes her mistakes, but she without a DOUBT, makes solid leaps and bounds early on in character progression. She sees her mistakes, she sees her faults, and she actively works on herself in an effort to appease and comfort Mei.\\n\\n\r\nIn turn, Mei rewards her by treating her like garbage at almost every step. What is once seen as being shy, or reserved, turns into full mental and verbal abuse towards Yuzu. Every time Mei seems to make some sort of character progression, she undermines herself by reverting back to being terrible towards Yuzu who is always, actively, trying to help create some sort of peace.\\n\\n\r\nEven the near psychopathic side loli character ends up being more redeemable than Aihara Mei. \\n\\n\r\nYuzu does NOT know when to stop, and give up. In my opinion, that should've been very early on in the anime. It's almost uncomfortable to watch her be consumed almost obsessively by this love for Mei that Mei doesn't really shoot down. Yuzu is being led on and taken advantage of for a large portion of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say watch this anime, if only you want to learn more about what abusive relationships look like so you can better see signs of it in your day to day life and try to help anyone suffering in an abusive relationship.",

            "content": "SPOLER-FREE\r\nAs a manga reader I had a lot of expectations from this title. While the end result is not as good as it could be, I can't help but still feel satisfied with what I got to enjoy\r\nSTORY\r\nThe adaptation follows the manga very well, though there was some unnecessary exaggeration in the story's key scenes at the beginning. This is more of the studio's fault, because in the source material Mei's behavior wasn't so close to a sexual predator. For whatever reason, studio put emphasis on this aspect of the initial story , while the main point should be somewhere else. Later we have somemildly generic drama, which could be delivered better if the character's were closer to their manga counterparts. Another issue, also in the first few episodes is messy pacing, though it gets good later on. Despite all of this, Citrus was still enjoyable \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nI think that while there are some issues with the portrayal of Mei, the majority of characters were delivered skillfully. This is especially true in case of the voice-actors. There were some minor issues with Yuzu's crying scenes, but not as bad. I think that some of the side characters, mainly Harumin, didn't get enough screen time. \\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND\\n\r\nWhile the visuals were pretty good and animation mostly well managed, the ,manga still outshines the anime. The soundtrack wasn't exceptionally good, but managed to highlight the mood of the scene very well. The opening sequence is a bit generic in it's visuals, but the song is exceptional, especially on the instrumental side. The whole usually worked very good, though I would like more variation to the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS\\n\r\nWhile the adaptation has some issues, I think it's worth watching, especially in case second season is made somewhere in the future. The issues surrounding story and characters can be fixed by simply creating a sequel. A lot of important developments regarding plot and the characters happens after this anime's conclusion. What I'm most happy about is that Yuri anime finally starts getting good and breaking through to the mainstream. This is more important for me than this particular adaptation's mistakes\\n\\n",

            "content": "Being a fan of yuri is hard, atleast when it comes to anime. The list of all yuri shows is very, very short, and most of them suck real bad. And so every new show that resolves around such themes always gets a lot of attention. With Citrus, the expectations were big. But sadly enough, it didn't fullfil many of them.\r\nFor what made Citrus so interesting to begin with is that it's the first full-on yuri show without the element of moe in a long time. Now that's not saying that I don't like moe, actually it's the complete opposite, but seeing a show thattries to add a bit of drama and reality into it's greater themes really did lit up the fire of expectations, for both, the fanservice and the story. And the story, for the most part, is the main reason Citrus as an anime completely failed in what it tried to do. \\n\\n\r\nIt resolves around the relationship of new step-sisters, Yuzu and Mei, who don't get along very well at the start. It's just a matter of time before Yuzu, the more lively out of the two, gets kinda obsessed with her sister and after sharing their first kiss, falls in love with her. However, Mei has a lot more admireres than Yuzu thinks and that is soon to be revealed... While the story doesn't try to be very complicated, you can't but feel that not much thought had been put into it. It it completely shallow, without a clear original idea and even though the promised drama is kinda there, it is actually the thing pushing the whole anime down. The way story develops is also very questionable, as instead of focusing on it's main couple, the anime constantly brings-up weird and non-relevant characters that somehow manage to create a fuss between the girls.\\n\\n\r\nPropably the best way to describe the character cast would be saying that they're just not very impressive. Starting with the better, Yuzu is not a terrible main lead. She has this outgoing and dumb personality which I was never a really big fan of, but since it's so common in RomComs I kinda got used to it at this point. There are not many positive things that I could mention about her but she's just the kind of girl that is hard to really hate. Unlike some of the other characters. For example the second main lead, Mei. Who is, by any means, a bad character as a whole. Her melancholic attitude, her bitchy assertiveness and even her forgettable design all forge a very uninteresting character whom I couldn't care less about. The way she makes the biggest poor soul out of herself while constantly mentioning her somehow depressing past, which is by the way not depressing at all, is also not a very good way of making such a shallow character look better.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the supportive cast was supposed to have positive impact on the growing relationship of Yuzu and Mei, by throwing some dramatic moments into their faces, they didn't really deliver either. There is Himeko, who started off as the biggest and most annoying Tsundere ever while also being a student coucil vice pres which is great combination indeed (sarcasm). Then there is Matsuri, who is supposed to be one of those bitch-ass characters. The problem with her is that her bitchiness is on the complete wrong side of things. I mean, comparing her to Akane from Kuzu no Honkai for example, Matsuri losses that battle on every line. She, unlike Akane, uses pretty lame tactics to get attention, her reasons to do so are not really valid and overall she just acts like a total kid. I mean, she doesn't just act, she literally is a kid. There is hope tho, and that is Harumin. Thank god for once atleast a little likeable character that saved many episodes purely by showing her friendly and funny attitude. There are also those two twin sisters who appear towards the end of the show, but since their addition worked only as another reason for Mei and Yuzu to argue and then make-up, they were pretty much completely irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned drama, right? Yes, I did. On the scale of forcing Drama, Citrus would propably rank somewhere around the likes of Kuzu no Honkai, which I mentioned already I know please don't kill me for it. Which in itself wouldn't be such a problem, if the drama was the show's only goal. The mentioned Kuzu no Honkai, for example, was undoubtedly a very over-dramatized show. However, because the drama (and sex, but these two were related) was the show's only intention from the start, it was able to take it's sweet time with it and actually make it good. Which is the main problem of Citrus. It doesn't take it's time with anything. The jumps between comedy, drama and kissing are way too damn fast and unlogical to the point where you'll never even take the dramatic moments seriously, because they were literally trying to make you laugh like half minute ago. The cycle of every episode is almost always the same too. Starts off lightly, then something occurs, then Mei gets mad, then Yuzu cries for whatever reason, then she saves the day and then they kiss. And it's like that for the majority of the show. \\n\\n\r\nAnother area in which Citrus does terribly at is building relationship, which is something RomComs should be all about. Seeing your favourite couple coming from a blushing duo to full-on lovers mode is an important development aspect to this kind of anime. Citrus however, does it all wrong. Instead of resolving the whole story around Yuzu and Mei and giving them the time to fully develop their relatioship by themselves, the show constantly introduces new random characters that create some love drama through which then tries to continue the story. Not only this kind of appoach won't work because the ones pushing the story are not those who should, it also takes away any kind of satisfaction the moment they actually end up together, because outside of some rare moments, they just haven't had any remarkable time to set-up this kind of ending.\\n\\n\r\nCredit where credit is due tho. What I really liked for example are the personal changes of some characters. Himeko in particular. You see, she starts off as the biggest and loudest Tsundere ever, but as soon as she gets rejected, she redeems herself and becomes a fairly respectable character for the rest of the show. Which is a good change compared to other harem-like animes when even the characters who get harsly rejected never actually stop with their sexual intentions. I also already mentioned that Harumin was a very likeable character herself and I loved whenever she appreated on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole yuri fanservice also wasn't very bad. Once I started ignoring the complete unlogicalness of the kissing situations, I got to enjoy them quite a lot. Though it's needles to say that there is almost no way of fucking up this sort of thing. Two girls kissing each other will always be hot. I still feel like they could've pushed the whole fanservice a bit further tho, and it's also a shame that Harumin never got any.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall art was good, but not anything breathtaking. The scenes look polished and clean, but  little is actually animated and almost every background is just a static image. I should also add that the character desings weren't very appealing to my eyes. They were either forgettable or just not very well looking. The fact that a lot of characters were using earrings, which is a thing I hate in and outside of anime, didn't help the whole art situation either. And the sound was.. okay, I guess? I don't really know. The voice-acting wasn't the worse but I can't even remember if the show had an OST, which means it had but it was just very shallow and beyond forgettable.\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\\n\r\nCitrus had a tough task coming into anime. There are tons of yuri fans, but only a handful of yuri anime. And having to adapt one of the more popular yuri manga didn't lower the expectations either. Even though however, Citrus as an anime fails at almost everything it tries to do. It's drama is not good, it's comedy is not funny and it's characters didn't hit the spot either. It still somehow manages to make the thing we all want, that being girls kissing each other, but that is just not enough. \\n\\n\r\nSo is the closure of Citrus, an anime that tried to bring drama into the world of only moe yuri, but failed miserably at it's quest along the way.",

That's all there is to it. As mentioned, another case of \"go and read the source\" if you want to know what happens after the occurrences in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo with it, let's intro with the characters:\\n\r\nYuzu Aihara, the once bad-mouthing bitch with a heart of gold (cough cough...sorry I meant densely gold) who claims to love her stepsister Mei but as evidently shown, no courage to pick up her pace, and always have to depend on her BFF Harumin (best character) to advise on her relationship paces with Mei.\\n\\n\r\nMei, the overly studious (and another dense) student council president, who is always reeling Yuzu on with her actions and emotions that are straightforward to understand, but due to the intensity, she becomes cold.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most annoying plot pointers, Matsuri the sexual predator that claims to have an affection for Yuzu (and as most of us see it), at the most obnoxious and cruel of a twisted personality possible.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the final inclusions of sisters Sana and Nina at the final moments of the show are just like a repeat of Matsuri's events, only less subtle and cruel but at the same time, incomprehensible at a time when the series is ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters here can be summed up in one word: Unknown, with their purposes well laid out but with an execution that's considered to be subpar.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nI will definitely give studio Passione props for their good artwork and backgrounds while really trying to censor out the intensifying Yuri moments, something that was sorely needed for the series to stand out in a comfortable way.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAnother decent area that's fairly compatible with what has been presented so far, and definitely appropriate for the light-hearted and intense moments, a good work on this aspect and nothing else to mention because there is nothing noteworthy about this area.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nEven though from a guy's perspective who's not into Yuri, I did watch my fair share of Yuri anime, and I don't remember it being this badly adapted (not after last summer's Netsuzou TRap), and for that, my decision to cement Yuri anime as more of an acquired taste is the only fitting thing I can say about this show. This show is really so-so, so watch it at your own discretion.",

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE*. Anything about plot that I say, is shown in the first episode so I feel it's fair game.\r\nCitrus is trashy, and that's why it's my guilty pleasure. I almost hate explaining the plot to my friends, esp the ones who don't watch anime, but I got so obsessed with this show so fast that I couldn't stop talking about it. That, and I loved to see the look on their faces when I say:\r\nStory: 7/10. that it's a show about a girl, Yuzu, who moves to a conservative all girls school and falls in love with the student class president, Mei. Oh yeah,and the class president is also her step-sister. It's straightforward, and the simplicity is nice. What is actually remarkable is that it never really resorts to cheap-and-easy drama. In shows like Grey's Anatomy and other dramas, a lot of the conflict arises from basic lack of communication, which is frustrating and inorganic. Citrus keeps things realistic within the world it has set up. The student body president, Mei, at an all-girls school is suddenly undergoing her first encounter with lesbian attraction. It's her new sister. On top of that, Mei is the granddaughter of the school's owner, and is set to inherit it when her grandfather passes on the mantle. I don't know what life is like in Japan for LGBT, but I imagine no conservative girls school would be happy about that. Meanwhile, Yuzu struggles to understand her feelings, while also building her familial and social relationships. Things get pretty zany as it goes on, but nothing ever escapes reality.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10. I like the art style. The characters are cute and expressive. Animation is smooth. Colors pop.  A variety of environments are used as settings, but when they revisit one, it always looks familiar. I give it a 10/10 not because it's earth-shattering, but because I straight could not imagine it looking better than it does. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10. OP is super hype, I love it. ED is forgettable, as in I don't even remember how it goes and I've seen all 9 released so far and last watched it a few days ago. Scene music is good and compliments the mood well, but also is forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10. This show has few characters, but that isn't a bad thing. It makes the most of each one. You cheer for Yuzu, understand her confusion, and share her excitement. Mei is a typical tsundere I would say, but it also fits the role she plays as president. Yuzu and Mei have a few friends, and while some are well-explored, others feel sort of flat. Especially Yuzu's first friend Harumin(sp?). She's more of a cheerleader than a friend, but she's pretty much the only one like that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10. Citrus is trash. It's ridiculous how much I love this show. It's not even bad; the core concept is even believable. The characters are fun, the story has enough twists and turns to stay interesting and build tension. Sound is about average (yes, at MAL, 7/10 is the median score pretty much). I love the art style though, which is what keeps me coming back to this. \\n\\n\r\nNow if you'll excuse me, time to rewatch eps 1-9 to prep for the new one coming out on Saturday!",

This is the kind of show that I can watch eating snacks, drinking my tea and enjoying how events are progressing.\r\nThe character growth in this anime show is fairly good. Especially the way how Mei interacts and handles the events going on around her, from feeling the need to isolate herself from her close ones in the sake of not wanting to bother them to the point where now she's more considerate about her newly sister's feelings and thoughts approaching the situationwithout wanting to give false signal or misreading the situation.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand Yuzu, energetic go-getter kind of person, isn't sure about her sexuality since she was always attracted to boys, trying to solve the problems that occurs between her and Mei, taking sudden acts for trying to do everything to be closer to her new sister and transforming herself from non-considerate selfish girl into a potential reliable romance partner.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is enjoyable to watch after a long day and that's why I like the show.",

            "content": "Citrus is a wonderful gift to Shoujo Ai fans. As die-hard fans of yuri anime, I would say citrus is more restless than the others. while the kind like sasameki koto or aoi hana have sweet and peaceful feeling, this one busy with events and maybe over dramatic actions. of course that isn't necessarily bad, if anything it would be more intriguing to watch. \r\nCharacters:\r\nMost people might realize this already, that some main character in romance anime usually dense beyond help. That stereotype might be used to prolong the series and delay as much as possible the conclusion audience have been waiting for (cough.. nise***).That's way some anime like citrus will be nice change of pace. The main characters are honest to their feeling, and it's very cute to watch. the others are unique and interesting as well, some are really funny, like Harumin. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story itself is good, there are no useless fillers, most of the events are related to the plot. The atmosphere feels serious, so if you want to watch something light or more playful yuri, try yuru yuri xD. There are anxiety and conflicts which we already know from the synopsis what is the cause (aside from mei own problem, which you'll understand once you watch this anime). they're both girls and stepsisters, that's why they hesitate. That alone make this interesting and intriguing. What is the solution awaiting for them, that's what we want to know.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nthe background sounds are okay I guess, it bring feels at certain occurrences nicely. what I really like are the OP and ED songs, they are wonderful and really suit this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWell I would give citrus 10/10 for enjoyment, I can't explain it well but the flow of this anime is just feels natural for me, I enjoy every second of it, including some cheesy dialogues (well you can't escaped that in japanese shows). The yuri or stepsister aspects don't bother me at all, yeah some \"Good and Noble\" people might want to complain and harassing this anime because of that. Really, just stay away from shoujo ai/yuri things if you can't stand it, instead of watching just to feel bad (of course that's applied to any other category). In the end, I really recommend citrus to shoujo ai fans, even though too bad it's just 12 episodes.",

I really enjoy the manga so I was looking forward to see how they will make it. Sadly, it fell short of expectations.\r\nI won't compare anime with manga but you just see the difference when you stay up to date with manga which, in my opinion, is far more better.\r\nThe story is quite interesting, romance between siblings (they'r not actually siblings, they'r half-siblings) is still a taboo for many people, even when it's getting more popular in anime nowadays, sopeople tend to show curiosity over stuff like this.\\n\\n\r\nArt: If you can't stand pinkish knees- don't watch it. It was the first thing I have noticed and was bothered by this at the beginning. Generally, the art is pretty good, especially characters' eyes that sparkle sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Honestly, I didn't pay attention to the sound so I guess, it's not outstanding. Also, I omitted the opening because the beginning wasn't appealing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Yuzu and Mei are totally different. The first one is your typical gal who likes to go shopping and do makeup, she's always cheery and she makes friends easily. The second one is withdrawn, chilly and tend to hide her emotions.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it? If you like yuri- you should definitely watch it because there are always few lesbian scenes in each episode. If you don't- it'd be a waste of time for you, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nIt's my opinion about Citrus. Hope you like it :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hi ! Another Robert's Too Late Review coming at you! This time, we're not so far behind (we're usually YEARS late) but fate makes up for it by the fact that this review will likely be on page 25 or further back of reviews, seen only by a single pair of mortal eyes and perhaps a bored Elder God or two. So hello fellow mortal and thanks for taking a moment to read this review! I will do my best to keep it up to the quality standards RTLR reviews are known for! I'll even discuss the RTLR wall of anime slobbery-kisses!\r\nToday we're going tobe talking about the oft-discussed anime Citrus. There seemed to be a lot of expectations surrounding this title (at least in the circles I move in) and there was a good bit of (mostly) unfair judgment against the show. At first blush, I also stuck my nose in the air, but after taking some time, and getting off my preconceptions, I watched the series again, and feel I can give it a much more honest grade. Of note, I am reviewing *only* the anime. I know the manga exists, and I know many readers find the manga to be far superior, and that it fills in some of the more puzzling aspects of the characters, but this isn't appearing on an 'overall media experience' page, its appearing on an 'anime review' page, so you will get just that because that is what my first hand experience covers. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nI actually did enjoy the story in Citrus. There are some bumps and ruts that lower the score some, but overall they did a fair job of presenting the tale well. The synopsis explains the whole how blondie Yuzu and dark Mei come to be together, so check that for details. Blondie Yuzu is very honest in the story, and admits to having no experience in matters of love. Her story arc reflects this naivety perfectly, as she's easily confused and gets her feelings jumbled easily, just as one would expect. The dark headed Mei is even more interesting in that she has been jaded by past events and uses what she has as a weapon, even when she doesn't intend to do so. It's ingrained into her by her life. The big rub for many was that dark Mei's actions seemed out of place and out of character. Some claim she does the odd acts she does for nothing more than titillation value. I don't find that to be the case.\\n\\n\r\nWhat we have is a story of a girl (blonde Yuzu) who is wide open in her heart being brought together with a horribly scarred girl (dark headed Mei) who acts out on her feelings in ways she herself doesn't even understand. Coming together, blonde Yuzu being led so easily to true feelings for Mei, who is truly confused and just thrashing around, the pair work through all their issues and come to know true feelings. Dark Mei is very similar in theme to Shizuma from Strawberry Panic. They are both damaged girls who have learned to use sexuality as a defense, even as a weapon to protect their hearts. Mei's overtly sexual (well, kissing everyone that gets within arm's reach that is) actions actually have a well defined and explained reasoning behind them. Due to the trauma of her life, she becomes who she is. Many dismissed the anime because Mei seems so random, but I propose a more attentive viewing shows that Mei isn't just some crazy kissing lunatic, but instead a deeply hurt girl. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of how both girls, on polar opposites of the spectrum, come to understand and accept real love is moving. I think a fair amount of people might not 'get' dark headed Mei's strange behavior because they have little experience with the kind of trauma that produces people like her. That's a good thing, obviously, in real life. Well, I've experienced and have people close to me that also experienced deep trauma, and I can say Mei acts in a manner that is authentic. The way blonde Yuzu works with Mei and handles Mei's meltdowns and such is very touching. Yuzu herself isn't sure about what is going on, or how her heart is telling her to react either, but she cares enough for Mei to keep working together with her to get past Mei's pain. Look at it for what it is, and that's a moving story. I can tell you from experience most people don't love deep enough to try to stay and help you through the difficulties that make you act out inappropriately. \\n\\n\r\nNow, why did I not score the story higher? Well, even though it hit me as very authentic, there are still parts that are handled poorly. I found the entire character of Matsuri who was brought in mid-way through as nothing more than a cop-out for true further emotional exploration. I also found the 'new' girlfriend brought in literally the last episodes to be completely rushed and not properly utilized. \\n\\n\r\nAnother ding for me was a side character that is a long time friend of Mei's that is apparently interested in pursuing a relationship with her. She acts as a foil to blonde Yuzu for the opening handful of episodes. The idea of a 'normal' girl seeing damaged Mei and wanting to protect her is perfectly normal, to have her basically disappear after being romantically 'defeated' by Yuzu in the race for Mei's affections was just sloppy. Honestly, they could have also written that trauma in a manner that was more direct and could have been more easily related to by people that haven't had such dark experiences. I 'got' Mei because I know girls that have been hurt, and hurt badly, and could immediately see how Mei's behavior was that of a troubled kid. But most people don't have experience with such troubled little girls, and I think that made it harder for them to come to terms with why Mei was doing such odd things like she does. I think it caused confusion, and a story should always be written in a manner to eliminate confusion. Mystery in the plot is fine, but things that seem contrary or nonsensical are usually not good calls. I could see Mei being nonsensical (and heard as much from people) when viewed with a lens not fogged by personal trauma experience. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nI LOVE the art in Citrus. Everything about how it is drawn and presented just wows me. I love the detail in the faces and eyes, love the choice of coloring. I adore Mei's purple eyes, and the small detail touches they put around in different places. I often find myself thinking as I was a new (to me at least) anime how well the art matches up to Citrus. I really do think of this series as a real standard to hold up. I can easily forget it is animation I am watching and I see the characters as real people. The backgrounds look good, the styling is smart, and the colors pop. Love love love it!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe voices are well done. Mei's voice is very well matched to her personality. She has that dead calm, almost emotionless tone that the characters requires. Yuzu is very animated, and her voice is bubbly and fun. As the series progresses, the actress playing Yuzu does very well in accentuating the name 'Mei' every time she says it, giving the whole 'crush' on Mei a proper note in her vocals. It's like she gets a little breathless and dreamy every time she even says Mei's name. Very well acted. Harumin, who is Yuzu's best friend, is also well cast, sounds right. The mid-point antagonist Matsuri is also appropriately menacing-sounding, as much as a young Japanese girl can be (which is a LOT us anime fans know!) and over all everyone has great voices. The opening song is odd, but grew on me, and the ending is pretty and I think fits the show well enough. My ears were pleased, I think yours will be too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nAgain, Yuzu's innocence and Mei's tragic past are both well written, well fleshed out. I would have given a full 10 if not for the fact that I think Mei isn't properly explained early enough for people without experience with troubled teen girls. Perhaps my own experience in knowing girls like that makes me think they assumed too much, I will admit. Guess that's why reviews are by nature subjective. I think they could have explained better for happy people, and happy people might think that Mei's trauma was explained perfectly when it needed to be. Hard to see things from the other side of the fence, you know? The girls' love for each other is handled well through their personal viewpoints, Yuzu with her sincerity, Mei with her brokenness, and the difficulty each has to go through to come to an honest account of how they feel and who they are is really well written into the characters themselves. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I do have a bit of issue with the mid-series antagonist, and the rival love interest tacked on in the last few episodes feels a bit inadequate, otherwise we're not so bad off when it comes to characters. Harumin is a wonderfully written best friend, supporting Yuzu and encouraging her when appropriate. Himeko is a bit over attached to Mei, but really does want what is best for Mei in her heart. She just happens to think it's her, and not Yuzu, of course. We don't deal in a whole lot of other characters, which I think is a pretty good call, story wise, to keep the focus a little tighter. In fact I would have pared down the last love interest, and had even fewer characters myself. There's a lot to unpack emotionally between these few characters, storywise. So thumbs up mostly for the characters too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI did enjoy Citrus, a good bit. I found the innocent girl paired with the troubled girl very interesting, and I did root for Yuzu and Mei both to find a way to break out of their respective, limiting viewpoints and cross the divide to the feelings they obviously had for each other. I could have done with less pink haired girls, and no silver haired ones at all, but stories have to have some conflict somewhere I guess. I think for me the lower enjoyment score is purely because Mei reminded me of some women I dearly love that were just like her at that age, and were only so because they suffered some terrible things as kids. I think it was more that it brought back painful memories for me, and that of course is not the show's fault by any means, but yet again, it does factor into the overall experience. And I know I'm not the only family member or loved one of a damaged girl, and for all of you out there that might happen across this, be prepared to remember some rough times when you watch Mei and her behavior. We cannot separate our own life experiences from our opinions of things, so mine is colored by what I've lived, and those times were very much NOT 9's or 10's on the rating scale. That's why I lowered the overall slightly while still having much praise for the series. \\n\\n\r\nMei is beautiful, she is tragic, and she is in pain, from the perspective where I sit. Yuzu is beautiful, and pure, and so upbeat and happy, from that same point. I found myself rooting for them to be together, Mei to find healing in Yuzu, and Yuzu to find maturity in Mei. And for them together to find a happiness that exceeds both of their shortcomings. I think I might pick up the manga for this series. When it comes to the RTLR wall of lonely hearts, I have one of Yuzu with her victory sign by her eyes (you'll know what i mean) and two of Yuzu and Mei kissing, because it has the basis of a beautiful relationship. Until next time, you guys!",

So the setting is a little intimidating to start as they are step sisters so ( \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u00b0). But i've seen a lot of yaoi anime and read a lot of yaoi manga so the concept isn't new or shocking to me. But I really enjoyed this series actually! all the characters have such big personalities and the art is so pretty.However the plot is a little meh to me I found that I got bored of what was happening in the storyvery easily and I tend to usually binge a anime when I start one but I couldn't do that with this anime. I would say overall it's a very cute shojo-ai with amazing characters with amazing art quality and the music in the series was so good! I love the ending song so much!\\n\\n\r\n<333",

It was difficult enough tolerating a character set whose morals seem to be as if they were raised at a brothel.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis was horrible too, proportions would be what you would assume to be if someone was drunk while animating this. There were multiple moments where we were given an overhead view yet the characters were standing sideways, so if flipped to real perspective, they were walking tilted downwards by roughly 45 degrees.\\n\\n\r\nLest we forget how in ep 1 MC wanted to put her phone in her cleavage but realized she was flat, then in her shower scene she suddenly has at least \\n\r\nC cups. LOGIC :D\\n\\n\r\nshe appears to be average in terms of her butt too, but on certain occasions she could compete against Kim Kardashian. once again, LOGIC.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nEither they purposely made the VAs squeal out the most annoying sounds they could or the VAs were just as disgusted as I am about this anime and couldn't be bothered to try.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED aren't bad though, I'll give it that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWant to get shock therapy to try and forget this shit / 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nPreteen boys would be so turned on by this / 10",

            "content": "Citrus is the most over the top train wreck of an anime I have ever seen in my life.  It\u2019s definition of subtlety is listening to the Eminem Show on the stereo during a roll over car crash and because of that\u2026 it is a ton of fun to watch!  \r\nCitrus is a very rare and special show that only comes around once every few years.  There are shows that are fantastic.  There are shows that are good and there are shows that are bad.  However, there are also shows like Citrus, which intentionally or unintentionally redefine the \u201cit\u2019s sobad it\u2019s good\u201d genre.  Citrus chooses to approach this through absurdly fake characters and an inexplicably inept grasp on reality, all while unapologetically exploiting the Yuri romance genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe first entertaining facet of Citrus are the fictitious characters, many of whom would never, under any circumstance, exist in our reality.  Yuzu is the star of the show as most every episode focuses on her and her emotions.  She is extremely obnoxious, care free, and grossly over the top to the point where everyone around her has to pay attention to her.  Much of the reason why she is so entertaining is because she is completely flanderized to the point where the show will disregard any realistic repercussions to her actions to accommodate her.  Much of the time, we see her skipping school, disrespecting superiors, and whining to others to get her points across.  However, much of the time the show considers her actions noble and justified adding to the hilarity of the show.  Much of the side cast is incredibly amusing as well.  Mei is a wildly entertaining depiction of a girl with sexual frustrations whose constant dead eyed expression and sand paper like dialogue produced many amusing \u201cWTF?\u201d moments.  Matsuri is a young high school girl who acts and talks like a porn star in her late 30s.  Many times the adults in the show are completely oblivious to anything happening in the lives of their young ones, which also adds to the fun because it allows the girls to work things out in their own over the top ways.  The character\u2019s ridiculous personas are so unbashful and in your face; you cannot help but laugh throughout every episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnother fun and ludicrous aspect of Citrus is the show\u2019s\u2026 \u201cUnique\u201d grasp on reality.  Most of the time in other anime the character\u2019s will have to change their personalities to accommodate for the challenges they have to face throughout the story.  However, as I touched on above, Citrus chooses to depict reality in an idiotic and nonsensical way to accommodate for the character\u2019s outlandish personalities.  This means in Citrus\u2019s reality, there are no such thing as consequences.  As with Yuzu, the other characters also choose to spit in the face of universal norms in incredibly distressing ways.  We see all of the girls, and I do mean ALL OF THE GIRLS choose to have illegal sexual relations with others, manipulate others through blackmail, and publicly disturb others by yelling and arguing with each other on more than eleven or so occasions.  However, the show decides to not only depict these acts as normal and justified but goes one step further by rewarding these characters for their criminal actions.  This depiction of reality to accommodate for the girl\u2019s personalities and shockingly insane behavior was incredibly entertaining throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, this show is a blatant exploitation of the Yuri romance genre.  As someone who rarely watches romance anime, I had no expectations for Citrus going in.  However, after the first few sexual scenes, that depicted Yuri romance as illegal sexual assault and then absurdly depicted these acts as normal and justified I was stunned.  The show bafflingly rewarded Yuzu and others when they attempted to assault Mei throughout the show.  This was even goofier because of how whimsical the writers attempted to depict these scenes.  The animation also added a strange aspect to these whimsical scenes, and by that, I mean that it is good.  In fact, the animation is almost too good to the point where much of the time the character\u2019s expressions cannot keep up with the artwork during these scenes adding to the hilarity.  The character\u2019s awkward expressions combined with the in your face dialogue were so insane and shameless, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh out of being stunned over and over again at the show\u2019s completely unapologetic attitude throughout the anime.   \\n\\n\r\nCitrus should be avoided by the faint of heart or anyone seeking any sort of genuine romance anime.  However, its absurd reality and flagrant attitude make it a great addition to the \u201cit\u2019s so bad it\u2019s good\" genre that should satisfy those looking for many awkward laughs.\\n",

            "content": "This is my second review ever. Lets start by saying that this anime is in the genre Shoujou Ai and won't be for everyone and it was definitely an interesting watch.\r\n_Story 8/10 : The story in this anime revolves around the relationship between two teenage girls named Yuzu and Mei. Due to the marriage of Yuzu's mother and Mei's father they end up living together as step-sisters. Because of this they have a relationship that is not simple at all and with their feelings it gets even more complex. A lot of the show consists of Yuzu dealing with her inner demons and asking herselfquestions such as \"what do i want/need?\" and \"what does Mei want/need?\". The pacing was very good in the beginning of the show (ep 1-8) but near the end of the show it became slightly more frustrating to watch because of how Yuzu handles situations so poorly. The story is pretty unique and it was refreshing to watch. I give it an 8/10 instead of 9/10 because of the bad pacing near the end and because of a certain character but I shall go into detail on that in the character section.\\n\\n\\n\r\n_Art 10/10 : The art in this anime was outstanding and it was one of the best I have watched in a while. In the first episode when I saw Yuzu with her makeup on it looked really weird to me and I really disliked it. However she ends up not wearing any so that was good (for me at least). The character designs in this anime were so good. The way each character looks different from one another was very nice to see because of how many anime I've seen where the girls all look the same. One of the best things about the visuals in this anime was the characters eyes. Mei's purple eyes just look so awesome and the colours of all of the school uniforms and hair looked superb as well. The background art was also very good in this anime and at some times looked almost like it was filmed instead of drawn. I give the art a 10/10 and the only negatives were how the lips looked kind of strange and Yuzu's makeup was just so weird to look at.\\n\\n\\n\r\n_Sound 6.5/10 : I give the sound in this anime a 6.5/10 because it was not anything special but it was also not bad. Like most anime it was just there and forgettable. However the music never seemed out of place and the opening was not that bad as well. \\n\\n\\n\r\n_Character 7.5/10 : The characters in this anime were really the deciding factor in its success or failure. Lets get into the important ones.\\n\\n\r\nAihara Yuzu - Yuzu is one of those characters in anime that is overall liked and she doesn't seem to have any real downfalls other than being somewhat dense. She is always trying to understand what is going on in Mei's head and she is usually unsuccessful which gets frustrating at times. Overall a pretty good protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nAihara Mei - Mei is another character that seems to be one of your general anime stereotypes at first (the cold tsundere/princess), but you will quickly realize that she has many reasons to do the things that she does and her depressing backstory added a nice touch of drama. She is not honest in her words or actions at all which leads to many situations that could have been avoided which is annoying at times, but its a part of her personality so it wasn't that bad. Her character added a nice sense of darkness and also realism as well.\\n\\n\r\nMizusawa Matsuri - All I can say about Matsuri is that she was by far the worst part of the show. The only purpose she served was to halt the progress of Mei and Yuzu's relationship. She has a twisted personality and is unreasonably mean. Her part in the show was very annoying to watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\n_Enjoyment 8/10 : Overall this anime was very enjoyable for me. It has a nice mix of drama/darkness and those heartwarming moments. The ending was very good as well and no strings were really left untied. The  supporting characters were pretty good and were not overused which was good. One thing about this show is that often times the way that Mei and Yuzu force themselves on each other can be somewhat disturbing to watch. When I say \"force themselves\" I'm not talking about raping each other or anything like that, but they steal kisses from each other and its sometimes uncomfortable to watch. The characters don't really get phased or traumatized by it so it doesn't have a real everlasting effect. \\n\\n\\n\r\n_Overall 8.4/10 : In conclusion this anime was very good and the art in this show is so good that I would say its worth a watch just to view the art. The story and pacing was pretty good and it was resolved nicely. Overall this show gets a 8/10 from me and I don't know why it has such a low rating on MAL. \\n\\n",

            "content": "While I can still enjoy an anime like this, I don't know if I enjoy anime like this or not. But, I admit it if I like shoujo-ai anime where women and women love each other without any sexual context. Yuri Yuri is one of the anime which why I want to dig deeper into this genre which I initially felt this is a thing that taboos into something I consider usual. By the way, Yuri Yuri is also one of the anime that I think is great if you wanna know more about this genre. But, I can also say that Citrus is alsoone of the anime for you if you want to enjoy the whole anime shoujo ai.\\n\\n\r\nFor some people, this anime certainly will not generate a comfortable feeling, feels weirdness, even feels disgusted. I know because some people think this is a taboo thing. However, I don't really understand the concept of what the audience wants to show about this anime. If I compare it with Call Me By Your Name, I understand pretty more about how the conflict and the relationships are built in a part. But for Citrus, the story is too repetitive that looks like a hustle. Initially, this anime has a nice first impression when I watch the first episode. I understand very well how the character of Mei Aihara was as constructed as possible and why she became like that. Her coolness to her sister's Yuzu Aihara made her not really understand what was in Mei's mind. However, her character is always reciprocal with his characteristics. Sometimes she becomes an out of character, a character that lowers the tone, and a character who sometimes build their own conflicts. Each story is also produced in a fast way. There is no detailed explanation of the characters until the story. If in the manga, this will certainly be told but I don't think like that. Sometimes being repetitive, sometimes characters are simply forgotten, the conflict resolution is not cleared, until the characters and conflicts that go straight into the main story. In conclusion, these anime pursue it's own pace so that have a neat to be not trim.\\n\\n\r\nRokka no Yuusha, Rail Wars!, until an overrated harem anime that will be launched next season's High School DxD Hero also worked with Passione. The visual artwork was well-constructed into match animation that how the theme is. With visuals which depicting the story of this couple of women to the background that I think is mediocre, the visual animation is good by the way. Some also I notice like visual details when showing the character kissing. For me, this section is built as detailed as possible. The extra characters are also sometimes made just like people who do freezes mob rolling in the street so it's just the important characters are turned on. For the art, I think I consider mediocre with some lapses.\\n\\n\r\nnano.RIPE is one of my favorite Japanese bands ever. The opening song which was performed's \"Azalea\" always kicking off when the beginning of the episode. It shows some relationship between the two characters and is really fit with the nuance of the anime. Mia REGINA's \"Dear Teardrop,\" I think it's good to bring the ending theme song though not as memorable as nano.RIPE. Ayana Taketatsu who fills Yuzu Aihara's voice is also very good with her voice that I often hear as Kotori Itsuka from Date A Live, Koneko Toujou from High School DxD series, Azusa Nakano from K-On!, and Suguha Kirigaya from Sword Art Online series. Minami Tsuda who fills Mei Aihara is same as Ayana Taketatsu. Only, her voice is very different when she filled Yui Funami voices from Yuru Yuri. I can't even realize her if she is the one who filled Yui's voice from Yuri Yuri while in this anime she lowered the tone. The composition score of Ryo Takahashi also makes this anime has its own tune.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really need to discuss this aspect again but I'll summarize it. There's Yuzu Aihara with her innocent and extraordinary personality ever since meeting Mei Aihara who's coolly transformed her into someone she never realized. There is Harumi Taniguchi who plays as the supporting character of Yuzu Aihara whose presence as a filler which I don't find it's important. There's Matsuri Mizusawa who just came without us not knowing her presence in this anime. By the way, this character is also the most hated character in this anime according to many people that have watched this anime. Although like that, this character is only held with conflicts that just came and forgotten just like that. Just like Himeko Momokino who initially had her own arc until she became a cameo who was just a supporter. In fact, this character has great potential at the beginning of her appearance as she helped Mei Aihara. And there's Sara Tachibana and Nina Tachibana who became the trigger for the two main characters. Despite this, both characters are not remotely memorable because of their appearance as they approach in the climax.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are some shortcomings that I mentioned, honestly I really enjoy this anime away from the bottom of my heart. It's charming, emotional, heartwarming, touched, and have a sympathy of how the character feels. The point is, I'm also a bit hypocritical in here. Though like that, I want to discuss one more flaw that's in this anime is a kiss scene. I sometimes just freaking out or surprised when this scene appears. I'm not too bothered with the scene but, this scene somehow always appears and sometimes the main character always say the same dialogue as \"What are you doing?\" or \"We are a sibling, so I don't accept this relationship.\" or \"Because I see you want it.\" These dialogues I often see to coincide with this scene. Though like that, it's back to myself that I enjoyed this anime.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, something that people always think is strange or taboo is not necessarily they can also enjoy it. Just like this anime where a stereotypical aspect occurs. It has a repetitive story, an over-accelerated pace, no detailed character depth, a conflict that just pops up, a less obvious conflict of completion, a forgettable character, a temporary character, a character that just comes out, disappears, became a cameo, and vanish. But, oh my god. I'm also a hypocrite if I really enjoy this anime. The stories are emotional, beautiful, moving, and heartwarming. I can't sort this out because I don't know which one I will choose. However, this anime is actually a trigger of a shoujo-ai genre where people always think is weird about this genre. It's stereotypical but in good ways. I'm not too impose your whether you want to watch this anime or not. So, if you wanna try, check it out but if you don't want to enjoy, it's better shunned.\\n\\n\r\nReviewed on April 3, 2018.",

            "content": "Citrus is sort of like a gore video.  You know you shouldn't continue, you know it's only gonna get worse, you know you'll regret it, and yet you can't take your eyes off of it.  The viewing experience turns into a sort of analysis of trying to pinpoint all the ways in which the show is terrible, and articulating them.  Now that time has come to properly verbalize all these ideas for the 2-3 MAL users that will ever read these words.  Shoutout to you guys, remember to upboat.  \r\nCitrus actually presents us with a pretty solid first episode.Sure, when you hear \"all girls school\" and \"student council president\", you should already have extremely loud alarm bells telling you to abort the mission. Despite that, it gave me a sliver of hope for what was to come.  It had some funny elements, and the twist of the semi-rape by the teacher spiced things up and left me wondering if this could be some kind of dark abuse story.  I could have been more wrong, but i would have had to go to great lengths, like thinking \"hey communism sounds like a dank idea\".  Already from episode 2, the downward spiral begins, and the acceleration only comes to a stop on the final minute of the last episode, when the viewer smashes into the bottom of the barrel at breakneck speed, shattering whatever was left of his sanity.  \\n\\n\r\nCitrus boasts some of the worst writing I've ever seen in any television show ever, including School Days.  The \"characters\" are just tools for the author to go through her check list of different girl-fan-service scenes.  The \"girl\" qualifier here is important.  You will get no tiddies, but you will get almost exclusively abusive semi-rape kissing scenes; because we know that's the only way females can get off (looking at you, 50 shades).  Every single exchange of dialog is complete non-sense, characters routinely come and disappear without any kind of explanation.  For example the teacher that was assaulting Mei in episode 1?  You never hear about him again after that scene.  Seriously.  He presented his fan service, and having outlived his usefulness, was discarded by this dumpster tier \"author\" without even a mention.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is the kind of show where conflict is ENTIRELY rooted in vapid feeling-based quarrels between the characters (see Scum's Wish, another prime example).  And naturally, these trivial events are being portrayed as life-changing catastrophes, and we're supposed to buy it.  Worry not, our precious characters will not be burdened by real issues such as poverty, violence, or illness.   X said something that made me angry!  Woe is me!  It makes you wonder, is this really how women see the world?  Is this the most touching source of drama they can conjure?  \\n\\n\r\nThe bright side is that this allows you, the viewer, to play the \"new character\" game.  The goal is simple : you have to guess when a new character will be introduced out of the blue.  Citrus makes this very simple, you know that as soon the current petty feud comes to a close, the brilliant author will run out of ideas, and copy paste some bullshit new girl.  I'm happy to report that i have properly predicted the apparition of almost all of the characters!  \\n\\n\r\nFor instance near the end, this new character comes in.  She becomes \"shinyuu\" (close friend) with heroine A within 1 day of meeting her.  And, behold, she falls in love with heroine B within that same day, confesses to her, and B agrees to go out with her.  They have all met in the last 24 hours.  If this happened between boys and girls, it would already be completely fucking retarded, but the fact that all the interactions are homosexual drives the non-sense up to 11 and shatters any sense of reality.  I'm willing to concede that of this extremely sloppy rushing may partly be due to the short anime adaptation.  But there is still not even the sliver of a doubt in my mind : this author is an absolute idiot, and would get outdone by the majority of teenagers writing a short story for their 9th grade English class. \\n\\n\r\nIn light of all this, Citrus is a fun trainwreck.  The stupidity is jaw-dropping.  You won't be able to look away; you will want to know how bad it gets.  And when you think you reached peak absurdity, it will get dumber.  As a bonus, you have well drawn, beautiful girls to keep your eyes busy while you analyze the shitfest.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is this decade's School Days; truly awful, but almost a must-watch for that reason.  \\n",

            "content": "A wise man once said \"Repetition is the death of art\" and no quote can be more applicable than to this anime. Citrus was as expected a romance, yuri based anime with a hint of comedy and love struggles. However while the genres may be correct, the execution was at best mediocre. So join me in the review of Citrus, to see what's right, and what's not.\r\nSo we'll compare it against another anime of similar proportions, Sakura Trick. Both feature excessive yuri, romance and kissing so I believe it's the perfect anime to compare it to as basis.  \r\nI think that both animes didwell into making a kiss look very \"kissy\", the same sort you can find from a hentai but a bit more restraint. The slight gasp and the flustered emotions from citrus to the more quieter subtle kiss from Sakura Trick, i think they basically did first base spectecularly. Audio and design wise, citrus is clearly the winner, even besting some of the current animes in character design and maybe fall short of violet evergarden and koe no katachi, big names basically. Audio wise also felt very airy and spacious with hints of background activity rather than closed up like sakura trick.\\n\\n\r\nThey did kissing well, they nailed the objective, give them a 10 already! Well not so fast. The issue is repetition. If this sort of detail of kissing was in a romantic anime like say koe no katachi or maybe chunnibyou, then well done 10/10. While most romance animes want to lightly sprinkle fanservice to make it as magical as possible, citrus decides to just pour the entire bottle. When kissing is done regularly and repetitively, it becomes superficial and very meaningless, very shallow. Like there is no meaning in it no matter how hard they try to express it. Sakura Trick also faces this issue but citrus did it way worse. While Sakura Trick only does it to people they truly love with specific couples set, Citrus decides that as long as that person is a girl, she's kissable.\\n\\n\r\nThe height of demand is a principle I use for shipping. Koe no katachi, I want them to start dating. For couples, i want handholding. For handholding couples, maybe a kiss etc. But for citrus, there's not much beyond it, because beyond it is second base, and that's too lewd. They were not expecting it and that led to a downfall when i get bored of something and I want more but didn't get it. \\n\\n\r\nThis would be still fine if there's other things to add to the magic of the excessive kissing. But unfortunately dear viewers, there isn't. At most one or two lines of comedy, the weird love \"polygon\" with very depthless drama, not even the slice of life part was done particularly well to fix the issue. Character quality wise, nothing special to add. While the main characters are ok, side characters are just jealous assholes.  \\n\\n\r\nCitrus was a godsent. Yuri, romance, kissing. Nothing could be more perfect than these three genres together. Unfortunately while they may have nailed the genre combinations right, they simply failed in execution.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it'll be a great drinking game. Who knows?\\n\\n\r\n> Wait is it me or does Sara looks and sound like Nayuta. Sneaky...\\n",

I'm serious the story was 12 episodes of frustration with characters that simply can't make up their minds. When more characters get involve into story it gets even worse. I dunno why but when I should cheer up for main protagonist I simply can't because she's too annoying.\r\nIf you want watch this I assume because the yuri part, but even that part could be better.\r\nSide characters are simply meaningless because they come and go without much input, I meanthey make some but it matters only because protagonist is a moron.\\n\r\nTo sum this up, if you want watch it, do it. It's just 12 episodes, right? 12 episodes of mediocre characters (a seriously frustrating main one), decent story (tbh story is so simple that it isn't awful but isn't good either) and pleasant to watch art. Oh and there is yuri stuff too, but not too much, to be fair Citrus is enjoyable only because yuri/gay scenes.",

            "content": "Why should you watch Citrus?\r\nStory is Good (7). One of the things I loved about Citrus is about the story. I really love the original manga where it was adapted from by Saburo Uta. With that I can say that this adaptation was not well presented it exchanged the titillation for oversexuallity and this is prevalent with the opening theme and the \"Key Scenes\" of the story. It should be more provocative rather than blatant. \r\nArt is Very Good (8). Setting aside the story, the art is well done, and it is really nice to see the characters of the story realized. However I needto point out one thing: Momokino's Eyebrow should not be edited to become more pleasing. She has a thick eyebrow in the manga and it was created that way for a reason. This cause her character to loose a lot of personality in the story. These changes with the characters hurt the story rather than enhance it.\\n\\n\r\nSound is Good (7). \"Azalea (\u30a2\u30b6\u30ec\u30a2)\" by nano.RIPE is a great song but I do not feel it was suited well for a story such as Citrus. It could have been better if they have chosen a song with a softer and a bit darker melody. I understand that the theme music wants to show a rebellious image since it is yuri but it was a step in the wrong direction. The sound track in general is good but it still misses on key scenes which is crucial for the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are Very Good (8). I really wanted to give this a 9 since I adore the manga a lot but I have to judge it based on the anime that is why I am taking a point away. Yuzu and Mei's characters are great as they carry the story but how they are interpreted in the story is just missing something: a heart. During the finale of the episode there were scenes that are satisfying to see but like eating something citrus it has a bitter aftertaste. Same goes with supporting the characters.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally, I came to winter with a lot of expectations with Citrus, but it disappointed me in a lot of its aspects. But if I would watch it without the manga knowledge I could be praising this anime.\\n\\n\r\n7.6 bitter lemons out of 10.\\n\\n\r\n#Citrus #WinterAnimeRetrospectiveReview",

            "content": "This review is for anyone on the fence about whether or not they should watch Citrus (or anyone that has already seen it). Up front: I really enjoyed the show. It was probably the most entertaining (of what I watched) this season (Winter 2018). So much so that it is the first review I've written in a long time. Anyway...\r\nCitrus is yuri. So girls kiss. \r\nIt is also trashy romance. So sensuality is paramount and consensuality is... well, let's be generous and say... ambiguous.\r\nTo be fair, Citrus is not particularly amazing at anything. It is alright.\r\nAnimation: fine.\r\nCharacter design: fine.\r\nBackgrounds: fine.\r\nMusic: fine.\r\nCast: fine.\r\nVoice acting: fine.\r\nWhere Ifeel it excels though is in the writing. Skeptics, hold your gasps. \\n\\n\r\nThis is tricky to qualify because whatever good is there is overshadowed by the show's more... polarizing aspects. I won't summarize the plot, you can read the synopsis for that. Instead, the best arguement I can make is by summarizing one particular scene (or series of events) that occurs towards the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThis is only like 5% - 10% of the show, at best, so consider this a minor spoiler of sorts. Again, this is an arguement for why the show is good in spite of its flaws, or why it is worth watching, so if you have ANY intention of watching the show spoiler free, please do that first.\\n\\n\r\nNow then, beneath the smutty surface, I posit that there is an unappreciated font of talented writing at play here. Bear in mind, that no matter how good the writing, trashy fantasy just may not be for you, but otherwise, I will present this ironically long summary as evidence:\\n\\n\r\n==========================================================\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Yuzu, runs into another girl, Sara, and her sister, Nina. Sara is looking for Mei, Yuzu's step-sister and love interest, who had helped her out earlier when she was lost. It was love at first sight. Destiny.\\n\\n\r\nYuzu helps little lost Sara (who is technically the same age) and over the time spent together, the two become fast friends. Dramatic irony ensues. \\n\\n\r\nYuzu gets into multiple dumb fights with Mei during the course of the show (as happens in any relationship, semi-incestuous or otherwise) and Sara confirms her resolve to confront Mei and confess her feelings to her. \\n\\n\r\nYuzu admires Sara and is supportive of her romantic endeavor but, more importantly, Sara encourages Yuzu to do the same, saying (and I\u2019m paraphrasing): \"If there\u2019s a chance, you have to act!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis is, more or less, the central tenet of Sara\u2019s personality and the ultimate theme of the show. The positivity and support for each other is all very heartwarming and uplifting, despite the clich\u00e9 of \"not being aware they are both in love with the same person\".\\n\\n\r\nFast forward and things come to a head and then get\u2026 complicated. What Citrus did that inspired me to write this, and will stick with me for many years to come, is thus:\\n\\n\r\nNina loves her sister, Sara, dearly and is concerned. Sara is a very selfless person and is always putting others before herself; sacrificing her own happiness in the process. So, Nina interferes, trying to coerce Yuzu into giving up. She guilts Yuzu into promising that she won\u2019t get in the way, because, after all, is Sara not her friend? But\u2026 Yuzu cannot keep that promise because she still loves Mei and was convinced of one thing: to not give up. \\n\\n\r\n\"If there\u2019s a chance, you have to act!\"\\n\\n\r\nFinal scene; Sara and Yuzu meet. Sara tells Yuzu to go to Mei. Nina objects, but Sara has already determined it was not meant to be. It is Yuzu that Mei is waiting for. \\n\\n\r\nYuzu leaves at Sara\u2019s behest, and Nina rebukes Sara. What about your destiny? \\n\\n\r\nTo which, Sara replies (paraphrasing again): \u201cI was drawn to Mei and met Yuzu. Isn\u2019t it wonderful to think that my destiny was to bring those two together?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nNina objects again, tearfully saying (essentially): \u201cNo, it\u2019s not wonderful. What about you? Don\u2019t you want to be happy?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nTo which, Sara concludes: \u201cWith a loving sister like you, how could I not be?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, I wiped a tear (or two) from my eyes and brought my hands together in applause.\\n\\n\r\nBravo, Citrus. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t care who you are, that\u2019s good drama right there.",

Sure sometimes we'd get scenes that are overall better then in the manga. But i don't know what it is about the manga but i liked it ever so more.\r\nThere were scenes where i was cringing while reading the manga such as when the chairman of the school first found out about Yuzu. I probably cringed and laughed a ton more in the show then the manga. \r\nMy least favorite plot line that i remember from the mangais the story arc when the loli comes in. She was bad in the manga and she's bad in the show. But i'd say that it's not as bad as in the Manga. I do know she becomes a pretty likable character later on in the Manga though.\\n\\n\r\nI do love that i feel they were able to do Mei and Yuzu right. I feel they could've easily messed both of them up. Yuzu is a really funny character and is funny how easily she get's embarrassed an Mei is really adorable when she get's embarrassed.\\n\\n\r\nArt is also kind of weird. It kind of looks cheap and low effort but it also kind of looks awesome and high quality. \\n\\n\r\nOverall i found the show to be fun and is just about on par with the Manga imo.",

            "content": "It kinda sucks to see so much negativity towards this show because of some of the non-consensual stuff at the start. I'm genuinely curious what its score would be without the hate scores.\r\nMy personal opinion is that the show doesn't feed on non-consensual power fantasies, it tries to establish Mei as a damaged character. It also does a good job of establishing that Yuzu is a strong lead and fights off Mei.\r\nThat being said, the show is short and develops its core plot in a bit of an awkward manner. Instead of focusing on the nice girl (Yuzu) learning more about the tsundere's (Mei) darkpast, which is the angle you would certainly expect after the first few episodes, it basically rehashes the same \"girl that gets in the way of their love\" thing twice. \\n\r\nThis is compounded by the way the romance unfolds. There appears to be a bit of a split, some people think Mei is an unlikable character, I happen to be of the opinion that Yuzu is just not very understanding of all that Mei has been through. Regardless, anyone can agree that it ends up boiling down to a lot of stubbornness and the general thought of \"man, relationships don't actually work like this in the real world\".\\n\r\nThat again, its a yuri anime drama, it doesn't need to make a lot of sense, it just sucks that if you carve out the 3 episodes at the start of any anime to establish the plot, and then the 3 at the end to build up to the end of the final conflict of any show, you only have 6 episodes to develop characters. That just isn't a lot of time, this really should have been 24 episodes, and it makes a lot of sense that the plot developed in a rushed way in light of the 12 episode run.\\n\r\nHopefully the hate doesn't land home, the show appears to have been super popular, so let's get a 24 episode S2! I'd normally only give a show like this a 7, but I'm giving it an 8 to account for the undeserved hate scores.",

            "content": "Let me tell you a story.\r\nBack in high school, I had a group of four friends. Myself, Florete (yes, that's my actual name), Danielle, Annie, and Melanie. One day we were at a restaurant together and while we had ordered different foods, we all ended up with mashed potatoes as a side. However, we all ate them differently. Danielle, who doesn't like flavor, had them plain. Annie liked pepper, but not salt. Melanie didn't like pepper, but loved salt. I loved salt AND pepper.\r\nAfter we were done eating, I turned to Melanie and gave her a sweet kiss, with tongue. You see, Melanie was mygirlfriend, and she's also my sister. Danielle and Annie rolled their eyes at us, the whole \"this again\" thing, as we had our fun. You see, salt strengthens us, so when we eat salt, we kiss, and it magnifies our power. We're also super gay lesbians, so combining salt with yuri is an astounding combo.\\n\\n\r\nYears later, Melanie - who is my sister and wife (sometimes I call her \"Wifester.\" She doesn't like it) - and I, Florete, were lounging around the house being gay when we discovered this anime called Citrus. It starred lesbian sisters similar to us and was generating mountains of salt all across the internet. Loads of yuri and a mountain of salt? We've never felt stronger!\\n\\n\r\nYuzu is like me. We're go-getters, the older sibling, the troublemaker. We know what we want but sometimes we're too stupid to know how to go about getting it, so we just do something random and things somehow turn out alright in the end, maybe. But that's why our sister loves us so much.\\n\\n\r\nMei and Melanie are also fairly similar. They're on the quiet side, but also smart and calculating. It took them some time to realize their love, but when they did, they knew how to accept it. You'd expect them to be on the receiving end of affection more often, but when in the bedroom, they can be surprisingly aggressive. Melanie hasn't assaulted me, though. Yet. Sigh.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, like Mei, Melanie is basically a walking lesbian magnet. We can just be walking down the street and girls will just start gravitating towards her, on their phone or checking their make-up, without even realizing what's happening. Sometimes the girls don't even yet realize that they're gay, and I swear she's turned a few straight girls gay by now. It's crazy and awesome. But it is annoying sometimes, because some will actually go after her for real, and then I have to tell them to go find their own sister to love because this one is mine and mine alone. One rival is kind of charming, the next is a little awkward, but by the time the third comes along I'm getting a bit sick of this nonsense. I get it, she's attractive, can we move on now?\\n\\n\r\nWhat about our other friends? Well, Danielle was closer to me, and Annie was closer to Melanie. Danielle was a great bff, pretty much always there whenever I needed someone to hang with or talk to without Melanie, although I never quite understood just why she was so attached to me. Annie, well, she was my first love rival for Melanie. Charming in its own way, that \"Wow, my sister-lover is desired, that makes me feel good that she chose me instead\" feeling. We got past it.\\n\\n\r\nReal talk now.\\n\\n\r\nI get it. By its very nature, our story is a bit squeamish, awkward, uncomfortable. Some people out there will be disgusted by the mere thought of it, others will try to have an open mind but be turned away when they see what it took for us to get there, some of the things we did. But there are others, those who will appreciate, those who will understand what we went through, those who aren't looking for an average rom-com, those who will follow and enjoy our story BECAUSE it's like this, because there really is a lot to love here. There are happy times. There are sad times. Good decisions and bad decisions.\\n\\n\r\nWe don't care what anyone else thinks. We're in love.\\n\\n\r\nFAQ\\n\r\nQ. Is your name really Florete?\\n\r\nA. Of course it is.\\n\\n\r\nQ. Are you and Melanie blood-related?\\n\r\nA. Hmmm...perhaps.\\n\\n\r\nQ. Did you actually review Citrus?\\n\r\nA. Didn't I, darling? Didn't I?\\n\\n\r\nQ. But you didn't say anything about animation or acting and such!\\n\r\nA. Sigh...Must I really?\\n\\n\r\nQ. Yes.\\n\r\nA. Fine. It was good. Decent. If you're not a stickler for the technicalities you won't notice anything (Mei's English dub voice is really perfect, though). If you are...well, I'm not, so I can't help you there. Watch the trailer, or something.\\n\\n\r\nQ. I have no further questions.\\n\r\nA. Thank you, internet voice.\\n",

            "content": "What brought me here was a PV that an ad randomly threw at me as I was reading what this season had to offer (which is rare enough as it is). Given that, I'm genuinely surprised at how many poor reviews people have put up for this show. I don't write reviews before watching all the scheduled episodes, this one is no different, and I hope that you may just be one step closer to considering watching this after reading the following.\r\nSTORY: 8\r\nThe premise is simple, Aihara Yuzu, who's never actually fallen in love before (but pretends to her friends) is attracted to her practicalpolar opposite, Aihara Mei... who also happens to be her step-sister. The story is really about how they get along, and how they fall in love with each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe one-sided development is how I find most modern anime relationships go, where one character is madly attracted to the other and somehow they just... magically like them back one day with no rhyme or reason. You won't find that here, even if it seems that way at first.\\n\\n\r\nART/SOUND: 8\\n\\n\r\nIt's rare for me to see an anime that looks attractive, but not over-the-top flash/bang/glitter... maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places. Given that, Citrus is very nicely animated, considering that the TV anime industry in Japan doesn't make as much revenue as actual licenses bought/Blu-Ray and DVD copies sold.\\n\\n\r\nSome scenes look anatomically odd or some areas, PASSIONE thought it a good idea to pull out the stops on kissing sound folios that just end up making it awkward but overall I'm impressed that the production level animation looks this good for TV.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9\\n\\n\r\nAlright, here's where I find a lot of reviews tend to miss the point and call the characters underdeveloped or downright undeveloped. What honestly got me hooked on this series are the characters, not the story, not the idea of yuri/shoujo-ai (girl's love)... but that's a nice bonus. PASSIONE did well to follow the anime closely to the manga frame by frame, and the storytelling style is to show, not tell.\\n\\n\r\nOn the outside, Yuzu is one of those \"meddling teenager\" characters who's always up in your face, being loud and rambunctious.\\n\r\nOn the outside, Mei is one of those \"perfect\" girls who doesn't let anyone or anything bother her. She's that polar opposite, quiet, thoughtful and distanced.\\n\\n\r\nMei and Yuzu feel like real teenagers, with real problems and real, but not always practical and mature ways to deal with said problems. There's a layer of depth to the characters that you can't discern from simply watching they do as a passive viewer.\\n\\n\r\nYuzu is shown at the very least to be very thoughtful when she's not reacting to something. Mei is likewise distanced because of her fear of becoming too attached. These are things that real people do and personalities that real people develop because of things that happened to them!\\n\\n\r\nTLDR; OVERALL: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe one reason I can't recommend this show is that PASSIONE made the intimacy almost one step too far from something that should feel nice to see, into something incredibly uncomfortable. Trigger warning for images of cringe and pseudo-assault. The \"no-means-no-means-yes\" is definitely bad for my feeling.\\n\\n\r\nCringe aside, there is a reason why these characters do these things. I think character development is the strongest point of the series, and it motivates practically every side of the story. There is a reason why Mei practically assaults Yuzu in the opening scenes, which ties into her development as a character, who she is, how she perceives affection (misaffection), and her image as someone cold and distanced for fear of hurt.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this show if you, like me are starved for a fictional character who if you took them out of their world and shoved them here, would behave 3-dimensionally like a real person. This is a rarity in modern story-telling.\\n\\n\r\nThe key to understanding the world of CITRUS is not simply to know the character... but to understand them as the many-faceted human beings that they are, even if they are fictional.\\n\\n\r\nI do hope you give CITRUS a try. Be undissuaded by nay-sayers, and even yay-sayers like me. Please watch it if you can handle some uncomfortable moments, and develop your own opinions. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, CITRUS is now my new favourite item of the season so send me a private message if you'd like to elaborate on this mini-discussion about character development!",

            "content": "When all was said and done, I enjoyed Citrus, but I probably wouldn't recommend it to most people.\r\nThe first few episodes are a real barrier and I wouldn't blame someone for not being able to get past it. It's a romance show that relies entirely on non-consensual advances (we call that \"sexual assault\" where I'm from) to move the plot along. While most of it sorta makes sense in the context of the characters if you read between the lines, it's also clearly done for the titillation of the viewer, which is kinda gross. Nonetheless, I kept watching because I like yuri and thus haveno standards.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the show makes a pretty big shift in episode 5. The main character, Yuzu, previously motivated purely by her desire to fuck her sister, has an epiphany moment, and suddenly wants to... be a good person and a supportive sister.\\n\\n\r\nHuh.\\n\\n\r\nShe's still monstrously thirsty, but from this point forward I'd say the main character is probably the best thing about the show. She's an adorable ball of awkwardness and a genuinely good person that doesn't deserve all the soap opera drama bullshit that happens to her. And oh man, do they ramp up the soap opera drama bullshit, and I ate that shit up no matter how cheesy it got. \\n\\n\r\nCitrus is an overly dramatic smutty Drake and Josh with lesbians that I would definitely never admit I watch to anyone in real life, but if you're into that kind of thing you could probably do worse than this.",

            "content": "Are you by any chance a fan of drama? The effect drama has on the characters of the series creates depth and a human elements for the cast. With Citrus you get the chance to experience the best and worst the drama genre has to offer. (Please note I am a huge fan of both the anime and the manga but I do feel all the criticism the series gets is totally deserved.)\r\nStory \u2013 7.5/10\r\nCitrus \u2013 at times \u2013 has a brilliant plot. Some scenes in the anime/manga have made me cry more than the majority of drama anime out there. When the plot revolvesaround the more complex aspects of the relationship between Mei and Yuzu and their family, Citrus does so brilliantly. The problem I have with the plot in Citrus is the fact that the show itself doesn\u2019t know what it wants to be. It doesn\u2019t know if it wants to be a sweet yuri anime focussing on the controversial relationship between two step-siblings, a series focussing on the discovering of the self, a introspective anime about the acceptance of LGBTQ couples in the Japanese society; or a really trashy show about exactly how trashy humanity can be when given in to their primordial emotions. Because of the amount of drama put into the anime simply for shock factor, the show comes off as a cheap poorly written excuse for making the show seemingly more mature. In summary the plot is brilliant but also horrible as some arcs are truly emotional and others a pain to watch (Like Matsuri\u2019s character arc).\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWell done Passione for creating an adaptation of a yuri manga with twelve episodes and a twenty-four minute runtime per episode which doesn\u2019t feel like a tight budget anime. I was seriously surprised at the amount of effort given to the art, as yuri is a tiny niche with a small fan base. The character design are all pretty nice as well as the set pieces of the anime. It\u2019s nothing special but nor is it something awful. That being said, the more intimate and romantic moments between Yuzu and Mei were really well done and didn\u2019t feel too much like another form of fanservice to draw in a larger audience.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic design in Citrus is good, just good. There are some great tracks found in the OST which really helped in creating the atmosphere of the anime, even though they might be somewhat forgettable. The opening and ending are both really fun to listen to and I managed to watch both every single episode.  Lastly I really enjoyed the voice acting for both the dubbed and subbed version of the series. I found that the subbed version has the more professional voice acting \u2013 as usual \u2013 but I happened to like the dubbed version just as much, because I felt the English voice actors captured the characters more realistically. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nYuzu is a likeable protagonist, because of her simplicity. I felt a connection with Yuzu as she is the type of character which the majority of the audience can relate towards, as the problems she deals with have been experienced by many people \u2013 regardless of their sexual orientation. You either adore Mei or hate her. The moments which captured her personality the best where those in which her reactions were the complete opposite of her character archtype, like the scenes where she tried being honest with Yuzu and those between her and her father. Even the relationship between Mei and Yuzu can be loved or hated. On the one hand you are rooting for the sweet Yuzu to have her feelings requited and Mei just to express herself better. On the other hand you might dislike the relationship between the two of them as Mei can be a giant bitch, because of her insensitivity towards her peers. Either whether you love them or hate them, their relationship is entirely subjective. Harumin in particular is a pretty fun character as she polarises the personalities of Yuzu and Mei. She made the show even more endearing as she is the type of friend you would want in your own life. Other than the above mentioned characters other characters I really enjoyed were: Yuzu\u2019s Mother and Mei\u2019s Father. The rest of the characters were pretty meh in my opinion as most of them served no other purpose than to get on my nerves, add more drama or move the plot forward.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nContrary to the amount of problems Citrus has, I personally really love the series and I love the romantic scenes between Yuzu and Mei. At times the anime is really heart-warming and sweet, and others it really gets on my nerves the amount of bullshit added to further the plot. I personally believe that the plot could have been done way better if only there wasn\u2019t a new threat every episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a excellent yuri series \u2026 then go read Sasameki Koto and The Private Report on my Personal Lesbian Experience with Loneliness. Both of these manga series manage to capture the best of LGBTQ drama. Citrus is a good anime if you are looking for those themes, but unfortunately falls short. Whether you love or hate the series is entirely up to you. I personally enjoy it!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my review!",

The music and passion of characters really intertwine and pull you in and the voice actors are amazing it is some of the most astonishing work I have had the pleasure to listen to.\r\nThe bad =  The realdrawback to making this show a memorable great is instead of taking a slow approach to character development it is obvious they throw new characters with over the top emotions in to push the story and draw mei and yuzu together and show how unsure yet willing they are to be together.\\n\\n\r\nwhile it can be seen as rushed or awkward time to throw romantic scenes at the viewer (I do remind you to think back to your days of being a teenager and really was anything planned or was it spur of the moment and awkward)\\n\r\nso I can see the realism in this and push through it as every time I have felt they will push the show into cliche drama it is resolved with logic and that is one thing I do love.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is truly unbelievable is this anime is not finished and I felt the necessity to write a review to show other people this anime is a MUST WATCH!\\n\\n\r\nI normally am a hard critic on anime especially with an expected 12episodes I tend to steer clear as the story is rushed, the characters have leaps in progression or more than not no progression at all and with 12episodes itis hard to complain as the animators/director and storyboard is packed full to tell the best version of the manga with minimal resources and time.\\n\\n\r\npros;\\n\r\n- Art\\n\r\n- Story\\n\r\n- Characters\\n\r\n- Music\\n\r\n- Voice acting\\n\r\n- resolving issues with logic (even if the issues are caused from horrible new characters thrown into the show)\\n\\n\r\ncons;\\n\r\n- currently airing (have to wait for 1week per episode)\\n\r\n- only 12 eps :(\\n\r\n- bad story set up of new characters & introductions can be seen clearly as problems to create episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI will hopefully be able to update this review after finished airing and change from 9/10 to a solid 10/10 and call this my favourite romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nI hope my review helped in convincing you to watch this anime :)",

            "content": "So, before I start this, I\u2019d like to mention that I only watched this because of the memes. I\u2019ve never really been into this kind of show -I\u2019ve never watched a hentai before- and it probably would\u2019ve completely passed me by if it were not for /r/Animemes.\r\nNow, into the proper review. I went into this optimistically, I know it involved two lesbians and was a yuri, but I thought I should watch it so I\u2019d know why it was in so many memes, and because I might enjoy it. But, I didn\u2019t. I suppose I enjoyed the first few episodes, but I constantly felt likeI was doing something wrong by watching this, it was almost like feeling guilty in a way, and this only got worse as I saw more of it. In fact, it\u2019s actually the reason why I dropped the show. When I saw that episode 7 was out I went to watch it, but I couldn\u2019t really watch it and enjoy myself, I felt like I shouldn\u2019t watch it and it felt overpoweringly wrong, so I gave up on watching the rest of the show and dropped it.\\n\\n\r\nBut, It\u2019d be wrong for me to give this anime a bad review, it is a good anime, the art is well done, the characters are detailed, the special effects are mostly great, and  some of the 3DCGI suprised me with their quality, and I definitely enjoyed some parts of it. The problem for me is the plot.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to spoil it, so I won\u2019t say too much, but this anime is definitely a yuri. I was shocked to find lesbian sexual harassment happening in the first episode and lesbian sexual assault by the third. I personallly think that that\u2019s the problem I have with this anime, the fansevice and sexual scenes, while clearly designed to interest the viewer and in some cases turn them on, didn\u2019t have that effect on me. If it was normal lesbian relationship then yeah it probably would of, but Citrus has the opposite effect on me because the characters are litterally sexually assaulting each other within the first the first few episodes, and that\u2019s a huge turn off for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I\u2019m going to give this anime an average score, because while it is a good anime that people can enjoy, I clearly aren\u2019t the target audience and as such I didn\u2019t enjoy this anime.",

            "content": "This is my first review, my apologies if it's biased majorly.\r\nGuys, Citrus is bad. Really, it's terrible. I wanted to like this show so much, I mean, it's one of my favorite manga, but seriously, it's BAAAAD.\r\nI made myself watch this since I loved the manga. The PV looked promising, I loved how the art looked, and oh my GOD, is that Yurika Kubo as Himeko?! This show was going to be my favorite of the year.\r\nAs your Local Lesbian, I was quite hyped for this anime to come out, homosexual representation is always great! Ever since that first PV...\r\nSadly, that was soon to bequite the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nI'll start with the positives first:\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is actually really, really good. I loved how vibrant Yuzu looks and how she always has a differentiating outfit every episode. The animation is also great; it looks amazingly clean in some shots, though in certain other scenes it can a little stiff. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is also alright. Decent, must I say. I can't stand the opening, the music is great but that singer really annoys me. I was never a big NANOripe fan, so that might be a reason. Voice acting is good, as I really can't resist Shikaco (Yurika Kubo.) I never really found myself paying attention to the music, but it wasn't bad in any way. (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow now, the list of negatives...\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIt's quite similar to the manga, and this is something that can hold it's own I guess. The premise was simple, Gyaru Yuzu goes to a new girls-only high school and seito kaichou is now her little sister. They did well enough to adapt that into the anime, but it's still lacking from the manga. (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is where I began to hate the anime. Yuzu is so unlikeable. I understand that she's thrust into this unfamiliar situation and her sister is after her (and shes sorta after her sister, too), but the anime adapted it terribly. They took everything likeably-cute out of Yuzu, making her an obnoxious, ignorant brat. Mei is a bit better, but she has this whole \"I'm going to act emo, but then, I'm sensitive, Aubrey! Which gets me into deep shit.\" I can't even explain how much I dislike these characters. I knew the Sekaiichi Hatsukoi anime had some unlikeable characters, but oh my GOD.\\n\\n\r\nThe only likable character I found (without their voice actor) is Harumin, she's actually a really cool character. Since I can't give this category a 0% (MAL, please add that just for this anime), it gets 10%. (1/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really hate this anime. I'm most likely biased because it adapted the manga so terribly, but I hate it. On its own, it would be a solid 5/10. Instead of being a yuri for yuri lovers female and male alike akin to the manga, it's a yuri anime for gross dirtbags with useless fanservice and terrible characters. You can clearly see the target audience, which wasn't the same as the manga. But hey, at least the art is nice. (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (3/10)",

            "content": "I want to write this review to explain why I enjoyed citrus even though I don't like ecchi or yuri. I did not read the manga so this is my first time encountering this series.\r\nCitrus is an anime about the love of two girls (yes it is about love and not lust). There is fanservice throughout (naturally) and of course it is not the type of anime that is always comfortable to watch. However, citrus is enjoyable and tells a story with somewhat original characters; even if they're not the most exciting.\r\nI'll be honest and say what's bad about this anime first. This isn\u2019t everythingbad, or everything good but it's what I gathered so far.\\n\\n\r\n1. Citrus can be uncomfortable to watch. There is a lot of scenes where sexual acts are forced and it can be so uncomfortable that I look away from the screen or take out one headphone. The over sexualisation is not something that is always necessary and can put some people off watching, myself included.\\n\\n\r\n2. The story attempts to tackle realistic scenarios but without realistic approaches. The relationship between the two main characters sometimes simply doesn't make sense and there hasn't been significant progression yet. Either things happen too fast or too slow. I guess realistic pacing, both for character development and monologue, are not the strong points of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n3. THE FANSERVICE. Simply put, I hate this. Both from a personal and objective point of view, the fan service is forced and once again uncomfortable. Rather than placing these moments within the story, the story revolves around these moments instead. They aren't particularly enjoyable so it doesn\u2019t really work as good fan service. \\n\\n\r\nSo why do I like citrus and think you should watch it?\\n\\n\r\n1. IT'S NOT BORING. Sure Citrus isn't going to be the best anime that you've ever watched, but it isn't dull either. The script isn't perfect and the mix between serious and comedy is confusing but it's enjoyable nonetheless. I've had fun watching Citrus even though it certainly isn't my usual genre.\\n\\n\r\n2. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S REALISTIC! I just wanna stress that it is an anime not a documentary. Some things that happen in Citrus are strange or don't make much sense (like the fact that her mother didn't tell her about the step sister). Sure these plot holes take away from the overall quality but not from the enjoyment. Watch Citrus for fun and for a bit of weird drama. If you take it too seriously then how can you enjoy anime?\\n\\n\r\n3. It's an unusual romance. As a huge romance fan I will admit that there is no build up to falling in love. Yuzu literally goes from seemingly asexual to lesbian in a day or two. But that doesn't mean that the romance isn't beautiful. It is not a clich\u00e9 school romance, so if you want that look somewhere else. Love comes in different forms and the love shown in Citrus may be different but it's refreshing.\\n\\n\r\n4. The art is pretty, the voices are great and the characters are easy on the eye. Visually it has been pretty well defined to make it easy to watch. I love the voice actors (especially for Yuzu) and really get drawn in by the clean visuals and fitting voices.\\n\\n\r\nOverall PLEASE GIVE CITRUS A CHANCE. Episode one is uncomfortable and that is a big flaw of the anime I won't doubt. However it is a romance that is different to a typical shoujo and is certainly unique in its execution. Citrus isn't for everyone, and it isn't even the best anime airing right now, but it is enjoyable and I will happily finish the season; hope you do too!\\n",

            "content": "If I had to describe Citrus, here is what I would say :\r\nTo my little sister : a heartbreaking impossible love story between 2 female teenagers that everything opposes.\r\nTo my little brother : a lesbian love story.\r\nTo my parents : a very interesting love story mixing true feelings and difficulties coming from family & society.\r\nTo my female friends : a very catchy love story which includes modern issues such as homosexuality but also family.\r\nTo my male friends : a story with girls kissing and almost having sex together, man.\r\nMore seriously : Citrus represents an interesting drama / romance anime, mixing classic love codes but howeverplaced in a contemporary world. Indeed, the relation between the 2 main characters remains modest and patient, nothing gets too quick. It is more about discovering, understanding each other slowly with passion.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, what makes it special is that the love story happens between 2 girls (not uncommon and not forbidden where I live, so it did not shock me at all)... who are also sisters. Basically, Citrus brings both homosexuality & incest but in a soft way ; understand that it does not promote any sexual orientation but gives a kind of tolerance message to all viewers. \\n\\n\r\nActually, everything opposes the 2 girls : one being a fancy lazy blonde and the other one being a serious cold-heart acting school girl with high responsibilites. This is at first a duel between 2 different classes and way of life. However this aspect quickly disappears to concentrate on the purest romance plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime includes 2 triangles of love which will help both characters to highlight some of their personal aspects. I found them interesting and relevant but a bit poorly exploited. Actually, Citrus was a good show to watch but it did not bring me tears and torment my thoughts for days (unlike some stories like Nozoki Ana, which is an erotic romance / love story I loved ; you can find my review on my profile). Some viewers surely found it heartbreaking on some points or very arousing / attractive ; well I did not but it does not mean the whole show was bad.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, our main characters' love story is not characterised by a single line where everything goes well, no no. Yeah, it should be drawn as russian moutains, with high deceptions but also joyful moments (with a happy expected ending, as you can guess watching the opening). Perhaps knowing from the start how it would end impeached me to fully enter the story. I also think the fact they intended to build relations with many characters (they all are secondary but still have a great role) created an interest for... too many characters in fact. To be honest, my attention was caught by the other girls lol, not saying that Yuzu & Mei were not well designed, eh.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end, I am convinced the ending satisfied most viewers (an happy ending usually does so) but my hunger / interest was not repleted, however. In fact, I expected more, something like an 'after war' moment, where both girls act as a new created & official couple. Some might say the story leaves this upcoming (Citrus has done being aired or published, do not expect more) part to my own imagination... probably right, yeah.\\n\\n\r\nWell, it was still a pleasant 12-episode show to follow, even if it didn't reach my heart I enjoyed discovering a controversial love story.",

            "content": "This anime must be considered an avant garde cultural piece in to the fore of the movement into deeper, more intellectual and philosophically thought provoking Japanese Works. There are clear influences of Freudian Theories on the overall story and can be used to explain the choices and characters in the story. For example, both the protagonists, Yuzu and Mei must be considered physical representations of the positive and negative Oedipal Complex concepts. In addition to this, the subtle nods to primitive psychology are present throughout the story. Clearly the Christmas cake scene and the behavior of the characters within the setting can be explained througha deeper analysis of the more well placed details many viewers may ignore. The strawberry base of the Christmas Cake can be used to explain the behavior of the two titular characters through the fact that strawberry is a natural aphrodisiac and unleashes the primal yet provocative inner repressed natures of the two. This is truly why the anime must be regarded as a revolutionary phenom in the industry.",

In bad taste, overall.\r\nNext, the commonly complained plot point over the first two episodes showing quite violent sexual assault. First off, to those who say this is just a plot point or something they bond over, no. You can fuck off. This anime doesn't glorify the sexual assault, which Iadmit, however, It leads into the rest of the anime and it is even the basis of the main characters feelings developing for her step-sister. \\n\r\nAka: \"All of this because you kissed me.\" \\n\\n\r\nNone of this anime was a healthy portrayal of a real relationship, but all just sounded and felt like desperation. A way to express feeling after being repressed by social ques, but not in the good way.\\n\\n\r\n0/10 would not recommend.",

            "content": "WARNING! Consider reading this review only after you have finnished the anime/manga. It contains some spoilers, ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE ENDING OF THE SHOW! Ill try to avoid as much as i can, and focus only on the development of the show, and how its handled. English isnt my native language, so im sorry in advance for any grammar errors. Also, i didnt read the manga, so the review is solely based on the anime.\r\nTaboo topics are hard to grasp and transfer into any form of a show. That's why there are not that many good yuri series. Throwing some kind of incest into the pot?What could go wrong, right? Well.. alot. By creating an ambitious plot idea its easy to slip and fall dramatically, which sadly is the case with Citrus. There are alot of reviews of people who actually praise it for, apparently, good character design, intriguing plot, etc. I'll try to explain why i strongly disagree with any of that, especially within the Character, and Story score section of the review. It will be propably pretty lenghty, so bear with me.\\n\\n\r\nArt [5/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe show immediately teases us with some really bright scenery and good looking, attractive characters. It's true, that art has some value here and there, but its very rare occurance the more you watch. The landscapes of the city that you're shown in the beginning are just forgotten after few episodes, because the show keeps you in the claustrophobic scenery for the most of the time. All you see is the same room, house, and school for around 6-8 episodes straight. That's a bad decision on the director's part, since the show has nothing to offer at the end. Why? Keep reading.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as animation goes, it's pretty okay. Sometimes. When the shot's are close ups on the characters, they are looking gorgeous. But the further the camera is, the more awkward the animation and the art gets. Im sorry, but it gets so ridiculous sometimes with the facial expressions in the distance, that you're wondering if the character is sad, or needs to take a shit really bad. Colours are either badly composed, or too bright/sharp, very inconsistent. Nothing special most of the time, sometimes good, and VERY awkward, alot.\\n\\n\r\nSound [3/10]\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing here to say about it for the most part. Music feels dull, and out of place sometimes, like it's from a Looney Tunes cartoon. Like, what? My ear didnt catch anything worth attention the whole story, except the main theme that plays when they kiss, etc. That's it.\\n\r\nI liked a few voice actors, Yuzu's best friend had the best one in my opinion. The Yuzu and Mei voice actors were nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nStory [3/10]\\n\\n\r\nAlright.. here we go. Listen. You know when someone tries to do everything right too hard, and fails miserably in everything? It's really sad to see that. And im very sad that this happened to Citrus.\\n\\n\r\nWe have a very good setup at first, the girl living with her mom, who found a new boyfriend who has a daughter, and she moves in to live with them. I leave their character design to the next section, but the plot looks kinda interesting, and it has some potential. Now here's the choice of the director. Do you want to make an anime about family drama? Or maybe about lesbian relationship drama? Maybe incest? Maybe a fucking soap opera with alot of fan service? Nah, lets just do it all at once. Look, im not saying that these cant exist together in a show, but you cant fit that many eggs in one basket and carry it without any difficulty ahead. I have a feeling that the director just threw some plots all together and mixed them without any reason. Lets talk about every option separately.\\n\\n\r\nIncest is hard to portrait, since its a taboo topic, that's not all that acceptable overall. I've heard it's a lighter topic in Japan, but im not sure if that's true, and im not gonna pretend i do know if it is. The anime Yosuga no Sora did handled it pretty well, not perfect but you know what was the conclusion at the end, whenever you accept it, or not. Sometimes you dont choose who you love, and with that said, there are alot of consequences, whenever you like it or not, if you decide to embrace your feelings. In the case of Citrus, all the incest plot was just so poor, and not neccesary. The struggles shown in the series felt fake, and weird, like it wasnt really a problem, but they tried to really make you believe it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe second part, lesbian relationships. With romance there are few things to consider to make any decent story. Drama, and the feelings that people have for eachother, and the overall chemistry of the characters. If you want to throw some fan service there, go ahead, whatever. But the director in this case didnt decide what he wants to do with it. The drama was shallow, and obnoxious, alot of characters were purely plot devices (which i will come back to it later), and the story didnt mean anything at the end. Most of the kissing scenes were thrown without context or purpose, except one. They just fucking kissed, because. After i saw the third character was also a lesbian, i knew how its going to be till the end. Just alot of lesbians everywhere, because, and they want to kiss, and shit. The drama was just there to extend the show maybe, i dont know, really.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion is, if you cant decide on something, its still better to pick only one, sacrifice and cut the idea abit and go with it. If you mix it all together without any thought its just a clusterfuck of everything that doesnt fit all together, and feels unfinnished, and not authentic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [4/10]\\n\\n\r\nThis show has non existent chemistry between the main characters. I know they just met, and are forced to live together, and they develop some feelings along the way. But even at the end, you dont understand what is going on, what's the drive of their own decisions, and choices, especially in the case of Mei. The only likable character was Harumi, and i really wish she had any backstory to her character. Yuzu is obnoxious for the whole show, and Mei is just a stereotypical lifeless doll that doesnt speak much, has a cold personality, and does weird shit all day. At the end, you would expect a feeling that they're actually meant for each other, and feel the chemistry between them. Instead, they feel like strangers to each other, forever.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the backstory. Alot of characters dont have any backstory at all, or its so short, that you cant really tell who they are, or care about anyone. Examples are, Mei's father, grandfather, Matsuri and the twins at the end. Especially the twins. They appear at the end just for the sake of fueling the drama even more, so the main characters cant go together yet, because MORE USELESS DRAMA.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [2/10]\\n\r\nOverall [4/10]\\n\\n\r\nI've thrown enjoyment and overall conclusion together, because this review is fairly long, and there's no point of repeating what's already said.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is dreadfuly boring, and tasteless. It's a jack-of-all-trades attempt, a pretty horrible one. This story could have some potential, but sadly, it was handled very poorly. The incest plot is unnecesary, and the mix of Yuri romance/Drama is the worst of its kind. Im giving it a 4, just because i really felt this show could be more. It had only a few good moments, and it makes me really sad. \\n\\n\r\nDont waste your time on it, and i mean it. Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

They go through some of the same romantic drama that you see in other romances. They get closer, something happens and they get awkward, then they get closer, then something happens and their fighting or something. But it was also very different because the interactions between two girls was quite different from any other real romance I've watched.\r\nAlso, the characters themselves seemed a lot different to me. Maybe I've seen too many harems, but this didn't have any same old boring character types. Even though the eventswere sometimes cliche and predictable, the characters themselves stayed true to themselves and seemed pretty deep to me.  When they resolved things, they actually grew as people.  You could see the way they acted and dressed changed.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I really liked it. Even though it felt similar to some other romances, it also felt really different. and different is good after watching too much anime. To be fair, I should also mention that I like yuri, so my opinion may be biased.",

First couple episodes aren't very enjoyable and had a lot of moments that made me cringe, but the seccond half of the show just really steals the show.

            "content": "Let's establish a fact: Yuri anime is very slim pickings. If you do like the genre, beggars can't really be choosers. Overall, if you're not interested in Yuri, Citrus probably won't entice you. Though it's a generally entertaining anime in it's own right and you could do a lot worse. \r\nEnjoyment - 9 - If you do like Yuri . . . Citrus is one of the best out there. Really, your enjoyment will hinge on whether you came to watch a Yuri anime or not. It doesn't pull the punches or go the innocent cutesy route which will catch the interest of many justfor that. You see a full on relationship develop with interesting, well written characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8 - What really carries the series is its characters. Every one of them is distinct and fleshed out. And better yet, the way they interact has chemistry and feels genuine, with solid dialogue helping move episodes forward at a good pace. characters may start out as archetypes but the writing makes them so charismatic they elevate the lukewarm story.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6 - Speaking of which, the storyline itself is rather cliche and sticks to a lot of tropes. Though mercifully the execution isn't terrible and in fact the show adapts the source material in a competent manner, often adding and taking away to help the pacing and smooth out rougher parts. \\n\\n\r\nThe issue of sexual assault's a valid one. The author uses it as a plot device several times without really exploring how serious the matter is. I wouldn't blame anyone for holding it against the anime as it's a dissappointing part of an otherwise enjoyable series. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 7 - Citrus not bad but not great. The anime doesn't have amazing production values or an ambitious style. Citrus has neither but it's characters are attractive, distinct and well drawn, the environments are fine and the animation's smooth. It won't win any awards or catch people's attention on its own, but the overall production doesn't hold the anime back either.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7 - Music and effects are fine, though not particularly memorable, although the anime was never hinging on either as the hook. The voice acting's solid and the characters except for one all feel well cast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7 - Because Citrus is such a niche series, and it doesn't really do much to elevate itself beyond being a very good and enjoyable Yuri title I can't give it higher than a 7 in the overall rating. Citrus is far from perfect but also is far from bad. The characters and their interactions are really great. It's major hook is being one of the best examples in its genre, a genre which is woefully sparse.",

Honestly I really hope they make a season 2, as it gets better from the next chapters/arc that is happening in the manga right now. I rate this series an 8/10 because I felt like it could've had a bitbeter music/sound and while characters were all very interesting, sometimes they didn't have as much emotion in some scenes compared to their manga scenes. Overall though, I liked it! A very fun watch for yuri fans. I recommend people to give this series a try tbh. :)",

            "content": "I want to start this review by saying that I'm kind of biased when it comes to this one. I have been waiting for a Yuri anime for a while and you can tell I'm a fan of these if you look at the rating I gave Sakura Trick, which was also a 10.\r\n  Now, I know that, if I were to rate this one (and Sakura Trick as well, for that matter), objectively, it would quite certainly not be a 10. I tried to be more objective when rating the story, art, sound and character design, though. \r\n  In itself,the story was a bit interesting. It isn't exactly your usual slice of life anime, where nothing too fascinating happens and it just exhibits regular life for a specific group of people. Rather, it's more on the romantic drama side.\\n\\n\r\n  I had to rate the art a bit lower. It's definitely not one of those series that you'll just look at the art and it'll turn you off to the point where you just want to drop it, but they surely could have done a better job with it. An instance where I found the art lacking was when crowded areas were being presented. You could see the main characters moving around in the middle of lots of people, while all these people were frozen in place and nobody was moving. Obviously, they were part of the background, but it just felt completely unnatural.\\n\\n\r\n  The sound was, in my opinion, pretty good. I don't really have much to say about it. As far as the soundtracks are concerned, I enjoyed the opening one to the point where I never actually skipped it, but that's just personal taste.\\n\\n\r\n  The character design was also quite diverse. You have Yuzu, the main character of the show, who is generally an optimistic person and tries to always look at the bright side of things. She's one of those people that are usually excessively excited, but not to the point where it gets irritating and obnoxious (I'm looking at you, Death March). To counter her personality, you get Mei, a more serious-minded and well-reserved person. She usually hides her feelings and isn't very open about them. There's also side-characters, like Harumin (Yuzu's friend) and the vice president, who either help the story progress or are just there for support.\\n\\n\r\n  I gave this one an overall rating of 10 because, taking into account the amount of enjoyment I got from it personally, I just couldn't let myself give it anything lower than that. As I did mention, though, this is a biased score. The fact that there hasn't been many anime for a while now (or even generally), whose main focus is the romantic relationship between women, led me to rate it this high. A lot of series that I have watched do hint at such relationships, but they are never open about it, nor is that their basic focus.\\n\\n\r\n  I would definitelly recommend this one to anyone who is a fan of the Yuri genre. I believe this one is similar to Sakura Trick, but actually has a plot this time instead of just being random scenes of girls making out.\\n\\n\r\n  I would assume that, from a perspective of somebody who isn't big on this genre, this wouldn't be very interesting to watch. Yet, if you are into the romance genre and don't mind it being between girls, this can still be something that you'd possibly like watching. If this series were to be briefly and very vaugely described, it would be something in the lines of \"an extrovert trying to get an introvert to open up to them\".\\n\\n\r\n  I guess this is obvious, but do not attempt to watch this if you're not at least okay with romance between two girls. I'm pointing this out because there were many people giving this show very low ratings due to the fact that it included such a thing. It should be understandable that it will, when you see the \"Yuri\" tag. There's no point in you watching it, unless you are okay with what that tag entails.\\n\\n\r\n  To the people planning to watch this, have fun. It definitelly was one of the best series for me personally. In fact, I was looking forward to Sunday morning every time, because I'd get to sit and watch a new episode of this.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The only people who will probably say Citrus is really good are those who are into pseudo-incestual lesbian/yuri stuff. THAT SAID, this series ended up being better than I thought it would.\r\nFor some reason, every studio seemingly insists on hitting you hard with the overtly perverted vibes early on, which will probably be off-putting to anyone new to anime or to this type of genre. Underneath all of that, though, is something of a story about struggling to convey emotions and dealing with societal/family expectations. The writers ended it in a way that gave some closure, but left the story open for continuation. I wouldn'tbe too surprised if we get a second season late next year. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is good, as was the score. There was occasional ugly animation, but that can be said most series, so we'll call it the norm. Overall, fairly pretty, and fairly enjoyable if you're into romantic dramas. If not, it's probably best to pass this one up.",

I don't watch these types of shows as it is, so take that for what it's worth.\r\nAs a lesbian living in a straight man's body, I can definitely identify with some if the plots of this show. \r\nBut...\r\nThere's no originality here, take any porn plot that involves two step sisters, then make an anime about it. Everything was really predictable and honestly there were so many plot issues I couldn't find myself checking out to watch the show, I'm not going to spoil anything, but let's just say it has todo more with the characters family. I'm not one of the people who really cares if the characters are lesbians/bi/gay/straight, but honestly it feels forced in this. If it was just a normal romance than fine, but I felt like every 5 seconds I heard the word \"sister\" or the phrase \"all girl\", yeah everyone gets it... it's a Yuri.... move on.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialog was so terrible I ended up laughing through the parts that were suppose to be serious. Which I can say that was a perk. The intended humor parts were pretty funny too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are bland, neither of the characters ever really develop outside of the stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nOpening theme song is pretty good though... So yay?\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you like romance animes, might want to skip this, I don't feel like it'll offer anything that another one can't or at least ones I have seen. I wouldn't even really put it in that category because it's too gimmicky. \\n\\n\r\nI'll be your big sis and tell you not watch this unless you just tryna find a unsatisfying nut.",

            "content": "So normally when I write a review, I talk about multiple aspects of the anime to give a better image on how I view a anime. But this time, I want to do something different. Citrus is a anime I really don't like, but I have thought about why I don't like Citrus past season. And after a season of thinking and Citrus releasing its final episode, I have come up with the 2 big problems this anime has.  \r\nProblem 1: The first impressions you get from this anime is bad  \r\nThe first four episodes are immediately the worst episodes ofCitrus. All of those episodes contained incest sexual assaults and awkward pacing. This in a weird contrast to the later eight episodes which are different, but also contain their own problems which I get into later. If you wanted to watch a drama with a lot of emotions, you will get turned of by the first four episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nProblem 2: The relationship between Yuzu and Mei constantly gets reset  \\n\r\nThis needs a bit of explaining. Yuzu and Mei are the main characters of the story and the romance between them is the focus of the plot. ''So what is the plot?'' you may ask, well here it is: Mei or Yuzu get feelings for eachother, they get closer to eachother, Mei or Yuzu decides that this isn't good, distance herselve of the other and their relationship is back to square one. Repeat four times until the end. This excuse of a plot is not only lazy, but also frustrating. It feels like the author of Citrus didn't know how to make one string of building up a relatioship and just decided to build up the relationship four times.  \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, this anime is not completely bad. The animation really fluid and the music is also pretty good, but everything else just frustrates me (including those two problems I mentioned). I do not recommend watching Citrus, but if you still want to watch it, then get ready for incest, blackmailing and rape.",

            "content": "Alright where do I start. I originally wanted to watch this because everyone said the manga was terrific. They were wrong. Not only was the plot garbage, but also it had absolutely NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. From episode one, Mei had the weirdest personality. She was condescending and cold for NO REASON to Yuzu. She kissed her without consent to get her to \"shut up\". I'm sorry what? Yes you heard me right. She kissed her to get her to stop talking. The author probably has never been in a relationship and fantasizes about no consent relationships all day. Yuzu, unlike Mei, was a bubbly happyretard who fell in LOVE with Mei the moment she was kissed without consent. Wth. She never doubted the creepiness of Mei's intrusive nature. Yuzu never really developed as a character from ep 1 to ep 12. The worst two characters by far are Matsuri and the curly haired failure that follows Mei everywhere. Matsuri was clearly raised by wolves. She tries to make moves on Yuzu and constantly calls her \"onee-chan\" in the most irritating and nauseating voice ever heard in the history of anime. She is about 14 years old and sexts old men to make money. Darling where are your parents? Author what are you trying to teach to young girls watching this anime? The anime literally could have done without her. Period. Now for the curly haired failure that followed Mei around like a puppy, she was just absurd and downright weird. Why is she so obsessed with Mei? Mei is an empty shell without a personality. Another thing that bothered me was the addition of Nina and her sister Sara in the last couple episodes. The author had to shove them in there because the story started to get repetitive and boring. The author also had to shove Matsuri in the anime because things started to get repetitive and boring. See the trend? Sara and Nina were both cookie cutter lame 3-year old acting girls who did not help the plot one bit. It was quite frankly nauseating watching them act like toddlers. This is what I hate about anime. They feel the need to shove toddler looking and acting girls into rom com and slice of life animes and claim that they are in high school. All in all, I thought this anime was a complete flop. A failure. A work of trash. A disgrace. The author could have written the story better and actually developed the characters ffs. But nooooo she had to lose all her brain cells before she wrote Citrus. Should have just made it a hentai. Nuff said.",

(Lo que ya vieron almenos el primer episodio entender\u00e1n). \r\nEn fin, esta junto a otra chica, comparten polosopuesto, que a lo largo de la serie, sus formas de ser choca entre si o con personajes relacionadas con ellas. En si, este tipo de cosas puede ser visto en tu t\u00edpico Shonen favorito en la que el prota tiene al obligatorio rival, solo que ac\u00e1, en vez de agarrarse a golpes, suelen siempre a comerse a besos (En casi todos los cap\u00edtulos). En varios casos, los sucesos tienen a caer en lo clich\u00e9 del t\u00edpico drama rom\u00e1ntico (Amistad de la infancia, tercera en discordia, traumas infantiles, etc) sumado a la desesperante relaci\u00f3n que tienen este duo har\u00eda que cualquiera \"Droppeara\" de inmediato la serie, en la que nos entrega un desenlace \"Conformista\" despu\u00e9s de tantos problemas.  \\n\\n\r\nEstilo art\u00edstico (Art): 7\\n\r\nA pesar de verse algo gen\u00e9rico la animaci\u00f3n es estable, a pesar de no ser destacable, en algunas escenas me sorprenden los aspectos lum\u00ednicos en cuanto al dise\u00f1o de la ciudad, hasta lo hacian perecer un jodido Wallpaper. Aunque lo que si el uso de CGI, fue medianamente sutil, si ignoramos los estudiantes sin vida que salen en las tomas a\u00e9reas de la escuela o los trenes sacados de un juego de PS2. \\n\r\nEn cuanto al dise\u00f1o de personajes como ya mencione, es gen\u00e9rico. y siempre me incomodo el coloreado rosado en las piernas (Mayormente se nota m\u00e1s en Yuzu). \\n\\n\r\nOST/ Seiyuus (Sound): 8\\n\r\nEn cuanto a la banda sonora, fue normalona y no destacable, pero funciona en las escenas en la que las complementan. En cuanto a las voces, fueron buenas y supieron darle vida a los personajes, aunque siempre habra alguna voz que te sacara de tus casillas.\\n\\n\r\nPersonajes (Character): 4\\n\r\nEn este apartado ser\u00e9 sincero, los personajes no fueron nada entra\u00f1ables, Yuzu fue tu tipica chica buena samaritana con todos y la vez muy sumisa...demasiado dir\u00eda yo. Y Mei, la peor del duo, en la que su personalidad me desespera, ya sea por su inestabilidad emocional en la que hace que la serie se alarge m\u00e1s de los debido, y la relaci\u00f3n entre ellas se complique m\u00e1s. Luego est\u00e1n los secundarios que no aportan mucho y solo sirven de alivio despu\u00e9s de escenas de besos entre las f\u00e9minas. \\n\\n\r\nEntretenimiento (Enjoyment): 8\\n\r\nDespu\u00e9s de mencionar todos los problemas y cierto puntos a favor que tiene la serie, tengo que decir que supo mantenerme enganchado (Lo vi todo en un d\u00eda \u00a1\u00a1OMG!!), aunque peca de mostrarnos Flashbacks continuamente de sucesos del mismo capitulo, por lo que lo vuelve cansina \u00ac_\u00ac\\n\r\nY sus escenas \"Hot\" digamos que es su fuerte, aunque cae en darnos eso en casi toda la serie y que al final de tanto li\u00f3, sent\u00eds que la historia no avanzo mucho y que hasta la telenovela de tu madre hubiera concluido mejor. \\n\\n\r\nEn fin, no se si voy a seguir continuando de ver esta serie (Si le dan una segunda temporada) despu\u00e9s de ciertos sentimientos encontrados junto a un hate que lleva mi yo critico, solo el futuro lo dir\u00e1.\\n\r\n- Atte.

            "content": "I wasn't really sure what to expect with \"Citrus\" I'm not really big on the genre in the first place and my initial thoughts were to expect the worst. \r\nHowever, after completing the show, I can confirm that it exceeded my expectations, I didn't think the show was bad, but that doesn't mean I thought it was good. \r\nSo obviously the whole \"Step sibling incest\" thing is a bit of a clich\u00e9 within anime. I'm not particularly fond of it myself, I just find it a bit weird, I know that it floats some people's boat, but not mine. Because of this, the show hadthis slightly weird feel to it. I probably would of liked the romantic angle of this show a lot more if I wasn't reminded every 5 minutes that they're sisters. \\n\\n\r\nOne area where I think the show really did do well was in the visuals. the show looked really good and the animation was fluid and pleasing to the eye. it's definitely the best thing about Citrus. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was decent. I enjoyed the voice acting and there were a couple of stand out tracks from the soundtrack. However I wasn't particularly fond of either the opening or ending theme. I never usually skip opening themes but I found myself doing so on Citrus on more than one occasion. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Citrus are a mixed bag. For example I really enjoyed Yuzu as a main character, she was fun and silly, but also had her share of emotional moments that I feel made her a well rounded character. She also had a great chemistry with her friend Harumin, who was always there to lighten the mood.\\n\\n\r\n Unfortunately, I can't really say the same for Yuzu's love interest, Mei. She seemed very one dimensional and often lacked any emotion. I know this is her character trait, but I didn't really feel any need to try and look deeper into her character that what was shown on the surface. I also don't particularly agree with her method of seduction but that's a whole different story.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some genuinely good moments in the show. Times where the drama felt real and like it really mattered. The humour is good. It looks great and had a few likeable characters.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there were a lot of moments that I felt just didn't really make sense or just were forgettable in general. The soundtrack was a mixed bag of good tracks and completely forgettable or overused tracks, and the whole show I feel was just tainted slightly by the slightly odd romantic incest angle. \\n\\n\r\nAnd really, that is Citrus in a nut shell. It has a few standout moments, but overall, it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth.\\n\\n\r\nI give Citrus a 5/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Short Answer: I couldn't get into it due to the soap opera like nature.\r\nLong Answer: Citrus seems to be a pretty faithful adaptation of a manga series about the same thing. Simply put, it's a not blood related sister lesbian show, and it focuses mainly on that romance. I could honestly put myself past that. I've watched Oreimo and Eromanga Sensei, however, two things did it in for my enjoyment of the show.\r\n1. The sexual assault man. We all know anime that have them, and honestly we expect some at this point. But I felt like I needed to go back to confessional at theend of some of these episodes. It's straight up borderline rape in some of these scenes. While another person might appreciate the \"forcefulness\" these characters have, I unfortunately cannot say the same.\\n\\n\r\n2. When I said \"soap opera\" like nature, it goes beyond the problem anime usually has. Most anime have some sort of \"rubber-banding\" where the main problem is almost solved but then back to almost square one. I'd argue that many good shows avoid this, however it's an incessant problem in Citrus. You'll have characters not regressing to square one, but new ones come in out of the woodwork every single time to thwart the main romance. It's almost ridiculous how half of Tokyo is out to fuck one of these two sisters.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say that the animation or art style is completely garbage, because it was pretty decent. Regardless, the story and character just weren't up to what I needed it to be for me to enjoy.",

This anime does not cover ihomosexuality from this perspective, which let me down; it's built a setting where towards those people around you it is a taboo, but when leaving that crowd it is a social norm i.e. the kisses that took place in public locations.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this isn't homophobia, but at this moment of time even though strides have been made in equality for different orientations it has not compleely integrated with society yet; which is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto Japan, I've read up on Japan time and time again for various things (because of my interest in japan); historically, lords were allowed young boys (before maturity) as servants with which they could have intercourse with -however further research is pending, so don't take my word for it- what im getting at is this suggests sexual tolerance, but recent reports have suggested that there is a number of homosexuals in Japan who get into heterosexual relationships out of fear/humiliation/embarrassment.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, such symptoms are naturally more severe in younger individuals, particularly because of expectations from parents, guardians, elders etc. So yeah, whilst it may be a harmless anime, it had the potential of helping homosexuals adjust and empower them by going through the same circumstances -of which it failed to do.\\n\\n\r\nApart from this rant, this anime in general had an average story but whatever me the most were that pedestrian themes of the anime had somehow elevated e.g. the glittery eyes, the flowing hair, the sadist, the dangerous rival, the silver haired wildcard...\\n\r\nIt had everything, and everything was enhanced by the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nFrom time to time. It was gripping. The suspense had my heart skip a beat. I made memes FFS. MEMES. And it was because I hated on the rival.\\n\r\nThen there was the calm... The quiet... The intimacy between the two protagonists (yuzuha and Mei it seems). \\n\r\nI'm a guy, not gonna lie, fingers crossed for some scenes to cross the threshold. Honestly, some scenes were on thin ice that I am not at fault. Some scenes were suggestive.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarise, the romance story was generic... Who cares, anime's a tendency to do that; but if you like borderline suggestive Yuri, I don't see why not.",

            "content": "This show was quite deceptive, from its title I thought it was going to be about oranges or vitamin C, but oh boy was I wrong. Though with all seriousness, this show delves right into the sole reason of why you are actually watching it to begin with, which is LESBIAN LOVE! Oh Yea! The show is in no way apologetic about it and presents the viewer with what he or she wants right off the bat, with an opening that sets the tone for the rest of the show. Showing our two hot, non-blood related, incestuous love birds hitting it off with some tongueaction a couple of times throughout that minute and a half opening just to make sure you don\u2019t skip it (I sure as hell didn\u2019t, these scenes were the most enjoyable part of the show!). \\n\\n\r\nHello and welcome, I am a unique MAL user here to bring you a unique and short review, because you don\u2019t have the time to read and I don\u2019t have to time to write (it\u2019s mostly because of the latter though)! \\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t feel like reading here is my TL;DR: You\u2019ll get more satisfaction from watching a Yuri hentai than this. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story is about this girl called Yuzu who moves to a new area and transfers to a new school because her mom had remarried a deadbeat dad who never seems to be around, erm sorry what I meant to say was a father who loves helping other children abroad, and in the process got herself a stepsister called Mei, whom she falls in love with right away because she sexually assaults her (I wish this would happen in real life, this way I would have had a harem by now...). Ever heard of love at first sight? Yea, here it\u2019s love after a first kiss. \\n\\n\r\nI am going to be honest when saying that I went into the show not really expected much out of it, because all I really wanted was to watch some girls hit it off, but somehow despite this it managed to disappoint. Yuzu, who never seemed interested in girls, falls in love with Mei for no apparent reason asides from her forcefully imposing a kiss out of the blue. What followed after that was by no means romantic, it was molestation or perhaps even rape; for the next few episodes all we ever saw was forceful sexual harassment to the point where I felt that each of them was developing Stockholm\u2019s syndrome. Things kept going this way even after a love triangle was established, with the new girl being as kinky, if not more, as they are. I mean yes sure seeing girls forcing themselves on each other was fun the first few times, but the joy of it wore off quicker than I thought it would. Though to be honest all this frustration was my fault, I thought that some Yuri would be enough for me to be satisfied with a show that I didn\u2019t expect much out of anyways, but I was wrong. The worst part is that it had potential to touch upon the subject of incest in a serious way, since we saw some feelings of regret, hesitance, and doubt among both our main characters at the start. Both questioned the morality of their actions and their relationship for some time, which would have been interesting had it been well explored. I believe that the show should have focused on the stresses that they could have felt while hiding their love affair and could have explored their long-term goals and expectations of this romance knowing that they may not be able to take it to another level or may have to indefinitely keep it a secret. Another issue that the show, unfortunately, fails to capitalize upon the idea that a person\u2019s environment can shape a person\u2019s sexual orientation. I used to be in a school were the girls and boys where segregated, so I got to witness and experience some of the things that the show tried to portray, such as girls holding hands and acting like lovers, even though they were not supposedly gay.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of trying to focus on social issues such as those mentioned above, the show chooses a path of redundancy where events that we had previously seen and experienced kept being reiterated. For the first time in a long while I felt like my brain was on cruise control; something which I rarely experience when watching a show, which pretty much means that what is going on in my head is far more entertaining that what was playing on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSomehow the show\u2019s plot stands out more than its characters. From what I had experienced, this show simply consists of a group of sexually frustrated female high schoolers who all seem to want to find true love. Now this is not a bad thing on its own of course, but the way these characters were presented and the way they approach their supposed love interests are rather identical and nonsensical. The one character that stands out happens to be Matsuri, and not because she happens to be interesting, but because she has the squeakiest voice I have ever heard! I had to take a step back whenever I heard her speak, her voice was incredibly weird to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animations of the show do the trick, meaning that they are not particularly good or bad. However, the show did have some pretty weird and sometimes even awful CGI, especially when the cars were displayed. Though overall they were fine.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nSimilar to the animations, the music does the trick. The opening and ending of the show were fine and mildly entertaining, though will did not leave a lasting mark. The same thing applies to the OST of the show which, in general, never really stood out or distracted me, which means it was just fine, not bad or good enough to make my eyes pop wide-open O_O. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI do not recommend you watch this because, even though I am no expert when it comes to romance, I am sure there are far more satisfying shows than this.\\n",

Over-the-top melodramatic situations, and typical high school drama put this anime among a vast multitude of others in the pool of utter mediocrity.\r\nOf course, I speak only for the anime, having not read the manga. Week after week I stick with the show only to seek some validation for the manga readers, but that doesn't seem to be happening, due to either a poor original premise, or an absolute butchering of the source material.\r\nThe visual and audio design don't really redeem it either.Sure, we've seen worse, but this is supposed to be a pretty big series, and the animation is quite below average, even for a slice-of-life romance. The art is okay, I guess, although nothing unique.\\n\r\nThere are also the characters (apparently that's what they're called), which are of the highest quality of cardboard. There's nothing really worth talking about here, if I'm being completely honest. Tropes upon tropes simply make character interactions a dull, pointless, 23 minute exercise. Oh wait, there's the music. Nothing special. The opening is quite nice though, but I highly doubt I'll remember it if asked the day after tomorrow.\\n\r\nBeing the trash I am, this telenovela, sorry, anime still managed to give me some form of entertainment, as I tune in every week to see it collapse upon itself to form a sad excuse for animation. Also there's the yuri, an aspect that it tries, but fails to deliver on to satisfaction. The number's to the top right of the review anyway, but to make it absolutely clear, it doesn't deserve more than a 4 out of 10.\\n\r\nThat's just below mediocre. So if by any coincidence whatsoever the folks at Passione read this, please don't fuck up Highschool DxD.",

The girl-to-girl is somewhat aggressive especially in the beginning of the series and this may put off some, but if you don't dislike that type of anime in particular, I'd say try this series because the character development is interesting to watch. At first, Yuzu and Mei protagonists are cringe-worthy, but then the show tactically gets you to empathize with and root for them over time. \r\nThe anime has a nice and modern art style and themusic is catchy. Everything kinda rolls up together making a nicely delivered modern-slice-of-life-anime package that emphasizes story-telling, character development, and plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nAt the very least,  USE THE THREE-EPISODE RULE. I would even dare say it'll hook you later than that, maybe episode 4 or 5. But don't throw it out if you've only seen the first episode, because this is worth it to ride out if you give it a chance to change your mind. I stuck with it and am happy I did.",

            "content": "TLDR; This is an anime that I love to hate. The story is terrible, characters are shallow and fickle, and the pacing is atrocious. But I'm still going to finish it. Why? I have no idea, but it just a fun little anime.\r\nThere's no denying that this anime is bad. The anime is a faithful representation to the manga, which was seemingly popular. But bad. Really bad. \r\nTo me, it seems that the writers had tonnes of ideas for things they could do with this story, but didn't think too much about how to flesh out the characters or how to pace the story. Soin their rush to get to the parts they wanted to, character development and pacing went out the window. \\n\\n\r\nSpoilers ahead\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nIn the first two episodes, the main character (Yuzu) does a complete 180 degree turn in her stance on her new step-sister, Mei, who forced her tongue into her mouth for shits and giggles about 5 secconds after meeting her. Somehow, this leads Yuzu to fall helplessly in love with Mei, for reasons unknown. \\n\\n\r\nFor the next 6 episodes, Yuzu is forced to deal with her feelings. Seems a bit much, a bit fast. But then Yuzu jumps through a stupid amount of hoops, constantly having her emotions toyed with by Mei, as she attempts to get closer to Mei so they can make out without Mei raping her for once. A love triangle is introduced, but literally only lasts about an episode, making it the most useless arc in anime history. Mei's father is introduced, then the problem is resolved within 2 minutes. ANOTHER useless arc.\\n\\n\r\nYuzu then realises Mei needs a sister and not a lover. This is stupid. \\n\r\nMei was the person who first made their relationship sexual, and never tried to be a sister in the first episode. Why did she do that? No idea. And I don't think we will ever know. Now another love triangle has been introduced, and I don't think it will go anywhere either. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style and character voices are both decent, and do as good a job possible with the two dimensional characters. Opening is decent, but forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nLook. This anime is bad. But you should consider watching it. Its something of a guilty pleasure. Think of it like one of those brainless soaps on the TV. They are stupid and drama filled, but you want to keep watching.",

The visual is nice, there nothing to say about that there. But the story... first, and the most important thing, this anime/manga ROMANTICIZE sexual agressions while it is far from acceptable. I\u2019ve watched a lot of anime to know that rape culture is something too common in animes/mangas. And I\u2019m tired of it. Romanticising sexual violence leads to people (and I think about young girls mostly) thinking it\u2019s ok, that if it happens to them it is normal, that itis nothing big and that it is fine to agress someone else. Well it is, and the way Mei, Yuzu and the others (even if there\u2019s a part a love or whatsoever) do things without the other\u2019s consent is wrong, and very annoying to watch. Big deception. Second, all this insest thing is quite disturbing but again too common and romanticised in animes etc.\\n\r\nAnyway, that kind of anime\u2019s/mangas, in times like these where there is too much sexual agressions/rape etc in the world, should seriously stop. How can someone even romanticise that when victims are destroyed in real life ? For god\u2019s sake... so irritating",

I know exactly how Yuzu feels after Mei kissed her and how shes never felt like that before. I love watching how Yuzu keeps finding excuses to be with Mei even though shes scared of her feelings. I cant wait for the rest of the series and even though its not done yet im really hoping there will be enough content for a season 2. Ive almost finished the manga and i have to say asa fan of yuri i really cant wait for more of this. I also feel like that you can connect with the characters and their feelings such as a first love and that scary feeling of being close to them then when you eventually work up the courage it feels so great and liberating to finally get that off your chest. In conclusion i think all round this is by far my favorite anime in the romance category and one of my favorites all round if you havent watched it yet id totally recommend it to you",

The characters are more than skin deep, and, for the most part, reasonably entertaining. The art and sound are up to, perhaps even a little beyond, the standard for today's shows. There even appears to be some emerging depth of plot as we movefrom scenario to yuri-fuel scenario.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, to its credit, Citrus is the kind of trash that clearly endeavors to be more complex than one would initially think. Our heroine's 'sister' is evidently struggling with abandonment and intimacy issues, and the heroine's search for love is engaging enough - they're both plot threads I'd like to see followed through. But for all this apparent effort the struggles of our protagonists have born fruit only in giving us more non-con makeout sessions. Hence my calling the show garbage. Garbage or not though, I'm invested enough to be along for the ride..",

Just way too many bizarre scenarios are excused and forgiven for seemingly no reason atall aside from moving on to the next absurd thing.\\n\\n\r\nVery, very bad.

It's particular problems are a repitition of the same general conflict and the sexual-assaulty way Yuzu and Mei start off their relationship.\r\nHow I got to this point:\r\nI finally got around to finishing this anime at the dawn of the new year mainly because of the manga. I got impatient with wanting to see what happened with the story as to was airing so I saught out the manga, caught up with what I had watched in anime form and quickly started to get annoyed at theplot, and promptly dropped it (I'll explain why a bit later). I did finally pick it up again as I was busy with personal things but I also don't want a story to stay unfinished in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe story:\\n\r\nIt's difficult to explain what I liked and disliked about a story without explaining the story, so I summed it up in the beginning if you want to avoid me spoiling it for you. This is also the lion-share of my review so you have been warned.\\n\\n\r\nThe Citrus anime, imo both benefits and suffers from not adapting the entire manga. While I have not yet read the whole thing myself, the reason why I stopped is also the way I think the anime improves on its sourse material - too many girls are in love with Mei or Yuzu. I stopped reading the manga after the forth coflict in a row was revealed to be \"this girl is in love with one of the main couple\". I was like: \"Oh come on! DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!\" The anime thankfully stops at the third one but I think the story would have been better for it if they had dropped one of the three - Himeko's being my choice. \\n\\n\r\nThe story also has a problem right out of the gate as well. I mentioned at the start that I have some misgivings about how Mei and Yuzu start off their interactions and the topic is concent.\\n\\n\r\nYuzu first encounters Mei on her first day at her new school when Yuzu unknowingly violates the dresscode and is confronted about it by members of the student council at the gate. Mei being the council president sees this and conducts a quick search of Yuzu's clothes for her smartphone as it is off limits to carry a phone into the school grounds and confiscates it. I didn't take this bit very seriously as I though the sensual way in which it was shown was intended to be taken as Yuzu's perspective and that she was just taking it as more sexual that it actually was (Mei was just looking for her phone after all) because she didn't realize she was into girls yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe real problematic part is when they are at home and Mei, completely out of the blue pushes Yuzu on her back and gives her a very long kiss. This is another instance of sexual interactions under dubious concent, unfortunately common among yaoi works of fiction as well. It's rather hard to judge whether this was against Yuzu's will or not - at one point she starts kicking and knocks over a case of make up, on the other hand when the two of them finally part lips they are both visibly out of breath so it could be that Yuzu was only struggling because she was running low on air. The anime (and, if I'm not misremembering, the manga as well) makes no attempt to clarify which is it and just leaves it up to interpretation. I'd rather go with the lack of oxygen as it means that Yuzu isn't in love with a family member who sexually assaulted her.\\n\\n\r\nTheir next \"romantic\" interaction comes up after they fall into a pool of water outside and need to take a shower together. Mei makes another unambiguously sexual advance on Yuzu who this time pushes her aways but doesn't bring up the issue of whether or not that kiss was consentual and instead only wants to ask about the mixed messages she's been getting from Mei. The story keeps side-stepping the issue instead of adressing it but I've seen much more blatantly rapey interactions between romantic couples in anime so it's thankfully not that bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot-point about Mei's grandfather was very good but I think it came much too early in the story. It's the first conflict after Yuzu and Mei meet and what flows it is 3 of the same conflict back to back, it would have been much better passing to have it happen in-between 2 of those, preferebly as the second-to-last conflict as it actually has by far the highest stakes.\\n\\n\r\nThese last few have been factors it shares with the sourse material, but I do need to bring one particular scene in the manga as I think the show is worse off for not having it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story opens with Yuzu chatting with some of her female friends about her transfer and in the manga she meets up with them again. At that point she's pretty sure she's in love with Mei and during that second conversation, the two girls she's talking to show that they have some pretty overtly homophobic views. This really hammers home the point that a lot of people would view even her interest in girls as unnatural much less her step-sister. I don't remember the manga very clearly, but I'd be shocked and disappointed if this point in particular goes unadressed. It's a very real conflict with very real stakes no matter how it is dealt with.\\n\\n\r\nBut I criticize because I care and I recognize that there is merit to the story the writer is trying to tell. At the core of it is the question \"What is love?\" not just \"Will they get together?\" as it usually is in this genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe art:\\n\r\nThere isn't really much to talk about here. The animation is basic for the most part - nothing that will blow your mind, but nothing distractingly bad that I've noticed. The animators did put in a bit more effort than the usual for an anime in the characters eyes. And any credit regarding the design of the characters themselves, with is good btw, would be due to the sourse material. There is a bit of same-face syndrome going on here with the girls, but that's all really.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound:\\n\r\n... Is not my forte of analysis, so I'll leave this one alone. I gave it a 5/10 because the tracks did stand out too much to me and I can't really say much about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters:\\n\r\nThis links with my opinion of the story itself as while it does iritate me that so many characters are just third wheels (... or forth... or fifth) to the relatioship we follow, I will grant points here for at least making them feel like seporate characters that go about splitting the main pair in different ways and different reasons for liking the one that they do. This goes a long way to mitigate the problem with the same-y conflicts.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment:\\n\r\nI found it an overall enjoyable show despite the times when it annoyed me and I didn't find the ambiguity of concent here as problematic as it could have been and it happened only at the start of the story and other interactions were much more clear cut with how consentual they were.",

There was enough action to say it's not boring. I liked the elements of this show.. first drama then romance, fun. \r\nI mentioned manga. I must say it's really correct to original and they don't add any non-logical things addapted to it. \r\nArt style was really amazing.

            "content": "It all started because I needed a break.\r\nAfter watching a lot of serious and saddening stuff, getting my heart broken way too many times and crying my eyes off because of how some shows ended, I needed something easier. Something lighthearted, with little to even no plot, just some amusing action and characters that make me smile. That's when Crunchyroll recommended me something that looked like a really average yuri, taking place in an all-girls school, with the main character realising her preference for girls in an unusual and a bit too stretched-out way.\r\nI clicked \"watch\", without giving myself a chance to second guess.\r\nWhat happenednext is a mess full of:\\n\r\n- yelling at the screen on which characters argued for another time\\n\r\n- blankly staring at the wall because I needed a breather\\n\r\n- explaining to my friends why do I make such a big deal of some random anime that made me question my views on morality of relationships\\n\r\n- and finally, those short moments of satisfaction, when the couple I (and I still feel a bit guilty about it) wanted to get together, got a moment for themselves.\\n\r\nSeriously, while it seems like yet another show about girls falling in love in embarrassing circumstances, Citrus made me think about what is right and how far can we draw the line, the border, between the socially acceptable (at least in the ideal world) love, and this other confusing feeling that almost everyone experiences in one way or another - lust, awakened by accident, by someone we should not be sexually interested in.\\n\r\nBut what's more - we get real characters! Characters with personalities, unique traits, motivations... We believe in them. We relate to the confused Yuzu, who tries to understand sensations that Mei gives her, to Mei, who tries her best to act indifferent but it's hard when she is just so starved for any form of affection and acceptance. To Harumin, who wants the best for her friend. To Momokino, who only needs a tiny bit of attention from someone she cares for.\\n\r\nWe also have a chance to see a lot of differences from other usual romances. You can see how surprisingly many interactions between characters is consensual, how much you can hear about importance of your other halfs feelings and, what I think is the most valid lesson we can learn from this gem, how huge is the role of communication. Seriously, I even started doubting if I myself, am a good partner!\\n\r\nOkay, I said a lot of good things but, unfortunately, I can't let you think that this emotional rollercoaster of anime series is perfect. Because it is not, in any way.\\n\r\nI can easily blame the fact that there are only twelve episodes, and that's the whole reason for how rushed the plot seems to be sometimes, but it wouldn't be completely true. Unless I assume that the creators weren't aware of how many episodes they have to cover with some extremely well-written dialogues and an ILLEGAL amount of sexual tension (which is obviously NOT what happened), I have to admit that they've messed up. \\n\r\nA lot of smaller plots had to be opened in order to create a believable relationship between main characters but they never got the chance to be finished. Sure, we can imagine that every single obstacle that Mei and Yuzu overcome during they pursuit to find their real love, magically disappears after being \"defeated\". But that's just not how life works, I can name at least four characters and three shorter plots that were literally BEGGING to be explored. If you know you won't have time to finish them all in a satisfying way, why would you create them from the start?\\n\r\nThe visual side of Citrus is just good. Yuzu is definetely the best drawn character in the show, while others tend to melt together because of how similar they are. It's cool though, I believe that that is what the creators wanted.\\n\r\nSo in the end, even if it's not a must watch, neither is it an anime you watch with the primary purpose of watching this particular one, I highly recommend giving it a shot. Because there are some real emotions hidden in this little, but definetely not so cute, love story.",

The characters are VERY VERY VERY exagerated but that's expected but I think what really makes the protagonists (semi) compeling is the conflict about expressing their feelings or not and that is writen well enough that you can get invested although I believe the show focuses to much onthe protagonist and her lover when the could/should have explored the surrounding characters tieing it into the main plot but that's just me, 12 episodes doesn't leave a lot of room for that. I don't criticise art or sound because it doesn't affect my enjoyment of the show and gets the point across.Overall, I would recomend this to someone that likes romance anime and that can look past a lot of the shows short comings, doesn't mind a lot of lesbian fan service (or just embraces it ... that also works) and that has a lot of time (because don't be dumb like me and make time to watch this show)",

            "content": "To sum Citrus up: it wasn't enough. I was hoping for girls consensually kissing, girls discovering their sexualities, family bonds being re-tied, reserved people making friends\u2026but I clearly expected too much.  \r\nThe main reason that I rated Citrus higher than my review might suggest is because the art style\u2019s beautiful and I was able to push aside a lot of the things that bothered me, to a certain extent. Citrus also has a lot of potential, which is why I\u2019ll probably be reading the manga in hopes that it can offer me everything that the anime didn\u2019t. \r\nLet\u2019s start with the most obvious problem.Why the flipity fuck has Yuzu not met the man who her mother\u2019s supposed to marry? I know this happens in a couple of anime, but it never fails to piss me off. Like, who was at the wedding? Did the mum just run off with some guy for a few months then come back married? I need a justification.\\n\\n\r\nThat point aside, Citrus starts off with the potential for a very interesting plot line but then spirals down into a tedious, generic story. \\n\r\nMei has daddy issues, people try to get in the way of their relationship and that\u2019s pretty much the entire plot. \\n\r\nThe first four (or was it six?) episodes are very enjoyable and they had me seriously anticipating the next stage- the moment when the plot was going to get real deep. It didn\u2019t happen. Those first few episodes focus mostly on family dynamics, but the moment Yuzu realises her feelings for Mei, it becomes a case of other girls getting in the way. Over and over again, that\u2019s all there is: two episodes centring around one girl who wants to separate them, then the next two centring around another girl who wants to keep them apart and the cycle\u2019s never-ending. \\n\\n\r\nIn some anime, sexual harassment\u2019s not talked about as an issue. To enjoy these, there\u2019s a need to acknowledge that what\u2019s happening\u2019s terrible but still look past it. I know. Not an easy thing. But it\u2019s the case for Citrus. Mei, Yuzu, and multiple other girls touch and kiss each other without consent- when the person\u2019s vocally and physically resisting their advances- and I was hoping that this anime would actually talk about it, seeing that it\u2019s a recent one. But no. Shitty excuses are given and the affair\u2019s never to be mentioned again. In fact, it\u2019s kinda romanticised. Nevertheless, as much as it disgusted me, I managed to not let the sexual harassment bother my watching experience.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s, ironically, a serious lack of discussion about sexuality. I first thought that Yuzu was straight- seeing the way she fawned over boys- and hoped to watch her discover her sexuality. Then, because she accepted her crush over Mei so fast, I assumed she was bi. But then, suddenly, in the later episodes, she pulls out the infamous line: \u201cLiking girls isn\u2019t normal.\u201d Excuse me- what? Where did this come from? And the worst part\u2019s that this statement never comes back again! I was so confused! Are you questioning your sexuality? Are you homophobic? Are you already bi? \\n\\n\r\nThe characters truly are the saving grace of this anime. Well, their relationships are. The friendship dynamics are heart-warming (Harumi\u2019s friendship goals, the girl seriously deserved more screen time) and the conversations are amusing enough. There\u2019s just not enough of it. The series is so focussed on Mei and Yuzu that the interesting relationships I actually cared about were explored so little.\\n\\n\r\nIndividually, the characters are well fleshed out, but again, just like this entire anime, not enough. I wanted to learn more about them as people, instead of how horny they were. Mei\u2019s a meh main character; Yuzu, though, is a protagonist worth talking about\u2026\\n\\n\r\nYuzu\u2019s the typical high school girl who loves fashion, going out with her friends and cooking (She\u2019s actually referred to as \u201cthe perfect wife\u201d- I shit you not- I wanted to throw up). Despite her slightly trope- filled personality, I enjoyed her character a lot, thanks to her daring attitude. However, that attitude quickly withers away as she spends most of the episodes, her head in her hands, whining about Mei, Mei and Mei. The latter\u2019s the only thing on Yuzu\u2019s mind, to the point that she could look at a fucking table, or a bright orange lamp and somehow draw a parallel to her sister. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s an illness or a superpower.\\n\r\nHere are some un-canon things that Yuzu would surely say: \\n\r\n\u201cOh look a floor- Mei walks on floors\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cHey there\u2019s my old friend, I wish that Mei was my friend *cries*\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to Karaoke- Mei doesn\u2019t go to karaoke\u2019s\u2026\u201d. \\n",

I'm not an expert when it comes to this. I mean I enjoyed the noises the girls made when engaging in... sexual activity? That was awesome!\r\nCharacters... I think this is where the show somewhat suffered. There was nothing wrong with the characters, of course. Apart from Yuzu being a dumb ass at times. I just think there are somecharacters that should have had more development. Fortunately, it seems Citrus might get a second season eventually... Since apparently, the manga is pretty long. Can only hope.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it. It wasn't a masterpiece or anything like that, but it was pretty fun. Again,at times it was frustrating but romances can be like that at times.",

Every interaction is an emotional roller-coaster; you never know whats going to happen!! As each episode comes to an end you are basically forced to watch the next as the cliffhangers are phenomenally done. The art differs from mainstream anime in a way that can be appreciated. The character design is surprisingly unique and visually appealing. All the characters look remarkably different which just shows the attention to detail in this anime. Speaking of characters, each and every one serves a greatpurpose to the plot and pushes it forward in a compelling way. The plot itself is quite possibly the best I've seen in any anime. It pulls you in right on the first episode and does not let you go until it has ended, leaving you stunned by its elegance.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, this anime succeeds in every category. The excellent art, plot and characters lead to an overall delightful experience. All I can say now is that incest is wincest. 10/10 IGN",

            "content": "Primarily in Citrus though common in many Shouji Ai series the viewer needs to abandon moral judgement in order to make the series enjoyable. The idea of \u201cCitrus\u201d is mostly unrealistic in it\u2019s general concept and presentation of the series which touches on potentially sensitive subject matter, and without separating the show from reality, it may be troublesome for some viewers to comfortably sit through the series, never mind enjoy it. \r\nWhile this subject matter was not an issue to me, it most likely was to many viewers, hence the scoring being below a seven on MAL when most potentially \u201cbad anime\u201d to the generalpopulation can generously receive a seven or higher. However, the use of this subject matter or the way it\u2019s presented doesn\u2019t reflect my score of \u201cCitrus\u201d, I just personally see many flaws in other parts of the show that made it exceptionally less enjoyable overall.\\n\r\n\u201cCitrus\u201d by many of it\u2019s top rated viewers praise the series on it\u2019s strength in story progression and character development, which I personally saw little of. Though I am aware of it\u2019s adaptation being a manga, and have not delved into the manga myself, this may have been the issue with the adaptation in terms of the lack of progression in story and characters. Potentially as by much of the audience who have read and watched the series said it adapted much of the mange \u201cwell\u201d or \u201ccorrectly\u201d, it may have also adapted some of the manga\u2019s issues, however I\u2019m not too sure myself.\\n\r\nThe storyline in \u201cCitrus\u201d didn\u2019t progress much farther off than the issue from the first episode: whether Yuzu or Mei would get together. And yes, while this is typically an okay concept for a twelve-episode anime to cover, the progression made it seem like as soon as they should be together, something (most commonly a character) got in their way and their feelings resulting emotion and overall progression of their relationship went back to square one, over and over again. I personally felt as if I watched the first and twelfth episodes of \u201cCitrus\u201d that would be the story, and everything in-between had minimal to no impact on the storyline after the \u201carc\u201d was over and was like it hadn\u2019t ever been an issue in the first place. \\n\r\nLike the storyline, this is what created ineffective side characters in \u201cCitrus\u201d and though yes, side characters are often introduced to progress the plot, they never really did. I felt as if I could go into \u201cCitrus\u201d without meeting the majority of their side characters and that would completely be fine. One after another, a side character was introduced into the story as a block between Mei and Yuzu\u2019s relationship, and once that was settled everything went back to normal, and they either a) never appear again, or b) remain supportive of Mei and Yuzu\u2019s relationship like they just could\u2019ve been to begin with. Even major characters such as Yuzu and Mei have minimal character development themselves until the last episode, while in-between after every conflict any progression we saw from either disappeared. \\n\r\nSo, while lack of storyline and characterization was an issue for me, one thing that kept me around in \u201cCitrus\u201d was the fanservice. And while many criticize its consistent use of it throughout the anime, I felt as the way it was presented was the only thing that kept me interested, as it was so raw and often did have reason through the plot. \\n\r\nHowever, apart from this, there\u2019s little I can praise of \u201cCitrus\u201d. \\n\r\nIf you watch anime purely for the enjoyment, while that be in \u201cCitrus\u201d through fanservice, a yuri relationship, or what have you, this anime will surely interest you, and I highly recommend as one of the \u201cGuilty pleasure\u201d watches. Otherwise it\u2019s not positive you\u2019ll find much enjoyment through this anime through the use of storytelling and plot development. \\n\r\nHowever, by the end of \u201cCitrus\u201d I personally believe the entire audience may question why it\u2019s called that in the first place. \\n",

It starts off really interesting but like so many anime fails to deliver at the end.\r\nThe story is weak, basically a lesbian relationship that gets stretched by challenges, it teases you with the promise of two people getting together which is common in other anime too.\r\nThe thing is that there's not really a backstory to one of the main characters, leaving you to wonder why she is acting this way, and it's never explained apart from her saying that it's just how she is.\r\nThere were parts where it got interesting, but it just went unexplained.\r\nHoles inthe story, that frustrate you.\\n\r\nCharacters that seem to know everything from another character when they just met. \\n\r\nA highly unpredictable character that is unpredictable without reasons.\\n\r\nSo much more that's wrong with this anime.\\n\r\nAll to arrive at a \"they lived happily ever after story\".\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, there are things like the interactions that felt really realistic and they did a good job on those and i found it at least enjoyable to binge watch this, however it's only worth watching this when you like to be teased with relationships, and don't mind being disappointment in the end.\\n\\n\r\nSpoilers -->>\\n\\n\r\nThe part with the pink haired juvenile wanna be pimp confuses me the most, how does she know just by looking at Mei that she'd kiss just about anyone, and that she's twisted like that. And WHY in FREAKING hell does she just casually get away with blackmailing her into being a hooker and instantly gets forgiven by yuzu. ALSO we don't know how Mei dealt with her \"client\" either, no way in hell that he's just gonna walk away from free sex like that.",

            "content": "Let\u2019s start off with this, I have only been watching anime for a little under a year now, so I\u2019m no professional whenever it comes to watching and interpreting anime quite yet, but I feel like I\u2019m getting there. With that being said, I\u2019m a very simple person when it comes to anime, if the show is interesting, I\u2019ll watch it through to the end. If at any point, I feel like the show isn\u2019t going anywhere or I find the characters bland, I\u2019ll drop it, however, this has only happened once. \r\nWhen it comes to Citrus, it was the first Yuri anime that Ihave ever seen. Hell, I didn\u2019t even know what the genre was until I found this anime. Yuri aside, I adore romance stories and I\u2019ll be damned if this is not once of the best romance anime\u2019s I\u2019ve seen. The character\u2019s personalities and emotions were so bold in every single episode, it left me wanting to see them grow more and more and understand their past experiences as an explaination for them. Yuzu\u2019s and Mei\u2019s story are extremely compelling and easily relatable and I think that\u2019s why I loved this anime so much. These sisters are in an incredibly awkward position, loving each other not because they are sisters, but because they are exactly what the other person needs in a relationship. They are each other\u2019s missing pieces to their own personal puzzle and its just so adorable.\\n\\n\r\nAfter I finished the anime, I was left wanting more, so this is the first time I actually purchased the manga. It was the best decision I have ever made because the manga goes SOOO much more in depth about our beloved main characters and the story continues onward! I can\u2019t wait for the rest of the manga to be released now and I\u2019m very much hoping that they come out with a season 2 for Citrus, it honestly deserves it.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR;\\n\\n\r\nStory: Pretty generic, step-siblings meet each other, fall in love and so fourth, however, the delivery of the story for this show was very unique which deserves Kudos. 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nArt: Surprisingly very pretty. The color\u2019s were amazing and everything in the show was visually appealing. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Something that gets overlooked very often but this show does a pretty good job with sound queues. The background noise is always subtle and suitable for the enviorment, music was on point enhancing the emotion in each situation and the voice acting was amazing. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Mei and Yuzu are two of my favorite characters in romance hands down. They both have their obvious problems and I thoroughly enjoyed watching them both grow as indivuals. The supporting cast was also spectacular, Harumin best girl.  9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Again, I can\u2019t stress enough, I have never been more satisfied after watching a pure romance anime. If anyone wanted a recomendation for Romance, I\u2019d recommend Citrus in a heartbeat. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you love great art style, charming character delivery, romance and that delicious yuri action, look no further than Citrus. This show was extremely good and won\u2019t disappoint. 9/10",

            "content": "Disappointing and overhyped, Citrus is an incomplete mess that failed to live up to its potential. Yes, I know how it sounds like I hate this anime just by opening my review with that, but that isn't (entirely) the case. The truth is, my feelings towards Citrus are rather mixed. It didn't exactly offend me as much as other FAR worse shows have (referring to SAO, of course), but I just can't help but be disappointed by the overall show.\nOne of my biggest gripes with the show is its writing. At times, the writing can be quite solid and give a lot of emotional depthto the situation being presented. But most times, the melodrama is quite forced and eventually just gets tiring to keep up with.\\n\nThe one thing I hated the most about the writing (and about the whole show, actually) was the nonconsenual elements. These acts serve no purpose to the overall plot, and seem to have just been included to grab the auidence's attention. That being said, it makes the show (particulary the first half) so uncomfortable to watch. Had these elements not been present, I probably would've enjoyed Citrus a bit more.\\n\nAnother big issue I had with Citrus is its characters. I won't exactly get into detail with the side characters, but I will say that most of them were boring, and the ones that served as the antagonists for a brief while were quite annoying. The characters I will be discussing in further detail are the starlets of our show: Yuzu and Mei Aihara.\\n\nYuzu Aihara is probably one of the best protagonists I've encountered in the little amount of romance anime I've seen. Throughout many times in the shows, she proves herself to be an emphathetic character in how she interacts and cares for others. Despite this however, she also has her flaws, as she can be arrogant and a bit of a jerk at times. This actually made her more realistic and relatable to me, and I really liked her as a character. I just wish I could say the same for her goth girlfriend.\\n\nMei Aihara is a dull, and overall, unlikeable character. She barely has any personality aside from staring with a constant deadpan expression and an adherence to filial piety. The little personality she does have is that of an awful, manipulative molester. I was hoping that I would grow to like her as the story progressed, but I just ended more sick of her character by the end of twelve episodes.\\n\nEven as someone who has taken half a year of chemistry in high school, I could tell that there was practically no chemistry between the two at all. Their whole relationship dynamic is unhealthy (as it all began with the aforementioned nonconsensual elements) and feels terribly forced. It's incredibly hard to care about a love story when one of the characters is unlikeable, and that is exactly the case with Mei Aihara. The only reason for them being an item is because the story says they have to be an item, without any justifiable (or healthy) cause. What does Yuzu see in this girl that makes her even worth pursuing? The obvious answer is nothing, and its a shame that Yuzu couldn't see that as well.\\n\nAside from my long and incoherent rambling on the story and characters, I would also like to briefly discuss the sound, art, and my enjoyment.\\n\nThe art is lovely. Even for all the girls in uniforms, each of the characters have a fair amount of design that distingusihes them from each other. \\n\nThe sound is fairly decent. I didn't care much for the opening, but I kind of like the ending theme.\\n\nOverall, I have mixed feelings towards this show. I can't say that I liked it, but I won't exactly say I hated it either. (Though it may seem that way.) Had it done some things better (like a more even narrative and better characterization for the side characters and Mei) and done away with some others (removing the nonconsensual elements, for example), I would've enjoyed it a bit more. At the end of the day, I just wish that Yuzu could've gotten a healthier relationship. She deserves better than Mei!",

            "content": "I will dive into this show with and open mind, mind you I said I do not like shows like dragonball or fairy tale, nor will I watch them I look for more unique looking anime, instead of the cookie cutter mundane action style anime hell episode 1 of persona 5 I fell asleep half way through so that is not saying much. \r\nAs for Citrus, it is different yes and had its good points and bad points but at least no one died in the anime, (which that added plot feature annoys me) well we have two step sisters Yuzu and Mei who didnot ask to be thrown together but this is what happens when mom marries dad if you will. Mei is cold and calculating and will kiss anything on two legs ( sounds like scums wish) but then there is the aloof Yuzu who makes this anime fun and exciting.  So.... lets get to the nitty gritty\\n\\n\r\nStory: a 7 and here is why,\\n\r\nThe story is modern and we are a modern society and we have had so much of the same sex rammed down our throats it is sickening but where the plus in this story is the romance that develops or should I say feelings between Yuzu and Mei although in the beginning it is one sided and Mei does come around but where the story lacks is the development of Matsuri, Nina, and Sara in my eyes for the story to be a 10 all three girls should have been established early on. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5 - nothing to really catch the eye for this anime. The CG is terrible not like any other anime i seen as of late If this were a Navel or a Okamoto style anime then the art would be more detailed. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 - This has the good 70's and 80's music feel that I do like and it sounds clean and well polished but not at good as the music of Clannad\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5 here is why\\n\\n\r\nThey spend way too miuch time on Mei and Yuzu when they could have developed other relationships around Yuzu or Mei, also they did not do Nina, Sara or Matsuri any justice either. I felt these characters came in way too late, we should have seen a budding relationship between Mei and Sara, and heck who knows Yuzu could have ran into a cute guy while at the mall in Tokyo, and any rate the characters are way underdeveloped and maybe a second season is needed to focus more on these characters one will never know unless the god of anime deem it so. My point is the characters towards the end lack development and need to be expounded on more to make the story one you cannot quit watching. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 8 - HERE IS WHY \\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime it was fun and sometimes sad with a twist of romance of the same sex, The facial expressions are good and the sense that it had a story to tell was there the one of same sex unrequited love. so it was somewhat enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a 7\\n\r\nPros - a funny romance story featuring two step sisters and whole lot of extras. This could have been well thought out and more episodes needed to tell the story but I do believe it strays from the manga and rushes several characters. More episodes are needed to do this it should have been a 24 episode anime instead of 12 so that better character development can  take place I would watch this if you are sick of the main stream anime ( except Bleach) of course. So if this type of story does not offend you give a watch.",

            "content": "Citrus for me was a bit awkward. I mean, I started it as a joke, but it turned into something I started watching.\r\nStory: Citrus' story is a bit out of place. It has a basic goal that has Yuzu trying to find out her feelings while also trying to mend/build up what she has with Mei, her step-sister. Although the premise seems easy to follow, the events seem like they're not planned that well. You have your events that occur throughout the year, but some that seem important are just left behind, never to be seen again. However, even with that, they did still manageto keep some previous scenes relevant, like the Christmas episode. That episode was referenced multiple times, and became the basis of Yuzu's actions later on in the show. However, that isn't enough to save Citrus from its story flaws.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in Citrus is something I'm not really used to, so it did come as a surprise. Characters just look more detailed, as more emphasis on what characters look like is needed for this show. This makes characters like Yuzu and Matsuri stand out, but some others are left in the dust, being applicable to Mei. She doesn't seem to change clothes themes, which makes her seem more forgetable when compared to her step-sister. Besides the characters, though, backgrounds were crucial for this show. Some were nicely detailed, but that didn't translate into some of the \"less important\" scenes. Most scenes were something that I could look at and see the detail, but there were some that didn't quite maintain the standard that this show had shown.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I felt that sound was mostly solid, although a few characters felt a bit off with voice acting. Music was ok as well, but unlike Slice of Life series that I'm used to like Oregairu, I don't really recall any of the background songs used in this show. However, I can say I grew fond of Azalea, the opening. Sound is overall good, but I did feel it could have improved.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well, this is where I have the most problems. Character was hit or miss in this show. Mei was done the way she should have, but I do feel that her cold exterior interfered with my watching experience. She made some scenes that should have been resolved in one episode drag on for more, but that's not the worst. The worst for me was that they had characters with potential that they just seemed to throw away to the side. I mean, Matsuri was a character that became a main component to dissolving whatever Mei and Yuzu had as a relationship, and they just set her aside to give Yuzu inspiration. She could have been used for more, much like Himeko. They both may be side characters, but they had a big impact on the two's relationship. With that said, what did Citrus do right? Well, they did a few things that I found to be good. Yuzu's struggles with understanding Mei and her actions went on long, but they were done correctly. Her overall development from this event helped her in the long run, although affecting Mei in a different way as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite my criticisms, Citrus was enjoyable for me. I don't know what it was, but even with its flaws, I still came back every week to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Citrus is not a perfect or the best showcase of what a yuri manga adaptation can be, not by any means. It has its flaws, but it also has some successes. Its writing can get weird at times, but it all ends up making sense and comes together later on in the series. If you're alright with yuri (why would you be on this if you weren't?), and you're alright with its story, give Citrus a go. However, if you're on the fence whether it be because of the story or yuri itself, I'd advise you to set this series aside.",

So I allowed myself to get excited, only to have my expectations drop lower and lower with every episode.\r\nStory & Characters:\r\nwarning:  If you're looking for a legit gay story, this isn't gonna cut it for you. Although the material is there, after all, Yuzu does struggle with her feelings and identity, that's all there is to it.\r\nThis is the typical pseudo-incest love story, which I have no issue with at all. The protagonist Yuzu islikeable, she's aloof and reckless and for once found myself enjoying this personality type especially when in stark-contrast to her step-sister Mei. Mei is the girl of a few words, the silent type. But there's a fine line between writing an observant, introspective character and a bland,robot that is devoid of feelings or reason. This is where Citrus starts to falter.\\n\\n\r\n  There's no communication between the characters, they are both supposed to understand each other's feelings via psychic abilities (which by the way, none of them have). Instead, we have a bunch of sexual harassment scenes which will might make the viewer uncomfortable or confused. In Citrus' defense that's how such a situation should feel, so it does that well. But it does it too much as an excuse for lack of conflict. \\n\r\nThe antagonists are both painfully annoying stereotypes, that for a lack of a better term, will make you want to claw your eyes off.  The conflict which these girls bring also revolve around sexual harassment or blackmail. Surprise (!)\\n\r\nFinally, however,  when it introduces an interesting point of conflict that differs from the distasteful tone of the story so far, it does it too late and we only have two episodes to explore this area which led to an extremely disappointing ending.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\n Key frames are nice, otherwise it's bland. Typical use of ugly ass CG for cars, buildings and npcs around the world.\\n\\n\r\nIt has some raunchy scenes, it's love between girls and it's (pseudo) incest. It had everything to be great, but alas, it's an average watch with many frustrating moments. The very end of the last episode did something which I want to applaud, which I will not go into detail to avoid spoilers, but it is explicit in the intention that our protagonists have towards each other. That is something that many girl's love series won't do. But what a shame that it took 12 episodes and 21 minutes to get to that point.",

I really wanted to like this show but I gave up after watching five episodes and here is why. This is not a story about love but sexual assault. Both girls either assault or are being assaulted by someone else (a teacher, a \"best friend\"). There isn't a single instance where any of the sex doesn't look like dub-con or flat-out rape (what Himeko does to Mei - that was rape. Mei didn't enjoy any ofit and was completely messed up after it). There is certainly no love anywhere. There is also no real story and not a single character that one can feel sympathetic for. Also, serious plot holes that make no sense. How the hell did the parents of those two girls end up married in the first place when Mei's father is constantly anywhere but in Japan? Did he advertise somewhere - \"need a mother for my teenage daughter, since I can't be arsed to take care of her myself\"? This anime reminded me of \"Kuzu no Honkai\" which I tried reading but gave up after being utterly disgusted by all the characters. Every single character is an egoist and not caring whether they hurt anyone else in the process of trying to find pleasure/fulfilment. How can you sympathize with anyone when everyone is an a**hole.  I watch anime for enjoyment and there was neither joy nor enjoyment while watching this turd.",

            "content": "This is the most pointless anime that has ever been created.  I was super excited to have a new yuri with pretty art, but this was terrible. What even was the point? All I want in the yuri world is something as beautiful and representative as Yuri on Ice. I don't think that will ever happen, the yuri creators are too obsessed with fetishizing. \r\n Wehh they aren't actually related its fine!! no. stop. The amount of time they just went back and forth was depressing. It didn't even start out well, since the creepy rapey incest began right away. \r\nThis would have beena better story if they got over themselves and learned how to be proper siblings. But you wouldn't get that creepy fetish thing that the writers were after. \\n\\n\r\nIt had every element of that forced yaoi trope, except a decent story line. Everything was creepy and forced, I don't even understand the ending? Even Junjou Romantica, with how forced and rapey that was, they had redemption. They had cute moments, they figured out their issues. But Citrus is all over the place. \\n\\n\r\nThey couldn't stick with one story line. Introduction of new key characters was awkward as hell. Surprise! Matsuri just *happens* to be at the same obscure arcade you are wow!! The whole Matsuri thing was just for a small \"life lesson\" at the end and to blackmail Mei? \\n\\n\r\nThen Sara and Nina just appeared *surprise* same day same time wow!!! and wow you guys get along great amazing. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMei actually seemed happy with Sara, but then they just had to force her and Yuzu together. I don't even believe that's what Mei wanted. She said she didn't want to lose Sara, so she did what Sara and her Nina asked. She only walked hand in hand with Yuzu because THEY wanted her to. It was reluctant. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were soulless. They creators did a terrible job at showing backstories, at forming emotional bonds for the watchers. Mei had 0 emotion, she showed a flicker here and there, with her daddy issues and when she was with Sara, but she was nothing. She might as well have been a mannequin. They didn't form character's emotions enough to make the watchers care. Yuzu, we had her internal monologue and chats with Harumi, she was probably the most developed character. But Mei is a main character and should have been fully developed. There was so much potential for them to develop character, but instead they just went down the rabbit hole of rapey. There could have been character development when Mei was being cold, and her and Yuzu weren't talking. What about Mei's internal monologue?? Even Himeko, who doesn't matter, was more  fleshed out than Mei. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI only finished this anime because I was expecting some massive character development, kept waiting for some heartbreaking revelations. But it never came and they just carried along their creepy, toxic ways. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI hate this anime with a burning passion. I wanted it to be good, I really wanted to like it. But I don't know how this flaming pile of garbage got produced.",

If Im honest I found myself getting a headache once nearing the end..\r\nStory- The story itself was rather straight forward and if Im honest annoying, It had alot of repetitive content assaulted love that always ended with the other not being interested, Roles reverse then ends the same way other girl not interested all of the sudden..Girls become close only to have a third wheel come along and try to ruin it..So repetitive and really just a headache to watch in one sitting.\r\nArt- The artwas fine sure it had some stupid scenery and the same backround girls doing the exact same thing throughout the anime, walking..But nothing bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound- I liked the music probably this animes strong suit the music added atmosphere to the whole anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- Now this is when it gets bad..One of the main girls  I could not stand she was annoying and just so confusion, I found myself sighing with each screentime she got..Considering she was one of the main girls it really wasn't good..Hard to enjoy an anime where a main character is just annoying and not fun to watch.. Not to mention the side characters where boring and a sore to watch also. The only character I liked was Yuzu who was pure until the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd say this is one of the better Yuri animes out there true it has alot of down points but for 12 episodes it did keep me hooked until the end, I wish I could of liked it more but yeah I cant see myself watching this again and if for some reason a season 2 does come out, I cant find myself watching it.",

I knew going into it exactly what this show was going to be: a sub-par lesbian romance show between two stepsisters, and when it didn't go that way, I was only left confused as to why they made those plot points. For the most part, the characters were pointless. Harumi doesn't change and by the end doesn't seem at all important to me, Matsuri prevents plot development and is in general an unlikable character, and so do Nina and Sara prevent plot. The latter two of thosewere the worst offenders to me, as they were introduced so late in the show that I did not understand why I was supposed to care about them.

            "content": "Spoilers below.\r\nYou have been warned.\r\nThere was many things about this series, that before it aired were hyped up so much, yet here we are at the end of it all with a terrible showing of a series. I am honestly disappointed in the series, which initially was looking to be fairly decent. I'll split this into segments to better explain why Citrus became such a disappointment for me.\r\nLet's start off with the story itself which I will rate a 1/10.\r\nSo this series started off with what appeared to be a well handled story and plot, but got derailed and crashed near the midway point ofthe series. From my initial take of the series' first 4 episodes it was on the right track. The introduction of Mei's father and suddenly disappearing after 1 episode was a little like \"What's the point?\" Also during this time and throughout the rest of the series Mei somehow transformed into cardboard, but I'll get to that later. When we were introduced to Matsuri, in my opinion is when the series started getting terrible. Appeared to be just a forced character to fuel more Yuri bait and get some feathers ruffled. Her inclusion in the series honestly was not needed, it felt out of place and down right intrusive. I'll get into details with this character later though. As we continued on to the final episodes even more forced characters just appeared out of the wood work. The \"twins\" (Character designers this is not how twins are...) made the last 3 episodes of Citrus so bad. The lines they delivered really got under my skin. It's as if we were expected to believe that people dating for 1 night can suddenly know everything about them! Right. Well the twins didn't help much in story advancement to begin with and never really helped during the time they were on screen. The last half of episode 12 should have been tacked onto episode 4 and delete the rest, there half way decent story. \\n\\n\r\nI also want to talk about the down right disgusting ecchi aspect of this series. Honestly the ecchi appeared to become the main aspect of the series around episode 4. It's as if at a meeting \"How often can we make these girls make out? And get into lewd situations and positions with each!\" As a guy I can say I enjoy ecchi, as long as it's not becoming the sole reason for being used in the series. Citrus cannot say that. Most of this series suddenly seemed like ecchi was used to move the story along. Sorry I am not here to watch a Hentai. Thanks.\\n\\n\r\nLet's get onto the Characters of this series. I gave this a 2/10.\\n\r\nI'll start with the good and decent characters (with a fair amount of screen time sorry mama and papa Aihara.)  So Yuzu and Harumi are in my eyes one of the small few things of the series that actually aren't piss poor bad. Both girls at least had a design that didn't appear to be a copy paste from a learn to draw book. Plus they had personality, beyond that of just your normal Mary Sue. Now in spite of still being half decent they have flaws too. Sadly for Harumi her flaw was the lack of screen time, not your fault girl, what ya going to do. Yuzu to me seemed to be on a string and just pulled along from one event to the other, she didn't have an initiative to do anything on her own, someone always had to push her or pull her towards the next event. All of the flaws aside, Yuzu and Harumi at least had a bit of brightness. \\n\\n\r\nNow terrible characters, there is always one... Too bad we have multiples. I'll start with Cardboard Lady. Cough. Mei. Her character design is simple, which is not bad. That sadly is her best quality. Her personality is as bad as wet cardboard. Much as Yuzu seemed to be dragged by a string from event to event, Mei was very much the same. But too bad for Mei is she had nothing else going for her in terms of character development. Her emotions and actions only seemed to mirror the other characters she was on screen with. She wasn't her own character, she was everyone else's side kick. Another character I'll talk about that shared the same, only her design was good, would be Matsuri. Her character design was unique and actually stood out. Sadly her personality was more than just annoying, it was brain shattering annoying. She's the screaming 8 year old that couldn't get his toy at the mall. Her character was forgetful, I had to look up her name to remember it when writing this. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's get to the last 2 characters I will talk about. The wonder twins. How in the world are identical twins so different in height? Like a few cm(inches) I'd be okay to turn a blind eye. But we're talking almost 2 feet. What? The inclusion of these girls just seemed so forced and out of place. Like really, the last 3 episodes. Really? And to mention they are supposed to play such a large role in the plot. But having 3 days in the series, and 3 or 4(I forgot) episodes, you just can't expect me to buy that. These twins wouldn't have been so bad if they were designed more similar in size and actually had more time to be characters in the series. Not just tossed in at the end as fan service. \\n\\n\r\nBut here we arrive to the Sound and Art department. Hurray we are almost done. I gave both the sounds and animation a 6.\\n\r\nAt times the series seemed to be lazy in both animation and sounds delivered to the viewers. But other times they were appealing. The opening theme was nice at least.\\n\\n\r\nLastly my enjoyment and closing thoughts. \\n\r\nSo I overall gave this series a 2. The flaws were just to drastic to even consider this anything better than dreadful. The phrase \"sex sells\" applies to this series so well. The ecchi scenes just seemed to take on more of an important roll than the actual story line did. Such a hyped series leading up to it's release only to disappoint so bad.",

            "content": "Ok. Phew. Done. *exhale*. Made it. This show is what I would call garbage disguised as diamonds. (Just made that up). Like it tries it's damnedest to be a genuine lesbian relationship series. But fails all the same. \r\nThe way it starts is repulsive and I don't blame anyone for not watching it for that reason. It's ridiculously stupid in its writing at those points. In fact, it's writing overall is pretty bad. Excluding the Mitsuri Arc (which I actually really liked cause I'm more so drawn to a good villain than a good hero), the writing is abysmal. Just bad. So herky jerky andway too reactionary. Going all the lines of \"ok, what's the most dramatic thing that can happen right now\" and then doing it. It's \"drama\" is so forced and fabricated. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are plain dumb and make stupid decisions. Yuzu going back and forth so much causes major whiplash and makes next to no sense. Especially the last arc, the School Trip Arc, like ouch. Hit a dud with that one, and after such a good climb with Mitsuri. Smh. Mei is one of the most heartless characters I think I've ever seen. Her in beginning episodes is just plain evil. Sexually assaults Yuzu more than a few times. \\n\\n\r\nBut of course, Yuzu comes crawling back. (Back to the bad writing). The supporting cast is not too bad actually. Harumin is a sweetheart and a shining beacon of hope in the pile of crap. As I said, I actually liked Mitsuri, probably my favorite character cause she's such an evil bitch witch, and so hammy with it that I just have the biggest evil grim on my face when she's chewing scenes. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, speaking from a technical side of things. It's actually pretty solid over there. Like the newer studio Passione really nailed the animation and music. It's really well done. The opening and ending songs are really good, and the way the violin music is incorporated is flawless and definitely amplifies things when the soundtrack is in full swing.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, this is now the example for me of \"style over substance\". It fits that mold so well it's crazy. Bad writing and dumb characters. But some amazing music and good opening and ending songs. So I'll give it a 6/10.",

Despite him being the main character, he's (surprisingly) not featured in everyepisode (although I could swear he was really pushing the director to let him be) and in fact gets tossed to the side in most cases in favor of Yuzu who seems to want so much Yuri action and then loves to just reject it in favor of a \"healthy\" relationship between kin. Mei is equally idiotic for the same reasons. Sexual advances are made, rejected, made again, accepted but then immediately declined, assaulted and accepted(?). The whole show really just makes you think \"Wait... why the fuck are you doing this now, I thought you were okay with this?\"\\n\\n\r\nStory: It's alright, it's a Yuri drama... Not sure what you're expecting here.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Lookin' good. A guy on reddit liked to show side-by-side comparisons between the manga and the show and I was surprised how great everything was!\\n\\n\r\nSound: You can really hear the sexual assault as it happens in real-time. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Could be better. You could boil most of the characters down to tropes \"Childhood Friend\", \"Childhood Friend who thinks she's your little sister\", etc\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I mean, ignoring the sexual assault, who wouldn't enjoy some yuri?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's a pretty solid 7. It's not amazing, it's not terrible. It's just... good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR- Alright show, Sexual Assault is the main character of the show but don't let that get you down, the Yuri in this show makes up for any kind of ill-feelings you may get.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire time I was watching this show I couldn't help but think \"Wouldn't it be great if there was a show like Citrus with all the Yuri in the world... but on ice?

            "content": "Why is this random shoujo ai (I use that genre loosely) show called \u201cCitrus?\u201d Because the main character\u2019s name is Yuzu, a fruit. Mystery solved! Moving on...\r\nThis show is absolutely gorgeous in a niche way. It celebrates Gyaru and high fashion. Everything has an over the top, warm sheen to it. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. Think Roppongi or Otemachi. It\u2019s not even Harajuku, it\u2019s classier than that. The art work reminds me of Peach Girl in that the characters all have style and everything is detailed in a way that must have been expensive to produce because there isn\u2019t a \u201cset\u201dway for characters to look; they\u2019re different every episode. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not impressed with the storyline. From time to time you get a reason to keep watching. I was about to give up by the episode in which Yuzu invites Mei to visit her father, but it was such a great outcome. Which Yuzu predictably ruins by turning it into an excuse to go on a date with Mei. She is obsessed with Mei to the point that there is no other character development for her. She talks about how much she loves Mei, and everyone around her makes comments about the kind of person she is (caring/loving/selfless/great sister, etc.). It\u2019s a cheap way to get out of actual character development. \u201cIf I tell you the character is like this, then we don\u2019t actually have to do the thing.\u201d It almost reminds me of the travesty that is Amnesia, where minor characters point something out that the viewers are never really exposed to. Most conversations in this anime involve Yuzu blushing hysterically, gushing about her feelings (or not feelings) for Mei, then Mei glaring/staring blankly/crying. Then the two trade very short lived ecchi moments before moving on to hurt each other again. It\u2019s a headache. \\n\\n\r\nNothing special about the sound. Yuzu sounds annoyed and frustrated every time she opens her mouth. I think the show could have been drastically improved by edgy, cool music in the same tone as the art. But it wasn\u2019t. \\n\\n\r\nNothing special here at all, unfortunately. If you want a good shoujo ai about star crossed high school girls, try Strawberry Panic.",

It has the same appeal as any trashy romance, the story is by every definition of the word bonkers, just when you think it can't get any more stupidly convoluted and needlessly force love dodecahedrons, this show finds a way to surpass that and play it completely serious. That's the \"genius\" of this show, and why it's so enjoyable to me. I have been left many times saying \"what the hell is going on\" and \"why did you jump to sex strait away\" or \" that makes no sense\". That'sthe main draw of this show at least to me. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is trashy, obscene, and borderline illegal, with characters that are there for no other reason but to get in the way of the two leads romance. Art that is serviceable at best but stays pretty consistent throughout the series, but does its job well. The music is forgettable and just kinda there not really adding to a scene or atmosphere at all, it could be stock music that the director downloaded off the internet for all I know.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are the reason to watch this show. they are set up pretty decently and when they are first introduced they seem fine. for the most part they seem pretty relatable and people that you would see in your average high school in america. this is then juxtaposed by their insatiable appetite to in some way immediately start sleeping with one of the two main characters. again that's kinda the \"genius\" of this show it plays the absurd and in no way would happen in real life situations and plays it completely strait. making for an entertaining romp that if you're in the right mindset (especially if your inebreated) and mood you will have a blast watching.\\n\\n\r\nlong story short watch this show, the only regret you will have is one day possibly having to admit you watched a show about two step-sisters falling way to much in love with each other, and enjoyed it way more than you should have. which I guess I just did.",

First, I'll say that the show looks nice in my opinion at the very least but if you want to watch a good looking show, just go watch Violet Evergarden. I haven't personally watched it but at the very least I can guarantee that it would be a much better experience than what you would get here.\r\n On the other hand if you are like me and was mainly here for the yuri, I will say that this show is not worth it at all and there are far better yuri shows outthere like Sakura Trick which is basically a high-school yuri romance like this show but without all of the things that makes this show shit.\\n\\n\r\nAs for everything else, this show is very uncomfortable to watch because it basically goes by the logic of \"It's not rape if they're both girls\". Even if you can get pass that what lies ahead is nothing but generic characters and the same boring ass romance plot that we have seen ten million times but the only difference is that they are girls.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show has many bad qualities that I likely haven't even covered and any good qualities that this show has are done much better in another show. I think I am being extremely generous to give this a 4/10. This has been my first review so I'm sorry if this was unhelpful but I probably need to watch more shows to get a better understanding of how to do reviews.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate: Lowered the score to a 3/10 since it better describes how I feel about this show.",

However, I'm not the type that assumes an anime, or any form of media, has to be of excellent calibre to be entertaining. People who are fans of slice of life, high school romance and light-hearted comedy will find a lot to enjoy in Citrus, just as I did.\r\nMany people will argue that Citrus is \"derivative\" and \"predictable\" in terms of its plotting and general progression as a series, which I suppose isn't necessarily an unfounded criticism to make. You'll find virtually every trope of thisparticular genre present in Citrus, but that doesn't mean these cliches aren't delivered convincingly. Cliches become cliches for a reason, of course: because they work, and HAVE worked for many years. The art is also fine- actually, it's borderline impressive, with some lovely backdrops of sunsets and moonlit cityscapes.\\n\\n\r\nOne aspect I was split on personally was the characters. The lead protagonist is fun, likeable and enjoyable to spend time with (though she seems to spend an awful lot of screen-time crying over not very much), but unfortunately the main love interest, Mei-Mei, hits a flat note. She's neither funny nor interesting, and instead her cold and aloof attitude made her rather irritating at times (at least in my eyes). I spent the majority of the first four Eps wondering why everybody seemed so absorbed by a character so abrasive. There's also some questionable romantic scenes that come close to being uncomfortable. Apparently, in the world of Citrus, it's perfectly acceptable to invade someone's personal space and effectively bypass the whole notion of \"consent\".\\n\\n\r\nYet despite all its faults, I found myself quite enjoying Citrus. Again, anyone not interested in slice of life will find absolutely nothing to admire, but those who do will have a lot of fun. It's a question of genre, not quality.\\n",

The main character is basically just a thirsty high school anime girl that wants in her new stepsister's pantsu entirely because she stole her first kiss. Now i'm all for ideas revolving around the fluid nature of human sexuality, but that sounds like a bit of a stretch. Especailly in almost every scene before the kiss, she's stupid boy crazy. Almost always complaining or asking about the lack of guys at her new all-girls school. Which would be fine, if yuzu was seen spending  more time mulling over her sexuality than\"I kissed a girl and I liked it\" so i'm gay now. It just feels unrealistic to be honest. Though given that same token im a cis-het man so id say its more than fair that my opinions on that are less than adequately informed. \\n\\n\r\nHowever! Where this show truly fails is the aftermath of the kiss. Where the stepsister, consequently the actual most intruiging character in the show, is made to put up with typical harem trope bullshit from her sister and childhood best friend, (Up to and including attempted sexual assault by episode 5) that I really feel she should be the only character in this show. If this show followed a loner high school president with MASSIVE and I mean MASSIVE daddy issues who basically is forced to move from home to home throughout childhood due her papa-san's delinquency from responsibilities. Well, that would certainly be a show I'd be down for.\\n\\n\r\nThat all being said, if you just came to see two beautifully animated girls make out then you've come ot the right place. Lets all have a party when we get thrown in prison together, okay? I'll bring the streamers made out of unused toilet paper. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Anime is trash and so am I :5/10",

However, I've become disappointed in this anime, holding high expectations because of the manga which may admittedly may be my fault. In any case that's how the cookie crumbles.\r\nAlone, Citrus is a pretty average anime with only one thing holding my interest, the fact that it is a yuri anime. Expressions are a lot more lax than parts of the manga, with parts of dialogue taken out or adjusted to fit the scenes. While normally this isn't a problem as sometimes things have to be changed, some of the alteredlines give a wholly different feel to the scene. Going from suspicion to enthusiasm or from indignation to determination these changes significantly affect the apparent emotions of characters However as this is a review about the anime itself I won't be getting into that. \\n\\n\r\nOn the whole the art is above average with some subpar scenes but many more outstanding ones to balance it out. The story is realistic without any major absurdities and the characters aren't flat but seem to have no life outside of the ones around the main characters which to me is a huge detriment. The sounds are average but the ED is in my opinion great. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Citrus is an average anime in general but is a huge addition to the yuri genre. If, however, you are looking for an anime adaption true to the Citrus manga then I'm sorry to tell you but you will be sorely disappointed.",

But it's pleasant to the eyes and entertaining.\r\nI've never seen an anime go from one scene to another this quickly. It seems the whole purpose of each passing scene is to just get to the next sexual scene as quickly as possible, while still maintaining a semblance of story telling. Mei is an extremely annoying character who's 100% unlikable. Yuzu is dumb as it gets. Most characters really are pathetic. One exception is Matsuri, unfortunately she's quickly set aside infavor of two sisters who don't bring anything to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are at times great, but devolve into an inconsistent pile of crap as the anime advances. The animation and camera spans in ep 12 are hideous, but they make the episode very funny to watch. Music is good I suppose, I didn't care much for it.\\n\\n\r\nOf all the ways Citrus could have been good, the way in which it was produced is far from it. It's a deception, a shame, and it should serve as a good example of what NOT to do. People should openly shame Citrus as degeneracy that shall not be encouraged. Melodramatic stories are engaging and addictive, sure, but an anime of such low objective quality shouldn't exist.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I've enjoyed it. I laughed my ass off at how crappy and inconsistent everything was. The Yuri scenes were good, if not cringy. Matsuri was a real breath of dramatic fresh air, as she had me hope that things would take a tragic twist.\\n\\n\r\nCitrus is a lot more bad than good, but one can't dispute it does have some twisted qualities.
