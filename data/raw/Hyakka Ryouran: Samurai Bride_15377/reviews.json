            "content": "A promising beginning led to an expected outcome. This is how I would summarize the second season in one sentence, and that is because of the same characters some of us love and watch dearly find themselves faced with another threat undergoing all sorts of labors in order to emerge victorious.\r\nEvery action we take has consequences and you can see that in this series very well because of the famous samurai in japan's history like Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojir\u014d that were revived because of some spirits that hateful of the course the history had taken and decided to change it themselves.\r\nThe end is prettymuch the same as the first season with the two main protagonists on their way to save the day and restore the peace to \"Great Japan\" as  Tokugawa Yoshihiko refers to the country. The expected outcome is what lowers my score for this series because it's not very entertaining to know the results before you even finish watching it.\\n\r\nArtwork is virtually the same because this season focused more on fan service rather than improving the storyline but maybe I'm expecting too much from a series that as ecchi and comedy.\\n\r\nSo if you enjoy comedy/ecchi anime that have a drop of drama then the Hyakka Ryouran series is waiting for you.

            "content": "I, like most of the other viewers of samurai bride was brought back by the boobs and swords; not story, not any deep sense of enjoyment, simply the boobs and swords just because those two things are a great combination. In fact, I think that's gonna be my two word summary of Samurai Girls/Samurai Bride, the problem? theres not as many boobs in this!(plenty of swords yeah) but wheres my boobs!?\r\nNow down to business.\r\nStory: ...Pfff, story!? This is a harem fanservice and that means that so long as the animators/producers/all the other guys do their jobs right, the story writers wont have to worry aboutwhat they're doing because all us guys(and the few female viewers) will be ogling at the boobs and panty-shots and somehow that will keep us occupied for the entire 12 episode stretch of the series, hell it worked once before so why not this time? Granted there are some out there who wont be so easily occupied and might get bored about halfway through, but don't worry folks, that's about the time when the story shows up. Its nothing too original, its about the same deal as the last time: evil force, destroy japan, boobs, and the chicks with the swords(but more importantly boobs) have to come and save the day. Beyond that I wont say but that's the basic outline.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is great, im actually being serious right now. The art is just very different from other animes and its this uniqueness that caught my attention in the first season. I can really only describe it as being simpler, but at the same time there is a lot of detail and how they do this is just incredible to me. Now I have to bring up the other big part of the art section... the boobs, because boobs are art, but the art is not always of boobs, but when it is, it just makes it sooo much better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Well we have the triumphant return of: the extremely childish but equally well-endowed juubei, the semi-arrogant princess sen, her loyal servant hanzo, the girl who the nude images of could be considered illegal yukimura, her servant matabe who seems to think that a loincloth is proper lower-body wear, and the chick with the hammer who gets knocked out more than an armless boxer, and finally that badass pirate girl with the eye patch gissen. As for new arrivals we have four evil resurrected samurai chicks, some great ki master, and a monkey... yeah you read that right, a monkey is now a main character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: Like ive said, the animation style gets serious points in my book, but not much else. The story is a lot of recycled stuff from the first season and I see very little new stuff being brought to the table this time around. Tragically there didn't seem to be as many boob shots in this, last time around it seemed as if they went out of their way to put tits on screen, but not this time, so all you horny guys out there are gonna have to go buy a playboy or something. I was slightly annoyed by the fact that the show made no progress until the final five or six episodes but I guess it cant really be helped.\\n\r\nI might have sounded like I was being down on samurai bride, but I want to take this time to say that I did enjoy watching it, and I would watch it again, I was simply disappointed because I had built it up in my head prior to its release. It was fun, if you liked samurai girls you should already be watching this and I think that's all ive got for you today, enjoy!\\n",

I called it garbage and cussed out the National Rifle Association while I was at it. Now, NRA's situation had gotten worse.\r\nMy opinion hasn't changed with Samurai Girls, meanwhile. The real and long-departed Yagyuu Jyubei Mitsuyoshi must be rolling in his grave... But atleast the plot stayed in focus and gave the returning characters 4 rivals, the \"Dark Samurai,\" to keep them on their toes.\r\nThe in-fighting in the \"evil (but not too evil)\" faction and the effort for self-improvement and chi-building in Jyubei's faction werea bit entertaining. But a monkey who, when kissed by Muneakira, transforms into a girl with \"Master Samurai\" powers? With incest, mileage may vary. But bestiality?\\n\\n\r\nWell atleast Muneakira turned everyone into Master Samurai. (ABOUT TIME!!) And Kanetsugu spent some time showing some sense of integrity instead of just being some \"nice butt of the jokes.\"",

With that being said the story is very generic and may come off cheesy at times and with only 12 episodes there wasn't much for character development. Some of the characters bonds even seemed forced throughout but where the story lacks the art style shines. Each character is drawn to match their different personalities which is nice to see in an ecchi anime. As for the sound some over used dramatic effects may become annoying and also again a bitcheesy. All in all its an ok watch if you seen he first although its not necessarily needed to immerse yourself deeper in the story. Watch it for the sake of half naked fighting females. lol",

            "content": "A promising beginning led to an expected outcome. This is how I would summarize the second season in one sentence, and that is because of the same characters some of us love and watch dearly find themselves faced with another threat undergoing all sorts of labors in order to emerge victorious.\r\nEvery action we take has consequences and you can see that in this series very well because of the famous samurai in japan's history like Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojir\u014d that were revived because of some spirits that hateful of the course the history had taken and decided to change it themselves.\r\nThe end is prettymuch the same as the first season with the two main protagonists on their way to save the day and restore the peace to \"Great Japan\" as  Tokugawa Yoshihiko refers to the country. The expected outcome is what lowers my score for this series because it's not very entertaining to know the results before you even finish watching it.\\n\r\nArtwork is virtually the same because this season focused more on fan service rather than improving the storyline but maybe I'm expecting too much from a series that as ecchi and comedy.\\n\r\nSo if you enjoy comedy/ecchi anime that have a drop of drama then the Hyakka Ryouran series is waiting for you. Thanks for granting me some time for reading this review... I hope it is helpful",

            "content": "I, like most of the other viewers of samurai bride was brought back by the boobs and swords; not story, not any deep sense of enjoyment, simply the boobs and swords just because those two things are a great combination. In fact, I think that's gonna be my two word summary of Samurai Girls/Samurai Bride, the problem? theres not as many boobs in this!(plenty of swords yeah) but wheres my boobs!?\r\nNow down to business.\r\nStory: ...Pfff, story!? This is a harem fanservice and that means that so long as the animators/producers/all the other guys do their jobs right, the story writers wont have to worry aboutwhat they're doing because all us guys(and the few female viewers) will be ogling at the boobs and panty-shots and somehow that will keep us occupied for the entire 12 episode stretch of the series, hell it worked once before so why not this time? Granted there are some out there who wont be so easily occupied and might get bored about halfway through, but don't worry folks, that's about the time when the story shows up. Its nothing too original, its about the same deal as the last time: evil force, destroy japan, boobs, and the chicks with the swords(but more importantly boobs) have to come and save the day. Beyond that I wont say but that's the basic outline.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is great, im actually being serious right now. The art is just very different from other animes and its this uniqueness that caught my attention in the first season. I can really only describe it as being simpler, but at the same time there is a lot of detail and how they do this is just incredible to me. Now I have to bring up the other big part of the art section... the boobs, because boobs are art, but the art is not always of boobs, but when it is, it just makes it sooo much better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Well we have the triumphant return of: the extremely childish but equally well-endowed juubei, the semi-arrogant princess sen, her loyal servant hanzo, the girl who the nude images of could be considered illegal yukimura, her servant matabe who seems to think that a loincloth is proper lower-body wear, and the chick with the hammer who gets knocked out more than an armless boxer, and finally that badass pirate girl with the eye patch gissen. As for new arrivals we have four evil resurrected samurai chicks, some great ki master, and a monkey... yeah you read that right, a monkey is now a main character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: Like ive said, the animation style gets serious points in my book, but not much else. The story is a lot of recycled stuff from the first season and I see very little new stuff being brought to the table this time around. Tragically there didn't seem to be as many boob shots in this, last time around it seemed as if they went out of their way to put tits on screen, but not this time, so all you horny guys out there are gonna have to go buy a playboy or something. I was slightly annoyed by the fact that the show made no progress until the final five or six episodes but I guess it cant really be helped.\\n\r\nI might have sounded like I was being down on samurai bride, but I want to take this time to say that I did enjoy watching it, and I would watch it again, I was simply disappointed because I had built it up in my head prior to its release. It was fun, if you liked samurai girls you should already be watching this and I think that's all ive got for you today, enjoy!\\n",

            "content": "With Samurai Girls, I called it yet another fanservicy, anti-shounen, \"cute girls do cute things\" outing utilizing Japan's samurai era. I called it garbage and cussed out the National Rifle Association while I was at it. Now, NRA's situation had gotten worse.\r\nMy opinion hasn't changed with Samurai Girls, meanwhile. The real and long-departed Yagyuu Jyubei Mitsuyoshi must be rolling in his grave... But atleast the plot stayed in focus and gave the returning characters 4 rivals, the \"Dark Samurai,\" to keep them on their toes.\r\nThe in-fighting in the \"evil (but not too evil)\" faction and the effort for self-improvement and chi-building in Jyubei's faction werea bit entertaining. But a monkey who, when kissed by Muneakira, transforms into a girl with \"Master Samurai\" powers? With incest, mileage may vary. But bestiality?\\n\\n\r\nWell atleast Muneakira turned everyone into Master Samurai. (ABOUT TIME!!) And Kanetsugu spent some time showing some sense of integrity instead of just being some \"nice butt of the jokes.\"",

            "content": "First off, if your a fan of the previous season it should come by no surprise this anime is not to be taken too seriously. With that being said the story is very generic and may come off cheesy at times and with only 12 episodes there wasn't much for character development. Some of the characters bonds even seemed forced throughout but where the story lacks the art style shines. Each character is drawn to match their different personalities which is nice to see in an ecchi anime. As for the sound some over used dramatic effects may become annoying and also again a bitcheesy. All in all its an ok watch if you seen he first although its not necessarily needed to immerse yourself deeper in the story. Watch it for the sake of half naked fighting females. lol",
