            "content": "Devil May Cry is a very strange anime. It does its thing nicely for a bit but then goes and ruins it with some silly nonsense. I have no idea why or how that happened. I mean, the games are pretty consistently decent, so why isn't this show the same?\r\nLet's start with that totally unnecessary thing called story. Honestly, you might as well forget about it, as you won't be getting any for about 9 episodes in a row. No joke\u2014this is essentially a slice-of-life series about Dante being cool. And before you ask the obvious question\u2014yes, it has less of a story than theseries of action games the setting is based on. Furthermore, at several points you get an impression that some general plot is about to emerge (it eventually does, but already after you lose all hope for it), but the very next moment you have your expectations shattered without any back thought. You could probably even watch episodes 2\u20139 out of order without noticing any substantial difference. For that exact reason, you shouldn't worry about spoilers when discussing this anime, since it's impossible to spoil something that is either immediately obvious or completely non-existing. \"4\" is a generous mark here, owing mostly to the universe created by DMC game series.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, Dante. As I mentioned earlier, everything in this series is about showing Dante in the process of being cool. He's so cool he transcends the meaning of the word \"cool\", like the living embodiment of coolness never seen since the cool came to cool town. He always has that swag going, and his sense of fashion oozes style. Obviously, he only eats the coolest food in existence: pizza, strawberry sundae, beer\u2014nothing else. He has megacool overpowered weapons\u2014because dramatic stakes are for pussies. And even his name is cool. Unsurprisingly, every time he's up for a job, he always does it single-handedly\u2014be it a bike race, gambling, or slaughtering a several-stories-tall demon in seconds\u2014with that detached facial expression that drives home the point of his towering superiority. Yet he always fails to complete his primary objective because he's too damn righteous. How impossibly cool! And even during that, he appears to be utterly bored by stuff happening around him. One Punch Man too popular for you? Take a look at this gem then: DMC did the \"overpowered MC is bored by flaccid antagonists\" shtick 8 years before the bald guy. Hellsing Ultimate has too much of that annoying character development? DMC should be right up your boat\u2014it doesn't have any.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of characters, the entire cast is mainly there to support Dante by... looking deliberately uncool in comparison. First, we have Morrison, who is old-fashioned, intelligent, and an exemplary gentleman, almost a polar opposite of Dante. Then there's Patty, the token loli moeblob comic relief character whose significance is never shown despite screenwiter's best efforts (which fail spectacularly, I must add). A notable character is Lady, who is almost as cool as Dante, but still not quite up to his level; this, however, doesn't prevent her from being more successful at her job. But hey, if Dante doesn't do it, it must not be very cool, right? Also, there is Trish, who is between Lady and Dante on the scale on coolness and never gets any screen time. Lastly, there is that typical small fry antagonist who behaves like a character significant for the plot, although you wouldn't ever want him to be. The plot twist is that he actually is. You have to be a man and brace yourself. Or, if you're a woman, become a man and then brace yourself.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say much about sound and visuals. Both seem to be quite fitting and high quality in general, but as for animation, some scenes could have definitely be animated better (as in, actually animated\u2014you'll get it when you see it), and music lacks variety somewhat\u2014almost all of it is mere variations on the three dominant themes.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, DMC is the kind of show you'd want for some simple braindead entertainment when you've run out of more entertaining stuff. Don't expect anything beyond that, as otherwise you'll be disappointed in no time. Just get your beverage of choice, a pack of suitable snacks, and press play. Alternatively, go play Quake 3 deathmatch\u2014it has just about the same amount of plot with ten times the action and thrill.",

            "content": "If you\u2019ve never heard of Devil May Cry before and are looking for a good action anime, this is not it. If you\u2019re a fan of the video games and want to see more stylish ass-kickery, prepare to be disappointed. \r\nStory: Dante is running his business, performing mundane tasks for clients like demon-slaying, saving the world, the usual. Almost every episode starts and concludes one of Dante\u2019s assigned cases, involving nasty monsters that inevitably end up dead. There is some cheap drama that focuses on a young girl whom Dante saved and a loser demon who wants to become a god, but you\u2019re not seriouslyhere for the plot are you?\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style is able to create a dark, gothic atmosphere where Dante spills plenty of demon blood. However, it is not enough to keep you tense at all since fight scenes are way too short. Battles involve more talking than fighting and tend to be settled with one stroke (by guess who). There is a significant lack of spectacularly choreographed fight sequences as seen in the games, which will no doubt be a major letdown. Animation quality is only mediocre for when there is actually action. If you're hoping Dante will pull devil trigger, unleash some insane combos, or wield his other devil arms, guess what? He won't!\\n\r\nOh and yes, Trish and Lady are in this, but they\u2019re drawn rather unattractively. No eye candy here. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Some heavy rock, some gothic choir tracks, all very forgettable. Seems even the lowliest of demons can speak Japanese. Voice acting and sound effects are acceptable, but nothing noteworthy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Here it is, the reason you may be considering this anime: to see Dante kick plenty of ass. And here is also the show\u2019s main failure: Dante is simply overpowered. Yes we know he\u2019s super cool and skilled, but he faces absolutely no challenging adversaries at all. This entire anime is a series of totally one sided fights like I've never seen. Dante spends some time cracking jokes, his opponent says something stupid like \u201cI stand a chance!\u201d, and then Dante proceeds with delivering the pain. Except not in a spectacular, SSSmoking SSSick fashion. More like finishing it with one bullet from Ebony/Ivory or a couple swings of Rebellion. For fans of the games, this is a major kick to the balls and won\u2019t leave you satisfied at all.\\n\r\nOh, and apparently Dante loves eating strawberry sundaes on sunny afternoons, while getting bossed around by a precocious little girl. Who would've thought.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved the video games for their dramatic fight sequences, challenging bosses, cheesy humor and impossible physics. What the anime tries to duplicate, it does so without success. Dante is not so much kicking ass in this show as he is absentmindedly swatting flies. Your time would be better spent trying/ replaying the DMC video games. Except DMC2, let\u2019s just forget that ever existed.\\n\\n\r\n5/10  \\n",

            "content": "Can you name a single video game that was turned into a movie that wasn't an extremely terrible film that failed in all regards?  Now can you name a good videogame that was turned into an anime that wasn't terrible?  Alright...you can probably name a whole bunch, alot from the choose-your-own-adventure genres.  However Devil May Cry is more like a terrible video game movie.  If you've ever played, or seen someone play, Devil May Cry then you know the style of the game quite well.  The quality and feel of the anime is nothing like that of the original videogame.\r\nStory:Lame.  That single, bland word perfectly describes the storyline of this anime.  I wonder sometimes what the storywriters were thinking when they sat down to write this anime.  They clearly didn't put any heart or soul into this, and I hope that they had other projects that they deemed more important than this.  The real storyline begins in about episode 4-5.  When you have 12 episodes to tell a story in, and you spend the first third of the anime doing self contained episodes you know that you're off to a terrible start.  Even the story that they decide to throw in is terrible and quickly forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Some people praise the art, I however find it terrible to anything it tries to do.  The art is very clunky, the people seem to be squares and triangles and circles thrown together, the fluidity of the people is nonexistant.  Anyone who's seen the game knows what Dante looks like, and in the anime version he loses everything that makes him so cool in the game.  I got a very generic feeling from the art, it didn't seem that they were taking any risks, they were just doing the same old things over and over and the art seemed really stale.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is good, the effects are good, the music is good.  I believe with almost absolute certainty that they took a lot of the music from the game itself and I found it was the single thing that I was connecting with as I watched with.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: On the outside Dante is a badass. A pizza-eating, Strawberry Sundae drinking badass.  And on the inside?  Well...he's a badass.  And he's lazy.  He will beat up anyone, especially demons, because they piss him off.  And while he's exorcising the demons and doing whatever it is he does he doesn't seem to care at all.  Cause nothing is more badass than killing bad guys while not seeming to care about it at all.  Now....as the writers sat down they must have thought &quot;hmm...how exactly do we make a better anime when the main character is a rude, pizza-eating badass?&quot; and some guy went &quot;OH! MY! GOD! We add....a CUTE LITTLE GIRL! Who talks a lot and is a central part of the storyline so basically Dante is forced to stick beside her...people will LOVE IT!&quot; However...it doesn't work because it's been done a thousand times before, and it was original 10 years ago....and it was fresh then too.  But now it's not.  They also throw in characters from the games, but it feels forced and is quite annoying for anyone who's played the games.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Honestly, after episode 4 I stopped paying attention at all.  I really, really didn't care after episode 6. After episode 8 I could barely sit through each episode.  So I can honestly say that I didn't enjoy this anime at all.  At all.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't really recommend this to anyone who enjoys the game series.  It's such a huge disappointment if you're expecting it to be the game. However some people might really enjoy this anime, however I've never met anyone who enjoyed it.  The only good point is that it's only 12 episodes, so even if you hate it it's only 4 hours of your life....that you'll never get back.",

            "content": "Devil May Cry: The Animated Series: Is it Worth It or Worst?\r\nA Devil May Cry Game into an Anime? Really? H-How? H-How did you make this game into an anime. I-I-- (sigh)... Alright... Just, let me review this anime...\r\nDevil May Cry: The Animated Series... Is by far, THE WORST ANIME THAT I'VE WATCHED IN MY LIFE... FROM MADHOUSE ENTERTAINMENT?! REALLY? THE ONE WHO GAVES US DEATH NOTE, AND KISEIJUU COMES WITH THIS HORRIFYING PIECE OF S... Ahh... Fuu-- (sigh) okay... Okay... Settle down, Vaas... Just... Let me... Just me relax and focus on my review... Okay (Inhaling) (Exhaling)...\r\nAlright, let me review this, I was soshocked when my beloved video game franchise, Devil May Cry, became an anime. And, the most shockingly thing that I've been seen when I watch this English dub is that, it was came from MadHouse Entertainment! I mean, come on... At first I was like, \"Hmm... MadHouse? What more could I ask for? It was like, the best anime corporations out there, there's nothing hideous when I watch this anime, right? Devil May Cry: The Animated Series is going to be a BLAST.\" And then, when I watch it from first to the last, I-- I don't know... I don't freaking know what am I going to say to both CAPCOM (the gaming developers of Devil May Cry) and MadHouse about this... this... SELLOUT ANIME BASED FROM THE VIDEO GAME CRAP...\\n\\n\r\nI hate this adaptations, and this is main example why the adaptation is so cruel, is so vile and worst.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nOkay, let's start with the Storyline shall we? (SPOILER ALERT) So it goes like this, there was man named Dante and a girl named Patty who stays in the Devil May Cry shop to search for her missing mother. Then, it also explains how Lady and Trish met (and that's why Trish and Lady became friends in the game; Devil May Cry 4), and wanted to kill all those who were in Dante's way, especially Sid, the main antagonist of the story who looks like a beggar at first but now he's a demon jackass. Oh, and by the way, this anime is CANON, meaning this anime is also set on the same universe on the game itself. So... As I checked on the storyline, it's just plain and simple, and also, there are no memorable things here in this anime, besides how Lady and Trish met, how Dante spoke profanity (which is kinda weird though), and Baul and Modeous' Appearances as Sparda's Protegees.\\n\\n\r\nBut you know what is worst in this anime? A Lot actually, like those Demon Fights with Dante which you think you'd expected longer and hardcore, well, I'd say, NOPE, it's not fun and I'd rather watch \"Shingeki No Kyojin\", \"Naruto\", or even the longest fight between Goku and Cell in \"Dragon Ball Z\" than wasting my time on this climatic... or should I say \"Boring\" Climatic Sequence. And also, really? On the episode where it sets on the Opera House, when Dante says to Patty \"Sorry kid, but this following sequence is FOR ADULTS ONLY.\" You also showed her any kinds of fighting and gore against those demons you've been facing with even the fight is sets behind the curtain... Really? Dante from the Anime World, a word of advice, Instead of telling her that, why don't you tell her to get out of the opera house because it's \"...FOR ADULTS ONLY\"... Really, Dante? Is this is how you treat that kid like that? \"Dante's Has No Son or Daughter Maybe That Was Acceptable, right?\" F--- NO!! He already looks like older now and a little mature, maybe he knows what is Good Values and Right Conduct. What is he? A Half-Demon, Half-Human with No Brain?\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNope... I don't like it... Why? Because Dante, from my view, is kinda thin, what is he? Is he taking some dope or something? What's wrong with him? The Only Dante I Know is he has a Good Shape and With A Nice F-----G Abs #NoHomo... WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT IN THE ANIME?! And also, Lady is so Hideous... Much worst to Dante's look in DmC: Devil May Cry game. So, when my boner was about to engage, instead, my boner retreats... Trish... I don't know, but for me, she looks fine though so I accept that...\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for the other minor characters... I have no problems at all... Besides, they're just another bunch of anime characters from the DMC universe. Except they're new and not on the game. Because if they are existed in the game, I would just flipped myself over because of those hideous looks starting from Lady to Dante...\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nError 404: Best Sound or Soundtrack Not Found...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nDante, speaks profanity, which is UNACCEPTABLE, but maintains its cool just like in the game. Lady, has the worst shape but her character maintains it, and Trish, which is also acceptable. Appearantly, those characters are just good enough... Except Sid, I don't like his face. PERIOD. Maybe next time, try Ver--... No... No... Not here in this anime... Oh how about this... NEXT TIME... TRY MAKING A ANTAGONIST THAT LOOKS LIKE VERGIL AND FIGHTS LIKE VERGIL EXCEPT IT'S A DIFFERENT NAME, how about that?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nFun Part of the story? I'd say... Hmm... Wait... Give me more minutes to think...\\n\r\n(More Minutes Later)\\n\r\n...\\n\r\n...\\n\r\nNope, I don't enjoy it... Oh wait... There's One... That was closing my Windows Media Player which contain the Episodes from Devil May Cry: The Animated Series, shutting down my PC, and go to sleep like it was just a dream... or a nightmare perhaps...\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIn my opinion... It's enough to play Devil May Cry games except watching this anime. I'm sorry, I don't like this and I wanted to have more time to watch any other animes besides this anime toilet... So, if you want to watch this anime, I RECOMMENDED YOU TO WATCH \"DEATH NOTE\" or \"PARASYTE -THE MAXIM-\". Two of the most well recommended anime shows from MadHouse Entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte -The Maxim- is maybe the best choice to devour Devil May Cry: The Animated Series onto it's roots. Why? Parasyte has the best battle out there and it has a great storyline with a well character development. So I recommend to watch that instead of this hideous anime adaptation based on the game.\\n\\n\r\nSo my final verdict is 3/10... It almost gone out to 2 or pathetic score. But because Dante's jokes that are kinda funny, and the explaination on how Lady and Trish turns out into good friends from DMC4, i guess that's enough to cover it...",

            "content": "As a huge fan of the Devil May Cry franchise, I felt obligated to at least give the anime a chance. I didn't expect much, and to say the least, that's what I got.\r\nThere's nothing extraordinary about the show, no specific highlights worth mentioning or anything that sets it aside from other anime, while at the same time, there's nothing I could say is actually 'bad' about it either. The dub quality is good, and the familiar voices are enjoyable for those like me who love the Devil May Cry games, and even the personalities are on point. Each episode follows a scenario where Danteis hired to do some sort of mission, leading up to at least one would-be epic fight scene, and I can't help but compare many parts to what would be seen in Cowboy Bebop, not to mention Dante being a bounty hunter himself. You might not see it the same way, but I can't help but see it as a watered-down version of Cowboy Bebop.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the show is that the fight scenes are nothing like what they should be. In an action show, the viewer's interest in supposed to peak at the heart of each episode, which in the case of Devil May Cry, is the episode's \"boss battles\". While Dante is MEANT to make his job look easy, there's no such thing as a good fight in this show. A bullet or two in the face of a demon (followed by a waterfall of Kool-Aid blood pouring out of said demon's face) is enough to defeat any enemy of Dante's. As challenging as the games are, players know that no fight is that easy. Dante is never given a challenge; he's never even touched by a single enemy. Nobody else even has the slightest chance of keeping up with him. Yeah, Dante is supposed to be badass, but the fight scenes aren't nearly as enjoyable as they should be because of every battle being played on easy mode with no chance of Dante even getting a scratch on him at any point.\\n\\n\r\nThe music isn't as loveable as I had hoped for it to be, and the visual quality is sub-par as well, but maybe that's just my high standards speaking. Being familiar with the characters, I guess I could say I was satisfied with the way they were in the show, and the day-by-day slice of life style in the episodes is a nice way for an idea like Devil May Cry to be played out, with each episode having its own story. If you're a die-hard DMC fan with tolerance for nearly any anime, there's no real reason not to check this out, but if you're expecting a great show with action to introduce you to Devil May Cry, stay away from this and go play the games... except for the terrible Ninja Theory reboot, of course.",

            "content": "Story (6) - Well, to avaluate devil may cry in this aspect is a bit hard..if we look at the anime it has almost no relation between episodes, and thats a negative point. Well, there are some connections, but the way the story goes is not directly connected, it is like each episode has is own story. By the story of all anime i give a 3. But i think each episode story is well made, so i give a 8 as an average of each episode story.\r\n(3+8)/2=5,5=6. If you like anime with good story, from the first episode to the last one, this isnot your kind of anime. I personally dont mind, and im opening for different kind of stories.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7) - Art is good, but nothing special in my opinion. Sometime it could be better, but is fine anyways, this is neither the strongest point neather the weakest.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10) - When i watched Dmc the first thing that got my attention was the opening..i liked it. Besides, character voices are good, the ending is also something great, background music is also nice. I have nothing negative to say about this aspect, so 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8) - Dante is great, and his personality  is well made. Some other suportt characters are also nice, but there are some that are not good at all. I think besides dante and 1 or 2 more, the rest is not anything special. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9) - I will only say this. i watched the first episode, and became interested in watching, and this is always a good aspect. I saw all the episodes really fast, and believe me, that is rare for me, because if it is nothing special i take more time to see all the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8) - I agree when people says that devil may cry is nothing special, i already saw much better, but i cant say it is horrible, because it isnt. Its a fine and entretaining show, not the best, but good enough to be worth of watching.",

            "content": "Story - The overall story left me wanting a bit more depth. It is borderline slice-of-life action, A wired combination and it doesn't work all that well in my opinion. There seems to be no plot going on throughout the first few episodes however the plot slowly develops a very tiny bit per episode until it reaches its climax in episode 11/12. the overall story had me a little bored however the last few episodes were some of the best anime I have ever seen. They were tense on the edge action and it is a great reward for sticking through the slow storyline.\r\nArt -The art is amazing. Defiantly something that should be admired. the art really adds to the level of depth and helps indulge the watcher in Dante's world.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Although a little repetitive at times the sound fits the anime quite well. The OP is amazing, It also has a very small role in the anime which really made me smile - I don't want to reveal too much but its usage in the last episode is amazing. The ED is almost engrish, the words change frequently which was a bit strange but the overall feel of the ED was a nice way to wind down after an action packed anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I didn't enjoy quite a few of the episodes however the last two episodes really redeemed the show. There are ups and downs and, as I have said before, everything comes together in the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Overall I liked this anime, the last episodes are amazing whilst the middle episodes (3-9) are quite boring however worth watching to see the very high tension ending.",

            "content": "Devil May Cry\r\nI saw a lot of reviews hating this anime knowing nothing about the games and not knowing this was to promote DMC4 so one should keep in mind that, and also this was made by one of the writers of the game, so his personality is the same like in the games; The anime is set chronologically between DMC1 and DMC4, showing what heppened between the gap of the two and also how Lady and Trish met; This anime was refreshing and it's different from the games, less action than what the games offer but i enjoyed it, Dante doesn't even use allhis powers and the only one that can fight and even kill Dante is Vergil but he doesn't appear here for obvious reasons and it could seem Dante is immortal, well, he's immortal even in his human form in DMC4, but the thing is, only Vergil can kill him, that's why he kills demons so easily; oh and for me this is a great anime more for the enjoyment that i had than what the story offered.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nIt follows an episodic formula in which Dante does all kind of jobs, specially killing demons and everything related with demons, he will accept the jobs so he can pay his debts, and the causing of the big amount of debts are Trish and Lady because they're always taking a share of the payment he earns without their help; Almost at the last eps. the story will continue what was left in the first two and conclude with a good story but not surprising and predictable also at the very end everyone heading to the same place, the events of DMC4.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe animation was great, there's not much to say, it was well done, the character design was surprising, i was expecting something bad just because it was different from the character design of the games but Dante looks good, i really liked it and i was wrong to think it was going to be bad just because it wasn't like the games but yeah, the art style/animation was great considering it was from 2007.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound was great, the OP, the backrgound music, the weird thing was the ED, i don't think it was fitting; The VA made a great job specially for Dante, i thought Dante's voice was going to be bad, but it was on point of who he was at that point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nBecause one writer helped to make the anime, the characters are just exactly like in the games and that's what i loved it, they didn't change it, they had the same personalities just a little changes on Lady tho and for the new characters, they were interesting, i liked that Dante had a contractor looking for jobs to offer him and i kind of liked the character of Patty, always cleaning the local and bothering him like if she was her little sister and he being cool about it. The enemies are weak but looking at the amount of enemies that appear at once or how many they appear in the whole anime, it's obvious they're not going to do anything to him, it's not even the amount that appears on any first chapter of the games but the characters were very good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nGreat enjoyment, I liked this anime because i wanted to see something different from the games, i wanted to see how Dante handles his business, how he approached the jobs, this was a refreshing turn from the games, that's why it's a 9 well, mostly for the enjoyment but the surprising animation and great sound were decisive to give it a high score despite the weak but good story.",

            "content": "Overall the Devil May Cry anime was pretty good. It's 12 episodes long. The animation and sound are good and it has action and humor. Many of the episodes look like one shots but everything is linked in the end. It won't confuse people who have not played the game and it won't bore those who have.\r\nMy criticism is that some of the action scenes are little cut. Dante starts fighting and a few seconds later fast forward, he's at home after winning the battle. \r\nAnother thing isn't really a critic as much as an observation, but I noticed after watching some game videos thatanime Dante is more serious then game Dante. Sure he still loves pizza and strawberry sundaes, and he's still cocky and confident, and a little cheesy; but game Dante is cheesier, louder and more cheerful. I'm not saying anime Dante is an emo, far from it, he's just quiet, practically never smiles and he takes a lot of naps. While game Dante would say &quot;This party's getting crazy! :D&quot; and proceed to beat up the bad guys while eating pizza, I honestly can't imagine anime Dante saying such a line. Fighting while eating pizza and being cocky yes, but he would instead say with a serious face &quot;it gets R rated from here.&quot;\\n\\n\r\nAs for what's new in the anime. You'll get some more information about Dante's past and certain characters who have appeared in different games will finally meet. You'll also see Dante in his day to day life. My favorites are episodes 5, 9 and 12.",

After I completerd the first episode I decided to leave it for a while, hoping that one day I would be in the mood for a stylish but brainless anime. Months later... I have realised this will not happen.\r\nThe story - or lack thereof - is disgusting. Fair enough, the DMC series never was known for its plot lines, but there is a huge difference between playing and watching (which is highlighted particularly by this anime).  I actually hadto force myself to finish the first episode. There was a basic 'transport this girl to this place' thing going on... punctuated by a bunch of demons popping up and almost killing someone,  before Dante appeared out of nowhere and killed them EVERY SINGLE TIME. There was no character development either... just a stereotypically cool Dante doing all the stylish stuff we could make him do in the games. The sound was predictable and boring - Dante listens to hard rock because he's awesome; we get it. \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing this anime does have going for it is the art. It is relatively well-presented and ultra-stylish. That really doesn't make up for how remarkably poor every other aspect of it is.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, I wish that I had discovered this anime somewhere in the middle of puberty, when I might actually have been content to kill brain cells by watching a guy shoot monsters over and over and over again. This is the only anime that I have abandoned to date. Steer clear.",

Come on, people, you have 3 games, 2 books, and 2 manga volumes worth of background to draw on and you give us Dante playing... death poker?? Are you @#%& kidding me?? \r\nThe series has one story per episode for the first 10 episodes, and only develops a coherent plot in 11 and 12. The stories are boring, the action is practically nonexistent, and Dante is more of a cameo than the main character. \r\nWho the hell is thetarget audience here?? DMC demons do not haunt the world like ghosts and manipulate people from the sidelines. They drop down from portals and immediately get in your face with claws and lasers! But there's barely 10 seconds of action per episode, and crappy action at that. \\n\\n\r\nMost of it involved Dante shooting something in the head. If anything interesting does happen, it happens offscreen and is never explained. \\n\r\nHow do you get that from a gaming franchise built on outlandishly stylish fighting?? By the way, Dante hardly talks and has no attitude. Yeah, out of DMC1 and DMC3 they picked DMC2 zombie-Dante. And whose idea was it to make Dante babysit an annoying little girl?? Ugh...\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I finished watching the whole series last night. DMC was simply awesome! \r\nI was looking for an anime that is shonen or seinen with a genre of action and with top priority on cool graphics - so I picked Devil May Cry with a lot of hesitations. \r\nI also thought I would never watched this kind of anime because I was tired with so detailed-like graphics and animation TV series I used to watch back then. But then again I thought, I'll give it a try. Man, I was wrong! I was hooked up right after I watched the first episode. \r\nI'll break down mythoughts on the anime without giving spoilers (hopefully). :)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nWhen I watched the first episode, I said, &quot;WOW!&quot;.  The graphics left me in awe with nicely drawn characters and backgrounds. Colors used were also great - with Dante in red dress and white-grey hair of which I thought before was boring if this is his &quot;uniform&quot; but then again, I was wrong if you&rsquo;re caught up with the story.\\n\\n\r\nI give the art as 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe OP soundtrack was superb and in sync with (flashes of) characters in their little scene. I did not read that entire lyrics of the ED soundtrack but the melody was nice. \\n\\n\r\nSound effects were also superb. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, sound is top-notch and I give it 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nI like how the anime story was somewhat divided per episode but each ep was connected in reaching to the climax. I really like the last episode. It left me smiling after watching it. I like to watch more of this anime!\\n\\n\r\nI also like the fact that they employ humor in the story for the main character; though humors here are little as this anime focus on serious action. \\n\\n\r\nWhy it's not 10? Maybe because it's a short series and I would like watch more about the main character's development as he is in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt's 9/10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nI say the main characters were cool with cool moves and were nicely drawn. I even found Dante sexy. Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. :D His moves were cool and sexy especially with his guns and sword. The lead female characters were also pretty cool and sexy. \\n\\n\r\nI give them 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThe entire series is a total enjoyment for me. Pretty cool characters and their moves with top notch graphics to go with. Story is not so intricate for me but it also gives mysteries which were unfolded in the climax. \\n\\n\r\nI totally enjoyed this anime, so it&rsquo;s 10/10. 2 thumbs up!\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this to those who look for action anime with very nice graphics, cool characters, superb sound, and story in one package. \\n\\n",

I'm sure many people know that this is based on the game of the same name, as it followed Dante completing missions by exterminating demons in some very stylish ways. Unfortunately, although the demon killing is present in the series. The greatness that was found in the games is completely lost. Those out there who sat through the Street Fighter Alpha series, Fatal Fury movies, or heaven forbid Art of Fighting. More than likely shouldn't be surprised and already have anidea on just how often the mark is missed. The only thing surprising to me is that the fans didn't outright obliterate this bullshit on release date like they did Street Fighter: Generations.\\n\\n\r\nVideo game to anime are mainly meant for one particular fan base, and that is fans of the games. However, as a fan of the game myself. I can tell you that this series doesn't do the game any justice at all, and as an anime, Devil May Cry is pretty much unwatchable. Devil May Cry has almost nothing to offer. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a dumpster load of reasons to hate this series. Right from the very beginning, I knew this series was going to be bad because Dante was given a chibi character named Patty to baby sit. This character along with many others serves absolutely no purpose, except to provide small repeated comedy relief which was never funny to begin with, and this is among the cliches that are present in this series. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are incredibly bland, and the secondary characters make appearances for no reason other than to squeeze in popular faces from the video game. Outside of the way they fight, the viewer can forget about learning anything about them. The secondary characters who make their appearances are Trish and Lady: two female fighters that aren't even slightly developed, with only very small hints about them thrown out there.\\n\\n\r\nDante is a decent character sort of yet he's very lame as well. He deals out death packing his usual two pistols with a large sword, but his full abilities are never fully displayed. Even fans of the game should come away disappointed here. Try to imagine Ryu from Street Fighter never using his ultimate attack, which would be the \"Hadoken\", and you will get the picture. In addition, I find nothing cool about a character whom fights demons, but loses to children and everybody in grown up games. Plus, has a love for cherry sundaes? It just comes off weird to me. Instead, he should be drinking beer, some fuckin' robust, full bodied, imperial stouts or some shit.\\n\\n\r\nThe direction is atrocious. The series utilizes an episodic format which happens to become quite repetitive and very predictable. Clients would appear to Dante requesting his services, and each episode ends with some type of battle with a demon. Hints at a greater plot are mentioned very early. Only to be completely dropped and never mentioned again. \\n\\n\r\nGiving a tad bit of credit where it's due. Some of the villains are somewhat interesting with decent abilities, but every last one of them are poorly used in delivering good battles. The action sequences are very boring and lack a lot of imagination. Many of the fight scenes either consist of off screen and unseen action, or are decided in one move victories. This also includes demons that are heavily hyped in to being real threats. The battles are colossal disappointments, and they are cut too short for an action oriented fan whom has binged on a lot of action anime to really be pleased. There are too many action titles out there that very far surpasses this, and I'm talking titles that pre-date this at least a decade.  The ending is every bit as unsatisfying, bland, and nonsensical, as every thing that came before it. This series is almost a bigger waste of time than Hell Girl, and that's saying a lot.\\n\\n\r\nDevil May Cry at least stands out with its production values. It definitely looks pretty, and it smoothly blends in 3-D with CG. The artwork brings the Madhouse flavor with scantily clad chicks almost baring it all, and the character designs are very faithful to their video game counterparts. I didn't find any of the designs for the demons to be impressive. Only passable at the very best. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack contains a real good opening theme, which is titled \"d.m.c.\", and quite honestly displays the best animation in the series. Plus, the ending theme is a nice song performed by Rin Oikawa called \"I'll Be Your Home\", but it's not worth sitting through 20+ minutes of bad anime to hear it. The voice work from the English cast was fine to me. Dante at times delivered some profanity filled lines, which were kind of funny. I can't comment on the Japanese cast, because I would never sit through this more than once. \\n\\n\r\nDevil May Cry is a nightmare for the anime vet and non fans of the game; but as a fan of the game, all this series does is make me want to play through the games for two reasons. Number one: to remind me that Devil May Cry really is a cool and entertaining franchise. Number two: to cleanse my mind of the vacuous tripe I've wasted my time on. I would say avoid this shit, but since it has a high rating I'm probably wasting my time.",

            "content": "Basically, Devil  May Cry is about a half demon half human who takes on a job as a Demon Hunter. If you love shiny guns, motorcycles, blood and shiny swords, this may be the anime for you.\r\nStory: (6/10)\r\nThe story isn't really bad. It has the right materials which are pretty substantial. In other words, the background of the story was great! It's very interesting; European setting, demons, Demon Hunter and so on. But then, the materials weren't used properly. So the story flow became really dull. The story development wasn't really visible. It was only until the 11th episode that the climax was drawn.And as soon as you're finally enjoying the climax, you suddenly get lost because the series has already ended. Personally, I think that the series was simply too rushed. I believe this would have been a better series if the story was more developed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe drawings are good. The proportions are great. But what I love most about this anime are the shiny guns, Dante's sword, some motorcycle scenes and the bloody scenes. Graphics' really good. The art complemented with the story and the atmosphere it was trying to give off.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (5/10)\\n\r\nSorry to say, I did not notice the sound at all. I only heard the gunshots and the dubs. Maybe it was part of the main idea of the story. But I think that more sounds would help define the atmosphere. That aside, I did NOT enjoy the OP and ED at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (6/10)\\n\r\nThe characters are interesting, but they were not developed well. The same comment as the story. They good materials but were not used well. For one thing, Dante's father and mother could have been given some light, but they weren't.The other two female characters, Lady and the girl that could use thunder could have also been given some emphasis. Simply put, there were not enough interesting flashbacks for the viewers to sympathize are empathize with.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8/10)\\n\r\nWell, it was funny and action packed. Again, you'll really enjoy this if you love guns and blood.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (7/10)\\n\r\nThough the story and characters were underdeveloped, the anime's decently enjoyable.",

So there is a lot of fun to be had as a fan seeing Dante going through these villain of the week stories. They do a good job subtly fleshing out his character, and there are some really cool concepts in play here. But the execution is just really flat. The animation is very bogstandard and rigid, which is a shame being in the hands madhouse. The main cast is as fun as ever but a lot ofthe side characters are really one note and even annoying. There are a few too many episodes that are boring. I can't help but feel disappointed, as I really enjoy this universe, but they do little to spice it up. I'd say if you wanna get into the series and experience a good story, just play Devil May Cry 3. Fans might get a kick out of some of the episodes but otherwise, it's pretty flat.",

But maybe some game like Lord of the Ring or maybe the recent Wolverine game for the PC is good. Speaking of game, now i going comment a anime that was base from one of the best game from Capcom call 'Devil May Cry' (wahhhhh.....), and how that i think about it; well, let's find out!\r\nDMC, when it say it going to become an anime; i like any other DMC player are jump forjoy for it adaption. But after going through all the 12 episode of DMC, i like any other DMC player are down with sorrow and anger that what the hell the director has done on DMC.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in this anime are all episodic, each episode are stand alone story until episode 9 or 10 where the real plot has finally started. And each episode are all the same: \\n\\n\r\n1,there is a demon case\\n\r\n2,Dante sitting around and do nothing (or maybe try to annoy Patty stupid problem) until Morrison say 'get your ass up! We got work to do, blah blah blah....'\\n\r\n3,He goes to work, have some help from Lady and Trish\\n\r\n4,He blew the work, mission accomplish and his debt is increase. The End!\\n\\n\r\nThat it! Nothing new, no plot that connected to other plot, zero! Until episode 9 or 10.\\n\\n\r\nSure you have character like Dante, Lady, and Trish to be animated here, and you do have character only for this anime, like Patty, she has been on the series since episode only has 'finally' been serve as a important character on episode 9 or 10, for the rest of the episode she just serve as a annoying brat! And Morrison, Dante agent always try to bring him a good job but end getting mess up by Dante.\\n\\n\r\nFor Dante, Lady, and Trish (i still want make a comment on them!), Dante still Dante, like pizza and strawberry, and weild Ebony & Ivory and Rebellion to fight off demon. And the funny thing is, he use his gun more than his sword! Even the director finally let him use it, the sword battle are just temporary! But Trish and Lady still play their role where they supposed to be, to support Dante and take Dante credit!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is good, no less. The shading and everything was good. Even the bike scene in episode 2 are well done. Plus the OP of the series was nice, able to blend in the series as well. But the ED (though i didn't listen that often) was smooth and relax.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the credit for us finishing DMC anime? Zero!\\n\r\nWhat is the credit for them finishing DMC anime?Promoting DMC4!\\n\r\nWhat is the credit for us buying DMC anime DVD?More DMC4 bonus!\\n\\n\r\nAnd in my opinion, this bonus are come to nothing and pointless after the real thing is out. The anime just bring down Dante good point and completely destroy the DMC atmosphere. And DMC is not the only one being anime, other like 'Tales of...', '.Hack' did make the series well and on going. And heck, even the live action Resident Evil movie was better than this!\\n\\n\r\nThat why product movie, animation, comic or anything that is base on something are mostly not a good thing!",

            "content": "Devil May Cry is something I desperately hoped would turn out great. Most things based off a video game- whether it be a movie, a book, or even an anime- are damned to fail. So for Devil May Cry, based on the video games of the same title, my hopes were that this work might succeed in its attempt to become a great anime. They might have been foolish, selfish wishes, but I wished that it at least would at least try.\r\nWas this anime as good as it could have been? The general consensus is no, as it seems. Why? To illustrate how an animebecomes boring, a list, featuring Devil May Cry:\\n\\n\r\n1. Dante doesn\u2019t have flaws.\\n\r\nIf he does, they barely exist. He\u2019s a freaking blank slate. He always defeats every demon in his way, EVERY TIME. Conflict? What conflict. If there isn\u2019t anyone he can\u2019t kill, then why even bother watching. Even Dante is aware of his extreme powers, and is constantly bored by his opponents. If he\u2019s bored, we\u2019re bored. You won\u2019t be at the edge of your seat, because you know he can defeat whoever comes his way. It\u2019s healthy to have the character lose once in a while, because it keeps the audience on edge. It\u2019s permissible to never have the characters lose, but at least let them break a sweat. If Dante ever breaks a sweat, which he won\u2019t, it\u2019ll be the cool kind, like a strawberry sundae oozing down his face or a pizza slice breaking out of his pores and sliding with a greasy trail down to his- scratch that, that\u2019s disturbing. I actually wanted Dante to lose or die in the end, because it would be a major twist from the usual formula of \u2018I can\u2019t defeat this guy\u2026 just kidding\u2019 that Dante relies on all too often. It\u2019s a level of boring that can only be matched by watching plastic grass grow. \\n\\n\r\n2. Being something all the time = boring.\\n\r\nDante should not be cool 24/7. It gets boring and grating to watch. He\u2019s cool when he sleeps. He\u2019s cool when he eats his cool food. He\u2019s cool when he walks all alone in the dark, in his cool outfit with his cool sword and cool shiny guns strapped to him and his cool poker face. He walks out of a fight without even a single speck of soil landing on his clothes and his hair immaculate. The coolness is great at first, but after the same thing all the goddamn time, you might even find yourself switching to \u201cMars of Destruction\u201d instead of this crap. At least you can laugh at MoD.\\n\\n\r\n3. The plot comes at the last minute.\\n\r\nLook at the picture for Devil May Cry. Go ahead, look at it. The white haired guy in front, as you probably know, is Dante. The other two guys are central to the plot, but show up at the next to last episode. That means the rest of the time was spent on NOTHING. The rest of the time is spent on Patty, who is basically Ciel\u2019s fianc\u00e9 Elizabeth from Kuroshitsuji mixed with Renge from Ouran High School Host Club. If you don\u2019t know who those people are, the mishmash would be a grotesque mass of blonde hair, clingy personality, no point, and a really annoying tendency to appear at the worst times. That\u2019s Patty for you, a girl who should\u2019ve left after the first episode, but stuck around just to add another element of suck to the DMC headquarters.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we\u2019ve got that out of the way, more about the plot. The plot is so rushed into the ending that they shouldn\u2019t have even bothered. Most of the anime is just one episode dramas which have zero conflict because as I said before, Dante doesn\u2019t lose. Ever. Devil May Cry is about Dante and friends having wonderful romps through their zany adventures of killing bloodthirsty demons. And Patty\u2019s there too, I guess. It wasn\u2019t very good, it\u2019s very obvious it was based off a video game. There\u2019s really no explanation of anything- I would have loved to hear the limitations of the demons, the limitations of Dante, or how Devil May Cry got started. Nobody gets that much of a backstory, no rules of the universe are explained, and no real emotional ties between characters are developed. It\u2019s cripplingly average. The majority of the anime is Dante strutting around eating his strawberry sundaes and pizza and beer while shooting demons. It\u2019s not very fun once you get passed the first episode.\\n\r\nOn the technical side, it\u2019s obvious that they did do a bit of demonology research, evidenced by names such as Baal, Modeus, and Dante. That, however, is to be expected and it\u2018s not very impressive.\\n\\n\r\nMoving right along to the art, there are a few things that need to be said about the dreaded art. It\u2019s blasphemous to see an otherwise gorgeous characters massacred by unsavory art. Dante\u2019s really hot, but you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell because the damn animation could turn caviar into feces with a garnish of roadkill. Trish the sexbomb was reduced to Trish the kill-it-with-fire bomb. Lady went from looking like Meagan Fox to looking like something a fox just killed. The animation\u2019s boxy and has a freaking ugly style. However, it gets a four because it\u2019s not bad enough to deter you from watching the series. Most of the other things might.\\n\\n\r\nRight about here\u2019s where characters are discussed, and it\u2019s a real shame that they\u2019re basically cardboard cut outs with traits slapped on to them. In fact, each character can be described in one sentence without fear of missing a personality aspect. They are all so flat that pieces of soggy paper say to their children, \u201cHoney, some day you\u2019ll be like Dante.\u201d\\n\r\nDante isn\u2019t the only character at fault here. Lady is a chick who basically fills the screen when the animators take a break from Dante\u2019s face, Patty is a chick who is there for comic relief, but it\u2019s more like comic agony, and Trish is the girl who\u2019s supposed to be really hot, but as I said before, the fault lies in the sub par animation. It\u2019s notable that Patty is one of the few original (to this anime) characters here. The actual demons are transparent and you can see their explanations for their actions coming from a mile away (I wanted to battle the infamous Dante, I need to prove myself to master, I knew your father, etc).\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the whole thing was okay. It was just alright. The choices were very obvious, like \u201cDANT\u2019S BAD@ZZ SO OBVSLY HE LURVES ROCKNROLL OMG LOL!!!1\u201d It\u2019s sickeningly mediocre rock, by the way. Nothing particularly hardcore.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the enjoyment, if you watch DMC, watch it for the ride. If you get tired of the same cool shtick over and over then watch a few episodes and don\u2019t finish it, the ending does not carry a great payoff. Otherwise, I recommend this anime to those who are intrigued by badassery and badassery alone.",

            "content": "A lot of gamers are, at least, familiar with Capcom's Devil May Cry. The franchise is pretty beloved, except for that reboot one where Dante had dark hair and was, objectively, a piece of shit. In 2007, after the third instalment but before the fourth, our old friends at Madhouse started releasing an anime based off of the games. That's right, the studio that brought us such adaptations as X-men, Metropolis, and FF Legend of the Crystals was behind this. Well, maybe this one isn't a pile of garbage like those were. Well, except Metropolis. It was just sub-par. \r\nStory:\r\nWe open with Morrison bringing Dantea job. Now, you might find yourself asking \u201cwho the hell is  Morrison?\u201d He's an original character who basically exists to bring Dante work and, occasionally, drive him around. The job is simple, Dante just has to safely escort a young orphan girl to the estate of the deceased father she never met to claim her inheritance. Naturally, she's being hunted by demons. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those anime where the underlying plot is pretty light and most episodes are just doing their own thing. Dante gets a job that somehow involves demons and then he goes out to slay them. In fact, the weakest part of the series is the big underlying plot. You get little snippets of it in quite a few episodes, but it ultimately involves a lot of contrivance and it's just not very good in general. Even the ongoing stuff that's meant to draw your attention to the fact that something is afoot is largely just dull and really obvious. To the point where it's just \u201cthis again\u201d after a few times. The episodes also have a general problem of trying way too hard to give happy endings. To the point where they can just go completely off the rails and not make much sense. There are quite a few episodes that set things up for sad or, at the very least, bitter-sweet endings and then pull happy ones out of their anuses. I guess I missed the memo about DMC being for small children who can't process tragedy on account of the PEGI 16 ratings. \\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, a lot of the episodic scenarios are pretty interesting. Varied too. Yeah, you know that Dante is going to fight some demon,  but there's a lot of variation in what kinds of demons he'll fight and how they'll approach. Some of them use stealthy approaches or try to use guile, others prefer the direct approach. Some are after him specifically, others just happen to stumble upon him while going about their terrible business. And some of the scenarios are really intricate. The death poker game being a prime example. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters from the games, Dante, Trish & Lady are all portrayed pretty true to character. Which is more than a certain reboot managed. In terms of original characters, some of the ones Dante encounters on his missions are kind of interesting. Others are pretty mediocre. Then we have our reoccurring Ocs, Morrison & Patty. Morrison is a boring character. We don't know why he's bringing Dante jobs, how they met or anything beyond \u201che brings Dante jobs.\u201d He's pretty much on par with the plot coupon guy from your average PreCure series. And those can get by with it because they are actually for children. Then we have Patty. Have you ever wondered what Devil May Cry would be like if Dante had a slightly annoying child sidekick? No? Well, it's not the best decision that Madhouse could have made. She spends a lot of time pestering Dante, having to be rescued and contributing virtually nothing. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is pretty decent. The characters look like themselves and Madhouse clearly made an effort to make the aesthetic look like DMC. The demon designs are generally pretty good as well. The trouble is that the action sequences themselves aren't all that good. In a series that relies heavily on action sequences. A lot of the \u201cbig\u201d Dante fights end very quickly without having much content. And a lot of the sequences focus heavily on scenes of Dante attacking while not showing, or barely showing, his opponent. It would've benefited from showing them striking at one another in the same frames a bit more, is what I'm saying. Oh, and expect a lot of deaths to go the blood fountain route. I guess demon blood streams are highly pressurised. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe series did get some good voice actors. We've got Morikawa Toshiyuki as Dante. Yes, Dante and Sephiroth are the same guy. We all suspected it given the resemblance. We've got Orikasa Fumiko and Tanaka Atsuko, both of whom are damn good actresses, as Lady and Trish respectively. Even the less interesting characters got some decent voices. The musical score by Hama Takeshi & Tsutsumi Hiroaki is pretty close to fantastic. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't any, really. The closest you're going to get is Lady and Trish forming a friendship. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nDevil May Cry is an anime that had some potential. After all, there's a lot to work with from the games. Unfortunately, it's held back by a dull underlying plot, trying too hard to provide happy endings, the slightly annoying child sidekick and mundane action sequences. Ultimately, I'd still say it's all right  but it certainly could have been better. My final rating is a 6/10. Next week we'll continue video game month with a look at Street Fighter Alpha.",

Oh well...too late. \r\nStory:\r\nNo plot. Seriously. There is no plot in this anime. Now I don't know what the video game is like so I won't dwell into it, but I was very disappointed in the fact this this anime, as good as it looks, lacked a simple plot. It was only 'filler' and 'subplot' episodes until at least the last two episodes. I just wished it came close to what my friend told me aboutinstead of this bull. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nSaved by the art. It's wasn't bad really. The style was especially interesting, and there wasn't bright colours to make my head spin. Overall, the anime and art style was relatively calm.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nSame as the art. Wasn't too, too bad. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nNow I know something is missing. I did look up the DMC wiki after I watched and realized they were missing a huge chunk of characters. Too bad since I was so interested in meeting Dante's brother and learning more about his past. But aside from a lazy, demon demon slayer, and a little girl who can't keep her mouth shut, they both seem like the typical demon and human tag team you would see in any other anime. In short, it's nothing new. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: \\n\\n\r\nIt was fine. I enjoyed the random parts and I am a fan of white haired anime guys, but it was too short for my tasting. I just wished they animated more. \\n\\n\r\nI give this anime 55% on the giant sword scale. \\n",

            "content": "Devil May Cry is a very strange anime. It does its thing nicely for a bit but then goes and ruins it with some silly nonsense. I have no idea why or how that happened. I mean, the games are pretty consistently decent, so why isn't this show the same?\r\nLet's start with that totally unnecessary thing called story. Honestly, you might as well forget about it, as you won't be getting any for about 9 episodes in a row. No joke\u2014this is essentially a slice-of-life series about Dante being cool. And before you ask the obvious question\u2014yes, it has less of a story than theseries of action games the setting is based on. Furthermore, at several points you get an impression that some general plot is about to emerge (it eventually does, but already after you lose all hope for it), but the very next moment you have your expectations shattered without any back thought. You could probably even watch episodes 2\u20139 out of order without noticing any substantial difference. For that exact reason, you shouldn't worry about spoilers when discussing this anime, since it's impossible to spoil something that is either immediately obvious or completely non-existing. \"4\" is a generous mark here, owing mostly to the universe created by DMC game series.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, Dante. As I mentioned earlier, everything in this series is about showing Dante in the process of being cool. He's so cool he transcends the meaning of the word \"cool\", like the living embodiment of coolness never seen since the cool came to cool town. He always has that swag going, and his sense of fashion oozes style. Obviously, he only eats the coolest food in existence: pizza, strawberry sundae, beer\u2014nothing else. He has megacool overpowered weapons\u2014because dramatic stakes are for pussies. And even his name is cool. Unsurprisingly, every time he's up for a job, he always does it single-handedly\u2014be it a bike race, gambling, or slaughtering a several-stories-tall demon in seconds\u2014with that detached facial expression that drives home the point of his towering superiority. Yet he always fails to complete his primary objective because he's too damn righteous. How impossibly cool! And even during that, he appears to be utterly bored by stuff happening around him. One Punch Man too popular for you? Take a look at this gem then: DMC did the \"overpowered MC is bored by flaccid antagonists\" shtick 8 years before the bald guy. Hellsing Ultimate has too much of that annoying character development? DMC should be right up your boat\u2014it doesn't have any.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of characters, the entire cast is mainly there to support Dante by... looking deliberately uncool in comparison. First, we have Morrison, who is old-fashioned, intelligent, and an exemplary gentleman, almost a polar opposite of Dante. Then there's Patty, the token loli moeblob comic relief character whose significance is never shown despite screenwiter's best efforts (which fail spectacularly, I must add). A notable character is Lady, who is almost as cool as Dante, but still not quite up to his level; this, however, doesn't prevent her from being more successful at her job. But hey, if Dante doesn't do it, it must not be very cool, right? Also, there is Trish, who is between Lady and Dante on the scale on coolness and never gets any screen time. Lastly, there is that typical small fry antagonist who behaves like a character significant for the plot, although you wouldn't ever want him to be. The plot twist is that he actually is. You have to be a man and brace yourself. Or, if you're a woman, become a man and then brace yourself.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say much about sound and visuals. Both seem to be quite fitting and high quality in general, but as for animation, some scenes could have definitely be animated better (as in, actually animated\u2014you'll get it when you see it), and music lacks variety somewhat\u2014almost all of it is mere variations on the three dominant themes.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, DMC is the kind of show you'd want for some simple braindead entertainment when you've run out of more entertaining stuff. Don't expect anything beyond that, as otherwise you'll be disappointed in no time. Just get your beverage of choice, a pack of suitable snacks, and press play. Alternatively, go play Quake 3 deathmatch\u2014it has just about the same amount of plot with ten times the action and thrill.",

            "content": "If you\u2019ve never heard of Devil May Cry before and are looking for a good action anime, this is not it. If you\u2019re a fan of the video games and want to see more stylish ass-kickery, prepare to be disappointed. \r\nStory: Dante is running his business, performing mundane tasks for clients like demon-slaying, saving the world, the usual. Almost every episode starts and concludes one of Dante\u2019s assigned cases, involving nasty monsters that inevitably end up dead. There is some cheap drama that focuses on a young girl whom Dante saved and a loser demon who wants to become a god, but you\u2019re not seriouslyhere for the plot are you?\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style is able to create a dark, gothic atmosphere where Dante spills plenty of demon blood. However, it is not enough to keep you tense at all since fight scenes are way too short. Battles involve more talking than fighting and tend to be settled with one stroke (by guess who). There is a significant lack of spectacularly choreographed fight sequences as seen in the games, which will no doubt be a major letdown. Animation quality is only mediocre for when there is actually action. If you're hoping Dante will pull devil trigger, unleash some insane combos, or wield his other devil arms, guess what? He won't!\\n\r\nOh and yes, Trish and Lady are in this, but they\u2019re drawn rather unattractively. No eye candy here. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Some heavy rock, some gothic choir tracks, all very forgettable. Seems even the lowliest of demons can speak Japanese. Voice acting and sound effects are acceptable, but nothing noteworthy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Here it is, the reason you may be considering this anime: to see Dante kick plenty of ass. And here is also the show\u2019s main failure: Dante is simply overpowered. Yes we know he\u2019s super cool and skilled, but he faces absolutely no challenging adversaries at all. This entire anime is a series of totally one sided fights like I've never seen. Dante spends some time cracking jokes, his opponent says something stupid like \u201cI stand a chance!\u201d, and then Dante proceeds with delivering the pain. Except not in a spectacular, SSSmoking SSSick fashion. More like finishing it with one bullet from Ebony/Ivory or a couple swings of Rebellion. For fans of the games, this is a major kick to the balls and won\u2019t leave you satisfied at all.\\n\r\nOh, and apparently Dante loves eating strawberry sundaes on sunny afternoons, while getting bossed around by a precocious little girl. Who would've thought.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved the video games for their dramatic fight sequences, challenging bosses, cheesy humor and impossible physics. What the anime tries to duplicate, it does so without success. Dante is not so much kicking ass in this show as he is absentmindedly swatting flies. Your time would be better spent trying/ replaying the DMC video games. Except DMC2, let\u2019s just forget that ever existed.\\n\\n\r\n5/10  \\n",

            "content": "Can you name a single video game that was turned into a movie that wasn't an extremely terrible film that failed in all regards?  Now can you name a good videogame that was turned into an anime that wasn't terrible?  Alright...you can probably name a whole bunch, alot from the choose-your-own-adventure genres.  However Devil May Cry is more like a terrible video game movie.  If you've ever played, or seen someone play, Devil May Cry then you know the style of the game quite well.  The quality and feel of the anime is nothing like that of the original videogame.\r\nStory:Lame.  That single, bland word perfectly describes the storyline of this anime.  I wonder sometimes what the storywriters were thinking when they sat down to write this anime.  They clearly didn't put any heart or soul into this, and I hope that they had other projects that they deemed more important than this.  The real storyline begins in about episode 4-5.  When you have 12 episodes to tell a story in, and you spend the first third of the anime doing self contained episodes you know that you're off to a terrible start.  Even the story that they decide to throw in is terrible and quickly forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Some people praise the art, I however find it terrible to anything it tries to do.  The art is very clunky, the people seem to be squares and triangles and circles thrown together, the fluidity of the people is nonexistant.  Anyone who's seen the game knows what Dante looks like, and in the anime version he loses everything that makes him so cool in the game.  I got a very generic feeling from the art, it didn't seem that they were taking any risks, they were just doing the same old things over and over and the art seemed really stale.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is good, the effects are good, the music is good.  I believe with almost absolute certainty that they took a lot of the music from the game itself and I found it was the single thing that I was connecting with as I watched with.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: On the outside Dante is a badass. A pizza-eating, Strawberry Sundae drinking badass.  And on the inside?  Well...he's a badass.  And he's lazy.  He will beat up anyone, especially demons, because they piss him off.  And while he's exorcising the demons and doing whatever it is he does he doesn't seem to care at all.  Cause nothing is more badass than killing bad guys while not seeming to care about it at all.  Now....as the writers sat down they must have thought &quot;hmm...how exactly do we make a better anime when the main character is a rude, pizza-eating badass?&quot; and some guy went &quot;OH! MY! GOD! We add....a CUTE LITTLE GIRL! Who talks a lot and is a central part of the storyline so basically Dante is forced to stick beside her...people will LOVE IT!&quot; However...it doesn't work because it's been done a thousand times before, and it was original 10 years ago....and it was fresh then too.  But now it's not.  They also throw in characters from the games, but it feels forced and is quite annoying for anyone who's played the games.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Honestly, after episode 4 I stopped paying attention at all.  I really, really didn't care after episode 6. After episode 8 I could barely sit through each episode.  So I can honestly say that I didn't enjoy this anime at all.  At all.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't really recommend this to anyone who enjoys the game series.  It's such a huge disappointment if you're expecting it to be the game. However some people might really enjoy this anime, however I've never met anyone who enjoyed it.  The only good point is that it's only 12 episodes, so even if you hate it it's only 4 hours of your life....that you'll never get back.",

Alright... Just, let me review this anime...\r\nDevil May Cry: The Animated Series... Is by far, THE WORST ANIME THAT I'VE WATCHED IN MY LIFE... FROM MADHOUSE ENTERTAINMENT?! REALLY? THE ONE WHO GAVES US DEATH NOTE, AND KISEIJUU COMES WITH THIS HORRIFYING PIECE OF S... Ahh... Fuu-- (sigh) okay... Okay... Settle down, Vaas... Just... Let me... Just me relax and focus on my review... Okay (Inhaling) (Exhaling)...\r\nAlright, let me review this, I was soshocked when my beloved video game franchise, Devil May Cry, became an anime. And, the most shockingly thing that I've been seen when I watch this English dub is that, it was came from MadHouse Entertainment! I mean, come on... At first I was like, \"Hmm... MadHouse? What more could I ask for? It was like, the best anime corporations out there, there's nothing hideous when I watch this anime, right? Devil May Cry: The Animated Series is going to be a BLAST.\" And then, when I watch it from first to the last, I-- I don't know... I don't freaking know what am I going to say to both CAPCOM (the gaming developers of Devil May Cry) and MadHouse about this... this... SELLOUT ANIME BASED FROM THE VIDEO GAME CRAP...\\n\\n\r\nI hate this adaptations, and this is main example why the adaptation is so cruel, is so vile and worst.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nOkay, let's start with the Storyline shall we? (SPOILER ALERT) So it goes like this, there was man named Dante and a girl named Patty who stays in the Devil May Cry shop to search for her missing mother. Then, it also explains how Lady and Trish met (and that's why Trish and Lady became friends in the game; Devil May Cry 4), and wanted to kill all those who were in Dante's way, especially Sid, the main antagonist of the story who looks like a beggar at first but now he's a demon jackass. Oh, and by the way, this anime is CANON, meaning this anime is also set on the same universe on the game itself. So... As I checked on the storyline, it's just plain and simple, and also, there are no memorable things here in this anime, besides how Lady and Trish met, how Dante spoke profanity (which is kinda weird though), and Baul and Modeous' Appearances as Sparda's Protegees.\\n\\n\r\nBut you know what is worst in this anime? A Lot actually, like those Demon Fights with Dante which you think you'd expected longer and hardcore, well, I'd say, NOPE, it's not fun and I'd rather watch \"Shingeki No Kyojin\", \"Naruto\", or even the longest fight between Goku and Cell in \"Dragon Ball Z\" than wasting my time on this climatic... or should I say \"Boring\" Climatic Sequence. And also, really? On the episode where it sets on the Opera House, when Dante says to Patty \"Sorry kid, but this following sequence is FOR ADULTS ONLY.\" You also showed her any kinds of fighting and gore against those demons you've been facing with even the fight is sets behind the curtain... Really? Dante from the Anime World, a word of advice, Instead of telling her that, why don't you tell her to get out of the opera house because it's \"...FOR ADULTS ONLY\"... Really, Dante? Is this is how you treat that kid like that? \"Dante's Has No Son or Daughter Maybe That Was Acceptable, right?\" F--- NO!! He already looks like older now and a little mature, maybe he knows what is Good Values and Right Conduct. What is he? A Half-Demon, Half-Human with No Brain?\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNope... I don't like it... Why? Because Dante, from my view, is kinda thin, what is he? Is he taking some dope or something? What's wrong with him? The Only Dante I Know is he has a Good Shape and With A Nice F-----G Abs #NoHomo... WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT IN THE ANIME?! And also, Lady is so Hideous... Much worst to Dante's look in DmC: Devil May Cry game. So, when my boner was about to engage, instead, my boner retreats... Trish... I don't know, but for me, she looks fine though so I accept that...\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for the other minor characters... I have no problems at all... Besides, they're just another bunch of anime characters from the DMC universe. Except they're new and not on the game. Because if they are existed in the game, I would just flipped myself over because of those hideous looks starting from Lady to Dante...\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nError 404: Best Sound or Soundtrack Not Found...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nDante, speaks profanity, which is UNACCEPTABLE, but maintains its cool just like in the game. Lady, has the worst shape but her character maintains it, and Trish, which is also acceptable. Appearantly, those characters are just good enough... Except Sid, I don't like his face. PERIOD. Maybe next time, try Ver--... No... No... Not here in this anime... Oh how about this... NEXT TIME... TRY MAKING A ANTAGONIST THAT LOOKS LIKE VERGIL AND FIGHTS LIKE VERGIL EXCEPT IT'S A DIFFERENT NAME, how about that?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nFun Part of the story? I'd say... Hmm... Wait... Give me more minutes to think...\\n\r\n(More Minutes Later)\\n\r\n...\\n\r\n...\\n\r\nNope, I don't enjoy it... Oh wait... There's One... That was closing my Windows Media Player which contain the Episodes from Devil May Cry: The Animated Series, shutting down my PC, and go to sleep like it was just a dream... or a nightmare perhaps...\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIn my opinion... It's enough to play Devil May Cry games except watching this anime. I'm sorry, I don't like this and I wanted to have more time to watch any other animes besides this anime toilet... So, if you want to watch this anime, I RECOMMENDED YOU TO WATCH \"DEATH NOTE\" or \"PARASYTE -THE MAXIM-\". Two of the most well recommended anime shows from MadHouse Entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte -The Maxim- is maybe the best choice to devour Devil May Cry: The Animated Series onto it's roots. Why? Parasyte has the best battle out there and it has a great storyline with a well character development. So I recommend to watch that instead of this hideous anime adaptation based on the game.\\n\\n\r\nSo my final verdict is 3/10... It almost gone out to 2 or pathetic score. But because Dante's jokes that are kinda funny, and the explaination on how Lady and Trish turns out into good friends from DMC4, i guess that's enough to cover it...",

            "content": "As a huge fan of the Devil May Cry franchise, I felt obligated to at least give the anime a chance. I didn't expect much, and to say the least, that's what I got.\r\nThere's nothing extraordinary about the show, no specific highlights worth mentioning or anything that sets it aside from other anime, while at the same time, there's nothing I could say is actually 'bad' about it either. The dub quality is good, and the familiar voices are enjoyable for those like me who love the Devil May Cry games, and even the personalities are on point. Each episode follows a scenario where Danteis hired to do some sort of mission, leading up to at least one would-be epic fight scene, and I can't help but compare many parts to what would be seen in Cowboy Bebop, not to mention Dante being a bounty hunter himself. You might not see it the same way, but I can't help but see it as a watered-down version of Cowboy Bebop.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the show is that the fight scenes are nothing like what they should be. In an action show, the viewer's interest in supposed to peak at the heart of each episode, which in the case of Devil May Cry, is the episode's \"boss battles\". While Dante is MEANT to make his job look easy, there's no such thing as a good fight in this show. A bullet or two in the face of a demon (followed by a waterfall of Kool-Aid blood pouring out of said demon's face) is enough to defeat any enemy of Dante's. As challenging as the games are, players know that no fight is that easy. Dante is never given a challenge; he's never even touched by a single enemy. Nobody else even has the slightest chance of keeping up with him. Yeah, Dante is supposed to be badass, but the fight scenes aren't nearly as enjoyable as they should be because of every battle being played on easy mode with no chance of Dante even getting a scratch on him at any point.\\n\\n\r\nThe music isn't as loveable as I had hoped for it to be, and the visual quality is sub-par as well, but maybe that's just my high standards speaking. Being familiar with the characters, I guess I could say I was satisfied with the way they were in the show, and the day-by-day slice of life style in the episodes is a nice way for an idea like Devil May Cry to be played out, with each episode having its own story. If you're a die-hard DMC fan with tolerance for nearly any anime, there's no real reason not to check this out, but if you're expecting a great show with action to introduce you to Devil May Cry, stay away from this and go play the games... except for the terrible Ninja Theory reboot, of course.",

            "content": "Story (6) - Well, to avaluate devil may cry in this aspect is a bit hard..if we look at the anime it has almost no relation between episodes, and thats a negative point. Well, there are some connections, but the way the story goes is not directly connected, it is like each episode has is own story. By the story of all anime i give a 3. But i think each episode story is well made, so i give a 8 as an average of each episode story.\r\n(3+8)/2=5,5=6. If you like anime with good story, from the first episode to the last one, this isnot your kind of anime. I personally dont mind, and im opening for different kind of stories.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7) - Art is good, but nothing special in my opinion. Sometime it could be better, but is fine anyways, this is neither the strongest point neather the weakest.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10) - When i watched Dmc the first thing that got my attention was the opening..i liked it. Besides, character voices are good, the ending is also something great, background music is also nice. I have nothing negative to say about this aspect, so 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8) - Dante is great, and his personality  is well made. Some other suportt characters are also nice, but there are some that are not good at all. I think besides dante and 1 or 2 more, the rest is not anything special. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9) - I will only say this. i watched the first episode, and became interested in watching, and this is always a good aspect. I saw all the episodes really fast, and believe me, that is rare for me, because if it is nothing special i take more time to see all the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8) - I agree when people says that devil may cry is nothing special, i already saw much better, but i cant say it is horrible, because it isnt. Its a fine and entretaining show, not the best, but good enough to be worth of watching.",

            "content": "Story - The overall story left me wanting a bit more depth. It is borderline slice-of-life action, A wired combination and it doesn't work all that well in my opinion. There seems to be no plot going on throughout the first few episodes however the plot slowly develops a very tiny bit per episode until it reaches its climax in episode 11/12. the overall story had me a little bored however the last few episodes were some of the best anime I have ever seen. They were tense on the edge action and it is a great reward for sticking through the slow storyline.\r\nArt -The art is amazing. Defiantly something that should be admired. the art really adds to the level of depth and helps indulge the watcher in Dante's world.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Although a little repetitive at times the sound fits the anime quite well. The OP is amazing, It also has a very small role in the anime which really made me smile - I don't want to reveal too much but its usage in the last episode is amazing. The ED is almost engrish, the words change frequently which was a bit strange but the overall feel of the ED was a nice way to wind down after an action packed anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I didn't enjoy quite a few of the episodes however the last two episodes really redeemed the show. There are ups and downs and, as I have said before, everything comes together in the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Overall I liked this anime, the last episodes are amazing whilst the middle episodes (3-9) are quite boring however worth watching to see the very high tension ending.",

            "content": "Devil May Cry\r\nI saw a lot of reviews hating this anime knowing nothing about the games and not knowing this was to promote DMC4 so one should keep in mind that, and also this was made by one of the writers of the game, so his personality is the same like in the games; The anime is set chronologically between DMC1 and DMC4, showing what heppened between the gap of the two and also how Lady and Trish met; This anime was refreshing and it's different from the games, less action than what the games offer but i enjoyed it, Dante doesn't even use allhis powers and the only one that can fight and even kill Dante is Vergil but he doesn't appear here for obvious reasons and it could seem Dante is immortal, well, he's immortal even in his human form in DMC4, but the thing is, only Vergil can kill him, that's why he kills demons so easily; oh and for me this is a great anime more for the enjoyment that i had than what the story offered.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nIt follows an episodic formula in which Dante does all kind of jobs, specially killing demons and everything related with demons, he will accept the jobs so he can pay his debts, and the causing of the big amount of debts are Trish and Lady because they're always taking a share of the payment he earns without their help; Almost at the last eps. the story will continue what was left in the first two and conclude with a good story but not surprising and predictable also at the very end everyone heading to the same place, the events of DMC4.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe animation was great, there's not much to say, it was well done, the character design was surprising, i was expecting something bad just because it was different from the character design of the games but Dante looks good, i really liked it and i was wrong to think it was going to be bad just because it wasn't like the games but yeah, the art style/animation was great considering it was from 2007.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound was great, the OP, the backrgound music, the weird thing was the ED, i don't think it was fitting; The VA made a great job specially for Dante, i thought Dante's voice was going to be bad, but it was on point of who he was at that point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nBecause one writer helped to make the anime, the characters are just exactly like in the games and that's what i loved it, they didn't change it, they had the same personalities just a little changes on Lady tho and for the new characters, they were interesting, i liked that Dante had a contractor looking for jobs to offer him and i kind of liked the character of Patty, always cleaning the local and bothering him like if she was her little sister and he being cool about it. The enemies are weak but looking at the amount of enemies that appear at once or how many they appear in the whole anime, it's obvious they're not going to do anything to him, it's not even the amount that appears on any first chapter of the games but the characters were very good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nGreat enjoyment, I liked this anime because i wanted to see something different from the games, i wanted to see how Dante handles his business, how he approached the jobs, this was a refreshing turn from the games, that's why it's a 9 well, mostly for the enjoyment but the surprising animation and great sound were decisive to give it a high score despite the weak but good story.",

Many of the episodes look like one shots but everything is linked in the end. It won't confuse people who have not played the game and it won't bore those who have.\r\nMy criticism is that some of the action scenes are little cut. Dante starts fighting and a few seconds later fast forward, he's at home after winning the battle. \r\nAnother thing isn't really a critic as much as an observation, but I noticed after watching some game videos thatanime Dante is more serious then game Dante. Sure he still loves pizza and strawberry sundaes, and he's still cocky and confident, and a little cheesy; but game Dante is cheesier, louder and more cheerful. I'm not saying anime Dante is an emo, far from it, he's just quiet, practically never smiles and he takes a lot of naps. While game Dante would say &quot;This party's getting crazy! :D&quot; and proceed to beat up the bad guys while eating pizza, I honestly can't imagine anime Dante saying such a line. Fighting while eating pizza and being cocky yes, but he would instead say with a serious face &quot;it gets R rated from here.&quot;\\n\\n\r\nAs for what's new in the anime. You'll get some more information about Dante's past and certain characters who have appeared in different games will finally meet. You'll also see Dante in his day to day life. My favorites are episodes 5, 9 and 12.",

After I completerd the first episode I decided to leave it for a while, hoping that one day I would be in the mood for a stylish but brainless anime. Months later... I have realised this will not happen.\r\nThe story - or lack thereof - is disgusting. Fair enough, the DMC series never was known for its plot lines, but there is a huge difference between playing and watching (which is highlighted particularly by this anime).  I actually hadto force myself to finish the first episode. There was a basic 'transport this girl to this place' thing going on... punctuated by a bunch of demons popping up and almost killing someone,  before Dante appeared out of nowhere and killed them EVERY SINGLE TIME. There was no character development either... just a stereotypically cool Dante doing all the stylish stuff we could make him do in the games. The sound was predictable and boring - Dante listens to hard rock because he's awesome; we get it. \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing this anime does have going for it is the art. It is relatively well-presented and ultra-stylish. That really doesn't make up for how remarkably poor every other aspect of it is.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, I wish that I had discovered this anime somewhere in the middle of puberty, when I might actually have been content to kill brain cells by watching a guy shoot monsters over and over and over again. This is the only anime that I have abandoned to date. Steer clear.",

The stories are boring, the action is practically nonexistent, and Dante is more of a cameo than the main character. \r\nWho the hell is thetarget audience here?? DMC demons do not haunt the world like ghosts and manipulate people from the sidelines. They drop down from portals and immediately get in your face with claws and lasers!

It can also make you laugh at times, but rarely as this is a serious action anime with the guns and the swords and everything. All in all, enjoyment is seen in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThis is a superb anime that you may want to watch! =)",

            "content": "I finished watching the whole series last night. DMC was simply awesome! \r\nI was looking for an anime that is shonen or seinen with a genre of action and with top priority on cool graphics - so I picked Devil May Cry with a lot of hesitations. \r\nI also thought I would never watched this kind of anime because I was tired with so detailed-like graphics and animation TV series I used to watch back then. But then again I thought, I'll give it a try. Man, I was wrong! I was hooked up right after I watched the first episode. \r\nI'll break down mythoughts on the anime without giving spoilers (hopefully). :)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nWhen I watched the first episode, I said, &quot;WOW!&quot;.  The graphics left me in awe with nicely drawn characters and backgrounds. Colors used were also great - with Dante in red dress and white-grey hair of which I thought before was boring if this is his &quot;uniform&quot; but then again, I was wrong if you&rsquo;re caught up with the story.\\n\\n\r\nI give the art as 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe OP soundtrack was superb and in sync with (flashes of) characters in their little scene. I did not read that entire lyrics of the ED soundtrack but the melody was nice. \\n\\n\r\nSound effects were also superb. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, sound is top-notch and I give it 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nI like how the anime story was somewhat divided per episode but each ep was connected in reaching to the climax. I really like the last episode. It left me smiling after watching it. I like to watch more of this anime!\\n\\n\r\nI also like the fact that they employ humor in the story for the main character; though humors here are little as this anime focus on serious action. \\n\\n\r\nWhy it's not 10? Maybe because it's a short series and I would like watch more about the main character's development as he is in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt's 9/10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nI say the main characters were cool with cool moves and were nicely drawn. I even found Dante sexy. Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. :D His moves were cool and sexy especially with his guns and sword. The lead female characters were also pretty cool and sexy. \\n\\n\r\nI give them 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThe entire series is a total enjoyment for me. Pretty cool characters and their moves with top notch graphics to go with. Story is not so intricate for me but it also gives mysteries which were unfolded in the climax. \\n\\n\r\nI totally enjoyed this anime, so it&rsquo;s 10/10. 2 thumbs up!\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this to those who look for action anime with very nice graphics, cool characters, superb sound, and story in one package. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm not surprised one bit. No, really I'm not. It's a video game to anime/movie translation. Normally, these types of projects are horrible anyway. I'm sure many people know that this is based on the game of the same name, as it followed Dante completing missions by exterminating demons in some very stylish ways. Unfortunately, although the demon killing is present in the series. The greatness that was found in the games is completely lost. Those out there who sat through the Street Fighter Alpha series, Fatal Fury movies, or heaven forbid Art of Fighting. More than likely shouldn't be surprised and already have anidea on just how often the mark is missed. The only thing surprising to me is that the fans didn't outright obliterate this bullshit on release date like they did Street Fighter: Generations.\\n\\n\r\nVideo game to anime are mainly meant for one particular fan base, and that is fans of the games. However, as a fan of the game myself. I can tell you that this series doesn't do the game any justice at all, and as an anime, Devil May Cry is pretty much unwatchable. Devil May Cry has almost nothing to offer. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a dumpster load of reasons to hate this series. Right from the very beginning, I knew this series was going to be bad because Dante was given a chibi character named Patty to baby sit. This character along with many others serves absolutely no purpose, except to provide small repeated comedy relief which was never funny to begin with, and this is among the cliches that are present in this series. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are incredibly bland, and the secondary characters make appearances for no reason other than to squeeze in popular faces from the video game. Outside of the way they fight, the viewer can forget about learning anything about them. The secondary characters who make their appearances are Trish and Lady: two female fighters that aren't even slightly developed, with only very small hints about them thrown out there.\\n\\n\r\nDante is a decent character sort of yet he's very lame as well. He deals out death packing his usual two pistols with a large sword, but his full abilities are never fully displayed. Even fans of the game should come away disappointed here. Try to imagine Ryu from Street Fighter never using his ultimate attack, which would be the \"Hadoken\", and you will get the picture. In addition, I find nothing cool about a character whom fights demons, but loses to children and everybody in grown up games. Plus, has a love for cherry sundaes? It just comes off weird to me. Instead, he should be drinking beer, some fuckin' robust, full bodied, imperial stouts or some shit.\\n\\n\r\nThe direction is atrocious. The series utilizes an episodic format which happens to become quite repetitive and very predictable. Clients would appear to Dante requesting his services, and each episode ends with some type of battle with a demon. Hints at a greater plot are mentioned very early. Only to be completely dropped and never mentioned again. \\n\\n\r\nGiving a tad bit of credit where it's due. Some of the villains are somewhat interesting with decent abilities, but every last one of them are poorly used in delivering good battles. The action sequences are very boring and lack a lot of imagination. Many of the fight scenes either consist of off screen and unseen action, or are decided in one move victories. This also includes demons that are heavily hyped in to being real threats. The battles are colossal disappointments, and they are cut too short for an action oriented fan whom has binged on a lot of action anime to really be pleased. There are too many action titles out there that very far surpasses this, and I'm talking titles that pre-date this at least a decade.  The ending is every bit as unsatisfying, bland, and nonsensical, as every thing that came before it. This series is almost a bigger waste of time than Hell Girl, and that's saying a lot.\\n\\n\r\nDevil May Cry at least stands out with its production values. It definitely looks pretty, and it smoothly blends in 3-D with CG. The artwork brings the Madhouse flavor with scantily clad chicks almost baring it all, and the character designs are very faithful to their video game counterparts. I didn't find any of the designs for the demons to be impressive. Only passable at the very best. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack contains a real good opening theme, which is titled \"d.m.c.\", and quite honestly displays the best animation in the series. Plus, the ending theme is a nice song performed by Rin Oikawa called \"I'll Be Your Home\", but it's not worth sitting through 20+ minutes of bad anime to hear it. The voice work from the English cast was fine to me. Dante at times delivered some profanity filled lines, which were kind of funny. I can't comment on the Japanese cast, because I would never sit through this more than once. \\n\\n\r\nDevil May Cry is a nightmare for the anime vet and non fans of the game; but as a fan of the game, all this series does is make me want to play through the games for two reasons. Number one: to remind me that Devil May Cry really is a cool and entertaining franchise. Number two: to cleanse my mind of the vacuous tripe I've wasted my time on. I would say avoid this shit, but since it has a high rating I'm probably wasting my time.",

            "content": "Basically, Devil  May Cry is about a half demon half human who takes on a job as a Demon Hunter. If you love shiny guns, motorcycles, blood and shiny swords, this may be the anime for you.\r\nStory: (6/10)\r\nThe story isn't really bad. It has the right materials which are pretty substantial. In other words, the background of the story was great! It's very interesting; European setting, demons, Demon Hunter and so on. But then, the materials weren't used properly. So the story flow became really dull. The story development wasn't really visible. It was only until the 11th episode that the climax was drawn.And as soon as you're finally enjoying the climax, you suddenly get lost because the series has already ended. Personally, I think that the series was simply too rushed. I believe this would have been a better series if the story was more developed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe drawings are good. The proportions are great. But what I love most about this anime are the shiny guns, Dante's sword, some motorcycle scenes and the bloody scenes. Graphics' really good. The art complemented with the story and the atmosphere it was trying to give off.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (5/10)\\n\r\nSorry to say, I did not notice the sound at all. I only heard the gunshots and the dubs. Maybe it was part of the main idea of the story. But I think that more sounds would help define the atmosphere. That aside, I did NOT enjoy the OP and ED at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (6/10)\\n\r\nThe characters are interesting, but they were not developed well. The same comment as the story. They good materials but were not used well. For one thing, Dante's father and mother could have been given some light, but they weren't.The other two female characters, Lady and the girl that could use thunder could have also been given some emphasis. Simply put, there were not enough interesting flashbacks for the viewers to sympathize are empathize with.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8/10)\\n\r\nWell, it was funny and action packed. Again, you'll really enjoy this if you love guns and blood.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (7/10)\\n\r\nThough the story and characters were underdeveloped, the anime's decently enjoyable.",

So there is a lot of fun to be had as a fan seeing Dante going through these villain of the week stories. They do a good job subtly fleshing out his character, and there are some really cool concepts in play here. But the execution is just really flat. The animation is very bogstandard and rigid, which is a shame being in the hands madhouse. The main cast is as fun as ever but a lot ofthe side characters are really one note and even annoying. There are a few too many episodes that are boring. I can't help but feel disappointed, as I really enjoy this universe, but they do little to spice it up. I'd say if you wanna get into the series and experience a good story, just play Devil May Cry 3. Fans might get a kick out of some of the episodes but otherwise, it's pretty flat.",

But maybe some game like Lord of the Ring or maybe the recent Wolverine game for the PC is good. Speaking of game, now i going comment a anime that was base from one of the best game from Capcom call 'Devil May Cry' (wahhhhh.....), and how that i think about it; well, let's find out!\r\nDMC, when it say it going to become an anime; i like any other DMC player are jump forjoy for it adaption. But after going through all the 12 episode of DMC, i like any other DMC player are down with sorrow and anger that what the hell the director has done on DMC.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in this anime are all episodic, each episode are stand alone story until episode 9 or 10 where the real plot has finally started. And each episode are all the same: \\n\\n\r\n1,there is a demon case\\n\r\n2,Dante sitting around and do nothing (or maybe try to annoy Patty stupid problem) until Morrison say 'get your ass up! We got work to do, blah blah blah....'\\n\r\n3,He goes to work, have some help from Lady and Trish\\n\r\n4,He blew the work, mission accomplish and his debt is increase. The End!\\n\\n\r\nThat it! Nothing new, no plot that connected to other plot, zero! Until episode 9 or 10.\\n\\n\r\nSure you have character like Dante, Lady, and Trish to be animated here, and you do have character only for this anime, like Patty, she has been on the series since episode only has 'finally' been serve as a important character on episode 9 or 10, for the rest of the episode she just serve as a annoying brat! And Morrison, Dante agent always try to bring him a good job but end getting mess up by Dante.\\n\\n\r\nFor Dante, Lady, and Trish (i still want make a comment on them!), Dante still Dante, like pizza and strawberry, and weild Ebony & Ivory and Rebellion to fight off demon. And the funny thing is, he use his gun more than his sword! Even the director finally let him use it, the sword battle are just temporary! But Trish and Lady still play their role where they supposed to be, to support Dante and take Dante credit!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is good, no less. The shading and everything was good. Even the bike scene in episode 2 are well done. Plus the OP of the series was nice, able to blend in the series as well. But the ED (though i didn't listen that often) was smooth and relax.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the credit for us finishing DMC anime? Zero!\\n\r\nWhat is the credit for them finishing DMC anime?Promoting DMC4!\\n\r\nWhat is the credit for us buying DMC anime DVD?More DMC4 bonus!\\n\\n\r\nAnd in my opinion, this bonus are come to nothing and pointless after the real thing is out. The anime just bring down Dante good point and completely destroy the DMC atmosphere. And DMC is not the only one being anime, other like 'Tales of...', '.Hack' did make the series well and on going. And heck, even the live action Resident Evil movie was better than this!\\n\\n\r\nThat why product movie, animation, comic or anything that is base on something are mostly not a good thing!",

            "content": "Devil May Cry is something I desperately hoped would turn out great. Most things based off a video game- whether it be a movie, a book, or even an anime- are damned to fail. So for Devil May Cry, based on the video games of the same title, my hopes were that this work might succeed in its attempt to become a great anime. They might have been foolish, selfish wishes, but I wished that it at least would at least try.\r\nWas this anime as good as it could have been? The general consensus is no, as it seems. Why? To illustrate how an animebecomes boring, a list, featuring Devil May Cry:\\n\\n\r\n1. Dante doesn\u2019t have flaws.\\n\r\nIf he does, they barely exist. He\u2019s a freaking blank slate. He always defeats every demon in his way, EVERY TIME. Conflict? What conflict. If there isn\u2019t anyone he can\u2019t kill, then why even bother watching. Even Dante is aware of his extreme powers, and is constantly bored by his opponents. If he\u2019s bored, we\u2019re bored. You won\u2019t be at the edge of your seat, because you know he can defeat whoever comes his way. It\u2019s healthy to have the character lose once in a while, because it keeps the audience on edge. It\u2019s permissible to never have the characters lose, but at least let them break a sweat. If Dante ever breaks a sweat, which he won\u2019t, it\u2019ll be the cool kind, like a strawberry sundae oozing down his face or a pizza slice breaking out of his pores and sliding with a greasy trail down to his- scratch that, that\u2019s disturbing. I actually wanted Dante to lose or die in the end, because it would be a major twist from the usual formula of \u2018I can\u2019t defeat this guy\u2026 just kidding\u2019 that Dante relies on all too often. It\u2019s a level of boring that can only be matched by watching plastic grass grow. \\n\\n\r\n2. Being something all the time = boring.\\n\r\nDante should not be cool 24/7. It gets boring and grating to watch. He\u2019s cool when he sleeps. He\u2019s cool when he eats his cool food. He\u2019s cool when he walks all alone in the dark, in his cool outfit with his cool sword and cool shiny guns strapped to him and his cool poker face. He walks out of a fight without even a single speck of soil landing on his clothes and his hair immaculate. The coolness is great at first, but after the same thing all the goddamn time, you might even find yourself switching to \u201cMars of Destruction\u201d instead of this crap. At least you can laugh at MoD.\\n\\n\r\n3. The plot comes at the last minute.\\n\r\nLook at the picture for Devil May Cry. Go ahead, look at it. The white haired guy in front, as you probably know, is Dante. The other two guys are central to the plot, but show up at the next to last episode. That means the rest of the time was spent on NOTHING. The rest of the time is spent on Patty, who is basically Ciel\u2019s fianc\u00e9 Elizabeth from Kuroshitsuji mixed with Renge from Ouran High School Host Club. If you don\u2019t know who those people are, the mishmash would be a grotesque mass of blonde hair, clingy personality, no point, and a really annoying tendency to appear at the worst times. That\u2019s Patty for you, a girl who should\u2019ve left after the first episode, but stuck around just to add another element of suck to the DMC headquarters.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we\u2019ve got that out of the way, more about the plot. The plot is so rushed into the ending that they shouldn\u2019t have even bothered. Most of the anime is just one episode dramas which have zero conflict because as I said before, Dante doesn\u2019t lose. Ever. Devil May Cry is about Dante and friends having wonderful romps through their zany adventures of killing bloodthirsty demons. And Patty\u2019s there too, I guess. It wasn\u2019t very good, it\u2019s very obvious it was based off a video game. There\u2019s really no explanation of anything- I would have loved to hear the limitations of the demons, the limitations of Dante, or how Devil May Cry got started. Nobody gets that much of a backstory, no rules of the universe are explained, and no real emotional ties between characters are developed. It\u2019s cripplingly average. The majority of the anime is Dante strutting around eating his strawberry sundaes and pizza and beer while shooting demons. It\u2019s not very fun once you get passed the first episode.\\n\r\nOn the technical side, it\u2019s obvious that they did do a bit of demonology research, evidenced by names such as Baal, Modeus, and Dante. That, however, is to be expected and it\u2018s not very impressive.\\n\\n\r\nMoving right along to the art, there are a few things that need to be said about the dreaded art. It\u2019s blasphemous to see an otherwise gorgeous characters massacred by unsavory art. Dante\u2019s really hot, but you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell because the damn animation could turn caviar into feces with a garnish of roadkill. Trish the sexbomb was reduced to Trish the kill-it-with-fire bomb. Lady went from looking like Meagan Fox to looking like something a fox just killed. The animation\u2019s boxy and has a freaking ugly style. However, it gets a four because it\u2019s not bad enough to deter you from watching the series. Most of the other things might.\\n\\n\r\nRight about here\u2019s where characters are discussed, and it\u2019s a real shame that they\u2019re basically cardboard cut outs with traits slapped on to them. In fact, each character can be described in one sentence without fear of missing a personality aspect. They are all so flat that pieces of soggy paper say to their children, \u201cHoney, some day you\u2019ll be like Dante.\u201d\\n\r\nDante isn\u2019t the only character at fault here. Lady is a chick who basically fills the screen when the animators take a break from Dante\u2019s face, Patty is a chick who is there for comic relief, but it\u2019s more like comic agony, and Trish is the girl who\u2019s supposed to be really hot, but as I said before, the fault lies in the sub par animation. It\u2019s notable that Patty is one of the few original (to this anime) characters here. The actual demons are transparent and you can see their explanations for their actions coming from a mile away (I wanted to battle the infamous Dante, I need to prove myself to master, I knew your father, etc).\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the whole thing was okay. It was just alright. The choices were very obvious, like \u201cDANT\u2019S BAD@ZZ SO OBVSLY HE LURVES ROCKNROLL OMG LOL!!!1\u201d It\u2019s sickeningly mediocre rock, by the way. Nothing particularly hardcore.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the enjoyment, if you watch DMC, watch it for the ride. If you get tired of the same cool shtick over and over then watch a few episodes and don\u2019t finish it, the ending does not carry a great payoff. Otherwise, I recommend this anime to those who are intrigued by badassery and badassery alone.",

            "content": "A lot of gamers are, at least, familiar with Capcom's Devil May Cry. The franchise is pretty beloved, except for that reboot one where Dante had dark hair and was, objectively, a piece of shit. In 2007, after the third instalment but before the fourth, our old friends at Madhouse started releasing an anime based off of the games. That's right, the studio that brought us such adaptations as X-men, Metropolis, and FF Legend of the Crystals was behind this. Well, maybe this one isn't a pile of garbage like those were. Well, except Metropolis. It was just sub-par. \r\nStory:\r\nWe open with Morrison bringing Dantea job. Now, you might find yourself asking \u201cwho the hell is  Morrison?\u201d He's an original character who basically exists to bring Dante work and, occasionally, drive him around. The job is simple, Dante just has to safely escort a young orphan girl to the estate of the deceased father she never met to claim her inheritance. Naturally, she's being hunted by demons. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those anime where the underlying plot is pretty light and most episodes are just doing their own thing. Dante gets a job that somehow involves demons and then he goes out to slay them. In fact, the weakest part of the series is the big underlying plot. You get little snippets of it in quite a few episodes, but it ultimately involves a lot of contrivance and it's just not very good in general. Even the ongoing stuff that's meant to draw your attention to the fact that something is afoot is largely just dull and really obvious. To the point where it's just \u201cthis again\u201d after a few times. The episodes also have a general problem of trying way too hard to give happy endings. To the point where they can just go completely off the rails and not make much sense. There are quite a few episodes that set things up for sad or, at the very least, bitter-sweet endings and then pull happy ones out of their anuses. I guess I missed the memo about DMC being for small children who can't process tragedy on account of the PEGI 16 ratings. \\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, a lot of the episodic scenarios are pretty interesting. Varied too. Yeah, you know that Dante is going to fight some demon,  but there's a lot of variation in what kinds of demons he'll fight and how they'll approach. Some of them use stealthy approaches or try to use guile, others prefer the direct approach. Some are after him specifically, others just happen to stumble upon him while going about their terrible business. And some of the scenarios are really intricate. The death poker game being a prime example. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters from the games, Dante, Trish & Lady are all portrayed pretty true to character. Which is more than a certain reboot managed. In terms of original characters, some of the ones Dante encounters on his missions are kind of interesting. Others are pretty mediocre. Then we have our reoccurring Ocs, Morrison & Patty. Morrison is a boring character. We don't know why he's bringing Dante jobs, how they met or anything beyond \u201che brings Dante jobs.\u201d He's pretty much on par with the plot coupon guy from your average PreCure series. And those can get by with it because they are actually for children. Then we have Patty. Have you ever wondered what Devil May Cry would be like if Dante had a slightly annoying child sidekick? No? Well, it's not the best decision that Madhouse could have made. She spends a lot of time pestering Dante, having to be rescued and contributing virtually nothing. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is pretty decent. The characters look like themselves and Madhouse clearly made an effort to make the aesthetic look like DMC. The demon designs are generally pretty good as well. The trouble is that the action sequences themselves aren't all that good. In a series that relies heavily on action sequences. A lot of the \u201cbig\u201d Dante fights end very quickly without having much content. And a lot of the sequences focus heavily on scenes of Dante attacking while not showing, or barely showing, his opponent. It would've benefited from showing them striking at one another in the same frames a bit more, is what I'm saying. Oh, and expect a lot of deaths to go the blood fountain route. I guess demon blood streams are highly pressurised. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe series did get some good voice actors. We've got Morikawa Toshiyuki as Dante. Yes, Dante and Sephiroth are the same guy. We all suspected it given the resemblance. We've got Orikasa Fumiko and Tanaka Atsuko, both of whom are damn good actresses, as Lady and Trish respectively. Even the less interesting characters got some decent voices. The musical score by Hama Takeshi & Tsutsumi Hiroaki is pretty close to fantastic. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't any, really. The closest you're going to get is Lady and Trish forming a friendship. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nDevil May Cry is an anime that had some potential. After all, there's a lot to work with from the games. Unfortunately, it's held back by a dull underlying plot, trying too hard to provide happy endings, the slightly annoying child sidekick and mundane action sequences. Ultimately, I'd still say it's all right  but it certainly could have been better. My final rating is a 6/10. Next week we'll continue video game month with a look at Street Fighter Alpha.",

Oh well...too late. \r\nStory:\r\nNo plot. Seriously. There is no plot in this anime. Now I don't know what the video game is like so I won't dwell into it, but I was very disappointed in the fact this this anime, as good as it looks, lacked a simple plot. It was only 'filler' and 'subplot' episodes until at least the last two episodes. I just wished it came close to what my friend told me aboutinstead of this bull. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nSaved by the art. It's wasn't bad really. The style was especially interesting, and there wasn't bright colours to make my head spin. Overall, the anime and art style was relatively calm.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nSame as the art. Wasn't too, too bad. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nNow I know something is missing. I did look up the DMC wiki after I watched and realized they were missing a huge chunk of characters. Too bad since I was so interested in meeting Dante's brother and learning more about his past. But aside from a lazy, demon demon slayer, and a little girl who can't keep her mouth shut, they both seem like the typical demon and human tag team you would see in any other anime. In short, it's nothing new. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: \\n\\n\r\nIt was fine. I enjoyed the random parts and I am a fan of white haired anime guys, but it was too short for my tasting. I just wished they animated more. \\n\\n\r\nI give this anime 55% on the giant sword scale. \\n",

            "content": "Badass half-human half-devil? That's Dante your talking about. Devil May Cry made its name first on games. Its really popular on game consoles, because a hack and slash game that's so detailed like DMC doesn't come quite often. And in 2007 they made an anime adaptation of it.\r\nStory : 8\r\nFirst of all, if you have no idea what Devil May Cry is. Its the name of a shop that Dante owns, a half-human half-devil who specializes on doing missions concerning devils. The story does not much differ from the game, Dante is still running his shop. But this time, he started helping a little girlnamed Patty. Who ends up staying at his shop. It doesn't really focus on Patty though. Every episode he completes different missions. The last two episodes are the longest mission he'll be doing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8\\n\r\nArt was great, the series was aired in 2007. And I'd say that it has better art than most of the 2007's animes. Well they did use a lot of CG's on it, since it has quite a lot action scenes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8\\n\r\nDante is your badass devil hunter, he has two handy dandy guns named Ebony and Ivory. And the sword Rebellion, which Sparda his father gave him. I kinda hoped that more characters from the game were used. Too bad some of the more badass characters in the game weren't shown on the series. But! Two of the supporting characters at the game were shown, Lady and Trish. Lady is a human devil hunter like Dante, and Trish is Dante's old partner at the shop. And the new characters shown on the series were pretty quite good too. Patty is your resident loli maid that lives in the shop. She's too damn cute.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic : 7\\n\r\nNot much to mention on music. The ending theme is quite good though. The opening theme is just instrumentals, I didn't bother listening to it though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8\\n\r\nThe series is short; so I quite enjoyed it myself, since I've been a fan of DMC ever since I've played it. If you loved the game, this definitely won't waste your time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8\\n\r\nOverall, the animation didn't quite hit like the game. But for me? It was worth my time, many games that were adapted to anime suck real bad. But DMC is quite OK for me though. I might be biased since I loved the game. But anyway, all in all you wouldn't enjoy this series if you haven't played any of the games. Since the series didn't bother telling who or what is Dante, and you surely want to know how DMC started. And its a must to know who Dante is, there's more to him than being a badass devil hunter. You'd love to know his history more. I highly recommend playing any DMC games or googling it if you don't have the time to play any of it. JACKPOT.\\n",

So very many mindless fight scenes, complete with copious levels of gore.Now, don't get me wrong, I like fight scenes, and I can see why an anime based on an action game would want to have a lot of fight scenes. Butwhen the fight scenes preclude any form of storytelling, as they do in Devil May Cry, then I can't see the justification in making an anime series at all.\\n\\n\r\nI do have to give credit where credit is due, though. Despite all of its many faults, Devil May Cry is very well animated. The fight scenes and action sequences, countless as they are, are all fluidly animated.

            "content": "Devil May Cry as a franchise needs no introduction. Debuting in the early days of the sixth generation of consoles, the original Devil May Cry was the game that defined the Hack N\u2019 Slash genre, which has more or less become the successor to the Beat Em\u2019 Up genre. It told the story of the demon hunter Dante (A Half Demon himself and the son of the legendary Dark Knight Sparda) as his quest trough Mallet Island to kill the demon that killed his mother and brother. While the game has aged, I still think it holds up just fine.\r\nIt was also a massive success.It ended up getting a disappointingly bad second game, a fantastic third game, a pretty good fourth game, a middle of the road reboot and most recently an apparently fantastic fifth game (I say apparently as I currently don\u2019t have enough money to buy it. Definitely doing so once I get the chance, though). However that\u2019s not all. It also received novels (None of which I have read) a prequel Manga for the third game (Which I also haven\u2019t read) and the subject of this review: A 12 episode anime by Studio Madhouse. So how did it turn out? Let\u2019s find out.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nTaking place between the first and second games (Originally the first and fourth game but Capcom recently decided to retcon the timeline so that the second game happens after the second game instead of before) the Anime can best be described as the DMC answer to a Slice Of Life show. As in, you get to see what Dante\u2019s everyday life consists of: Killing Demons. Thus the plot is mostly episodic, with the ongoing plot not really presenting itself until the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThere are both benefits and downsides to this kind of storytelling. On the one hand, every episode stands out, with each having its own identity and charm. And truth be told, most of these episodes are enjoyable. Sadly, its issue ends up being one BIG problem: There\u2019s no tension. Since this is set in the height of Dante\u2019s Demon Hunting career, there\u2019s next to no challenge he can\u2019t take on with no problems whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue is just that once the actual ongoing plot presents itself, it\u2019s honestly not that interesting. It\u2019s not awful or anything, but overall I don\u2019t think it lived up to all the buildup it got. Overall, the plot is just not particularly great. I will however say that I did actually enjoy myself. Overall, the spirit of the games is mostly present here, and at the very least, I can say I\u2019ve seen far worse.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOnly three characters from the games appear: Dante (Obviously) Trish (Dante\u2019s maybe love interest, maybe mother figure) and Lady (A Tsundere). All of them are more or less how they are seen in the games, and overall it is fun to see them bounce off each other. I also found the running gag of Dante never paying for his pizza to be rather hilarious. We don\u2019t get to see as much depth to their characters as in the games (Well, mostly for Dante and Lady as Trish barely had a personality to begin with), but as a side story it\u2019s perfectly fine\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is less notable. Patty is your attraction for all the lolicons out there, and she\u2019s harmless enough so I don\u2019t have much else to say about her other than she and Dante do have some rather amusing interactions. Morrison is a decent enough foil to Dante, and he was at the very least notable enough to eventually get a cameo in the games (Why he has a different race is a completely different question).\\n\\n\r\nFinally is the main villain Sid who is\u2026 interesting. He seems like Arius from the second game, except that whereas I\u2019m pretty sure we were supposed to take Arius seriously, I can\u2019t quite say the same for this guy. Still though, he does ultimately prove himself to be one of the few threats in this show, so you have to give him that much.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThe show looks okay. It reminds me a lot of Fate/Stay Night 2006, in that there just isn\u2019t much movement. I am overall more forgiving of it here as they not only tried to at least hide it, but the show does overall stay on-model almost all of the time. Also I do overall like this artstyle. It feels like an updated take on the first game\u2019s artstyle, which does work with the setting. And there are a few moments here and there that are well animated, so there\u2019s that.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is similarly okay. I only really noticed three or so tracks overall (Not counting variations on said tracks) but they all fit the mood and work quite well. The only thing to mention is that the Opening, \u201cD.M.C.\u201d, is freaking awesome!\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is pretty decent. Morikawa Toshiyuki, Tanaka Atsuko and Orikasa Fumiko had their debuts as Dante, Trish and Lady in this show, and they were all pretty good, enough so that once the games started getting Japanese dubs, they were carried over (And also Hirata Hiroaki as Vergil from Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3 but that\u2019s a different story). Similarly the extras are comprised of similarly big name actors, like Yuzuki Ryouka, Miki Shinichiro, Okomura Akemi, Nakata Joji, Fukuen Misato, Park Romi and the Late Great Nozawa Naichi.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn\u2019t much to say about this show. It\u2019s not bad or anything, but it doesn\u2019t have enough to be considered great. It\u2019s entertaining and not much else. I can only really recommend it to fans of the games (Especially since it is canon), otherwise, I can only recommend it as a curiosity.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "Devil May Cry... I wouldn't say it was a huge disappointment, since I really expected very little of a storyline - which on par with my expectations, turned out to be none at all. Having watched only 8 of the 12 episodes I only percieve there to be some kind of good dramatic twist toward the end with some kind of storyline relevance that isn't all about Dante weilding his sword & guns like a \"badass\" as shown in all previous games & so on; sadly I came to notice a lot of the fight scenes were rather tedious or cut short & a fewof the episodes seemed pointless.\\n\\n\r\nThe art has shown for the majority to be good (some was rather horrible). I found the female characterization to be rather poor, an example being Lady - she was a lot more cocky & less modest in the anime in comparison to the 3rd game where she appeared most (perhaps being in Dante's company for too long turned her into his female equivalent?). That being said I was never really fond of the females in the games either, Lady was probably the better though (until DMC4). \\n\\n\r\nMoving on.\\n\\n\r\nI did however, enjoy the every-so-often cursing which would seem to fit with Dante's personality very well. The sound & soundtrack never really caught my ear, & I have a real ear for music. The only music I honestly enjoyed was the Opening Theme. \\n\\n\r\nDespite my better judgement, I still give this anime it's props.\\n\r\nI had no high expectations so I wasn't exactly disappointed in the least. It's alright to watch Dante jump around acting like the cool guy - afterall, he is known for it. All in all I'm enjoying it, for the most part.",

            "content": "I love the Devil May Cry games (although, to be honest, I haven\u2019t played its second installment). And, wandering hopelessly on the web, I found out it has an anime adaptation. Too bad for me though, only finding out about it just lately.\r\nWith me, who has played the Devil May Cry games, I had high expectations with this. \r\nStory: (6/10)\r\nIt's your typical cartoon series: it has no sequence, no continuity. You can watch the first few episodes in random order and find no differences in each. I recommend you watch episodes 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 before watching episodes 10-12. It'd be less depressingthat way. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (8/10)\\n\r\nAnimation's good. It has has that Devil May Cry feel, but a little milder. Gun animations are pretty cool too. Motorcycles, slashes, etc. are all good. one thing you'd hate about it though is that you will witness less the action unlike that in the games. Also, Dante's anime features is pretty accurate.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\r\nOkay. Maybe I'm exaggerating on this one, or maybe I'm not. Sounds were amazing and believable. They have convinced me that this 'thing' is slashed, or the gun has fired, or a person's walking. Also, the opening theme was one of the best musical scores I've heard from an anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (6/10)\\n\r\nDante's overall cool-and-mysterious-that-somehow-still-finds-a-way-to-be-hilarious characteristics made an episode worth watching. Also, at first, I didn't like Patty and Morrison. But Patty's story was moving, and Morrison's pretty cool. But, it's not that I don't want to see them, it's just that I wanted to see somebody else. Like Lady and Trish for example, who, if I might add, were just worthless the whole story. I mean, sure, Lady makes more money with her heterochromic eyes, and Trish is this bad ass chic who controls electricity. But, no. They weren't as interesting as they were in the games. It's like they were never there at all. I also wanted too see Virgil, and the Devil Trigger in its full capacity. Too bad, I didn't.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (7/10)\\n\r\nIf you're going to ask me if it really is enjoyable, yes. It is enjoyable. Patty's fun to watch especially when she nags around Dante. Cool, although minimal, fight scenes will reel you in. Comedy was not too forced. I have said this earlier, but some episodes would just blow you off. That made it less interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIt was Stylish! (EP12). Overall, it\u2019s actually pretty good. It had boring instances, but only a few. If you haven't played the game, you should watch it. If you have, then it'd be your choice. Other than the upsetting parts of the anime, it still has that Devil May Cry feel, especially when Dante becomes all cool and turns on his swag. It\u2019s worth watching.\\n",

The anime is not like the games, this time Dante doesn't face a personal affair/important mission like in the games. This is Dante'sday by day, his normal life, and this is what people doesn't seem to understand.\\n\\n\r\nAlso a lot of complains come about how Dante defeats demons and I would like to ask: What do you expect? the anime takes place directly after DMC1, Dante has already defeated Mundus who's the Prince Of Darkness and master of demons, do you really think that's gonna be easy to find some enemy equal to that? and if that would be the case Capcom would save it for the games and not use it in a promotional anime.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the anime itself Madhouse did a great job as always. The art is beautiful with great coloring, music is great and characters representations are very accurate, I'm glad to good to see some DMC1 Dante attitude instead of the constant flippant DMC3-4 one.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before if you're just gonna watch it for the action then don't even bother, the target of the anime are the true fans of DMC.",

Basically it's them doing missions and being very clich\u00e9.\r\nThe animation wasbeautiful in my opinion. I fell in love with the way they drew dante *0* he's pure eye candy! The scenery was drawn beautifully aswell.\\n\\n\r\nFor once in my life LOVE the dub! I prefer the dub!  Reuben Langdon's voice is perf.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this anime version a whole lot.

The story of the anime didn't really have much ties with the games, but that's actually favorable so that the average anime viewer can understand what's going on. \r\nSo, the story: Dante, a badass demon that slays demons, tries to kill a guy that is trying to destroy the world. The story is rather weak, but isn't boring, but it is mostly fillers. \r\nThe fight scenes were really disappointing, because Dante mostly beats all the enemies in one hit without using his devil trigger. \r\nDante ,like always ,is awesome and alwayshas the best cheesy but witty one-liners.\\n\\n\r\nBy now, you'll probably be thinking to yourself why you wasted so much time reading this poorly-written review. You will by now have also guessed that i am not a professional critic. To that I reply you are right. Anyway this anime was pleasant, but definitely not a masterpiece, so watch it if you can, or get DMC1 or 3 (the games) and play them, because they are masterpieces.",

            "content": "The first thing I asked myself after watching Devil May Cry was: \"How hard is it to make a DMC anime?\", I mean, the story of the games isn't really that complicated, it's basically about a badass Demon Hunter who enjoys eating pizza and some evil demons who wanna fuck around with him, and you don't even need to scratch your head too much to realize how you can adapt the gameplay into the animation, it's a hack 'n slash game for christ's sake, just make him fight some demons and be cool, maybe put some really crazy weapons into the mix, and some pumpingawesome rock tracks, and you might just have a great action anime, but that's not the case with Devil May Cry, it can't even get the hack 'n slash part right.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the plot, it is set between the events of DMC1 and DMC4, but it's not like that really matters. Most of the episodes (8 of them actually) are structured in an episodic format, basically showing Dante doing some type of contract for a costumer, be it a desperate wife or the brother of a biker that died during a race, which generally involve him killing some random demon that murdered someone important to this person. The episodes that are not individual stories focus around this weird demon guy named Sid and his plan to receive the powers of the demon lord Abigail, while also giving away some other details about the demon world and Sparda.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't really mind that the episodes were mostly separate stories, but most of them are really boring and uninteresting, and I think the main reason for this is that the anime doesn't really have that much fighting in it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that an anime can only be good if there's lots of fights in it, but, dude, this is DMC, if you're not going to put lots of fights and demon slashing in it (and why the hell wouldn't you?), than at least make the side characters and stories interesting.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, Dante is still as funny and badass as he used to be, the same goes for Trish and Lady, who also make an appearance in this show, I even like the new characters they introduced. Sure, Patty can be annoying sometimes, but it's aways great so see her bitching at Dante telling him to get his lazy ass off the chair and do some work, and Morrisson is just cool in general, I think it's because of the mustache. The problem with these characters is that, while they're pretty cool and likable when they're alone or interacting with each other, the same doesn't go for when they're interacting with the side characters or the enemies. None of these characters could make me feel interested in the story or what was going on, with a few exceptions here and there, and these were mainly because the plot lines were sort of interesting, and there is no tension to be had if the enemies you fight feel like soldiers from a Dynasty Warriors game. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost every single fight in this anime is resolved within 2-3 minutes or less, it depends if Dante decides to use his pistols or if Trish and Lady are there to help him. It just makes enemies look like they're no big deal, even when they're 4 times Dante's size. \\n\\n\r\nIt's just makes me feel so disappointed everytime the anime decides to show some fighting, because they're actually pretty cool. The animation is fluid and it looks great, and besides one or two fights that just involve Dante shooting demons 'till they explode, the choreography of the fights is really good, It's just a shame that there is so little of them in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department is also good. The opening does a pretty good job of setting the mood for the rest of the episode, and the fact that it is also used in almost every fight in this anime is not a bad thing. Besides the opening the rest of the songs are ok, with the exception of \"Future in my Hands\", the main theme for the sixth episode, \"Rock Queen\", that really stands out from the rest of the tracks, possibly being the best song present in this anime's soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't consider DMC to be a bad anime, it's just sort of misguided. They could have done so much more with what they had here and instead they lamed it out. There are some few moments of pure enjoyment here and there, but most of the time you'll only be mildly interested in what's going on in the screen at best.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL RECOMMENDATION: If you're a fan of the games, then give this a try, it's still fun to see Dante kicking some ass, but if you're not, well, you might wanna watch something else.",

            "content": "Since I\u2019m a huge fan of entire Devil May Cry series this review may be a bit biased. Actually, thanks to this exact anime my whole interest in this fandom began. I got some dvds from my friend who didn\u2019t have time to watch them. And there was Devil May Cry anime, unfortunately only the first episode. But it was enough to get me in. I downloaded the rest as soon as I could and started watching.\r\nI wasn\u2019t much of a anime watcher then. I knew only several anime, but none of them like Devil May Cry. And to be honest, I still haven\u2019t foundanything similar enough.\\n\\n\r\nDevil May Cry is a series of 10 short stories, which have nothing in common except the main characters of Dante, Patty and Morrison, and some others. But then suddenly, we come onto episode 11 and everything stars to make sense! The stories in fact have been essential for the main plot which appears in two last episodes. Well, episode 12 is basically the final fight only, so not of a plot there. The stories themselves are different, some are better some weaker but for me each of them was interesting enough to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI know that most of DMC fans don\u2019t like the anime, for the creation of Dante. And I don\u2019t blame them; it\u2019s true that Dante\u2019s personality\u2019s been deformed more than \u2018a bit\u2019. But, still, maybe because it was the beginning for me, I like it. The first time I watched it a year ago, and since then I played DMC, DMC3 and DMC4, read mange and huge amount of fanfiction. A few days ago I watched it again, to make sure that I love it as I loved it then.\\n\\n\r\nAs I see it\u2019s getting mostly weak scores, but from me it\u2019s 10. I\u2019m absolutely enchanted by the DMC world, anime art, Dante\u2019s personality (the active part of it, not the one that could be sleeping all day long), guns and generally fights. In any other anime I didn\u2019t find such a good looking main character with a gun and an oversized sword. And therefore I dare to say there isn\u2019t a single anime resembling DMC, its world, characters and weapons.\\n",

It was exactly like the time  I watched fate zero where in the end I curse the studio not for making a literal shit-show of a show but making it look promising to lure you in and scalp you like an Italian con artist. So let's get on it shall we before the hoards of fate zero fanatics lynch me for my comment\r\nEssentially DMC has a lot in common with hellsing ultimate in terms of visuals. Butthat is all there is to it. In fact the only good thing one can say about the show Is that its got great visuals. Detailed characterization \\n\r\n, profound character development, superb far reaching storyline, riveting action scenes and intense music that hits you right to the core, all the things that made Hellsing Ultimate so much more than a run of the mill action show? If you hate those than this is the show for you\\n\\n\r\nFirst off its got exactly zero plot.The first 9 episodes have almost no connection with each other and only pretends to be furthering the plot. The characters are a huge disappointment. Dante is cool just because he's Dante and that's really all there is to him. He's stupidity overpowered, so much so that you'd think an asteroid could hit the earth and it wouldn't even ruffle his ultra stylish attire. He's got more superpowers than Superman including but not limited to coming back from the dead, crossing through separate worlds without help, being the coolest guy to ever inhabit the earth and of course  being so above anyone and everyone  that you question  the fact why Dante isn't  president prime minster admiral general Dante of earth. You have lady who's a badass though not on Dantes level Couse well because he's Dante. Trish who doesn't get any screentime, patty the quintisential loli and Morrison a gruff agent who's character is better developed that Dantes to be frank. \\n\r\nSo here's the catch. DMC takes a plethora of great characters and totally wastes them.\\n\\n\r\n But that only the tip of the iceberg I'm afraid Couse you're probably saying what do we need character development for in an action anime!!, Some good fight scenes and popcorn is what I'm looking for not the bloody  \"Paradise lost \" you pseudo intellectual ass. But therein my friends lays the greatest disappointment. There's absolutely no bloody action. In fact Dante is so stupidly overpowered that even the climactic season finale battle has only about a minute's worth of fighting most of which is surprise surprise Dante being cool. There is no fight scene that requires Dante swing his sword more that thrice.It makes you think it'll get good right after this and before you know it you've wasted 6 hours of your life. An alternative title to the show could be \"cool dude is so cool nothing and no one else matters.",

As a half demon \u2013 half human, he uses his trusty sword \u2013 Rebellion \u2013 and his two guns \u2013 Ebony and Ivory \u2013 to take on missions. Dante owns and runs an odd job called \u201cDevil May Cry\u201d, a business thatspecialises in hunting and killing demon-related or supernatural problems. The series is based on the game series which goes by the identical name.\\n\\n\r\nPlot Rating \u2013 5.0/10.0\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tArt and Animation \u2013\\n\r\nThe art style and animation in DmC is good, compared to any other animation or artwork seen in any anime aired during the 2006-07s. Since it is based on a gaming series originally, the artists and the animators have kept this in mind to give the characters a bit different appearance from the normal or traditional anime style. The artwork resembles that seen in the anime movies \u2013 Bayonetta: Bloody Fate and to an extent Dante\u2019s Inferno: An Animated Epic and the animation is praiseworthy. However, the series advocates much of gory content, which makes it unsuitable for watchers of every age.\\n\\n\r\nRating for Art and Animation \u20136.0/10.0\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tDialogues and Voice Casting \u2013\\n\r\nThe dialogues are pretty well-framed, so as to give the characters their personalities, which are individually reflected in the most efficient manner, judging by the manner of presentation of thoughts, which the characters adopt throughout the series while carrying out conversations among themselves. However, in a few instances, it is seen that the usage of explicit language has been supported throughout the episode, which makes it unsuitable for kids to be viewed, again.\\n\\n\r\nScript \u2013 5.0/10.0\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tOverall Review \u2013\\n\r\nThe TV series of DmC is based on the originally released gaming series by Capcom, which goes by the same name. However, 12 episodes, each highlighting a separate mission is supposedly not enough for the entire story line of the actual series to get covered up. In my opinion, a second season at the least was expected, since the season 01 has failed to portray a few other important characters such as Nero and Virgil. Moreover, Dante\u2019s relations / history with his father Lady, Sparda and Trish weren\u2019t highlighted much in the series except for a bit of references given in a few particular episodes. These drawbacks have brought about a bit of disappointment, although the series as a whole makes a fair watch, undoubtedly.\\n\\n\r\nFor the aforementioned drawbacks, my personal rating out of 10.0 \u2013 5.0/10.0\\n\r\nAverage Rating \u2013 6.0/10.0",

Weather your wanting to watch this show as a fan of the games or a fan of anime this suits both parties. Don\u2019t have to high expectations the show doesn\u2019t do anything revolutionary, but it is good. Very Hellsing mixed with Claymore and if you haven\u2019t seen those shows go watch Hellsing ultimate\u2026you don\u2019t have to watch Claymore though that one needs help. To be honest in DMC I wish that the story almost solely revolved around him, but there is a boring support character that keepsshowing up and if you want character development your out of luck, but just because those things are bad, it doesn\u2019t mean it ruins the show. So go watch Dante be a badass and just enjoy yourself.  \\n",

            "content": "Story & Plot- 5/10\r\nIn a word the story and overall plot is poor, at best. The individual \u201ccase\u201d or \u201cmission\u201d episodes were a great way to hold the attention of the viewer and add variation, but would have been better suited to a series of more length. As it were, 12 episodes is far too short to hold a structure like that, much less to keep that form until the final few episodes. Yes, there were several underlying characteristics which could be argued to point to the end, but only to the untrained eye. Even if the form was flawed, it is refreshing to seean anime take an episode-by-episode approach.\\n\r\n\tSound & Music- 5/10\\n\r\nThe music is obviously meant to excite the viewer, but the overuse of intense and somewhat violent rock music in every other scene gets old, fast, and leaves the viewer (or me, at the very least) tired of having their ears shredded every time a main character does something remotely cool. The dub and sub versions have some flaws, such as timing and portrayal of enthusiasm, but overall are average. Both the OP and ED left no lasting impression, falling somewhat flat. \\n\r\n\tArt & Visual Appeal- 5/10\\n\r\nThe art isn\u2019t bad, but it isn\u2019t good either. It is smooth at times, and awkward at others. The lighting is done well to set mood, and so is the use of color schemes, for the most part.\\n\r\n\tCharacters & Character Development- 5/10\\n\r\nThe characters are what they are meant to be: fun, suave, witty, and bad*ss. Other than the several characters which are the focus of the series, the rest feel to be nothing but walking puppets superimposed with stereotypes. There is little development, which is disappointing but fitting for the series at the same time. There is a bit of backstory given for the main character, Dante, but it is laughably cliched and underwhelming, not to mention poorly executed despite the entire episode gven to its development. The other characters? They simply do not have a backstory. \\n\r\n\tStyle- 4/10\\n\r\nThe series is over the top and does not possess much \u201cfinesse,\u201d overall. There are some select moments which do not follow that form, but often a witty line or something of the sort which is well used the first time is overused to the point of causing annoyance. (The line \u201cthis show is adults only\u201d was excellent the first time around. It referenced Patty\u2019s assumption that Dante was in a band from his guitar case- which actually houses his demon-slaying sword- and tastefully segways the scene away from Dante\u2019s fight, shielding it being a curtain and forcing the viewer to use their imagination, to great effect, adding greatly to the style. The line was overused at later and seemingly random times)\\n\r\n\tEnjoyment- 9/10\\n\r\nEven in the face of all of its flaws, Devil May Cry is an enjoyable watch. It has moments which shine through as memorable, stylish, and well-executed, with excellent sound and structure, moments seemingly plucked from a different series. Other than that, the constant action and poorly written but cool characters are fun to watch in all their demon killing glory. \\n\r\n\tCohesion- 5/10\\n\r\nPoor cohesion between episodes, which is expected of an episode-by-episode styled series, but there is also a sometimes off-putting structure to the episodes themselves. \\n\r\n\tOverall- 5/10\\n\r\nDevil May Cry may be trash, but I\u2019ll darned if it isn\u2019t enjoyable trash. For a series which seems to be an odd hybrid of Supernatural, Trigun, and Vampire Hunter D, it does surprisingly well, and surprisingly poorly at the same time. \\n",

            "content": "Warning this review may contain spoilers. \r\nFirst impressions, so devil may cry a anime adaptation of a video game about this guy who fights demons sounds cool enough.\r\nStory, 5/10\r\nSo the story of devil may cry is about dante who is a demon hunter and is also a demon-human hybrid.\r\nSo if your a devil may cry fan you have probably wanted to know the question of what does dante do when he isn't saving the world or fucking some random chicks in a dumpster somewhere.\r\nWell if your asked yourself this question then you will me happy to know that this anime gives you idea. He fightsRandom demons he then eats pizza and sundaes and we are reminded that he is drowning in debt and doing all these things while being a badass.\\n\\n\r\nSo from what you have just read so far you can pretty much guess that there really isn't really a plot to this and for the most part you would be right.\\n\r\nDevil may cry story is for the most part very episodic it mostly includes stand alone missions.\\n\r\n that dante dose for a living and some of what dante dose when he doesn't have work going on. Which is mostly him fucking around while eating high amounts of sundaes and pizzas.\\n\r\nWhich I am not an expert of demon or half demon biology but surely eating all that pizza and sundaes would probably slightly bad for him .\\n\r\nunless in this world just demons  really love  pizza and sundaes.\\n\\n\r\nBut other than that there really isn't much I can comment on\\n\r\nthis show doesn't  really use all the ingredients that it could used and even if this show for all intents and purposes is a kick ass rule of cool show about some badass dude fighting demons. It doesn't use or play on many  of the elements it's brings up.\\n\\n\r\nLike one example there was an episode where we find a demon falling in love with this human women and though this episode we find out that not all demons are evil monsters that destroy and kill everything in there path and demons themselves have the ability to grow not just in power and also there personality and beliefs.\\n\r\nAnd what really bothers  me is that they gloss over this idea in one episode,\\n\r\nWhich leaves me with few questions like why is this demon so different from the rest of his kind or what lead him to becoming like this.\\n\r\nThey never explain or  expand on that idea and concept.\\n\r\nWhich I think is a wasted opportunity.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will mention   that this show tried to have an overarching plot with the loli side kick that Dante has with him.\\n\r\nThat dose lead to this plot In the end but it really doesn't matter in the long run of things. What happens is that the this demon that's trying to become some sort of super demon and needs the loli side kicks blood or something she has to complete it.\\n\\n\r\nBut it was boring and predictable and I don't care about in the lest.\\n\\n\r\nLike here is how they  could have made this show ten times more interesting and not feel like a soulless video game ad in anime form.\\n\\n\r\nStill keep the episodic missions expect the episode count is 24 episodes and during these episodes we lean more about the lore and world of devil may cry.\\n\r\nBecause the demon and super natural elements are quite interesting and it would cool to explore Dante childhood as being a half demon/orphan or talk about what other super natural shit that going down that doesn't involve demons.\\n\r\nIt would be pretty cool to see Dante fight angels or some organization trying to capture or kill him because of his demonic nature.\\n\\n\r\nSurely that would be batter Than what we actually got and if it had those what ifs the story and anime could stand up on its own and  not just be a video game adaptation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter,6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is pretty badass. I mean if you look up badass in the dictionary you would probably find this dude picture on it.\\n\r\nHe is pretty cocky and very relaxed , says bad ass lines and dose the most badass things you can think of.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters were also pretty cool as well.\\n\r\nExcept one character because for some reason this show has a loli side kick for dante \\n\r\nWho pissed me off some times.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad guys who are demons of the week.\\n\r\nAre pretty much your throw away characters that I don't give a fuck about.\\n\\n\r\nArt, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty decent, it's very polished and shiny it is something you should watch in he if you can.\\n\\n\r\nIt also has this kind of dim color scheme that goes well with the kind setting that this show has.\\n\\n\r\nIt also has some pretty good fight animation as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe demon designs were pretty cool as well.\\n\r\nDante also looks pretty cool as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound, 5/10\\n\\n\r\nNot a big fan of the opening or ending song.\\n\r\nBecause it just a background noise music which doesn't sound good to me.\\n\r\nThe ost is pretty decent and it fits the tone of the show pretty well.\\n\r\nAnd I couldn't find out who did the ost.\\n\r\nBut ost is ok.\\n\\n\r\nThe sub and dub  is alight.\\n\\n\r\nPlus Dante English voice actor sounds like he does in the games.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment,6/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked the fight scenes.\\n\r\nI also like the characters as well.\\n\r\nI also like some of the designs for the demons they were pretty cool.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall,6/10\\n\\n\r\nSo if you are Looking for a decent rule of cool show then you will probably like this anime but it seems like to be that you would have to be fan of devil may cry in order to like it more.\\n\r\nIf you not a fan of the game you will mostly right this off as another sub par video game adaption.",

            "content": "( Warning : Minor spoiler alert )\r\nIf you're used with serene, clueless, \" powah of friendshipz ! \" \" nevah give uuup !!! \"  hero types, then you've just bumped in the wrong place. Indeed, that's not particularly true for this guy. He just loiters around all day long, eating strawberry sundaes, and wasting his money on gambling.\r\nNo responsability, whatsoever !\r\nAnd as expected of such loosers, the wind sings through his pockets, and moreover, his debts have reached an epic scale, because of those frequent poker escapades, and that spoiled chick, who don't even stay with him cuz he's such a broke. Doesn't thatsound familiar ?\\n\r\nSo, to lower his debts and avoid loosing his shop ( that being his only roof ... ), he's forced to work for a slavedriver gramps relentlessly following an agenda, and he's also got a brat to look after, whose greatest passions are to stay on top of his head, and to redecorate his shop, this last place of refuge, to match her sightly disturbed artistical sense. And from time to time, also finds herself staring at demon mouths ( from the inside ), ... the inevitable scream occurs...sigh, not again...NOT AGAIN !!!\\n\\n\r\nAnd if that wasn't enough trouble already, that job of his also happens to be ...being the world's greatest demon hunter that ever existed !!!\\n\\n\r\nAnd ...you know what that means, ...having to constantly be the target of average Joe's envious stares. Of the requests of people calling him over or coming from all the corners of the earth to push their little demon related problems onto him. Or of devious plots schemed by bloodthristy demons from Hell, tirelessly seeking revenge for their comrades who've lives have ended tragicaly, when during what was supposed to be a leisurely dinner on earth, they'd met with the sharp blade of his longsword, or his neverending bullet waves. Yeah...like they could ever do as much as scratch him...\\n\r\n...!!!\\n\\n\r\nBecause here, we're dealing with Dante, son of demon lord Sparda, owner of mandatory pro motorcycle and cool opening song, nothing can pose a problem for him. \\n\r\nWho has not hessitated to kick major a** on PS2 ( + PC, and whatever other platforms, the game series developed by Capcom were released for ), nor he does now ( he certainly doesn't hessitate. It's just that there's mostly only weaklings in this short 12 episodes long anime. The stories are quite variate, and fairly interesting. Although those expecting hardcore fights like in the games will be dissapointed.  )\\n\\n\r\nSo...you think you've got a boring and demanding life, that drains you of your energy ? Well, I just gave you an insight straight into our friend's everyday's life.  Safe ride...or not ?\\n\\n\r\nGodspeed !\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S. This review has humouristic purposes rather than informative. Capturing in an unusual way what this anime seems to be all about : showing Dante off.\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you've read other reviews, then you most probably decided to skip the anime even if you're a fan of the game series. As a fan myself I recommend to watch it.\r\nIf you're unfamilliar with the series and don't want any spoilers here's the short version - Very episodic, but slowly, part after part the main plot appears. Badass main male character. Short, but cool fights. Awesome music (rock-metal intro and a slow, peaceful ending). Every battle scene includes a badass music theme, mostly the intro. The graphics and animation are fine, especially demon blood getting splashed all over the place :). There's also aplenty of comedy moments.\\n\r\nAnd now the part for game fans.\\n\r\nIt's about Dante after the first part of the game, when he has already slain Mundus and is (most probably) the strongest, most powerfull and definitely badass living being. If you've played the game, then you should already know that it's hard to actually challenge Dante. Most of his opponents are nothing but flies to him. With that said, I don't really understand why other reviewers are so rough on it. Lady and Trish also appear, but (in my opinnion) Trish is a bit ignored by the show and it doesn't show enough of her.\\n\r\nIt's about Dante's everyday life, you get to know a few more things about him, mostly his financial status and favourite food.\\n\\n\r\nI think this show should be treated as one describing the life of hero, who has already saved the world and defeated his most powerful opponents and now is simply taking care of things if they get out of control. In short - Life after the final goal have been accomplished. That's why the main hero is mostly bored and lazy.\\n\\n\r\nSummary: Good story, Great characters (it's Dante, you know), Good animation and Awesome music.\\n\\n\r\nPS. If we put Vergil in the place of Dante as the main hero, the whole show would be a one episode, about six minutes long. Opening and ending included :D",

            "content": "Typically I like action anime so I have to try not to be biased when I review but I can honestly say I had no problem removing my bias. Anybody who watches this series though must know that the characters aren't exactly identical from the ones you got to know in the DMC games, don't judge it by that, if anything the animated series is supposed to inspire you to go play the game if you haven't.\r\nStory- In terms of story line, mediocre is a good word it tries to actually follow a decent storyline except a few episodes just kind of fall out ofplace. To be honest some episodes don't even seem related to the series and just seem to be filler (funny considering that most of my friends considered more than half of the series filler) but the truth is their not really filler but just plots that won't actually get tied together until the last two episodes (which is fine and all but seriously was not the best idea the creators have). There was nothing persay to build up on unless of course you think that \"Dante kills demon\" is something that is really well built (not that that's bad idea i thought it was a really good one but typically I want more behind a fight than I'm going to kill you because your an abomination)\\n\r\nArt- I actually thought the art was pretty good I mean they obviously need to take a class to find out how much blood is inside of a given body then again most animes have that problem anyway. The animation was good very rarely did I end up saying that was shoddy (although occasionally the number of bullets shot didn't match the number that hit the ground I know it's stupid but I'm picky about that sort of thing).\\n\r\nSound- The sound was pretty good it actually pulled me in I especially liked the opening theme which matched really well to the whole battle context. Voice acting was okay not the best thing in the world but it got me through I don't want to hear english dub though I liked dante's jab voice actor and they will most likely ruin it with english dub.\\n\r\nCharacter- I hated character development they spent no time developing the aspects of Dante or for that matter any other character in the series in the end all I thought was that Dante likes strawberry sundaes and pizza and that near everybody seems to like killing demons (it actually does sound like fun when you think about it but honestly as you can tell by Dante's financial status it doesn't pay much).\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Despite all my whining I did enjoy the series after all in this case especially the end justified the means and gave me the gratification I needed not to bomb this whole series. I'm a man who likes action and if gun totting sword swinging demon bashing fights don't fill that need I don't know what could.\\n\r\nOverall- My suggestion only watch this series if you don't feel like being a little insulted because you've played the games and know something is not right about a situation. If you like violence and killing I doubt you'll have a problem getting through this series",

Its just 12 episodes, it has not just Dante but also some really good character development from the protagonist and antagonist sides, and each episode was actually unique - twists and turns and such.\r\nWith that said, the ending episode was what made it surprising for me - I wasn't expecting such a twist to occur.\r\nWith that said, I feel that Virgil should have been a part of this story in some form or way. Even though Sid is a good villain, he's not the bestvillain you'd want. Personally, I found King in \"Death Poker\" a more interesting villain than Sid. At the same time, I think that this series (although good in terms of its art style and its episodic construction) was good, and worth the rewatch, but its for fans only.\\n\\n\r\nEither way, its ten times better than DMC5 and what they did to Virgil and Dante - this Dante kicked ass, and its worth every minute watching his fight scenes.

            "content": "You know, I never though a series could get away with relying on one character for the series to succeed. Seems kind of impractical to me, and would most definately lead to failure. You need character interactions, you need dramatic relationships, you need romance. Well, apparently Dante could give a s@#t less about that, because he's just gonna kick some monster ass and let you watch.\r\nStory-wise it suffers. Why? There isn't one! It is an episodic series, which isn't bad by any means. The series basically follows the jobs that Dante is employed with at his office, Devil May Cry. Him and Patty, a youngorphan who hangs around the office as the female of the company, take any jobs they can get to get some money to pay of Dante's enormous debt and get on living through the next day. This formula was mildly successful, since Dante is utterly awesome and who doesn't like seeing him kick ass. However, I can only watch so many Bruce Lee movies before I go \"I think this is getting old\". And unfortunately that is what happened. The other characters had little importance in the series and thus did not add to the story much. \\n\\n\r\nArt-wise, it was exactly the kind of animation you would expect from a horror action series. Dark, sharp, and very detailed gore. The design of the series as a whole was well done. The character design is what it was for the video game, but seeing t in animation was a real treat as a fan.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP was quite intense seeing as though there was absolutely no vocals. It was one of the best instrumental OPs out there. The ED was nice, but not as good in my opinion. The BGMs did a good job keeping the atmosphere dark and suspenseful, and was actually quite impressed.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've played the video game, watch it. Trust me. As a fan it was a great treat. However, I can't say that you can only watch this if your a fan because that means that the anime failed to please the rest of its audience. Even though it pleased me, I'm not sure I can say the same for someone new to the series, as it does nothing special or out of the ordinary to stand out from others in the same genre. Overall, its a good series, but I cannot promise it will please everyone.",

            "content": "Normally, when someone creates an anime or manga based on a video game, it loses what was special about that game. Most of the time, even though I don\u2019t play many games myself, I don\u2019t tend to like these shows because it always feels like I\u2019m out of the loop of some element to the story. Strangely, taking this show out of context made the show much better and I actually liked it.\r\nWe have the normal characters that we seem to love like Lady and Trish but sadly, they don\u2019t get enough time in the show, giving the little girl Patty Lowell as the maincharacter next to Dante. This was the only thing I really didn\u2019t like although the interaction between Dante and having him baby-sit this little girl gave the show a fair bit of comedy mixed into its very serious story. Sometimes it felt as though it was a bit forced as there are things I could never see Dante being ok with like when she turns the whole shop into a cute pink fairytale looking place. Patty somewhat made my inner demon want to get out myself as I have had times where I could imagine Dante throwing her out the car or off a bridge, she was that annoying. It\u2019s sad that we had to go threw having her in there for every episode because she wasn\u2019t really a big role until later on near the end. \\n\\n\r\nDante on the other hand was awesome. I only watched the English dub but Reuben Langdon did a pretty good job matching his sort of swagger style of talking. Sometimes he had a little too much swagger in it but that didn\u2019t happen very much. The \u2018I don\u2019t care\u2019 attitude was cool though it needed more of a push to the badass side, it felt a little lost. He did as well as he could to match the first game but it feels like it wasn\u2019t enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe style of the anime and the graininess gives it a novo feel, almost like an old detective movie where the music gives it a New York 80\u2019s jazz style. The colors are dark and sometimes it\u2019s hard to see what\u2019s going on but it gives the show that Horror that all the games have. (At least at when this show came out.) The character designs match the games pretty well and I have no problem with that at all. Dante looks really cute in fact for an animated character. The blood and gore that is so scattered in this show sometimes just looks like it was heavy congealed red something. It does not normally look like actual blood sometimes. The openings sadly feel lack luster as they have images of the show just plastered in for the most part. I think they should have given it a real opening rather then just a set of images. Again, I really wanted to see Lady and Trish more then Patty. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this is really a show that has to be seen with a clear head. You can\u2019t base it on the video game or any other thing. You can only base it on itself and maybe the shows around it because of the work they did on it.\\n",

            "content": "Devil May Cry is an anime based upon a popular game series which I hold fondly in my heart. The fact that there came an anime of it is testament to how good they are. Unfortunately the anime can't measure up to the games, but that still doesn't mean it's not good, just not AS good.\r\nSpoler Alert!\r\nStory: The weak point of the anime is definitely the story. In fact other than episodic pacing with a few hints of something bigger on the horizon, it's pretty much non-existent. You get to know some info about the main character and see him be a total badass. Asthis show goes, I would call it a major power fantasy, filled with blood and gore. This, for the most part, works for the show with some exceptions, like the ending where, no matter how strong the enemy is, Dante almost just finishes the fight in one blow of his sword.\\n\r\nCharacters: After the story, the characters is the weakest part of this show, because most of the characters never get an established backstory. There are in fact only 3 characters who get their backstory explained, Dante, Patty and Patty's mother Nina. Still, you get to see an interesting enough cast of character and an interesting variation of enemies throughout the show.\\n\r\nSound and artwork: The soundtrack in this show is quite good and suits it well, with heavy metal or rock playing during the fight scenes. The art style is dark for most part, with lots of dark shades and some things (like blood) highlighted with vibrant colors that stand in contrast to the else-wise darker tones.\\n\r\nEnjoyment and summary : In total I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the show, though my experience with the games left me somewhat disappointed. I would recommend this show to those who do not mind blood and gore in their anime, and those who like shows with tons of action.",

            "content": "I've been on a bit of a Devil May Cry bender lately, what with DMC5 having been announced and recently gameplay being shown and it looking freaking amazing. But yeah this bender eventually led me back to the Devil May Cry anime, yes like most popular Japanese games DMC got an anime but how does it fair, is it one of those rare good adaptations of a video game or does it fall flat on its face.\r\nStory: 6/10. For those unfamiliar, Devil May Cry follows the adventures of Dante, a half human half demon devil hunter who runs the titular Devil May Cry store, inwhich he receives his demon hunting jobs. However unlike most anime based of a game which attempt to adapt one of the games of the series, DMC actually follows an original story (well sort of). The show follows an episodic format in which Dante takes up odd jobs that usually lead to him slaying one or multiple demons who are wreaking a small amount of havoc on his employers. These episodic stories range from being kind of crap, for example an episode based around a guy who is stalking Dante cause a girl he likes has a crush on Dante, to actually being quite good, like an episode in which Dante has to deal with two demonic brothers who have some connection to him. There is an overarching story which is set up in the first episode that involves a little girl character Paddy as well as a demon named Sid (more on them later). This slowly progressed in the background in some episodes and eventually paid off in the last two episodes. This storyline is... alright i guess, it has its moments but ultimately it just isn't focused on enough for you to care very much about it by the end. So overall the episodic stories have some highs and lows and the overarching story has moments but i fell is ultimately quite weak.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. The art in this series is actually quite good. Madhouse worked on this show and while not one of their strongest works i wouldn't exactly call it weak either. The characters all look good, especially Dante who is rocking his DMC1 attire (my personal favourite attire), the show also has some really good demon designs with some looking quite badass and some looking quite horrific (in a good way). The animation is also quite good generally looking quite clean and making the action scenes look damn awesome. The environments are fine if a little uninspired, just your average city scapes and forests etc, especially since the DMC games (the first two in particular) have a very Gothic inspired look to them so i found that kind of disappointing but at least the environments look good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10. The sound in this show is probably its strongest point, with a badass rock soundtrack which fits quite well with the DMC vibes, the sound effects themselves are good, Dantes guns sound great, cars explosions etc all sound great, and the voice acting is all good as well (I've watched in both English and Japanese and both are equally as good as one another).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10. For this i'm gonna cover characters from the games and original characters separately. Dante himself is relatively close to how he is in the games, a smart mouthed badass who likes to joke around with his enemies and loves Pizza, however sometimes i feel Dante comes of as a bit of a cynic which was something that was never present in the games and i feel it doesn't fit well with his character. other returning characters from the games include Lady and Trish. They are both pretty much exactly how they are in the games which is great, Lady is a much more serious character who tries to get Dante to take his work more seriously (mainly because he owes her a lot of money, which is actually one of my favourite running gags in the show) and Trish is a badass demon femme fattale although she doesn't appear much in the series so she doesn't get much time to shine. The original characters range from being alright to being really bad. Morrison, Dantes agent of sorts is easily the best of them acting as a great straight-man to Dantes more laid back nature. There is also Paddy, a little girl who Dante has to protect in the first episode and then begins to hang around the Devil May Cry. She... isn't very good, She begins to develop an almost Father-Daughter relationship with Dante which is kinda nice but i just find her kinda annoying. The main villain Sid is actually alright, he's a weaker demon so he sort of plays around with Dante in the background as opposed to facing him straight on which i actually like a lot. The characters who appear in the episodic stories range from alright to awful and none are really memorable, save for the two demon brothers in episode 10 who actually have a good storyline.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10. The show has a lot of problems but i can't deny that watching some kick ass demon killing action for 12 episodes didn't entertain the hell out of me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. i love the Devil May Cry series and while the anime isn't one of the strongest parts of the series it is still a relatively fun show. If your a DMC fan or just want to watch a badass dude kill demons for 12 episodes and not have to worry about story then you just hit the JACKPOT. If neither of those apply to you, then i'd give this one a skip.",

I personally enjoyed this anime quite a bit. It was cool seeing Dante just perform his job instead of saving the world from Vergil or something. Seeing Lady and Trish was cool as well, and how could you NOT like that poker episode?",

The Opening is maybe the only thing I would save about it,but then the episode starts. \r\nAlmost every episode is self-contained,the plot is trivial and all the characters who aren't in the main cast,last just an episode. The only piece of story is about a character who is not in the game series,not that i remember,and the animation sometimes is poor. Save your time,play the games,because when I started an episode,I could easily tell where that episodewas going and I literally lost interest after 5 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nDante,Lady and Trish live up the expectations,but maybe the most annoying thing about this anime is the amount of times when it seems that there is finally a bit of action , but in the next scene is already all over and Dante has saved the day. Dante still loves pizza and gambling,but you can't make a 12 episode series without some plot,but you do preferring to put those aspects that make it a lot better in the game.",

If you go into this anime expecting some generic mainstream crap than of course you won't enjoy it. DMC is in a genre nearly of its own.\r\nThis isn't a anime you watch for a \"deep romantic storyline\". This is an anime you watch if you want to see a badass kick alot of ass; than get his ass kicked - and yet come back alive for round three. \r\nI'd compare this anime's storyline to Cowboy Bebop. Its similar, in thatits not a deep flowing storyline but instead of set of small but awesome adventures occurring within the same set of characters. \\n\\n\r\nDMC has great animation, awesome fight scenes, badass enemies and allies. Its a hack & slash gory horror thriller. If you love crazy over the top action, you will love DMC. If you would rather be watching twilight or listening to bieber, please step away as this is not for you.",

            "content": "So if you're here after having played the DMC series games (DMC 3 and 4) and are expecting to see more of the continuity of the story, like Dante's past or how do he take care of his arsenals, let me tell you this: there's nothing like that in this anime. It's episodic, meaning that it's stories about clients coming Dante's demon hunting shop and in each episode, the CLIENTS are the focus. Not Dante or his partners. Picture Cowboy Bebop (Except Cowboy Bebop does it better in my opinion).\r\nStory:\r\nI think this show is made in order to promote the video games but the problemis, i think the writers are afraid to take risks to tamper with the already existing characters such as Dante and Trish because they don't want to upset the fans by make these characters go through troubles, conflicts and emotional breakdowns (because that'll make them appear weak). Therefore they write the characters as emotionless gun-wielding bounty hunter who breezes through every demons in every episodes with barely no effort.\\n\r\nAnd also, they had made a loli to live with Dante to nag about his lifestyle every episode. This came out of nowhere and looks out of place.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt's pretty great in quality (as it's the same studio that made Death Note). The only gripe i have is that Dante's face is always covered by his hair most of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe dubbing is pretty decent but more importantly if you have been a fan of the game, they had Rueben Langdon, the man who voices Dante in both DMC games to voice Dante in this show, which is really great. You can clearly recognizes Dante's speech mannerisms and tone from the game, which for gives a slight feeling of nostalgia.\\n\r\nExtra: The demon's voices in the dubbing are really loud and rather incoherent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's not like i'm saying that i hate show adaptations of video games in general. I'm willing to love adaptations with open arms. It's just that for them to be enjoyable, we need to make shows that expand the characters' backgrounds and make these characters go through conflicts in order to make character development.",

            "content": "What to say about Devil May Cry... Well, to start off, it's based on the Capcom action games, which are pretty outstanding and frequently get thrown into \"Top 10 Games of the Year\" lists. Insert groan here: you can already tell someone tried too hard to get this converted into an anime. And it shows.\r\nDevil May Cry (the anime) has no solid plot until the bitter end. The episodes all feel like either one-shots that were never meant to take off, or filler that was never meant to stand out. Either way, there is no \"story\" to speak of. It's all about Dante being thisridiculously cool, gun-wielding, sword-swinging badass, and if I wanted that, I would just pick up the game and play it.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's sort of what sets Devil May Cry to the side. The artwork and sound are both excellently executed, and the voice acting is superb. I think Capcom knew from the beginning that this was a bad idea, so they threw as much into the project as they could to prevent it from absolutely shattering when it dropped. And this is where this anime shines. If you're a fan of the video games, you'll absolutely love the style and flair of this series. Despite the lack of continuity, you never feel empty about any particular episode. It never leaves you feeling unsatisfied. But that's sort of a problem, too: Devil May Cry is best taken in small doses. I can absolutely fall in love with one of the episodes, and just call it a day right then and there, but if you start to watch them back to back, it starts feeling forced and drawn out, dare I say filler arc-ish. In order to really set this one apart from the rest, I think they should have either based it on the plot of one of the games (which could have made for a ridiculously good anime), or made a new plot with a continuity and a backbone to hold it all together. Style, flair, and even Dante himself, can't save this anime from its unfortunate shortcomings, and you'll notice them as time goes on.\\n\\n\r\nIt really pains me to rate this so low. It had so much potential, and they blew it. But I honestly can't recommend it. Few anime series do justice to the games, and this is one of the ones that finds itself treading the same waters as a live-action movie of a video game: once you take out the element of the human player, you start losing your love for the character, to the point that the flair starts getting show-offish and almost annoying. A bit of substance might have remedied this problem, but as it stands, Devil May Cry doesn't hold its own when compared to Hellsing, Trinity Blood, or any of the other really good demon/vampire hunter-style anime out there.",

            "content": "So I'm going to wonder as to how many people who have watched this show knew there was a game series tied to it. It has to at least be a 30-70 split in favor of the group who knew.\r\nEither way, I'm on the side who not only knew there is a game series attached to the name but also played the whole series as well lol. So needless to say, I'm going to be a little bias but at the same time, I'm also putting it along side the games that are part of the same time line. So higher standards in the end.So with out further introductions, Let's rock.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nOk, gonna be honest here but if you come to any of the games to tell you a good story, then you are gonna be disappointed. The games are mission based with only a few cut-scenes along the way to give story detail. Any fan would say you come to the games for the action and game-play. The same applies to the anime as well. There was something nice and charming to it in the beginning but as the story progressed you kinda feel like you are going through different missions. Which would be fine if it was for esthetic purposes, but I honestly didn't feel that way. 1 job per episode. The ending also wasn't too great either since the main villain was too easy to spot and his motives not being any more unique then a simple B-movie villain. The games didn't suffer too much with this but there was a fair amount of prediction going on through out the game. The only other problem I have here, and this is more of a nit pick, is that the name of the shop was different after the first game which comes before the anime in a timeline sense. Can't tell me Dante just changes the name back because fucking why not.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 8 and 9\\n\r\nI thought the visuals were really nice and fit the style of the piece entirely. DMC being a famous hack and slash game is all about gritty combat and flashy moves, so a hard edge, high detail style works well here. Dante's design is really nice to look at as well as a lot of the other characters. But the detail doesn't stop there because the demons are freaking awesome to look at. Horrific and grotesques, just the way the Underworld brewed them.\\n\\n\r\nToo bad the sound department edges out bringing the rock and metal tracks to play in the background of every fight as well as a great use of Spanish guitar for somber moments. The opening theme especially is a badass enough track to get you pumped up for a fight or two. To bad the quality of the story doesn't deliver an equal amount of badass.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking in terms of the games, the art was always great to look at as we moved further along in titles. The sound too was always appropriated to fit their situations. So we have a good integration here as well. I did only find it appropriate to listen to the soundtrack as I typed this out lol.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThis is an easy one, anybody who knows this series knows exactly who we came to see. I have heard Dante being described as \"50 shades of awesome\" and I honestly can't come up with a better description then that. He loves his job and has fun doing it, and when he isn't hard at work he couldn't care less so long as he had a pizza at hand. I can see people disliking the show taking time to poke fun at Dante and make a fool of him and their reactions being something along the lines of, \"Dudes, this is a badass demon hunter with enough power to slay his own kind. Why are you trying to get on his last nerve?\". Which I don't understand. I actually enjoy the breathe of fresh air they give his character. In the games he is always on the job so he has to find fun along the way, but he is never put in a position where he can relax for long enough to produce any content to prove that he wouldn't do something like this. Getting a chance to see him and his comrades in a more relaxed state gives us another angle of their personality which is always appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nWhich speaking of other characters, We have a few other familiar faces here. Trish from DMC1 and Lady from DMC3. Both of which are before this show chronologically speaking, so yeah more fun. Again, I love what they did here with these characters. They show well enough that these characters have history with each other, enough so they have no problem quipping at each other mid fight or before they go on a job. It's just more depth to their relationship. Wins all around.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nWhat can I say, I get just as much thrill from this as I did the games (except DMC2 because DMC2 sucked massive ass). The characters were spot on, the art fit the style and the music excited every occasion. And while the story can be feel very bland, its not beyond the series as a whole to be weak in the story department. But, like I said before, that's not what we came here for. We came here to hack and slash our way through demons. To be put in situations that no sane man would honestly take on. And to look as badass as possible while doing it. What can I say, putting it all together it comes up with a solid Jackpot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

It shows more what Dante is doing the rest of the time when not fighting super powered bosses in games.\r\nThe story I would say is it's weakest point, it's not bad, it's just probably not what your hoping or expecting in a Devil May Cry Anime, it's very episodic until the end where it picks up.  \r\nThe art I like, a decent amount ofblood and gore for the action, the various demons I found fascinating.\\n\\n\r\nSound is okay, about what is fitting.\\n\\n\r\nTo me the main thin that works is the characters, Dante is his usual suave self cracking jokes and kicking ass, a few chars from the games show up, and he ends up taking someone in early on that plays a decent part throughout the show, and was a nice addition even if felt a bit tacked on till later on.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy this, if you go into expecting high octane non stop action you will be disappointed, but if you go into this with a open mind and learning about Dante and the world a little more, you might enjoy it.",

It has a kind of 'monster of the week' format for the most part, and this can make the episodes seem really rushed.\r\nArt\r\nI have no complaint with the art, it all looks pretty decent and the character designs were good, the only jarring thing is that some of the3d animation doesn't quite fit in with the rest of it.\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThis is one of the weakest aspects of the series, as it sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom, sometimes you have no idea what the characters are saying (this is based on the English dub), the same music is used repeatedly, and some parts seem to lack sound effects.\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThere is basically no character development, and many of the characters are very similar to each other.\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI actually did enjoy this show! It was silly, a lot of it was stupid, but it is a self aware show, which makes it not as painful. Don't take it too seriously, allow yourself to laugh at Dante's corny lines and some of the anime physics, and it is actually quite fun to watch.",

My impression from playing the games was that except for boss battles which in many cases were insane all other batles were easy in any mode except DMD once you learn how to use Dante. So the complain does not hold ground. About the story it does not even aim to be anything more than separate missions. As in other movies and anime even if there is a storyline that links the episodes it is only hinted with the exception of the episodes whichresolve the story. I found the end a bit stupid though. The way Dante defeats the Boss is anticlimatic and seems to have been rushed without a second thought.",

You join him as he kills these demons each episode. Now, at the end, the plot starts forming. The last episode is pretty intense. \r\nI think they did Dante's character extremely well. It's the side people I didn't care much for. Here's an example: When Dante was on screen, I smiled andfelt happier. When he wasn't and someone else I couldn't care less about was panicking about something stupid, I frowned and was tempted to exit the page. Patty, the girl he took care of, was adorable and I wish she was in the games . . . although I don't see what point she would have. \\n\r\nOverall, I recommend this to anyone who plays the games. If you don't, then unless there's absolutely nothing else to watch, then watch it. It's a good show, but it's not exciting if you don't even know who Dante is. \\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n",

There are also two new regular characters - Dante's agent Morrison who visits frequently, and Patty Lowell, a young orphan girl he saved in the first episode, who also visits frequently and shares a father-daughter relationship.\r\nMy thoughts:\r\nDante is a half demon, one of the sons of Sparta and a very good character. He has a laid back attitude but when it comes to demons, he\u2019s all business. Although he complains about Patty, he doesn\u2019t seem to mind having her around (if only to clean up the messes hemakes). In each episode, Dante fights a demon and the episodes relate to something totally different, but underneath, each episode has a piece of the puzzle that comes to a climax in the last episode.",

With that said lets get this show on the road.\r\nStory line- There was no solid plot for the first 10 episodes of the anime. Each episode was basically Dante going on jobs hunting demons. Which got kind of boring after a while. Its not until the tenth episode that they tried to create a plot. (THIS ANIME IS ONLY 12 EPISODES) There was no form to the plot, it just kind of appeared out of no where. It also made little to know sense at all.\r\nArt & Sound- The art was classicallydone with dull colors however, it does have a dark appeal to it. The sound is also good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- This anime was created based of the game Devil May Cry. However, if you have never played the game series you would certainly be lost on the characters. There were only a handful of characters that you would see in every episode. No character actually made a show stopping performance. Nor did I feel attached to any particular character. They basically came and left.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I overall enjoyed the theme of the anime (dark, supernatural, action, gore ) theme. I felt that the actual deliverance of the anime needed a bit of work. Nonetheless it was good.",

            "content": "You've all heard about the horrors of video game movies: They're ludicrous messes of distorted, mismatched plot elements that show no respect for the source material. Unfortunately, this phenomenon is not necessarily limited to Western games. In Japan, prominent games are regularly made into anime series, and more often than not, they end up just as convoluted as their western equivalents. Devil May Cry, as most of you readers probably already know, is a fairly successful video game franchise developed by Japanese publisher Capcom. It was only a matter of time until someone decided to make an anime out of it. Well, nothing can possiblygo wrong here, can it?\\n\\n\r\nThe anime series in question is Devil May Cry: The Animated Series. It follows the misadventures of Dante, a tall, half-demon man that fights other demons with automatic pistols and a nine-foot-long sword. There are other characters, too, but none of them are particularly interesting, nor do any of them stand out as unique or dynamic. Dante is the owner of \"Devil May Cry,\" a business that investigates demons... or something. That's about as far as the plot gets before it decides to throw storytelling out the window. Who are these demons? Why are they attacking? What do they want? Why is Dante hunting them? Well, the writers didn't seem to think any of these questions were very important, because they didn't bother to answer them. I guess they couldn't cut a few minutes out of the fight scenes to make room.\\n\\n\r\nOh yes, the fight scenes. So very many mindless fight scenes, complete with copious levels of gore. Let me put it this way: The title for this show would probably be more accurate if it were \"Dante Stabs Demons in the Face.\" Now, don't get me wrong, I like fight scenes, and I can see why an anime based on an action game would want to have a lot of fight scenes. But when the fight scenes preclude any form of storytelling, as they do in Devil May Cry, then I can't see the justification in making an anime series at all. The only story elements that are given any time are those that set up the given episode's action sequences. Anything else is apparently not worth the time - including things like, say, concluding the episode.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, in the first episode, Dante is tasked with guarding a young girl named Patty, who is apparently the illegitimate heir of a local rich man who just passed away. Okay, that's simple enough. Then, as the climax of the episode draws near, another woman shows up at the man's mansion to claim the inheritance, claiming that she is actually the heir and the girl was a decoy. Except she's in her twenties and the man (presumably) wasn't that old. So who's the real heir? The \"epic\" fight scene of the episode ensues, but in the aftermath, the issue is promptly dropped without any explanation. To boot, the woman who claimed she was the real heir asks to help take care of Patty, completely out of the blue. What's the history behind these two characters? No matter, the credits abruptly roll, and then we never see her again. Thanks, Devil May Cry, I guess concluding your own stories isn't important after all.\\n\\n\r\nI do have to give credit where credit is due, though. Despite all of its many faults, Devil May Cry is very well animated. The fight scenes and action sequences, countless as they are, are all fluidly animated. The backgrounds are crisp and clear, and provide a good contrast to the characters that inhabit them. Devil May Cry just looks good, and if there's one thing I can say about the series as a whole, it's that it definitely had a big budget.\\n\\n\r\nBut at the same time, when you realize the work that went into this show, it's distressing that the writing managed to come out so badly. Did they just hire a hundred animators and one writer? Didn't anyone see a problem with leaving entire episodes' worth of story hanging without any sort of conclusion? Perhaps it's better not to analyze it so closely; no matter how much you pick apart and examine a train wreck, it's still a train wreck.\\n",

They could maybe have made it a bit longer, maybe go a little bit deeper the chars personel life.\r\nThe story: isn't very good. They have it way too lazy on that. But on the other side it would be very bad, if they copied the games story a 100%. i give it a 4/10.\r\nThe Art: is amazing. They keep the drawing close the the dark theme that the story also is. Igive it 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound: that is a hard one. It did not have all the over-dramatic sound effects, that some other animes have. And the music that goes with each part of the mood in the anime is also wonderfull, (partly because its the kind of music i like personaly). It gets 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: It is great how it matches up the game, and that it has the cool yet funny people in it. Some might say they should have more people with defferent personality in it, but that would ruin it since its made after a game. It gets 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: the injoy ment in it was not that great. Because the game is pretty much a pure hack n' slash game. But on the other side it would be bad if the anime is a hack n' slash. So the battle (if you can call it that) are very good for an anime to be. Yet the story pulls the whole anime down. So it gets 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The anime is good, but the story pulls the whole thing down. But still i would love to see a season two comming up, (but don't think it's gonna happen). They did a good job keeping up with the game but in the end they couldn't do it.\\n\r\n4+7+8+9+3=31 / 4= 6,2=6. so the final grade is 6.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. Signed Vampmaster!!",

Well, I'm glad that small part of me was wrong but I still would have been better off listening to it.\r\nStory 5/10\r\nUntil the last two or so episodes, you don't get any, but It's no big deal really as this is just a straight up action show with a pinch of slice of life. However, I do think a bit more story could have drastically improved it.\r\nArt 8/10\r\nIf this thing has a shining point, this wouldbe it. Nothing really to say about it other than it's awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack suits the anime well, especially in the last episode. As for the opening, I bloody loved it. The closing on the other hand was quite forgettable. I say this because I can't remember it no matter how hard I try.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nFor the most part, I liked the characters but I never really saw any development. Still, I don't think the setup really requires a gigantic and complex character cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nOut of all 12 episodes, I only liked one, episode 5.
