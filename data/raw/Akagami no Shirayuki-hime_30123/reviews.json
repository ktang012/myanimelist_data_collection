            "content": "Shirayuki, why are you so special and so loved by everyone you meet? This is the question I cannot help but ask with each episode I watch of this anime. The specialness of this very bland, boring, ordinary girl with a supposedly unusual hair color just goes way too far. If I'm not feeling it, then why are all of these idiots in her world?\r\nThose who claim this anime sidesteps the usual shoujo anime tropes couldn't be more wrong. It falls awkwardly and unawares into most of them and sloshes around in the ditch water like a pig wallowing in its own filth. We havea very cliched protagonist, Shirayuki, who is the Mary Sue of anime.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, she has a very unusual name in any culture, \"Snow White.\" If that doesn't scream \"Mary Sue,\" then I don't know what does. Second, she has a rare hair color for NO story reason in order to force her to be considered special by the other characters, but it doesn't convince the viewer who is not impressed with this unrealistic display. Third, she is so special, the prince of her own kingdom wants to make her his concubine, but she decides to flee the country instead, only to run into none-other than the SECOND prince of the neighboring country. A coincidence for you, and one coincidence for YOU---coincidences for everybody!\\n\\n\r\nBut, wasn't Shirayuki escaping a horrible life when she ran away from home? That's why she ran, right? Well, no. In fact, she was very well loved by everybody in her own kingdom and she literally threw it all away simply because Prince Raj got horny and decided he wanted to pamper her like a wife without actually marrying her. I'm not saying this is okay, but there are worse fates out there.\\n\\n\r\nSo, now she's in the kingdom next door as the very special friend of Prince Zen, a young second prince she meets immediately upon leaving her own kingdom. Because she had already worked as an apothecary, she took naturally to this whole herbs business and easily passed the test to become the palace's apprentice herbalist. Well, nothing's hard for this girl, other than being so beautiful and revered. Life is hard, indeed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, that's just the problem. There really is nothing about Shirayuki's life that is a problem. She was happy before and she is happy now. She was pretty before and she is still pretty. She was hardworking before and she is hardworking now. She stood up for herself before, and she does it now, too. What is the point of even watching this anime when the story is nonexistent and she has so little conflict in her life?\\n\\n\r\nIt comes off like a wish fulfillment fantasy that gets so carried away with making the protagonist's life perfect, it's BORING AS HELL. There is no character development whether in Shirayuki, Zen, or anyone. You cannot have meaningful anything or anyone if you have nothing at stake. There is nothing at stake here, and it is a story about a really fortunate girl, with perhaps a bit too much fortune, finding a very fortunate love match. Perhaps this would be more interesting if there was some struggle and some real growth in Shirayuki and Zen, but it doesn't exist.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this can be a way to pass the time if you're bored, but I found myself becoming bored while watching this. If a story about everyone getting along with everyone else and only having to deal with minor misunderstandings sounds like a blast to you, then dig in. I ain't got no time for this lightweight storytelling crap.",

            "content": "Roses, tomatoes, and human blood. What do these all have in common? If you guess their color, then you would be correct. A certain girl with noticeable red hair also exists in a fantasy world where the colors of red decorates its colorful storytelling. Akagami no Shirayuki-hime (Snow White with the Red Hair) isn\u2019t exactly a Disney tale where there\u2019s just prince charming or Cinderella shoes. Rather, this show is what I\u2019d envision as a unique fantasy story of vibrant coloring.\r\nAdapted from the manga of the same name written and illustrated by Sorata Akizuki, the series focuses on a young woman named Shirayuki. She isborn with her trademark red hair that catches the eye of almost anyone she meets. This unfortunately attracts the attention of a prince named Raji who wishes to marry her and in response, Shirayuki attempts to escape from the country. She later meets a young man named Zen and helps him with an injury. As prince Raji attempts to find Shirayuki, we see how her adventure begins not as a heroine who is on a mission to slay dragons but to obtain a rightful place in the world where she belongs. The series is noticeable that it\u2019s a split cour (12 episodes) each. This review will cover the first cour of the adaptation by studio Bones.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of the manga, I was ecstatic to see that this anime adaptation became a reality. To get straight to the point, Akagami no Shirayuki-hime is a very classic fantasy. It takes place in the Kingdom of Clarines that is highly decorative. In fact, its first few episodes will make you see the world fiction that Shirayuki and the others are part of. Even the very few first scenes of the show will unravel what may be expected. The highly decorated castle, the scarlet red haired heroine, and a prince with a commanding presence all bring out the atmospheric shoujo setting. The premise also includes a poisoned apple which is a classic plot device used in the original Snow White story. But rather than Snow White being saved, it\u2019s Shirayuki who does the saving. In essence, Shirayuki is an antithesis of the damsel in distress trope. She is courageous, intelligent, daring, and very compassionate with the people around her. She helps a stranger (Zen) with little hesitation and often puts others\u2019 will-being above her own. What defines her as a strong woman also makes her independent as she relies on almost no one to achieve her goal. And in this story, her goal is to become a professional pharmacist.\\n\\n\r\nThe show executes its storytelling from many angles. The most prominent would be the relationship building between Shirayuki and Zen. The two already have a charming chemistry with their moments from the very first time they\u2019ve met. Zen\u2019s curiosity of Shirayuki is also interesting to see as he wants to know more about her each episode. Their social status in the show contrasts greatly but it\u2019s shown that they are similar in a variety of ways. Both are confident in their abilities, skillful in certain arts, and often uses clever thinking to solves problems. They are also both sometimes stubborn with certain objectives such as when Shirayuki stood in front of a sword while risking her life to get a point across. Furthermore, it\u2019s also shown throughout that Zen has grown fond of Shirayuki to the point that he sometimes feels dependent of her. In return, Shirayuki often looks after his well-being while developing a mutual respect for one another. And given the shoujo fantasy premise, there\u2019s little doubt that romance soon blossoms between the two.\\n\\n\r\nAs a character driven story, the series also puts emphasis on the other people that we see. The two most noticeable are Zen\u2019s aides, Mitsuhide and Kiki. The two has a strange relationship although it\u2019s shown that they very close. Their sense of loyalty is also unparalleled each episode as they are willing to put their lives at risk to help Zen. Although we don\u2019t learn much about them, it\u2019s shown that they\u2019ve also grown quite fond of Shirayuki\u2019s presence. Other characters such as Obi makes the audience wonder what they may be capable of especially with what they make of their first impressions. Lastly, there\u2019s also a bit of sibling drama that occurs in the show. Zen\u2019s brother is shown to be manipulative individual who is hard to read; sometimes he is serious, other times he is playful. The siblings\u2019 relationship often creates tension whenever they are on-screen together and it really makes the audience curious to see how their relationship develop in the present story.\\n\\n\r\nFor Shirayuki\u2019s role, she undertakes challenges to prove herself as a capable pharmacist. While the show is predictable, it still manages to capture the interest of the viewers as we see how she is able to take on different challenges. The experience she shows in the series isn\u2019t just by the actions she does but by how she does them. It\u2019s interesting to note that Shirayuki\u2019s confidence comes from willing to help others as a goal to become a pharmacist rather than just earning money or achieve fame. Her selflessness combined with courage and independence makes her stand out as an inspiring heroine. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the series is very appealing, this might not be a show for everyone. For starters, this is not to be taken as an action theater. In other words, do not expect epic sword clashes, war drama, or political affairs that spans into complicated plot angles. Instead, this is more of an inspiring fantasy shoujo that classifies the characters and how they progress. The relationship dynamics makes this series very colorful while retaining the strengths of a classic shoujo. I do have to admit that not everything is captured by source material adaptation standards. Also at times, the story\u2019s pacing feels sluggish in particular with the first few episodes. There\u2019s also some forced comedy that occasionally appears although this can be neglected by the memorable dialogues. A fantasy adventure like this isn\u2019t also without romance so expect some obvious direction that the story follows up with. Despite this though, the show itself stands alone as something unique. It\u2019s not a reboot of Snow White but a colorful tale of red.\\n\\n\r\nAs one of several Bones\u2019 series to premiere in 2015, Akagami no Shirayuki-hime is a powerhouse when it comes to visual arts. The show\u2019s animation features vibrant colors combining elements of resourceful landscapes, architecture, and character designs. The Kingdom of Clarines is also shown to have fantastic features that is fitting for a grand castle along with its neighboring town. Shirayuki\u2019s red hair is decorated as unique throughout the season. Her outfit gradually changes as her skill evolves and reflects on developed experience. Zen\u2019s outfit is also fitting for someone with the status of a prince and alongside his aides, they make up a memorable trio. There is also virtually no fan service as the show makes its point to unravel Shirayuki as an independent heroine, a female character that doesn\u2019t need to rely on looks to gain others\u2019 attention. All things aside, I do have to admit that there are occasionally some sluggish animation issues with the character movements. However, the body language in the show is undeniable when it with \u2018a picture is worth a thousand words\u2019 moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe word I\u2019d describe the music for the show would be sweet. It\u2019s lighthearted that isn\u2019t hard on the ears but instead convey its fantasy shoujo feel whenever it needs to be. The OP/ED theme song are decorative and well connected to its atmospheric setting. Character voice mannerism comes from the strengths of the main leads. Shirayuki shows a lot of personality in her voice that shifts from confidence, humorous, and daring when she needs to be. Similarly, we also have Zen who displays a familiar nature as a prince. His voice sometimes does display inklings of stubbornness and even arrogance when interacting with his brother. That actually brings up to a good point as well. Izana is probably a character that I\u2019d describe as the most hard to read yet. Just judging on his voice alone, there\u2019s a lack of trustworthiness in his character. But overall in terms of character voice mannerisms, the whole cast is well portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nSo what else is to say about Akagami no Shirayuki-hime? It\u2019s more than a tribute to the original Snow White story. We get a colorful cast of characters in a world where possibilities can become a reality. The show does a wonderful job when crafting its premise while staying true to it throughout the season. The character relationships are some of the key highlight points that makes the show worthy of its praise. And when it comes to its technical features, the series is a red scarlet eye candy of fantasy. In retrospect, Akagami no Shirayuki-hime makes you feel attached to the characters, story, and become a part of something almost magical.",

            "content": "There are anime series which excel because they have an original story (Clannad After Story, Stein's Gate and Madoka Magica) and there are those which soar due to well-written characters who carry an otherwise generic story. Akagami no Shirayuki-hime may be dismissed due to its straightforward nature which seems to religiously follow the shoujo genre but a deeper look reveals its characters that defy the tropes which makes it special.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe legitimate weakness of this series is that its story does not stand out. We were introduced to Shirayuki, a girl who ran away from her home because their prince wanted to make her aconcubine then she met Zen, a prince from another country. The premise basically rings a familiar trope that was used too many times before (Disney, anyone?).\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode is very fairy tale like in my opinion with all the events being mirrored with the first few events of Snow White. We then follow her life and struggles after she made friends with the Prince. In all honesty, it can be tiresome at times since the first few episodes were made to look as if she was a princess in damsel and the prince has to rescue her just at the right moment. \\n\\n\r\nOther moments involve Shirayuki taking an exam, being introduced to Zen's brother and so on but again, the story does not stand out which is a fair claim to naysayers to dismiss the series as just another shoujo show. This hurt the series considerably in its not so stellar episodes and might leave a stagnant feeling to the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: My praise to Akagami Shirayuki-hime begins here and it might border as if it came from a rabid fanboy but I will try my best to balance my review. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is highly consistent courtesy of Bones and is the prettiest looking series this season. It was as if the staff borrowed some of Shinkai's technique  (the man behind 5 Centimeters Per Second) when it comes to the relaxing hues used in Akagami Shirayuki-hime. The artwork (lighting and the characters' expression) was also able to accentuate the heartwarming scenes in this series (Episodes 4 and 11 in particular) and along with the standout score, it elevated an otherwise generic moment.\\n\\n\r\nAs regards to character designs, these were cleanly made and these faithfully followed the mangaka's but modified them a bit to have a Bones feel to them. These also mark a departure from your typical shoujo fare where the typical characters are so pretty that you might be dazzled.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, Bones is not a stranger in putting the right music at the right moment which makes the effect of crucial scenes in this series very potent to those who invested their time in it. Strings were used during climactic ones which elevated nondescript scenes to heartwarming events. It also knows when to stop during the show's most crucial moment (I am not going to spoil anything) to emphasize something irreversible with Zen and Shirayuki has happened.\\n\\n\r\nFor most of the time, the musical score is relaxing enough to complement this languidly paced series which is a very commendable job for Bones. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki is a character driven show which has actual and relatable characters and a very strong lead reminiscent of Akatsuki No Yona.  For what the story lacks, the characters in this show compensate. \\n\\n\r\nShirayuki defies the traits of a typical shoujo lead. She is socially capable, strong-willed, is not afraid to speak her mind and has actually has a brain which knows her limits. A viewer might expect a typical shoujo lead to go doki doki with her love interest but Shirayuki holds her own and yearns to seek position for her to see Zen as her equal. A crying main character trope because she was intimidated is also not present here but we are given a very rational one who thinks before she acts. \\n\\n\r\nZen, on the other hand, might err at times to your typical male shoujo character but a closer examination reveals that he is not. While he is kind, his past (a very painful one, mind you) reveals what made him like he is as portrayed. He might be likable and composed but his insecurity (or whatever that feeling is) to his much superior brother is palpable and shows its ugly fang when triggered but not to the point that he shows angst about it. He also narrowly avoided the sparkly main lead syndrome by toning down some of his traits and by not giving him a chick magnet role. \\n\\n\r\nAll other recurring characters were also given ample time to get some development. Mitsuhide and Izana benefited from Zen's flashback of his past so much that it can be also viewed that certain story was theirs and not Zen's. They were also elevated from plot device to actual characters which interact with the leads (and contribute to their future paths) without the feeling of emotional manipulation. Izana in particular might just be my favorite character in this show for his reasons and his peculiar ways of handling problems which antagonize him a bit.\\n\\n\r\nObi, on the other hand, is a very interesting oddball which complemented Zen's calm nature. He is quite perceptive and throws statements which drive the series to a positive direction. The confession scene would not have happened without him after all.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a shoujo junkie and are looking for shoujo-esque moments every single episode, then I am sorry that you are looking for the wrong show. There are no overly complicated relationship webs (A likes B who likes C who likes D... yada... yada...) and we are only given focus with Zen and Shirayuki for as long as the shoujo nature of this show in concerned.\\n\\n\r\nYou will also not see Zen getting doki doki around Shirayuki (vice versa until the climactic moment in this show) just because it's the genre's trope. A crying lead being submissive to her love interest after an unfortunate event is also missing here. Instead, Shirayuki has her own resolve in the show's larger problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe main leads also prove that we don't have to go for two seasons of confusion and misunderstanding to get a very satisfying confession in the end. And boy, what a satisfying event that was.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are episodes which fail to copy the oomph of the series highlights (Episodes 2 and 5 in particular can be erased and it will be better in my opinion) but I expected a generic love story upon hitting the play button. Then my prejudice in this show was destroyed in the first episode. This is how execution can make cliches to something special. A second season is coming in January which I hoped will live what makes this one a good romance title.",

            "content": "This review will not contain any spoilers regarding the series.\r\nStory:\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-hime's story is straightforward and simple, it's concept and how it is formed is something that is very common with the demographic that it resides in. So in that regard, it is not something that has not been seen before. Despite it being so simple and straightforward, it gives the feeling of being magical and soothing. How the events unfolds towards the character is incredibly seamless.\r\nWhile it may follow the specific tropes that come from the demographic, it tries its best to either break the trope and become surprising or execute it in away where it is appreciated. Many people may hate the 'damsel in distress' trope, but this series tries its best to avoid it, as much as the synopsis/first episode gives the impression of it occurring, the continuity of the series avoids it.\\n\\n\r\nAs the name of the show suggests, the show tends to give a feel of it being a Disney movie. It's charming, fuzzy and cute to watch through. The story is definitely light and focuses more about the dynamics of the characters, and how their relationships progress through the events that approach them.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation of the series is incredibly exquisite. As expected from a studio that is well known for it's gorgeous visuals, Bones. It does not follow the usual colorization that someone would expect from this type of show. Yet it fits it perfectly. The colors are bright and the animation is slick smooth.\\n\\n\r\nIt is easy to distinct between the characters and it highlights everything. The visuals are consistent throughout the entire series without a hint of drop in quality. Surprisingly, the visuals compliment the series atmosphere, considering how warm the content of the series is.\\n\\n\r\nIn this situation, the visuals play a factor in the enjoyment of the series, since it visualize everything that is needed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are not my favorite, but they're fine. They're not bad or amazing. They don't feel out of place, the sound is something to be expected from the type of show this is.\\n\\n\r\nOn the contrary the soundtrack for the series is fit and light. It does not overwhelm the atmosphere that the show is trying to represent. It does not stand out, but I'm under the belief that it is intentional, considering that it is not the type of show that the music should take the spotlight. It's only more evidently used in scenery focus moments to capture the feel of the place.\\n\\n\r\nIt may not be a great field on it's own, but that does not necessarily make it bad from my perspective. (Please note that both sound and art category are for most post completely subjective points; they're my opinion)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between the characters is what this show is all about. Or well, to be more accurate. It  is what makes the show special and great to watch. Shirayuki is a fresh of air from the usual heroines that are commonly  in this type of demographic. She's very clever, independent on what she does and holds responsibility of what she does and try to repay any favor that she may hold to anyone. She is not there to be saved and protected for romantic moments, she holds her on and tries her best to be in the same line as the male main lead. Her boldness and ability to solve situations on her own is nothing short of amazing!\\n\\n\r\nThe same falls for other characters. Most of the characters showed how multidimensional their characteristics are instead of being one dimensional characters. Character developments are thankfully still open for the continuation of this series,.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-hime is an anime that is incredibly easy to watch through. It's light and warm as I have mentioned previously. The interactions between the characters are interesting and the dialogue rarely leaves the person to be bored or feel that it is being dull. It may have it's moments that feel \"cheesy\" on book, but the way it is approached is what makes it gorgeous and beautiful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're fan of the shoujo demographic and the Disney-like settings, with a  strong-willed heroine, then this show should be right up the alley.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review, any feedback is appreciated on my profile!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The second time I decided to watch all the way through, because I rarely disagree with anime that are rated highly on myanimelist. I go through the anime on this site that are highly rated, when I'm wanting to watch an anime and have no idea to watch. This is actually the first time I have disagreed with the overall good rating of a show.\r\nI don\u2019t get the hype. At all. \r\nSometimes, even if I don\u2019t like an anime, I can seewhy other people like it: It\u2019s just not my taste.  I don\u2019t click with the characters. I\u2019m not particularly fond of the art style. Etc etc. But I honestly just can\u2019t understand why this show rated so well.

Love shoujo and romance, so this should have been right up my alley. But it\u2019s not.\\n\\n\r\nThis may contain the slightest bit of spoilers, but only because I can\u2019t criticize what is wrong with it, without mentioning plot points. I will keep them as vague as possible.\\n\\n\r\nEverything is so pseudo-melodramatic it\u2019s irritating. The \u201cproblems\u201d the main character faces are presented as super dramatic, even life threatening, blah blah blah, but then get resolved so easily it\u2019s laughable. They try to make Shirayuki \u201cdifferent\u201d from the typical damsel in distress in that she tries to solve problems on her own, but ultimately in the end, the prince always shows up at the last minute to save her. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone is in awe of Shirayuki because of her red hair and because of her character, but all she does is act like a typical, normal person. She doesn\u2019t do anything extraordinary. Everyone else acts weird and super stereotypical towards the archetype they\u2019re created as, so her utterly normal actions get glorified like they\u2019re wondrous/amazing/so odd and quirky and charming, when they\u2019re just normal, human responses to problems. So many of the side characters and minor characters are irritating, judgmental insufferable idiots, so of course, Shirayuki, who is just a plain, nice person, is a hundred times better than they are. Anyone set up against those types of people will shine.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, it\u2019s not an exaggeration. Skip this one paragraph if you want to avoid spoilers completely, because it will contain a slight minor scenario spoiler (but doesn\u2019t affect anything about the story). In episode 4, a sick patient comes to get medicine. Yet, instead of being grateful to the herbalist he insults them horribly to Shirayuki. Like\u2026 how believable is it that a patient will show up to the doctor, then directly insult the doctor to one of the staff, instead of just getting the medicine they need. Like I said, side characters and even minor characters are set up to be so unbelievably stupid and rude so as to contrast with Shirayuki\u2019s not-so-amazing character to make it seem amazing. And of course Shirayuki won\u2019t stand for the insults and insinuations against her senior (as any plain, normal person wouldn\u2019t) so she\u2019s seen as super amazing and different and shocking when she takes offense towards the incredibly offensive comments. \\n\\n\r\nSo of course, since a normal, nice person is apparently the rarest of the rare in this world, the prince (and everyone else) end up being so utterly charmed and surprised by Shirayuki [insert massive eyeroll here]. It's really not amazing when someone doesn't want to be insulted or treated poorly, nor is it amazing when someone doesn't like it when their friends are insulted/treated poorly, but apparently, in Shirayuki, it's utterly amazing and unique and seemingly in this world, Shirayuki is the only person in history/existence to ever feel that way, so everyone is in complete awe of this aspect of her character episode after episode after episode.     -_________-\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this, the story is lacking. It revolves around Shirayuki doing these \u201camazing\u201d things, that really aren\u2019t so amazing, so there\u2019s nothing to build off of. We don\u2019t learn much about the characters besides the prince. We don\u2019t have a solid plot to follow. It\u2019s just Shirayuki getting into predicaments, then she struggles with solving them, solves them a bit but then gets stuck again, then gets rescued by the prince. Then she encounters more new people. Some of these new people cause her problems, which then repeats the cycle. To mix it up a bit, they throw in problems that are ALWAYS plant/medical related, so unsurprisingly, Shirayuki as a herbalist, is always able to easily solve them.  \\n\\n\r\nThey try to develop some side plots revolving around the prince and related royal conflicts, but they\u2019re so shallow and laughably simple and barely concentrated on (and of course, following the pattern of this anime, easily resolved) it\u2019s just an annoyance. \\n\\n\r\nYou never even have the slightest bit of worry that problems won\u2019t resolve themselves because they\u2019re so incredibly simple. It's marketed as a drama anime, but there's nothing dramatic about the story, just that things are presented in an overtly dramatic fashion.\\n\\n\r\nMeh.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing by far in this anime is the artwork and the setting/world building. Stylistically, it\u2019s not the best or the highest grade of artwork, but it\u2019s richly detailed and the details of the kingdom setting are nicely developed and pleasing to see. However, nice artwork can't save a show that is lacking in every other aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I don\u2019t like it. Plot is lacking and undeveloped, and what is developed is always predictable. Problems follow the same repeat pattern over a over. Problems also lack any depth or complexity. Characters follow their stereotypes, so it's easy to \"get to know\" them, but that leaves them incredibly one dimensional and predictable.\\n\\n\r\nI guess though, I could recommend it to people to watch if they\u2019re in a really bad mood/having a bad day/week and want to watch something that is incredibly easy to follow and doesn't require thinking if you're exhausted, and everything predictably always works out so your day won't get worse than it already is. Like how adults watch simple kids cartoons sometimes when they're feeling bad, because it's simple and easy and you know you don't have to think or feel or see anything that might disappoint/hurt your heart/worry you, about the characters or story.",

It wasn't bad, it was just boring! I found a complete lack of plot, and the only thing it hadwas romance. I mean don't get me wrong I love romance anime but there has to be a scenario that can back it up.\\n\r\nArt 7/10: the art was what initially made me want to watch it, it's not something unique but that's not really a bad thing in this case, it's good art.\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10: well I liked Zen, the whole prince with a tragic past was nice and was at least making an effort for a storyline even though it failed, Shirayuki on the other hand was boring, she is a strong character which is a good change from the weak high school girl we usually see in shoujo, but I felt like she didn't really have a purpose in life, she was going on and on about a place to belong which would have been nice if her previous home was terrible and people there hated her, but she was really loved and apart from the thing with the prince she had a nice life there. Also the only thing that she seems to be interested in is alchemy which would have been nice if it wasn't ONLY centring around medicinal herbs.\\n\r\nSo overall it is not the kind of anime that you will hate, and if have free time and just want to watch romance than give it a shot, but if there is something better in your \"to watch\" list then see that one.",

            "content": "I am reviewing this show after the final episode that aired a few days ago. Akagami no Shirayuki-hime, translated to Snow White with Red Hair in English, was a romance anime running in the summer anime season of 2015. It was the only romance anime running in the season, or at least the only noticeable anime to have romance as its main genres. This I believe is the reason the show got the kind of views that it did, as it was the only choice this season for the romance enthusiastic. \r\nLet's get started.\r\nThis time around there will be four categories that I will scoreseparately and collect their averages to give a final score out of 10. The categories are, Story, Characters, Production and Enjoyment. I decided to remove production from the bigger category of Enjoyment, because I feel like it deserves its own section and also because, just because the production value of an anime is high doesn't mean it is enjoyable. Please tell me if there is anything else I should change, this structure is still a work in progress. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThere was no overarching story in Akagami no Shirayuki-hime, referred to as Akagami from now onward. Each episode or a pair of episodes has its own conflict that in the end builds up the characters as individual characters and their relationships with other major characters.\\n\\n\r\nThough having episodic stories does not automatically mean that the anime is bad with story, though to have it done right, a very unorthodox method of storytelling has to be used. I am referring to the classic anime Mushishi when I say this and the exact opposite would be that thing called Nisekoi, in which episodic stories do not work out, even with an overarching story line. Akagami however did not tell its tale in the way Mushishi did and did not have a main plot. Everything just happened, one after another.\\n\r\nThere almost isn't a story for me to score, and in all honesty I gave the story a score of 1 when I first started writing this review. I increased it after realizing that the main focus of this anime is to build a relationship between Zen and Shirayuki.\\n\\n\r\nThe building of Zen and Shirayuki's relationship is actually kind of weird. The relationship itself is actually very nice but the way it developed, and how the writers decided to play it out, is a bit wobbly. I have to assume that there are a lot of timeskips in the 12 episodes of this anime. Though there is no significant mention of them, it did feel like a lot of time had passed after each side arc. The way that played out, was quite confusing, and it would have been better for them to state how much time had passed in some way after each event that took place.\\n\r\nThis actually ended up causing a bit of problems for me when it came to character and relationship development. I did not know for how long had Shirayuki and Zen known each other for by the time Zen ended up confessing his feelings. I would assume that it was months, but no information was given and because of that I couldn't asses the type of relationship Zen and Shirayuki were having.\\n\\n\r\nI could talk a lot about how bad the story component of this anime is, but to put it simply, there was no clear cut story to this anime. It was episodic, in the type that Slice of Life anime are written. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI knew that the story of this anime was going to be very... shit, at around episode 5, but I continued watching the show for two reasons. One being the characters and the other being the production value, which I'll talk about later. There are three main characters of the show; Prince Charming, Disney Princess and Obi the G.O.A.T.\\n\\n\r\nShirayuki, is the lead character. At first glance and at an overall look she is an extremely generic Disney princess type of character. Ordinary village girl, that happens to be very beautiful and kind, and ends up having the prince fall in love with her. \\n\\n\r\nBut the thing is, Shirayuki's character is so extremely generic that at this point it is done on purpose. You would expect here character to be just your average damsel in distress type of character, but then all of a sudden she does something unpredictable. For example, the time she jumped from the top of the tower into the water below, or the time she made a good escape attempt from her kidnapper.\\n\r\nThis makes Shirayuki a very interesting character to watch. Not only that but in nature Shirayuki is a normal girl, she jokes around, she gets angry, learns new things, gets embarrassed and basically behaves like a normal person would. Which also makes her a likable and relatable character for some.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is her Prince Charming; Zen. He is again a typical Disney Prince, that likes being out of the castle exploring rather than sitting in his castle signing papers and being served high class tea. Though unlike Shirayuki, Zen doesn't throw loops in that character structure of every Disney Prince. Instead Zen is like Shirayuki, a likable and relatable character.... most of the times.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, Obi is the best character of the show. Not only because he is absolutely hilarious, loyal but he also doesn't give a shit about any thing at all. There is a lot of mystery left unsolved for Obi by the time this season ends, but I do expect it to be explored more in upcoming seasons. \\n\r\nWhat's really amazing about Obi is that he is slowly falling in love with Shirayuki. But it's different than Zen. Originally it seemed as though Zen fell in love with Shirayuki for her looks, which isn't something I would want to complain about, but the fact that Obi is falling in love with Shirayuki slowly because of her actions, puts shame to Zen (sorry this is just me talking about my favorite ship).\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters in this show are surprisingly good for only 12 episodes running time. That's mostly because they were all made to be likable characters and most of them follow tropes in anime that everyone sees quite often, and because of that we can fully understand the character's personality without even seeing much of them. \\n\r\nThere were no characters that I felt needed to be explored more, which I feel is always a problem in short, seasonal anime. Each character was given enough time for what they were worth and how interesting they were. Obi being the only exception, who didn't get enough development, but I am fine with it because it adds mystery to his character and gives me something to look forward to in new seasons of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nProduction: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Akagami was amazing. Even among the marvelously animated shows running this season, I always get impressed by the art style and animation that Akagami offers every episode. The art style in the first episode reminded me a lot of a Hayao Miyazaki film, especially the way the backgrounds were drawn, but it slowly faded away from that and everything started looking more computer drawn, though still well done. \\n\\n\r\nThe VA for Shirayuki was the only VA that stood out from the show. The way she handled the comedic scenes vs the serious scenes always matched the type of character Shirayuki was. And if you already didn't know the VA for Shirayuki is Saori Hayami who has also done some other amazing voice acting roles and is also the one who performed the anime's opening theme. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending sequences for the show are just average, nothing that stands out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the episodic nature of the show, there was a point where everything became boring. There is a point in the show where you realize that everything that is happening is most likely irrelevant to everything and will never be mentioned again. Also the redundant use of Shirayuki's morals about her path, got to the point where it was annoying to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, I did feel the need to come back to the show every episode. To enjoy the characters and the beautiful animation that Akagami offered.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Scores:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nProduction: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nTotal: 6.3/10\\n",

In addition, the 1st episode drops a few hints from the original show too. Shirayuki\u2019s flashy red hair gets everyone\u2019s attention including the Prince of the country (Prince Raj) who intends to make her his concubine! Shirayuki escapes and meets with Prince Zen who happens to be the 2nd prince of the neighbouring country and that\u2019s where the story progresses. She accompanies with Zen where she practices to become a skilledherbalist and must accommodate living around with a prince and his world. And amid all this, an adorable romance springs up between Shirayuki and Zen! For a fantasy genre, it\u2019s fairy tale aspects are weakly portrayed but whatever they get by feels right! The show also doesn\u2019t shy away from its clich\u00e9s but since they own it, I can\u2019t complain much. I still would have preferred more of grey villains rather than the corny one\u2019s here. Moreover, I really hated the ridiculous attempt at the forced love triangle that\u2019s probably going to be touched in the next season because it totally comes across unwarranted, included just to introduce cheap love drama! Now the good stuff and the 1st best thing about the show is its representation of romance which is beautifully grasped, taking a mature route with the 2 leads fully realized relationship. Comedy is lightly sprinkled throughout the course of the season but gets its job done. (Especially those 2 guards!) \\n\r\nThe 2nd strength comes in its character\u2019s depiction, for they are wonderfully realized. Shirayuki could have easily been turned into a Mary-Sue but thankfully they refrain from it! Instead we get an awesome person who\u2019s very likable with her positive hard work ethics, strong yet infectious personality, all in all a badass with bright red hair! They pull this off by not OPing her but rather showcase her exuding confidence in one sided fights, making her that much more attractive. Furthermore, her strong stand on achieving her goals without taking any short cuts just further proves how motivated she is as an individual. And she\u2019s wholly supported by Prince Zed who once again, thankfully wasn\u2019t utilized to a one note, paper thin character. With distinct set of skills, he was well-defined to the result of personable and likable. His love for exploring his city and mingling with the crowd solidifies the existence of his big heart! Zen has a strict yet kind, though direct behaviour who honorably sticks to his promises and this made him the perfect partner for her! Aside from them, we have good side characters too. Kiki and Mitsuhide relationship with Zen is well defined, especially Mitsuhide who gets his own arc later in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very welcoming, with its colourful backgrounds and vibrant overall nature of the anime. With the addition of music, they naturally set a romantic tone to the entire show which I appreciated. The dubs were great here, both the voice actors for Shirayuki and Zen do justice to their characters, never leaving them out of field. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance really is well handled, coming across downright adorable due to the amazing chemistry between the two! They have you rooting for the 2 leads at episode 1 itself! The build-up was patiently worked out, starting off as good friends and getting to know each other, then the playful banter between them, going on adventures while sharing those sweet and tender moments with each other and finally the confession. I also liked the fact that the show doesn\u2019t play around with the romance arc, they get right to it with the leads speaking out about their feelings. So please, please and please, don\u2019t tarnish all you have accomplished with a terrible love triangle! I also took notice of the times where Shirayuki needs to be saved but they are done in a way where she doesn\u2019t come across as weak. And when the story calls for it, you get pretty good action too. I was pleasantly surprised with this anime even when it\u2019s not my type of thing! I do hope though that Shirayuki grows her hair back in s2! Definitely recommend this, great for anniversaries or Valentines too! \\n",

            "content": "I'm not gonna lie: the anime industry isn't what it used to be. Now, I don't mean to sound like one of those crotchety old people who say \"back in my day things were much better!\" However, there's no denying it: anime now just isn't as good as it was years ago. True, there were some duds, but creators back in the 70s, 80s, and even 90s were able to churn out many episodes of whatever the heck they wanted, loved doing it, put a lot of effort into them, and as a result, many of them are well known and beloved, with some titlesbeing Rose of Versailles, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Gundam, the World Masterpiece Theater, Pokemon, Sailor Moon, Digimon, etc. There's a reason they're all so well known and loved, and that's because people back then did everything they could to write passionate, riveting stories with three dimensional characters, and were able to utilize their time and tell the story they wanted...most of the time, that is. Now? Anime only get 11-13 episodes, with the occasional DVD episode here and there, and most of it is just wish fulfillment, self-insertion fare full of cute girls with big boobs, bland guys who get harems for no reason, moe stereotypes, phoned in voice acting, panty shots, questionable writing, stupid plotlines, etc. They make the most money now, and unless the industry changes somehow, I don't see the trend ending anytime soon. However, this doesn't mean quality anime don't exist anymore. There's fewer in number, yes, but they're still popping up despite the lack of success. One of those shows is Snow White with the Red Hair, or Akagami no Shirayuki-Hime...and I'm not gonna lie: this is seriously one of the best anime to come out in YEARS.\\n\\n\r\nThe story centers on a young woman named Shirayuki, who is well known for her work as a herbalist and...her red hair. Nobody in her country of Tanbarun has such red hair, and this makes her the center of unwanted attention. When the moronic Prince Raj falls in love with her and wants to make her his concubine, she refuses to let herself be subjected to a cruel fate, so she gives him the middle finger by cutting her hair and runs away to the next kingdom, Clarines, as she has nowhere else to go. While traversing through the forests, she finds herself befriending the crown prince of Clarines, Zen, who offers to let her into his kingdom to protect her from Raj. She isn't quite sure what his intentions are, but she does want to pay her debt to him, so she becomes a court herbalist in his castle. With this, her adventures in the Clarines kingdom begin.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I hear, Bones is a very well liked animation company. I've seen some of their works, such as Angelic Layer, the Escaflowne movie, and Ouran High School Host Club. But I wouldn't consider myself a big fan of them. However, I can tell you that the popularity Bones gets is 100% justified, as their work on Shirayuki-Hime has to be one of the best I've ever seen from them. The series has a soft, shiny, serene animation style that blends perfectly with the low fantasy setting, and the architecture design is great. The fluidity of the characters' movements, bird wings flapping, and other things are absolutely sumptuous. Even little things such as a character's hair swaying in the breeze, and tears flowing from someone's eyes are animated with such tender loving care that you can almost feel it. Seriously, Bones. You've earned my respect.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending theme songs are wonderfully sung and animated, with the first one simply telling its story in little time as opening themes should, and the ending theme adopting a more artsy, Art Nouveau style that still matches the story's serene atmosphere. Both art styles compliment the series well, and the music does its job. The soundtrack itself isn't anything home to write about, but it fits the setting just fine, and I didn't find any pieces that I didn't like. Everything seemed to just fit into place. I did notice one thing about the soundtrack: it's always mellow and subtle, never bombastic, even during compelling fight scenes (and there's only ONE action scene in the entire series, which says a lot about the series and what its like for those new to it). I think the music composers did a good job in keeping the soundtrack like this, as even though Shirayuki-Hime is a fantasy, its more political and character-oriented in nature. There's no slaying dragons, no warring kingdoms, no princesses with magical powers, etc. Nobody said having those things was a bad thing, but nobody said NOT having them is bad, either. Shirayuki-Hime knows what it is: a mellow fantasy story about a commoner girl and a prince who has to deal with his responsibilities.\\n\\n\r\nI know I praise the characters a lot in my reviews of anime, but for me, if an anime doesn't have good characters, then it doesn't win any points for me. Thankfully, Shirayuki-Hime's cast is fairly well rounded and great in their own right, and defy many stereotypes in shoujo manga. Shirayuki is friendly, kind, brave, and not afraid to do what she wants, but this trait can also get her into trouble, and she still has moments of vulnerability throughout the series that keep her from being perfect. Zen is a slightly mischievous and playful prince, but unlike most princes, we see him having to deal with his responsibilities, such as going to territory under his jurisdiction and making peace between countries using whatever methods he can. He is constantly under pressure, and his status as a prince is both a blessing and a curse, as a tragic event in his past involving a person whom he thought was a friend made him realize being a prince has both benefits and drawbacks for not just himself, but others. Seriously, how many cartoons in any country even go into this kind of stuff?! The only shows I can think of that also tackle the issues royalty face are My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic and Rose of Versailles. For someone who doesn't know much about how royal business goes in the real world, I think the show did a great job in showing the trials and tribulations a prince (or princess) have to go through in order to fulfill their duties. The other characters like Mitsuhide, Kiki, and Obi are also wonderful in their own right. There's even two guards who sometimes pop up every now and again who have very funny scenes and play off of each other very well. Even minor characters are given complex personalities and serve a purpose in the show, while still managing to come off as...well, people! I wish I could write characters like this.\\n\\n\r\nI personally couldn't find anything the show that I actually hated or put me off. But I know some episodes are very character driven and slow paced, and this isn't a show for people who like high octane action or constant melodrama going on. Everything is presented in a down to earth manner, and there's no dragons or magic or alchemy or anything like that. Plus, I liked the soundtrack, but I wouldn't consider it the greatest soundtrack ever. Not only that, the show is very short, having only 12 episodes so far. I say so far because, wonder of wonders, it has a second season coming up, so it'll be able to explore more of its story! Though from what I hear the manga is still ongoing, with 12 volumes out, so the anime, even with 24 episodes, probably won't be able to tell the entire story. But nonetheless, I still find whatever it does tell to be very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a gem in a sea of excrement, Shirayuki-Hime is the anime for you. It's not perfect, but it's a diamond in the rough that deserves all the love and appreciation it can get. You won't regret watching it...but you do require patience and appreciation for atmosphere.",

            "content": "Like many Shoujo shows, they are sweet. Sweet as in they are sugar coated in ingredients that entices people who easily go for anything similar to its flavor. Not that people who follow Shoujo are easy to impress, but it's a genre that many akin to when they do not want a complex story or complex characters. There are some exceptions to this and become classics in their own right. However, there are others that try to do this formula, such as Akagami no Shirayuki-hime, and come across as painfully average in the process.\r\nWhen I say that it is average, or just borderline okay, Imean that there are parts of it that work tremendously to help facilitate the anime from being bad but there are other rusted parts that feel unstable and slightly bring it down a notch. If you do not fit into the demographic that this show typically panders to, most of the problems I'll mention might not be an issue for you. Nevertheless, if you're like me and want to be surprised by an anime of any genre, there are many things to pick out of Akagami no Shirayuki-hime that range from positive or negative.\\n\\n\r\nLet us start with the positive aspects, beginning with Akagami's main heroine, Shirayuki. As far as female characters go, she is what many would figure out as the perfect example of a strong female character. But do not be discouraged if you think the show is going to rub it into your face about how strong she is. Shirayuki's strong charisma and optimism feel very natural and less tact-on to be in league with many other strong anime females in the past. Voiced by the always lovely, Saori Hayami, she adds an excellent level of innocence and personality that gives Shirayuki a likable presence along with her actions. They even play with the damsel in distress plot arc and give it a nice twist to it that makes her capable and true to her character arc. Not that she is a woman because she does this but because she just so happens to be female and succeeds in doing so is where Akagami flourishes.\\n\\n\r\nLike many Shoujo anime, the art style is usually fitting for the characters to look relatively minimalistic and less-overblown, to which Akagami is no exception. However, the art style has nice little tidbits to it that give it a nice pastel atmosphere from the character designs and how the world is drawn. I would not say that it is precisely like a Studio Ghibli production, but various elements seem like inspirations to the studio. The character expression all feel very natural and fluid, not to mention the saturated colors of the characters and backgrounds feel almost as if they were done with a paintbrush that gives it a 1980s aesthetic in modern times.\\n\\n\r\nThat is where, unfortunately, all of the positives grind to a halt. Where most of the problems lie is the plot itself. Is it badly written? Do the characters not have enough development? Is it boring? Both of these can be answered with: Yes, yes, and yes. It is poorly written from the prospect that the plot feels very bland and not well-thought out. From the half-way point into Akagami, I found myself apathetic to what was going on because the plot has nothing to it other than we're just watching Shirayuki try to fit in with this new town that she is living in. And while I do love Shirayuki as a character, nothing else that she does that tries to further the plot does nothing to resonate me with it.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, another big crux to the plot are the other characters besides Shirayuki. It was almost as if the writers took most of their time to focus on how great she is, but forgot that there were other characters to shine as well. Her knight in shining armor, Zen Clarines, is a prime example of this where his entire personality is entirely overshadowed by her's. It comes down to how Zen is portrayed as a knight hopelessly in love with her and the lines and things he does, unknowingly, to win Shirayuki's heart is about as cliched as one can get out of a Shoujo anime. The other characters that fall into the same spectrum as Zen, such as Obi and Rouen, are just as dull and uninteresting as he is; so much so that I had to look up their names so I could write them down on this review.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned about Zen being overshadowed by Shirayuki, their relationship that reaches its climax by the end of Akagami does not heighten my positive reflections of Shirayuki or lower my perception of Zen. It just feels like your typical romance relationship that does not feel surprising by the time you reach the last two episodes. It goes about as you would expect if you are familiar with this kind of story. Not that I was wanting a new way of telling this type of romantic story, but if it wants to do something similar, at least give Zen a better archetype that helps in keeping this from being monotonous.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Akagami no Shirayuki-hime boasts one of the best female characters this year, the plot does not win the best of the year. If it were not also for the magnificent art design, this would have been an extremely forgettable anime to pick out. It was a polarizing experiencing that could have been something more than what it already is if time was spent to write better supporting characters. Akagami was a missed opportunity in being unique, no doubt. It just cannot seem to pass the curse of being another generic Shoujo anime.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: C\\n",

Akagami no Shirayuki-hime is not your typical anime nowadays that over-dramatize everything to invoke humor/or just to bring a point across. \r\nThis anime focuses on its more relaxed nature and keeping its innocence. It's like giving a bad review/score for a romance anime because it doesn'thave good fighting scenes. Her review is just flawed in that sense. I will only agree that the plot is abit on the bland side, though a well tradeoff to preserve its relaxed innocent nature. \\n\\n\r\nIf you were looking for an action-packed anime like Shingeki no Kyojin, then this isn't the anime for you. And perhaps meegan reviewed this based on that.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you are into romance and slice of life genre then I'd recommend this to you. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-hime Review: \\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki is unlike your typical cliche romance anime whereby girl meet boy, goes crazy for boy or is only there for ecchi bullshit cliches. It focuses on its calm and more relaxed nature as suggested by its bgm even at the very start of the first episode. Its romance sets them miles apart from your typical shoujo.\\n\\n\r\nOver here, the romance is very pure and innocent. Our beloved characters can hold proper conversations without any cliche moments/ecchi fanservice. The interaction between the characters are very refreshing in that sense. The scenes and conversations are well-crafted and thought-out and sure knows exactly when to be romantic as hell when the appropriate moment arises. \\n\\n\r\nEvery episode makes you go \"awww\" and leaves its viewers a warm fuzzy feeling inside. The love between the protagonists, Zen and Shirayuki are so pure and lovely. Truly the best couple of 2015.\\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-hime is the epitome of romance and truly a gem in anime history of its genre.\\n\\n\r\nA well deserved 10/10.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: Shirayuki(Hayami, Saori), a strong-willed girl with exceptionally rare red hair, led a normal life as a town herbalist in the kingdom of Tanbarun until her beauty attracted the attention of the first prince Raji (Fukuyama, Jun) who requested that she become one of his concubines. Unable to outright refuse his demand due to her social status, she fled the kingdom and had a chance-encounter with a stranger by the name of Zen (Osaka, Ryota) who, after curing him of a poisoned apple meant for her, is discovered to be the second prince of the kingdom ofClarines. In Zen's company, Shirayuki continues on to Clarines and attempts to start her life anew.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nShirayuki, the protagonist of the story, offers refreshing enough characterization - she is intelligent, kind-hearted, and resourceful but her uniqueness resides in how she interacts with the rest of the cast. She avoids the majority of the character tropes associated with the romantic lead and female love interest through her conviction and at times assertive personality both of which I found to be compelling character traits. Moreover, while she may not exemplify the traits of the more typical romantic lead, she does offer a number of instances where she operates within a role-reversal between herself and prince Zen. Though she does not become masculine in this way, her actions more closely resemble that of the a male-lead. An explicit example of this reversal was when she climbed a tree to visit Zen on his balcony. Perhaps my only and most notable qualm concerning Shirayuki is that she exists too closely to a character paradigm and doesn't offer much in the way of character flaws or moments of weakness - her character very purposefully exists in order to overcome the obstacles that would make other typical female characters stumble and in this way is a shade too 'perfect'. \\n\\n\r\nThe lack of complications does not solely reside in Shirayuki and is also present in a decent number of the other cast members. The lack of this trait actually accounts for what I believe to be one of the shows major stumbling points in that, by nature of all of the main characters being goodhearted, sincere, and supportive the tone of the show becomes quite flat. Though they contribute greatly to the feel-good romance nature of the show there aren't all that many diverse characters within the cast. Even someone like Obi who initially was more of a scoundrel-esc character quickly becomes homogenized after his introduction.\\n\\n\r\nTo speak briefly about Zen, there was one major area in which I felt his characterization was quite interesting and well done. He represents a pretty typical depiction of the prince of a kingdom - dashing, good-mannered, and kind and there isn't much else that infringes upon this however I found it remarkable that despite Shirayuki receiving a good number of role reversal scenarios that he was not weakened or made less dominant within their relationship because of it. He possesses equal to or greater agency to anyone else in the story and his resilience and integrity of character in this regard was quite compelling as it, along with Shirayuki's role in the relationship, resulted in something slightly more unique than i would have expected from what is otherwise quite a typical Shoujo romance.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation of the show was delivered in top form and avoided any and all noticeable quality drops throughout its 12 episode run. There were a great many uses of dynamic lighting which added significantly to the more important scenes and the scenes of greatest import were visually delivered quite beautifully. While the character designs were enjoyable by themselves I did find the presence of a fairly dynamic wardrobe to be a decent visual bonus as it made the show feel a bit more alive.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nWhile Shirayuki offers a handful of uncommon character traits the story fails to follow suit and plays out in fairly predictable and typical ways with perhaps the exceptions where it attempts to specifically highlight Shirayuki's characterization. One fortunate thing to note is that the story does offer plenty of romantic progression and so it avoids the route of starving the viewer while simultaneously tantalizing them each episode; in this area the pacing is good. The story initially exhibits some folk-tale influence through the use of poisoned apples and a snow-white-esc premise however this element seems to quickly be forgotten and I think it would have perhaps been more interesting had there been a greater number of allegories or references in this way. \\n\\n\r\nAkagami's story most likely falters for me due to its character reliance. Because the show is less concerned with offering an engaging plot or exploring the world being present and more focused on developing its main two characters both as people and as a romantic couple it comes off as highly reliant on the success or failure of its cast. With that being said, the cheerful and supportive tones in each and every one of the main characters makes for pretty bland and unexciting dialogue. The story doesn't drag but is a bit uneventful outside of furthering character relationships and so not only does it proceed quite typically in the form of many other shoujou romances but offers very little to break away outside of its main character.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music fit the show really well and while it didn't blow me away I think it added significantly to the show. The soundtrack was used especially well to play up key moments of the show to better dramatize them. I think this element of the show could be described as working well for the show while falling short of being interesting in an objective sense.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day Akagami plays out as a typical feel-good romantic show while offering several areas of interest such as its protagonist. Shirayuki's characterization and avoidance of tropes was delivered in a bit of a hamfisted manner however this also allowed the show to more directly parody the stereotypical romantic relationship and so I am of the mind to forgive it in this way. I think the show still offers plenty of potential going forward into its upcoming second cour where the characters could very well better diversify themselves and a more interesting plot might develop. I remain hopeful for the show in the future. \\n\\n\r\nRating: 6\\n\\n\r\nI gave Akagami a 6 because, while it was uneventful in many regards it also avoided being forgettable. Shirayuki and Zen carry the show to a degree and I feel that it's worth watching almost solely because of how it plays with the dynamic of their relationship though it doesn't offer a great deal beyond this. It was a decent show and certainly may turn into something more engaging in the future though ultimately there are better romance stories out there though few that play with its characters in this specific way.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Akagami first and foremost to those interested in the romance genre, more specifically to those who prefer shows that don't spend their time endlessly dancing around the subject of romance but instead are frequently involved with it and see fairly frequent relationship progression. There are a handful of action scenes though they mostly exist to reinforce the setting rather than add to the show's actual diversity of tone and so I don't think it exhibits anything special in this regard. The show is fairly light on drama though some does manifest by means of the romantic tones and so while some drama exists Akagami falls a bit short in terms of quantity to actually exhibit the genre fully.",

            "content": "Supposedly Akagami no Shirayuki is one of the better shoujo animes out there, and I can reluctantly admit to this. However, this also makes me incredibly sad about where shoujo anime is currently at. And the reason, AnS is one of the better shoujo animes is because Shirayuki isn't an idiot and sometimes she does things on her own without the help of the prince. (Note: I do admit the art is very pretty to look at, and Shirayuki + Zen are kinda cute together)\r\nMany reviewers have mentioned how Shirayuki is an independent, strong and intelligent character, and it seems each episode attempts to demonstratethis but somewhat fails. In the second episode( which was an incredibly pointless episode that did not progress the plot whatsoever) Shirayuki gets captured and manages to escape her captor before the prince goes to save her anyway. Am I supposed to be convinced that she isn't a damsel in distress? Also, episode three; another episode in which the show tries to demonstrate again how brave she is, when she gets banned from the castle, but somehow enters anyway, and has a 'showdown'( I say this lightly) with Marquis Haruka. Basically Haruka threatens her and says that intruders should be dealt with immediately, raises his sword towards her (at this point, in which I was like 'HIT HER!') and Shirayuki somehow proves herself by stepping towards it, and Haruka withdraws his sword. HUH??! OH Shirayuki you are so brave and so unordinary. WHAT? \\n\\n\r\nIn a way, the problem with this show is less to do with Shirayuki as a character but more with the lack of tension and conflict in the show. She's a fine character, but I fail to see the specialness that everyone else seems to. The plot isn't strong enough, and the characters aren't interesting enough by themselves. I'm not suggesting that it needs to be more psycho pass- esque but a touch of sabotage(hello prime opportunity during the herbalist test!!!), or even people who don't automatically fall in love with her (yes, you lot- Zen, Ryu, Obi, Mitsuhide, Kiki) would make this a better show.\\n",

            "content": "I'm as much a sucker for romance and quasi-reverse-harem anime as the next girl, but nothing about Akagami no Shirayukihime really drew me in. I suppose the biggest compliment I can give to Akagami no Shirayukihime is that I finished the series. It wasn't bad enough on any level to compel me to stop. That being said, there wasn't too much about it that had me invested in the story, the characters, or any other component of the series. \r\nThe emotional relationship between Shirayuki and the Prince, Zen, is developed to around 90% completion in the first episode -- that is to say, they arepretty much instantly and unreasonably attached to each other from the get-go, which leaves very little room for development as the series goes along. The result is a very boring shoujo anime. \\n\\n\r\nThere's no interesting conflicts between the two. You get no warm-happy feeling watching their relationship blossom. There's no  \"FINALLY!\" moment when the characters reach the realization that they're in love. It pretty much seems to happen INSTANTLY (even if it's not *directly* vocalized), and the rest of the series wanders down this path of \"I-want-to-be-an-herbalist-and-everyone-falls-in-love-with-me!\" which -- while not particularly offensive -- isn't super gripping.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say the series is 'fine,' but I don't think it merits the rating it has. There is no development in the series, in characters' relationships, or in the characters themselves, really. The only characters who seem to change are the ones who go from \"I have my doubts about this Shirayuki person\" to \"Shirayuki is hard-working and great and I might have a crush on her!\" -- and there are quite a few of those, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is actually pretty nice (I'll give it that), but that can't rescue the series. I won't be watching season 2. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Most shoujo female protagonists tend to be weak, so let's make ours the strongest willed person to ever walk across this god-forsaken world.\"\r\nI guess this was roughly the general idea when creators were coming up with the premise of Akagami no Shirayuki-Hime. And I'd gladly support that under normal circumstances. Having a female character who doesn't blush every three minutes does spark a lot of interest and promise in an otherwise very average piece of fiction. Sadly enough, the show is not able to capitalize on its strong premise and instead gives us a world full of empty characters and meaningless emotions. Which is ashame, because this anime really wasn't doomed from the start.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't take a lot of time to realize that the supposedly strongest aspect of the show, that being Shirayuki, is actually the one bringing it down the most. Why? Well, let's start the actual review, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nShirayuki is absolutely perfect. She's strong-willed, intelligent, beautiful, caring, kind, brave, considerate, moral, gutsy, useful, cute when drunk, cool and I don't know what else. Everybody is obsessed with her. It doesn't matter if it's a kid, old woman or a prince of a country, everybody is astonished because of how perfect of a person she is, and how uniquely red her hair is. The first prince fell in love with her just after hearing about her beautiful hair. That's right, he hasn't even seen her at the time and he already knew she was the prettiest girl alive. The second prince fell for her just after a first glance at the striking red of her hair. Random people casually show up out of nowhere just to kidnap her because her hair is just that fabulous. I really do throw around the word 'hair' a lot. Well, watch the show and see for yourself, there is legitimately not an episode that would go without someone admiring Shirayuki's bEAUtIfUl hair. \\n\\n\r\nBack to her characterization as a whole, I thought she was a pretty endearing character at the start. She is different than most females in shoujo romances, and that is a welcome change. It really seemed like the creators genuinely cared about making her a strong character. However, it only took a handful of episodes to realize that it was just a tricky bait. Shirayuki's writing goes nowhere. She's presented as strong in will and never in any other way. Basically every single episode adds just another positive personality trait to her already admirable arsenal. She's never portrayed as a character who's struggling, never makes a bad decision, always comes up with solutions for problems. She is just that amazing. Maybe she could be considered a 'strong' character if we were to talk about her strength in personality. However, she is not a strong character when it comes to writing. Strongly written characters are believable, which means they have flaws. Every human being has flaws. Shirayuki doesn't. She's perfect in every sense of the word, and I find that disgustingly sickening. \\n\\n\r\nWell, now that we got the main point of this show out of the way, you could basically look at any other shoujo romance review because the originality of this show ends exactly when you stop talking about Shirayuki.\\n\\n\r\nHer male counter-part Zen is, surprise surprise, the manliest male in the world, exactly how it tends to be with shoujo characters. Just like Shirayuki, he's perfect. Almost everything I said about her can be said about him. He's also an amazing prince who genuinely cares for all his peasants even though every other politically active character is presented as arrogant and greedy. He's amazing, absolutely flawless. Even his obsession with Shirayuki, which could technically be considered a flaw, or at least weird, is made to be a positive trait in this case because why would the writers of this anime want anyone to have flaws?\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's a pretty convenient question actually, because once we move aside our main 5 characters (of which 3 are not even worth talking about) suddenly its pretty normal for people to have them. Almost every episode presents multiple characters that could be thrown into a pile called \"horrible people\". Shirayuki gets kidnapped by evil guys on daily basis, people who act selfish and arrogant are that much more normal. The point is, these people only exist so that the main two characters could seem that much more incredible. There's someone acting like a douche? Well, be sure that Shirayuki is close enough to start yelling at him and show her strong demeanor. There's someone talking bad about Shirayuki? Well, be sure that Zen is close enough to hear all that and start protecting his end-all-be-all love. It's ridiculous just how perfect the two main characters seem compared to everybody else. I've legit never seen a show so bad at portraying evil. Random people showing up doing bad things with zero IQ just to serve as a foundation so the main characters can act cool and complex for a while. Pathetic writing honestly. \\n\\n\r\nIn which we get to a very important point of Shoujo romances, or just romances in general. That is, of course, relationship development. Well, nothing to write home about here either. Okay, fine... I admit. It's true that the show creates a lot of space for Shirayuki and Zen to properly develop feelings for each other. Good job there. However, the way it goes about it feels very artificial, at least from Zen's point of view. He gets obsessed with Shirayuki basically the second he sees her. It's not rare for him to go out of his responsibilities just to see her pretty face. It doesn't matter if he has tons of paperwork to do as long as Shirayuki is close to chat. It's like that all the time. Whenever Zen pleases, he goes to see her, while never caring about his responsibilities as a prince. Speaking of that, he sure has a lot of time to play around with his love for someone who is part of a royal family. I always thought people like that would be short on time, but apparently, it's no problem for Zen to visit Shirayuki like 15 times a day or spend the night with her somewhere. It's also no problem for him to start freaking out every time she gets into trouble and such. My point is, that this \"love\" doesn't feel anywhere close to reality. I've been in love, I know how things go. Sure, you do think a lot about the person in question but responsibilities always come first, even more so when you are in a position Zen is. There is absolutely no subtlety in his feelings because all he ever thinks about is Shirayuki. We never see him getting involved in royal matters, we never see him doing casual things, all we see him do is talk to Shirayuki or think about her. Now that I think about it, we know basically nothing about him besides how much he loves her. If that's what's called 'raw emotion' nowadays then I'm probably very old-dated for my own generation. \\n\\n\r\nShirayuki's emotions are, in this matter, much more respectable, as we see her engage in more things beyond just socializing with Zen. That bit of humaneness on her part is enough for her feeling to be justifiable and no matter what I'd said about her as a character, her side of the relationship growth was pretty decent. If the show kept some time to portrait Zen's life the same way as Shirayuki's maybe I could view him as something more than just \"a guy who likes a girl with red hair\".\\n\\n\r\nTo not come off as a douche out of this, I also need to mention some of the things I like, though they are pretty modest in numbers. Shirayuki's character was really interesting the first three or four episodes, it's sad that her writing and development later on was shit. Animation remains fairly decent for the most part. I also like the half fantasy/half historical setup for whatever reason. Two midsection episodes containing flashbacks of Zen's past are actually not bad at all. Sadly enough, they are also the only two episodes in which Zen becomes a real character and actually develops a bit, which once again proves how horrible at writing characters people who made this are. You simply cannot throw a couple of flashbacks onto a shallow character and expect him to look better. Development shouldn't be happening in the past. It should be happening in the present.\\n\\n\r\nThat about wraps it up. It has been a long time since I last wrote a review for a non-seasonal show, but I guess that perfectly shows just how frustrating of an experience this anime was for me. What started out with tons of promise quickly faded into generic nothingness. Perhaps that is a sad fate for all shoujo anime.\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-Hime is really good at one thing. At tricking people into thinking that it's better than other shoujo anime. The sad part is that it really could've been one. If the interesting world and intriguing female lead got supported with good development and writing, I don't think I would be sitting here writing this negative review. The bitter taste in my mouth won't go away for a while.\\n\\n\r\nBad shows are just bad. Bad shows which wasted its potential are a general disappointment.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\n(As supplementary material for this review, please refer to my writing on the similarities of this anime, Shirayuki and Snow White Similarities, found here: http://thechuunicorner.com/2016/01/04/shirayuki-and-snow-white-similarities/)\r\n\u201cMirror, mirror, on the wall. Who is the fairest of them all?\u201d This iconic phrase is most often credited to the animated, Disney-made film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. That is actually a pretty difficult question to answer, no matter what is being compared.\r\nI would consider myself a big Disney fan. I like Goofy and Donald \u2013 mostly thanks to my extensive time playing the Kingdom Hearts series \u2013 butI have an affinity for its fairy tales, too. Tarzan, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin are among my favorite animated, fairy tale films (which, coincidentally enough, are also within the Kingdom Hearts series\u2026). There is just something about the blending of the real and the magical, the budding romance, and the supremely happy endings that fills me with pure joy.\\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-hime, otherwise known as Snow White with the Red Hair, is not technically a Disney-made anime, but it is a fairy tale. A tale that instills similar feelings of joy.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nAkagami is about finding one\u2019s path in life. It is about happy fairy tales. It is about romance. But most of all it is about balance. This idea of balance is key to the narrative, balance that rests on a shaky foundation.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the anime often relies on the same set of events. Namely, Shirayuki is in trouble but then Zen comes and saves the day. This happens a lot over the course of the season. Shirayuki is attacked by a selfish prince, so Zen protects her. Shirayuki is kidnapped, so Zen rushes to her side. Shirayuki is going to be disrespectfully used in a public play, so Zen stops the nefarious actions. It can get a bit repetitive watching the same set of events unfold each and every time. But the anime is a fairy tale, so the \u201cdamsel in distress has her knight in shining armor rescue her\u201d is not completely out of place.\\n\\n\r\nZen is not always rescuing Shirayuki, though. In fact, Shirayuki regularly saves herself. She discovers the problem plaguing the soldiers of Fort Laxdo, as well as cures them of their ailments. She is the one that jumps out of the watchtower and into the lake to retrieve the lost whistle. Even when she is kidnapped, before Zen arrives she proves that she is more than capable of handling herself.\\n\\n\r\nThe best moment, however, is after the dinner party, when she does not let Zen come to her but instead insists that she go to him. So she climbs the nearby tree (rather than taking the steps or some other route), leading her to his hand and a private moment between the two of them. In all these scenes, Shirayuki takes the initiative, going against the typical fairy tale structure. This consequently shifts Akagami away from being a one-sided narrative and towards a more balanced one.\\n\\n\r\nBalance is further achieved through the rest of the scenes that are neither all about Zen nor all about Shirayuki, but rather all about the two of them together. During Shirayuki\u2019s herbalist test, she and Zen work together to switch the flowers. The confession scene likewise achieves this balance. Not just that they both confess their feelings of love for one another but also that the writing afterwards flip-flops between Shirayuki and Zen narrating, indicating that the prince and the maiden are now on the same page.\\n\\n\r\nThis balance is what makes the romance feel so right. Akagami is a tale about how Shirayuki and Zen, a man and a woman with different lives and different statuses, share a romantic relationship. So what the first season shows is Zen coming down to be with Shirayuki and Shirayuki climbing up to be with Zen. Zen sneaks away from his guards, he seeks out Shiryuki against his brother\u2019s wishes, and he risks his life for her. Shirayuki, in return, travels to Zen\u2019s country. She trains as an herbalist in the castle. She takes part in the castle\u2019s activities. For both Zen and Shirayuki, they strive to be with each other, equally, in balance.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is the first half to Akagami, this theme on balance starts off strong. It is the anime\u2019s other themes that have yet to be fully explored. The obvious social disparity, the notion of following a path in life, the difficulties romance \u2013 be it the one Shirayuki and Zen share or otherwise \u2013 entails, and so on. The anime certainly alludes to these themes throughout the first half but does not outright expound on them, presumably saving said expounding for the second half. So, for now, not exploring more of its themes is not so much a negative as it is a signal that the continuation should (and better) do so.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the worst missteps that the anime makes is when it tries to make the anime not about Shirayuki and Zen, disrupting the balance the two share. The conflict with Raj is acceptable; that causes the two lovebirds to meet. What ruins the narrative is when Izana kisses Shirayuki on the forehead (after having been hostile towards her) and when Obi clearly has an interest in Shirayuki (ripping off her bandana to see her smile, giving her his prize that he won at the arena, and so on). These are smaller scenes, but nonetheless they are distracting. They get in the way of the romance which, subsequently, gets in the way of Shirayuki and Zen\u2019s balance.\\n\\n\r\nAkagami is also not without its share of poorly executed moments. Shirayuki slapping the medicine out of Raj\u2019s hands was a bit too dramatic. The worst offender, however, was Shirayuki\u2019s spat with Lord Haruka; given the context and direction of the narrative, the scene was overly confrontational. Here, the balance is off. Not with romance but in the mood. Yet, Akagami has its well-executed moments, too. Shirayuki dropping her books and getting flustered as Zen inadvertently grabs her hand is one such scene. Another is when Zen comforts a crying Shirayuki at a window sill. These are the moments when the balance is perfectly struck, romance-, emotion-, and mood-wise.\\n\\n\r\nAkagami is not done telling its tale. There are obvious improvements to be had, but the narrative is at the minimum acceptable for an opening act.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nArguably, the strongest part of Akagami is its wonderful art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime takes place primarily at Zen\u2019s castle, the surrounding grounds and the inner rooms making up most of the backgrounds. In order to combat any feeling of repetition, Akagami lathers its art with dazzling colors and bountiful light. Beautiful pinks, purples, and blues are accentuated by the soft, visible sunlight as well as noticeable sparkles here and there. Greens, oranges, and, of course, reds are likewise supported by the hardness and playfulness of the light. Altogether, the medieval backdrop \u2013 castles, swords, and gardens \u2013 combined with the colors and the light, paints Akagami as the fairy tale that it is.\\n\\n\r\nWhile actual animation never surpasses the stunning artistic direction, the animation still manages to remain at an elevated level. Truth be told, not a whole lot of action takes place. Zen, Mitsuhide, and Kiki fighting some bandits near Fort Laxdo, Zen dueling Izana, and Izana and Mitsuhide defending Zen from a group of marauders make up the most action-heavy scenes with lots of sword swinging and flourishes. Yet this is not the impressive part of the animation. It is the subtler aspects that are. Shirayuki\u2019s hair and outfit swinging as she moves. Her hands clasping Zen\u2019s as they share an intimate moment. The swaying of leaves as a gentle breeze passes by. Everything has a fluidity to it that makes the anime feel alive, much like romance does to those that experience it.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the fairy tale setting and the animation, the show does not play around with the camera too much \u2013 most of its shots are framed around singular characters or a pairing of characters. This, as it turns out, follows the anime\u2019s own balancing motif; having Shirayuki standing in the middle of the shot or showing Shirayuki and Zen opposite each other achieves that sense of balance visually.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs remain consistent, both in terms of quality and balance. Shirayuki\u2019s bright, red hair and stark, green eyes make it easy to see why she is the apple of Zen\u2019s eye. Shirayuki also wears many different outfits over the course of the season. A hooded outfit, her professional, white work coat, and her one-time-only (for now) princess get-up change up her appearance at a regular pace.\\n\\n\r\nShirayuki\u2019s red hair and white coat bring about the balance. Zen is similar; his white hair and striking blue eyes match his white and blue princely outfit, dignifying him while also balancing him. Mitsuhide, with his teal hair and brown outfit, Kiki with her blonde hair and purple gear, and Obi with his short black hair and olive green scarf continue the balance of the designs, coinciding with the anime\u2019s main theme.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAkagami has a medium sized cast. Mitsuhide, Kiki, Ryuu, and Raj are notable members of said cast, though they are not technically the focus. Obi and Izana might arguably be more important than the rest of the side cast, but even they do not have much to go off of beyond their base characterizations. Zen and Shirayuki, however, are ripe for picking.\\n\\n\r\nZen is the easiest to start with. Zen is a dutiful prince. He completes his paperwork, he cares for the people of his country, and he takes responsibility for his own actions. Perhaps most importantly, Zen looks out for Shirayuki. Obviously it is because he is a kindhearted and respectful young man, but it also because he clearly has deep feelings for her.\\n\\n\r\nDespite Zen upholding his status as prince, he often acts of his own volition. He sneaks away from Mitsuhide and Kiki to tease them a bit, he dresses up as a guard to observe his people on \u201cOpen Castle Day\u201d from a different vantage point, and he makes sure to drop whatever he is doing should Shirayuki find herself in trouble. From this list, it is clear that, even when he is not following what he is \u201csupposed\u201d to do, he has the people around him in mind (especially Shirayuki).\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Zen was not always like this. As a child, he was na\u00efve. He rebelled against authority. He hated being seen as someone above others. He understood that everybody compared him to his older, more accomplished brother. All he wanted was to be treated like any other normal kid. Thus, he flocked to Atri, his childhood best friend. Through Atri and Atri\u2019s death, Zen sees firsthand the difference between him and the common man. Atri\u2019s death deeply affects him \u2013 Mitsuhide is, thankfully, there to support the young prince \u2013 but rather than resting on his laurels, Zen vows to become the type of prince, the type of person, that anybody \u2013 be they a recent traitor or a civilian \u2013 can view not as a distant man but as a close friend. Thus, the path he takes leads him down that of kindness, respect, and camaraderie.\\n\\n\r\nShirayuki, in contrast to Zen, is a bit more complex. Shirayuki is not a princess, she is a woman with a knack for herbs and flowers who also happens to have uniquely colored hair. Above anything, though, she wants to forge her own path. She does not like people controlling where she goes, and more importantly she does not like people telling her she cannot do something. Akagami even pokes fun at this during her drunken state; she tries to go to Fort Laxdo, alone, to help the soldiers there in order to apologize to Zen for getting him in trouble.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, Shirayuki is not the best character possible. At least, not yet. Shirayuki acts independently, she is both funny and sweet, and she is undeniably cute. This makes her extremely likable to not just the people around her but also the audience. But she does not necessarily grow as a person. She remains pretty much the same independent, sweet, and cute woman from the moment she cuts her hair to the final light show at the end of this first season.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, outside of a single (and single-framed) flashback, Shirayuki\u2019s past life is unknown. This detail seems unimportant, but it is actually quite clever. Again, Shirayuki is someone who is always moving forward. Dwelling on the past is something she would never consider because that is just not who she is. So, the anime ignoring her past further highlights the ideals that Shirayuki has about following one\u2019s path in life and never looking back. Thus, the path she takes leads her up that of goals, achievements, and dreams.\\n\\n\r\nFor both Zen and Shirayuki, they follow a path of their own design. And as the anime shows, their paths converge. At first, they just crossed. Zen comforting Shirayuki as she cried over his medical records, Shirayuki falling into Zen\u2019s arms, and Zen kissing Shirayuki for the first time in the watchtower. By the end, their paths no longer cross. Now, rather than moving down their path by their lonesome, they are moving on the same path together, hand-in-hand, as the couple they were always meant to be. That is to say, they have achieved a balance that befits them both. A status barrier still separates Shirayuki and Zen, but that barrier, as has been shown time and again, means nothing to them. For them, all that truly matters are each other.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other character details worth noting, those not directly tied to Shirayuki and Zen. Mitsuhide receives a proportionate amount of focus that makes his character more than just a man that guards his prince. Contrarily, Kiki and Gazelt (Shirayuki\u2019s main boss) are sorely lacking in the characterization department. At the same time, the constant shuffling of villains seems like a poor decision since they each become one-offs, but doing this puts Shirayuki and Zen into more scenarios together, leading to more opportunities for the two to connect.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether \u2013 and given that this is the first half of the anime \u2013 the characters, while not amazing, are poised and ready for what is to come in the continuation.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme starts off awkwardly, but maintains its stride following its first few notes. What is most impressive about the OP is the airy quality about it, as if the singing and the instruments are carried by the wind and not by their power alone. The soft background choir and the subtle ambient sounds further contribute to this feeling of lightness. There is this small dip in the middle of the track where the piece somewhat resets itself, and in doing so prevents the release of the tension the song had built up immediately prior, adding weight towards the conclusion of the piece. Combined with the chimes and the rhythmically parallel lyrics, the track makes for a wonderful beginning to every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme is nowhere near as floaty. Instead, the ED chooses a kind of stepwise approach, the beat and the lyrics stepping through the song. In contrast to the OP, the beginning of the piece is the strongest part, starting off orchestral and dance-like in tone. This leads into a mellow, dainty track that more or less follows the general mood of the show. The piece is not fairy tale-esque, hurting its relevancy, but it is at the minimum catchy to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the original soundtrack, it follows in the path of the OP. Almost every piece is grandiose, orchestral in tone and fairy tale in feeling. Instruments like the harp and the flute help to achieve this feeling faster, although the tracks are not without calming violins and shakers. One of the tracks is particularly moving: a slow trumpet, followed by an ensemble of triumph, can only be described as magical. Besides the more uplifting pieces, the anime also includes tracks filled with harrowing violins as well as mysterious guitars for those grim times. But no matter what part of the OST is playing, the music produced is nothing short of stellar.\\n\\n\r\nThe last bit of sound-work is the voice acting which (after careful consideration) sees an average level of performances. Saori Hayami as Shirayuki can easily be said to have performed the best, her womanly and determined way of speaking fitting the red-haired maiden perfectly. But beyond Ms. Hayami\u2019s performance, the rest of the cast is not that noteworthy. Ryota Osaka as Zen has a kind and princely way of speaking, Kaori Nazuka as Kiki speaks as nonchalant as possible, and Nobuhiko Okamoto as Obi as a wily tune to his voice, demonstrating that they each fit their role nicely enough. But nobody reaches the same sense of perfection that Ms. Hayami does throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI will say it until the day I die: I love romance. The love interest blushing, the holding of hands, the much-anticipated first kiss; all of it makes my heart skip a beat.\\n\\n\r\nFor this reason, I really liked this one. While the beginning makes it sort of unclear how Shirayuki feels about Zen \u2013 Zen, in contrast, wears his emotions on his sleeve \u2013 the further along the anime went, the more romance I got, and consequently the happier this anime made me. Zen getting mad at himself for not saving Shirayuki faster while she was trapped on the island was awesome. Shirayuki and Zen telling each other at Fort Laxdo that they are the driving forces for one another is way too adorable. Shirayuki looking absolutely flabbergasted after Zen kissed her, for the first time, following her radiant smile made me laugh out loud due to joy and excitement. Every small flirt, every romantic happening between Shirayuki and Zen put as big of a grin as could fit on my face.\\n\\n\r\nI also like the not-really-said-out-loud-but-probably-more-than-likely romantic pairing between Mitsuhide and Kiki. Literally nothing happens romantically between them, but I can see the anime taking that direction if it wanted (and I hope that it does).\\n\\n\r\nOne part of the anime that I take offense to is Obi\u2019s interest in Shirayuki. He seems like a kind dude, but at the same time the anime trying to make it seem as if he wants to be more than just friends with Shirayuki is irritating to say the least. His presence gets in the way of Shirayuki and Zen, which means his presence gets in the way of the romance, which also means his presence gets in the way of my happiness. I think he has a place in the anime, just not as the faux-rival the show is somewhat designing him to be.\\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-hime is a fairy tale in anime form. The characters\u2019 pathfinding, the stunning art and animation, and the wonderful romance come together to create a nice experience. Some hiccups do exist \u2013 such as some faltering with the story and portions of the sound-work \u2013 but they are not so egregious that they outright ruin what the show has started. To answer the mirror\u2019s earlier question, while Shirayuki and the gang are not the fairest of them all, they are certainly high up on the list.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, strong theme on balance leads to equally strong romance, some distractions throughout, with a mix of both well- and not-well-executed scenes\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, beautiful art, crisp animation, and thoughtful character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Zen starts off strong, Shirayuki, while extremely likable, needs a bit more work, but the two together prove that not every path has to be taken alone\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, okay ED, great OST, okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, the high amount of romance is divine, but Obi\u2019s presence I could do without\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "The trigger to the female main character Shirayuki meeting who she'll meet, getting into messes she'll be getting into is all because of her red hair, but in the anime you have a silver haired prince, a blue haired attendant and a dark green haired character, it makes no sense for her hair to be the solely unique one.\r\nApart from that, the story development is very entertaining, the anime doesn't empathise her looks too much and focuses on a good character build. But the character backgrounds of most characters are lacking or very anti-climatically explained and the protagonists don't really have an antagonist to balanceit out. You could say it's too happy go lucky, no matter what happens it'll turn out well for the protagonists.\\n\r\nThe female protagonist is a bit too perfect in that aspect as well, considering she's living in a medieval timeline, living alone, but targeted by many for her rare red hair colour, she bears no grudge towards anybody, even naive at the present and in the future too. She is independent, headstrong and doesn't falter in front of hardships. Admirable but considering it logically it's a too good to be true story of a girl meeting her prince charming. (In comparison the male protagonist faces several more realistic hardships)",

When reading the manga, I really liked the ethnic & detailed background, and feel. I would have liked it if the anime used more realistic colours with less vividness. \r\nAlso, I feel that the anime puts more power into the romance parts rather than loyalty, pride, and responsibility, that Ifound made the story very deep and meaningful. I really liked the choice of the voice actor for Shirayuki but I hoped she would have talked with more strength in her words. I couldn't feel the strong and responsible character she should have. With Mitsuhide, I think the anime makes him appear too flimsy, while he is more down to earth in the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThese are opinions that I had because I read the manga before and can't help but compare because I love the manga so much. lol \\n",

            "content": "TL;DR: If you like a story that resembles a Disney movie, romantic cliches, heartwarming romance, and like having everything go your way in terms of story, give this a watch. If you don't like very stereotypical shoujo romance anime, I wouldn't suggest this anime in particular, but give it a go.\r\nHaving been a fan of the manga for a while and not being aware there was an anime adaptation the whole time, I was ecstatic beyond belief to begin the first episode in the two season series we've all come to know and love. Personally, the premise of the story reminded me of something thatwould come from Disney; though that didn't bother me at all.\\n\r\n      The basic synopsis of the anime, is that Shirayuki (Snow White), known for her apple red-hair (oh, the irony) and her expertise in herbalism, is chosen to become a concubine for the prince in her home-country, Raj Schenazade. In an act of defiance, Shirayuki decides to cut her hair, essentially quit her old life as an herbalist in Tanbarun and crosses the border into a neighbouring kingdom, Clarines. From there, she has a fateful encounter with a white-haired boy roughly the same age; and from there, the two develop a long-lasting relationship filled with adventure, romance, and well; more romance.\\n\r\n    The story was something that felt very straight-forward and linear; following a path other anime of the similar demographic have taken. Though that may be true, something about the simplicity of the story and the smooth transitioning as well as the development of the different relationships in the anime made it very magical, or maybe even Disney-like, per se.\\n\r\n     The art throughout the anime; the different scenes involving the castle, the city, the environment in general; I have to give it to Bones, the art was something I really appreciated for its exquisiteness all throughout, and was something that felt really soothing to me as I continued to watch. The quality of the art was very consistent and accurately displayed the mood, whether it be warm and fuzzy, or stone-cold; showing no visible drop in quality throughout the series. Heck, I'd even say the quality got visibly better between the seasons. \\n\r\n    The selling point in the anime for me would've definitely been the music. Other reviews I've seen haven't really talked about the music in particular, but the soundtracks played throughout the anime at pivotal moments made it all the more heartwarming, giving me an \"Awwwww..\" feeling as I continued to watch in delight. It's been a month since I downloaded some of the soundtracks on my phone, and I still give it a listen when I feel like reliving those warm moments from the anime.\\n\r\n   All in all, the character development between the two would probably be, fairly linear to say the least. It feels like everything was set to follow the most stereotypical shoujo cliche possible, but reluctantly I'd have to say that even then, Akagami no Shirayukihime is one of the better shoujo animes out there. I'd definitely give this a watch if you want everything to go your way and not have to worry in the least about any obstacles the two lovebirds face.\\n\r\n    To conclude, I just had to give this anime a 10/10 for enjoyment, and a 9/10 overall. It was something I was able to follow along with without much effort, and the characters, the art, the sound, and the story all mixed in were very enjoyable and very heartwarming to watch. I would DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone who enjoys shoujo anime / manga and is looking for a good, cliche, heartwarming relationship between two lovers.\\n",

            "content": "Shirayuki, why are you so special and so loved by everyone you meet? This is the question I cannot help but ask with each episode I watch of this anime. The specialness of this very bland, boring, ordinary girl with a supposedly unusual hair color just goes way too far. If I'm not feeling it, then why are all of these idiots in her world?\r\nThose who claim this anime sidesteps the usual shoujo anime tropes couldn't be more wrong. It falls awkwardly and unawares into most of them and sloshes around in the ditch water like a pig wallowing in its own filth. We havea very cliched protagonist, Shirayuki, who is the Mary Sue of anime.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, she has a very unusual name in any culture, \"Snow White.\" If that doesn't scream \"Mary Sue,\" then I don't know what does. Second, she has a rare hair color for NO story reason in order to force her to be considered special by the other characters, but it doesn't convince the viewer who is not impressed with this unrealistic display. Third, she is so special, the prince of her own kingdom wants to make her his concubine, but she decides to flee the country instead, only to run into none-other than the SECOND prince of the neighboring country. A coincidence for you, and one coincidence for YOU---coincidences for everybody!\\n\\n\r\nBut, wasn't Shirayuki escaping a horrible life when she ran away from home? That's why she ran, right? Well, no. In fact, she was very well loved by everybody in her own kingdom and she literally threw it all away simply because Prince Raj got horny and decided he wanted to pamper her like a wife without actually marrying her. I'm not saying this is okay, but there are worse fates out there.\\n\\n\r\nSo, now she's in the kingdom next door as the very special friend of Prince Zen, a young second prince she meets immediately upon leaving her own kingdom. Because she had already worked as an apothecary, she took naturally to this whole herbs business and easily passed the test to become the palace's apprentice herbalist. Well, nothing's hard for this girl, other than being so beautiful and revered. Life is hard, indeed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, that's just the problem. There really is nothing about Shirayuki's life that is a problem. She was happy before and she is happy now. She was pretty before and she is still pretty. She was hardworking before and she is hardworking now. She stood up for herself before, and she does it now, too. What is the point of even watching this anime when the story is nonexistent and she has so little conflict in her life?\\n\\n\r\nIt comes off like a wish fulfillment fantasy that gets so carried away with making the protagonist's life perfect, it's BORING AS HELL. There is no character development whether in Shirayuki, Zen, or anyone. You cannot have meaningful anything or anyone if you have nothing at stake. There is nothing at stake here, and it is a story about a really fortunate girl, with perhaps a bit too much fortune, finding a very fortunate love match. Perhaps this would be more interesting if there was some struggle and some real growth in Shirayuki and Zen, but it doesn't exist.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this can be a way to pass the time if you're bored, but I found myself becoming bored while watching this. If a story about everyone getting along with everyone else and only having to deal with minor misunderstandings sounds like a blast to you, then dig in. I ain't got no time for this lightweight storytelling crap.",

            "content": "Roses, tomatoes, and human blood. What do these all have in common? If you guess their color, then you would be correct. A certain girl with noticeable red hair also exists in a fantasy world where the colors of red decorates its colorful storytelling. Akagami no Shirayuki-hime (Snow White with the Red Hair) isn\u2019t exactly a Disney tale where there\u2019s just prince charming or Cinderella shoes. Rather, this show is what I\u2019d envision as a unique fantasy story of vibrant coloring.\r\nAdapted from the manga of the same name written and illustrated by Sorata Akizuki, the series focuses on a young woman named Shirayuki. She isborn with her trademark red hair that catches the eye of almost anyone she meets. This unfortunately attracts the attention of a prince named Raji who wishes to marry her and in response, Shirayuki attempts to escape from the country. She later meets a young man named Zen and helps him with an injury. As prince Raji attempts to find Shirayuki, we see how her adventure begins not as a heroine who is on a mission to slay dragons but to obtain a rightful place in the world where she belongs. The series is noticeable that it\u2019s a split cour (12 episodes) each. This review will cover the first cour of the adaptation by studio Bones.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of the manga, I was ecstatic to see that this anime adaptation became a reality. To get straight to the point, Akagami no Shirayuki-hime is a very classic fantasy. It takes place in the Kingdom of Clarines that is highly decorative. In fact, its first few episodes will make you see the world fiction that Shirayuki and the others are part of. Even the very few first scenes of the show will unravel what may be expected. The highly decorated castle, the scarlet red haired heroine, and a prince with a commanding presence all bring out the atmospheric shoujo setting. The premise also includes a poisoned apple which is a classic plot device used in the original Snow White story. But rather than Snow White being saved, it\u2019s Shirayuki who does the saving. In essence, Shirayuki is an antithesis of the damsel in distress trope. She is courageous, intelligent, daring, and very compassionate with the people around her. She helps a stranger (Zen) with little hesitation and often puts others\u2019 will-being above her own. What defines her as a strong woman also makes her independent as she relies on almost no one to achieve her goal. And in this story, her goal is to become a professional pharmacist.\\n\\n\r\nThe show executes its storytelling from many angles. The most prominent would be the relationship building between Shirayuki and Zen. The two already have a charming chemistry with their moments from the very first time they\u2019ve met. Zen\u2019s curiosity of Shirayuki is also interesting to see as he wants to know more about her each episode. Their social status in the show contrasts greatly but it\u2019s shown that they are similar in a variety of ways. Both are confident in their abilities, skillful in certain arts, and often uses clever thinking to solves problems. They are also both sometimes stubborn with certain objectives such as when Shirayuki stood in front of a sword while risking her life to get a point across. Furthermore, it\u2019s also shown throughout that Zen has grown fond of Shirayuki to the point that he sometimes feels dependent of her. In return, Shirayuki often looks after his well-being while developing a mutual respect for one another. And given the shoujo fantasy premise, there\u2019s little doubt that romance soon blossoms between the two.\\n\\n\r\nAs a character driven story, the series also puts emphasis on the other people that we see. The two most noticeable are Zen\u2019s aides, Mitsuhide and Kiki. The two has a strange relationship although it\u2019s shown that they very close. Their sense of loyalty is also unparalleled each episode as they are willing to put their lives at risk to help Zen. Although we don\u2019t learn much about them, it\u2019s shown that they\u2019ve also grown quite fond of Shirayuki\u2019s presence. Other characters such as Obi makes the audience wonder what they may be capable of especially with what they make of their first impressions. Lastly, there\u2019s also a bit of sibling drama that occurs in the show. Zen\u2019s brother is shown to be manipulative individual who is hard to read; sometimes he is serious, other times he is playful. The siblings\u2019 relationship often creates tension whenever they are on-screen together and it really makes the audience curious to see how their relationship develop in the present story.\\n\\n\r\nFor Shirayuki\u2019s role, she undertakes challenges to prove herself as a capable pharmacist. While the show is predictable, it still manages to capture the interest of the viewers as we see how she is able to take on different challenges. The experience she shows in the series isn\u2019t just by the actions she does but by how she does them. It\u2019s interesting to note that Shirayuki\u2019s confidence comes from willing to help others as a goal to become a pharmacist rather than just earning money or achieve fame. Her selflessness combined with courage and independence makes her stand out as an inspiring heroine. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the series is very appealing, this might not be a show for everyone. For starters, this is not to be taken as an action theater. In other words, do not expect epic sword clashes, war drama, or political affairs that spans into complicated plot angles. Instead, this is more of an inspiring fantasy shoujo that classifies the characters and how they progress. The relationship dynamics makes this series very colorful while retaining the strengths of a classic shoujo. I do have to admit that not everything is captured by source material adaptation standards. Also at times, the story\u2019s pacing feels sluggish in particular with the first few episodes. There\u2019s also some forced comedy that occasionally appears although this can be neglected by the memorable dialogues. A fantasy adventure like this isn\u2019t also without romance so expect some obvious direction that the story follows up with. Despite this though, the show itself stands alone as something unique. It\u2019s not a reboot of Snow White but a colorful tale of red.\\n\\n\r\nAs one of several Bones\u2019 series to premiere in 2015, Akagami no Shirayuki-hime is a powerhouse when it comes to visual arts. The show\u2019s animation features vibrant colors combining elements of resourceful landscapes, architecture, and character designs. The Kingdom of Clarines is also shown to have fantastic features that is fitting for a grand castle along with its neighboring town. Shirayuki\u2019s red hair is decorated as unique throughout the season. Her outfit gradually changes as her skill evolves and reflects on developed experience. Zen\u2019s outfit is also fitting for someone with the status of a prince and alongside his aides, they make up a memorable trio. There is also virtually no fan service as the show makes its point to unravel Shirayuki as an independent heroine, a female character that doesn\u2019t need to rely on looks to gain others\u2019 attention. All things aside, I do have to admit that there are occasionally some sluggish animation issues with the character movements. However, the body language in the show is undeniable when it with \u2018a picture is worth a thousand words\u2019 moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe word I\u2019d describe the music for the show would be sweet. It\u2019s lighthearted that isn\u2019t hard on the ears but instead convey its fantasy shoujo feel whenever it needs to be. The OP/ED theme song are decorative and well connected to its atmospheric setting. Character voice mannerism comes from the strengths of the main leads. Shirayuki shows a lot of personality in her voice that shifts from confidence, humorous, and daring when she needs to be. Similarly, we also have Zen who displays a familiar nature as a prince. His voice sometimes does display inklings of stubbornness and even arrogance when interacting with his brother. That actually brings up to a good point as well. Izana is probably a character that I\u2019d describe as the most hard to read yet. Just judging on his voice alone, there\u2019s a lack of trustworthiness in his character. But overall in terms of character voice mannerisms, the whole cast is well portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nSo what else is to say about Akagami no Shirayuki-hime? It\u2019s more than a tribute to the original Snow White story. We get a colorful cast of characters in a world where possibilities can become a reality. The show does a wonderful job when crafting its premise while staying true to it throughout the season. The character relationships are some of the key highlight points that makes the show worthy of its praise. And when it comes to its technical features, the series is a red scarlet eye candy of fantasy. In retrospect, Akagami no Shirayuki-hime makes you feel attached to the characters, story, and become a part of something almost magical.",

            "content": "There are anime series which excel because they have an original story (Clannad After Story, Stein's Gate and Madoka Magica) and there are those which soar due to well-written characters who carry an otherwise generic story. Akagami no Shirayuki-hime may be dismissed due to its straightforward nature which seems to religiously follow the shoujo genre but a deeper look reveals its characters that defy the tropes which makes it special.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe legitimate weakness of this series is that its story does not stand out. We were introduced to Shirayuki, a girl who ran away from her home because their prince wanted to make her aconcubine then she met Zen, a prince from another country. The premise basically rings a familiar trope that was used too many times before (Disney, anyone?).\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode is very fairy tale like in my opinion with all the events being mirrored with the first few events of Snow White. We then follow her life and struggles after she made friends with the Prince. In all honesty, it can be tiresome at times since the first few episodes were made to look as if she was a princess in damsel and the prince has to rescue her just at the right moment. \\n\\n\r\nOther moments involve Shirayuki taking an exam, being introduced to Zen's brother and so on but again, the story does not stand out which is a fair claim to naysayers to dismiss the series as just another shoujo show. This hurt the series considerably in its not so stellar episodes and might leave a stagnant feeling to the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: My praise to Akagami Shirayuki-hime begins here and it might border as if it came from a rabid fanboy but I will try my best to balance my review. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is highly consistent courtesy of Bones and is the prettiest looking series this season. It was as if the staff borrowed some of Shinkai's technique  (the man behind 5 Centimeters Per Second) when it comes to the relaxing hues used in Akagami Shirayuki-hime. The artwork (lighting and the characters' expression) was also able to accentuate the heartwarming scenes in this series (Episodes 4 and 11 in particular) and along with the standout score, it elevated an otherwise generic moment.\\n\\n\r\nAs regards to character designs, these were cleanly made and these faithfully followed the mangaka's but modified them a bit to have a Bones feel to them. These also mark a departure from your typical shoujo fare where the typical characters are so pretty that you might be dazzled.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, Bones is not a stranger in putting the right music at the right moment which makes the effect of crucial scenes in this series very potent to those who invested their time in it. Strings were used during climactic ones which elevated nondescript scenes to heartwarming events. It also knows when to stop during the show's most crucial moment (I am not going to spoil anything) to emphasize something irreversible with Zen and Shirayuki has happened.\\n\\n\r\nFor most of the time, the musical score is relaxing enough to complement this languidly paced series which is a very commendable job for Bones. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki is a character driven show which has actual and relatable characters and a very strong lead reminiscent of Akatsuki No Yona.  For what the story lacks, the characters in this show compensate. \\n\\n\r\nShirayuki defies the traits of a typical shoujo lead. She is socially capable, strong-willed, is not afraid to speak her mind and has actually has a brain which knows her limits. A viewer might expect a typical shoujo lead to go doki doki with her love interest but Shirayuki holds her own and yearns to seek position for her to see Zen as her equal. A crying main character trope because she was intimidated is also not present here but we are given a very rational one who thinks before she acts. \\n\\n\r\nZen, on the other hand, might err at times to your typical male shoujo character but a closer examination reveals that he is not. While he is kind, his past (a very painful one, mind you) reveals what made him like he is as portrayed. He might be likable and composed but his insecurity (or whatever that feeling is) to his much superior brother is palpable and shows its ugly fang when triggered but not to the point that he shows angst about it. He also narrowly avoided the sparkly main lead syndrome by toning down some of his traits and by not giving him a chick magnet role. \\n\\n\r\nAll other recurring characters were also given ample time to get some development. Mitsuhide and Izana benefited from Zen's flashback of his past so much that it can be also viewed that certain story was theirs and not Zen's. They were also elevated from plot device to actual characters which interact with the leads (and contribute to their future paths) without the feeling of emotional manipulation. Izana in particular might just be my favorite character in this show for his reasons and his peculiar ways of handling problems which antagonize him a bit.\\n\\n\r\nObi, on the other hand, is a very interesting oddball which complemented Zen's calm nature. He is quite perceptive and throws statements which drive the series to a positive direction. The confession scene would not have happened without him after all.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a shoujo junkie and are looking for shoujo-esque moments every single episode, then I am sorry that you are looking for the wrong show. There are no overly complicated relationship webs (A likes B who likes C who likes D... yada... yada...) and we are only given focus with Zen and Shirayuki for as long as the shoujo nature of this show in concerned.\\n\\n\r\nYou will also not see Zen getting doki doki around Shirayuki (vice versa until the climactic moment in this show) just because it's the genre's trope. A crying lead being submissive to her love interest after an unfortunate event is also missing here. Instead, Shirayuki has her own resolve in the show's larger problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe main leads also prove that we don't have to go for two seasons of confusion and misunderstanding to get a very satisfying confession in the end. And boy, what a satisfying event that was.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are episodes which fail to copy the oomph of the series highlights (Episodes 2 and 5 in particular can be erased and it will be better in my opinion) but I expected a generic love story upon hitting the play button. Then my prejudice in this show was destroyed in the first episode. This is how execution can make cliches to something special. A second season is coming in January which I hoped will live what makes this one a good romance title.",

            "content": "This review will not contain any spoilers regarding the series.\r\nStory:\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-hime's story is straightforward and simple, it's concept and how it is formed is something that is very common with the demographic that it resides in. So in that regard, it is not something that has not been seen before. Despite it being so simple and straightforward, it gives the feeling of being magical and soothing. How the events unfolds towards the character is incredibly seamless.\r\nWhile it may follow the specific tropes that come from the demographic, it tries its best to either break the trope and become surprising or execute it in away where it is appreciated. Many people may hate the 'damsel in distress' trope, but this series tries its best to avoid it, as much as the synopsis/first episode gives the impression of it occurring, the continuity of the series avoids it.\\n\\n\r\nAs the name of the show suggests, the show tends to give a feel of it being a Disney movie. It's charming, fuzzy and cute to watch through. The story is definitely light and focuses more about the dynamics of the characters, and how their relationships progress through the events that approach them.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation of the series is incredibly exquisite. As expected from a studio that is well known for it's gorgeous visuals, Bones. It does not follow the usual colorization that someone would expect from this type of show. Yet it fits it perfectly. The colors are bright and the animation is slick smooth.\\n\\n\r\nIt is easy to distinct between the characters and it highlights everything. The visuals are consistent throughout the entire series without a hint of drop in quality. Surprisingly, the visuals compliment the series atmosphere, considering how warm the content of the series is.\\n\\n\r\nIn this situation, the visuals play a factor in the enjoyment of the series, since it visualize everything that is needed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are not my favorite, but they're fine. They're not bad or amazing. They don't feel out of place, the sound is something to be expected from the type of show this is.\\n\\n\r\nOn the contrary the soundtrack for the series is fit and light. It does not overwhelm the atmosphere that the show is trying to represent. It does not stand out, but I'm under the belief that it is intentional, considering that it is not the type of show that the music should take the spotlight. It's only more evidently used in scenery focus moments to capture the feel of the place.\\n\\n\r\nIt may not be a great field on it's own, but that does not necessarily make it bad from my perspective. (Please note that both sound and art category are for most post completely subjective points; they're my opinion)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between the characters is what this show is all about. Or well, to be more accurate. It  is what makes the show special and great to watch. Shirayuki is a fresh of air from the usual heroines that are commonly  in this type of demographic. She's very clever, independent on what she does and holds responsibility of what she does and try to repay any favor that she may hold to anyone. She is not there to be saved and protected for romantic moments, she holds her on and tries her best to be in the same line as the male main lead. Her boldness and ability to solve situations on her own is nothing short of amazing!\\n\\n\r\nThe same falls for other characters. Most of the characters showed how multidimensional their characteristics are instead of being one dimensional characters. Character developments are thankfully still open for the continuation of this series,.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-hime is an anime that is incredibly easy to watch through. It's light and warm as I have mentioned previously. The interactions between the characters are interesting and the dialogue rarely leaves the person to be bored or feel that it is being dull. It may have it's moments that feel \"cheesy\" on book, but the way it is approached is what makes it gorgeous and beautiful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're fan of the shoujo demographic and the Disney-like settings, with a  strong-willed heroine, then this show should be right up the alley.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review, any feedback is appreciated on my profile!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019ve tried watching this anime twice now. The first time when it came out I got up to episode 5 before I stopped. The second time I decided to watch all the way through, because I rarely disagree with anime that are rated highly on myanimelist. I go through the anime on this site that are highly rated, when I'm wanting to watch an anime and have no idea to watch. This is actually the first time I have disagreed with the overall good rating of a show.\r\nI don\u2019t get the hype. At all. \r\nSometimes, even if I don\u2019t like an anime, I can seewhy other people like it: It\u2019s just not my taste.  I don\u2019t click with the characters. I\u2019m not particularly fond of the art style. Etc etc. But I honestly just can\u2019t understand why this show rated so well. In my opinion, there\u2019s barely anything good about it.\\n\\n\r\nI love fantasy anime. I especially love fantasy anime set up in a kingdom setting. Love shoujo and romance, so this should have been right up my alley. But it\u2019s not.\\n\\n\r\nThis may contain the slightest bit of spoilers, but only because I can\u2019t criticize what is wrong with it, without mentioning plot points. I will keep them as vague as possible.\\n\\n\r\nEverything is so pseudo-melodramatic it\u2019s irritating. The \u201cproblems\u201d the main character faces are presented as super dramatic, even life threatening, blah blah blah, but then get resolved so easily it\u2019s laughable. They try to make Shirayuki \u201cdifferent\u201d from the typical damsel in distress in that she tries to solve problems on her own, but ultimately in the end, the prince always shows up at the last minute to save her. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone is in awe of Shirayuki because of her red hair and because of her character, but all she does is act like a typical, normal person. She doesn\u2019t do anything extraordinary. Everyone else acts weird and super stereotypical towards the archetype they\u2019re created as, so her utterly normal actions get glorified like they\u2019re wondrous/amazing/so odd and quirky and charming, when they\u2019re just normal, human responses to problems. So many of the side characters and minor characters are irritating, judgmental insufferable idiots, so of course, Shirayuki, who is just a plain, nice person, is a hundred times better than they are. Anyone set up against those types of people will shine.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, it\u2019s not an exaggeration. Skip this one paragraph if you want to avoid spoilers completely, because it will contain a slight minor scenario spoiler (but doesn\u2019t affect anything about the story). In episode 4, a sick patient comes to get medicine. Yet, instead of being grateful to the herbalist he insults them horribly to Shirayuki. Like\u2026 how believable is it that a patient will show up to the doctor, then directly insult the doctor to one of the staff, instead of just getting the medicine they need. Like I said, side characters and even minor characters are set up to be so unbelievably stupid and rude so as to contrast with Shirayuki\u2019s not-so-amazing character to make it seem amazing. And of course Shirayuki won\u2019t stand for the insults and insinuations against her senior (as any plain, normal person wouldn\u2019t) so she\u2019s seen as super amazing and different and shocking when she takes offense towards the incredibly offensive comments. \\n\\n\r\nSo of course, since a normal, nice person is apparently the rarest of the rare in this world, the prince (and everyone else) end up being so utterly charmed and surprised by Shirayuki [insert massive eyeroll here]. It's really not amazing when someone doesn't want to be insulted or treated poorly, nor is it amazing when someone doesn't like it when their friends are insulted/treated poorly, but apparently, in Shirayuki, it's utterly amazing and unique and seemingly in this world, Shirayuki is the only person in history/existence to ever feel that way, so everyone is in complete awe of this aspect of her character episode after episode after episode.     -_________-\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this, the story is lacking. It revolves around Shirayuki doing these \u201camazing\u201d things, that really aren\u2019t so amazing, so there\u2019s nothing to build off of. We don\u2019t learn much about the characters besides the prince. We don\u2019t have a solid plot to follow. It\u2019s just Shirayuki getting into predicaments, then she struggles with solving them, solves them a bit but then gets stuck again, then gets rescued by the prince. Then she encounters more new people. Some of these new people cause her problems, which then repeats the cycle. To mix it up a bit, they throw in problems that are ALWAYS plant/medical related, so unsurprisingly, Shirayuki as a herbalist, is always able to easily solve them.  \\n\\n\r\nThey try to develop some side plots revolving around the prince and related royal conflicts, but they\u2019re so shallow and laughably simple and barely concentrated on (and of course, following the pattern of this anime, easily resolved) it\u2019s just an annoyance. \\n\\n\r\nYou never even have the slightest bit of worry that problems won\u2019t resolve themselves because they\u2019re so incredibly simple. It's marketed as a drama anime, but there's nothing dramatic about the story, just that things are presented in an overtly dramatic fashion.\\n\\n\r\nMeh.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing by far in this anime is the artwork and the setting/world building. Stylistically, it\u2019s not the best or the highest grade of artwork, but it\u2019s richly detailed and the details of the kingdom setting are nicely developed and pleasing to see. However, nice artwork can't save a show that is lacking in every other aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I don\u2019t like it. Plot is lacking and undeveloped, and what is developed is always predictable. Problems follow the same repeat pattern over a over. Problems also lack any depth or complexity. Characters follow their stereotypes, so it's easy to \"get to know\" them, but that leaves them incredibly one dimensional and predictable.\\n\\n\r\nI guess though, I could recommend it to people to watch if they\u2019re in a really bad mood/having a bad day/week and want to watch something that is incredibly easy to follow and doesn't require thinking if you're exhausted, and everything predictably always works out so your day won't get worse than it already is. Like how adults watch simple kids cartoons sometimes when they're feeling bad, because it's simple and easy and you know you don't have to think or feel or see anything that might disappoint/hurt your heart/worry you, about the characters or story.",

It wasn't bad, it was just boring! I found a complete lack of plot, and the only thing it hadwas romance. I mean don't get me wrong I love romance anime but there has to be a scenario that can back it up.\\n\r\nArt 7/10: the art was what initially made me want to watch it, it's not something unique but that's not really a bad thing in this case, it's good art.\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10: well I liked Zen, the whole prince with a tragic past was nice and was at least making an effort for a storyline even though it failed, Shirayuki on the other hand was boring, she is a strong character which is a good change from the weak high school girl we usually see in shoujo, but I felt like she didn't really have a purpose in life, she was going on and on about a place to belong which would have been nice if her previous home was terrible and people there hated her, but she was really loved and apart from the thing with the prince she had a nice life there. Also the only thing that she seems to be interested in is alchemy which would have been nice if it wasn't ONLY centring around medicinal herbs.\\n\r\nSo overall it is not the kind of anime that you will hate, and if have free time and just want to watch romance than give it a shot, but if there is something better in your \"to watch\" list then see that one.",

            "content": "I am reviewing this show after the final episode that aired a few days ago. Akagami no Shirayuki-hime, translated to Snow White with Red Hair in English, was a romance anime running in the summer anime season of 2015. It was the only romance anime running in the season, or at least the only noticeable anime to have romance as its main genres. This I believe is the reason the show got the kind of views that it did, as it was the only choice this season for the romance enthusiastic. \r\nLet's get started.\r\nThis time around there will be four categories that I will scoreseparately and collect their averages to give a final score out of 10. The categories are, Story, Characters, Production and Enjoyment. I decided to remove production from the bigger category of Enjoyment, because I feel like it deserves its own section and also because, just because the production value of an anime is high doesn't mean it is enjoyable. Please tell me if there is anything else I should change, this structure is still a work in progress. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThere was no overarching story in Akagami no Shirayuki-hime, referred to as Akagami from now onward. Each episode or a pair of episodes has its own conflict that in the end builds up the characters as individual characters and their relationships with other major characters.\\n\\n\r\nThough having episodic stories does not automatically mean that the anime is bad with story, though to have it done right, a very unorthodox method of storytelling has to be used. I am referring to the classic anime Mushishi when I say this and the exact opposite would be that thing called Nisekoi, in which episodic stories do not work out, even with an overarching story line. Akagami however did not tell its tale in the way Mushishi did and did not have a main plot. Everything just happened, one after another.\\n\r\nThere almost isn't a story for me to score, and in all honesty I gave the story a score of 1 when I first started writing this review. I increased it after realizing that the main focus of this anime is to build a relationship between Zen and Shirayuki.\\n\\n\r\nThe building of Zen and Shirayuki's relationship is actually kind of weird. The relationship itself is actually very nice but the way it developed, and how the writers decided to play it out, is a bit wobbly. I have to assume that there are a lot of timeskips in the 12 episodes of this anime. Though there is no significant mention of them, it did feel like a lot of time had passed after each side arc. The way that played out, was quite confusing, and it would have been better for them to state how much time had passed in some way after each event that took place.\\n\r\nThis actually ended up causing a bit of problems for me when it came to character and relationship development. I did not know for how long had Shirayuki and Zen known each other for by the time Zen ended up confessing his feelings. I would assume that it was months, but no information was given and because of that I couldn't asses the type of relationship Zen and Shirayuki were having.\\n\\n\r\nI could talk a lot about how bad the story component of this anime is, but to put it simply, there was no clear cut story to this anime. It was episodic, in the type that Slice of Life anime are written. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI knew that the story of this anime was going to be very... shit, at around episode 5, but I continued watching the show for two reasons. One being the characters and the other being the production value, which I'll talk about later. There are three main characters of the show; Prince Charming, Disney Princess and Obi the G.O.A.T.\\n\\n\r\nShirayuki, is the lead character. At first glance and at an overall look she is an extremely generic Disney princess type of character. Ordinary village girl, that happens to be very beautiful and kind, and ends up having the prince fall in love with her. \\n\\n\r\nBut the thing is, Shirayuki's character is so extremely generic that at this point it is done on purpose. You would expect here character to be just your average damsel in distress type of character, but then all of a sudden she does something unpredictable. For example, the time she jumped from the top of the tower into the water below, or the time she made a good escape attempt from her kidnapper.\\n\r\nThis makes Shirayuki a very interesting character to watch. Not only that but in nature Shirayuki is a normal girl, she jokes around, she gets angry, learns new things, gets embarrassed and basically behaves like a normal person would. Which also makes her a likable and relatable character for some.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is her Prince Charming; Zen. He is again a typical Disney Prince, that likes being out of the castle exploring rather than sitting in his castle signing papers and being served high class tea. Though unlike Shirayuki, Zen doesn't throw loops in that character structure of every Disney Prince. Instead Zen is like Shirayuki, a likable and relatable character.... most of the times.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, Obi is the best character of the show. Not only because he is absolutely hilarious, loyal but he also doesn't give a shit about any thing at all. There is a lot of mystery left unsolved for Obi by the time this season ends, but I do expect it to be explored more in upcoming seasons. \\n\r\nWhat's really amazing about Obi is that he is slowly falling in love with Shirayuki. But it's different than Zen. Originally it seemed as though Zen fell in love with Shirayuki for her looks, which isn't something I would want to complain about, but the fact that Obi is falling in love with Shirayuki slowly because of her actions, puts shame to Zen (sorry this is just me talking about my favorite ship).\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters in this show are surprisingly good for only 12 episodes running time. That's mostly because they were all made to be likable characters and most of them follow tropes in anime that everyone sees quite often, and because of that we can fully understand the character's personality without even seeing much of them. \\n\r\nThere were no characters that I felt needed to be explored more, which I feel is always a problem in short, seasonal anime. Each character was given enough time for what they were worth and how interesting they were. Obi being the only exception, who didn't get enough development, but I am fine with it because it adds mystery to his character and gives me something to look forward to in new seasons of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nProduction: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Akagami was amazing. Even among the marvelously animated shows running this season, I always get impressed by the art style and animation that Akagami offers every episode. The art style in the first episode reminded me a lot of a Hayao Miyazaki film, especially the way the backgrounds were drawn, but it slowly faded away from that and everything started looking more computer drawn, though still well done. \\n\\n\r\nThe VA for Shirayuki was the only VA that stood out from the show. The way she handled the comedic scenes vs the serious scenes always matched the type of character Shirayuki was. And if you already didn't know the VA for Shirayuki is Saori Hayami who has also done some other amazing voice acting roles and is also the one who performed the anime's opening theme. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending sequences for the show are just average, nothing that stands out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the episodic nature of the show, there was a point where everything became boring. There is a point in the show where you realize that everything that is happening is most likely irrelevant to everything and will never be mentioned again. Also the redundant use of Shirayuki's morals about her path, got to the point where it was annoying to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, I did feel the need to come back to the show every episode. To enjoy the characters and the beautiful animation that Akagami offered.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Scores:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nProduction: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nTotal: 6.3/10\\n",

In addition, the 1st episode drops a few hints from the original show too. Shirayuki\u2019s flashy red hair gets everyone\u2019s attention including the Prince of the country (Prince Raj) who intends to make her his concubine! Shirayuki escapes and meets with Prince Zen who happens to be the 2nd prince of the neighbouring country and that\u2019s where the story progresses. She accompanies with Zen where she practices to become a skilledherbalist and must accommodate living around with a prince and his world. And amid all this, an adorable romance springs up between Shirayuki and Zen! For a fantasy genre, it\u2019s fairy tale aspects are weakly portrayed but whatever they get by feels right! The show also doesn\u2019t shy away from its clich\u00e9s but since they own it, I can\u2019t complain much. I still would have preferred more of grey villains rather than the corny one\u2019s here. Moreover, I really hated the ridiculous attempt at the forced love triangle that\u2019s probably going to be touched in the next season because it totally comes across unwarranted, included just to introduce cheap love drama! Now the good stuff and the 1st best thing about the show is its representation of romance which is beautifully grasped, taking a mature route with the 2 leads fully realized relationship. Comedy is lightly sprinkled throughout the course of the season but gets its job done. (Especially those 2 guards!) \\n\r\nThe 2nd strength comes in its character\u2019s depiction, for they are wonderfully realized. Shirayuki could have easily been turned into a Mary-Sue but thankfully they refrain from it! Instead we get an awesome person who\u2019s very likable with her positive hard work ethics, strong yet infectious personality, all in all a badass with bright red hair! They pull this off by not OPing her but rather showcase her exuding confidence in one sided fights, making her that much more attractive. Furthermore, her strong stand on achieving her goals without taking any short cuts just further proves how motivated she is as an individual. And she\u2019s wholly supported by Prince Zed who once again, thankfully wasn\u2019t utilized to a one note, paper thin character. With distinct set of skills, he was well-defined to the result of personable and likable. His love for exploring his city and mingling with the crowd solidifies the existence of his big heart! Zen has a strict yet kind, though direct behaviour who honorably sticks to his promises and this made him the perfect partner for her! Aside from them, we have good side characters too. Kiki and Mitsuhide relationship with Zen is well defined, especially Mitsuhide who gets his own arc later in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very welcoming, with its colourful backgrounds and vibrant overall nature of the anime. With the addition of music, they naturally set a romantic tone to the entire show which I appreciated. The dubs were great here, both the voice actors for Shirayuki and Zen do justice to their characters, never leaving them out of field. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance really is well handled, coming across downright adorable due to the amazing chemistry between the two! They have you rooting for the 2 leads at episode 1 itself! The build-up was patiently worked out, starting off as good friends and getting to know each other, then the playful banter between them, going on adventures while sharing those sweet and tender moments with each other and finally the confession. I also liked the fact that the show doesn\u2019t play around with the romance arc, they get right to it with the leads speaking out about their feelings. So please, please and please, don\u2019t tarnish all you have accomplished with a terrible love triangle! I also took notice of the times where Shirayuki needs to be saved but they are done in a way where she doesn\u2019t come across as weak. And when the story calls for it, you get pretty good action too. I was pleasantly surprised with this anime even when it\u2019s not my type of thing! I do hope though that Shirayuki grows her hair back in s2! Definitely recommend this, great for anniversaries or Valentines too! \\n",

            "content": "I'm not gonna lie: the anime industry isn't what it used to be. Now, I don't mean to sound like one of those crotchety old people who say \"back in my day things were much better!\" However, there's no denying it: anime now just isn't as good as it was years ago. True, there were some duds, but creators back in the 70s, 80s, and even 90s were able to churn out many episodes of whatever the heck they wanted, loved doing it, put a lot of effort into them, and as a result, many of them are well known and beloved, with some titlesbeing Rose of Versailles, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Gundam, the World Masterpiece Theater, Pokemon, Sailor Moon, Digimon, etc. There's a reason they're all so well known and loved, and that's because people back then did everything they could to write passionate, riveting stories with three dimensional characters, and were able to utilize their time and tell the story they wanted...most of the time, that is. Now? Anime only get 11-13 episodes, with the occasional DVD episode here and there, and most of it is just wish fulfillment, self-insertion fare full of cute girls with big boobs, bland guys who get harems for no reason, moe stereotypes, phoned in voice acting, panty shots, questionable writing, stupid plotlines, etc. They make the most money now, and unless the industry changes somehow, I don't see the trend ending anytime soon. However, this doesn't mean quality anime don't exist anymore. There's fewer in number, yes, but they're still popping up despite the lack of success. One of those shows is Snow White with the Red Hair, or Akagami no Shirayuki-Hime...and I'm not gonna lie: this is seriously one of the best anime to come out in YEARS.\\n\\n\r\nThe story centers on a young woman named Shirayuki, who is well known for her work as a herbalist and...her red hair. Nobody in her country of Tanbarun has such red hair, and this makes her the center of unwanted attention. When the moronic Prince Raj falls in love with her and wants to make her his concubine, she refuses to let herself be subjected to a cruel fate, so she gives him the middle finger by cutting her hair and runs away to the next kingdom, Clarines, as she has nowhere else to go. While traversing through the forests, she finds herself befriending the crown prince of Clarines, Zen, who offers to let her into his kingdom to protect her from Raj. She isn't quite sure what his intentions are, but she does want to pay her debt to him, so she becomes a court herbalist in his castle. With this, her adventures in the Clarines kingdom begin.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I hear, Bones is a very well liked animation company. I've seen some of their works, such as Angelic Layer, the Escaflowne movie, and Ouran High School Host Club. But I wouldn't consider myself a big fan of them. However, I can tell you that the popularity Bones gets is 100% justified, as their work on Shirayuki-Hime has to be one of the best I've ever seen from them. The series has a soft, shiny, serene animation style that blends perfectly with the low fantasy setting, and the architecture design is great. The fluidity of the characters' movements, bird wings flapping, and other things are absolutely sumptuous. Even little things such as a character's hair swaying in the breeze, and tears flowing from someone's eyes are animated with such tender loving care that you can almost feel it. Seriously, Bones. You've earned my respect.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending theme songs are wonderfully sung and animated, with the first one simply telling its story in little time as opening themes should, and the ending theme adopting a more artsy, Art Nouveau style that still matches the story's serene atmosphere. Both art styles compliment the series well, and the music does its job. The soundtrack itself isn't anything home to write about, but it fits the setting just fine, and I didn't find any pieces that I didn't like. Everything seemed to just fit into place. I did notice one thing about the soundtrack: it's always mellow and subtle, never bombastic, even during compelling fight scenes (and there's only ONE action scene in the entire series, which says a lot about the series and what its like for those new to it). I think the music composers did a good job in keeping the soundtrack like this, as even though Shirayuki-Hime is a fantasy, its more political and character-oriented in nature. There's no slaying dragons, no warring kingdoms, no princesses with magical powers, etc. Nobody said having those things was a bad thing, but nobody said NOT having them is bad, either. Shirayuki-Hime knows what it is: a mellow fantasy story about a commoner girl and a prince who has to deal with his responsibilities.\\n\\n\r\nI know I praise the characters a lot in my reviews of anime, but for me, if an anime doesn't have good characters, then it doesn't win any points for me. Thankfully, Shirayuki-Hime's cast is fairly well rounded and great in their own right, and defy many stereotypes in shoujo manga. Shirayuki is friendly, kind, brave, and not afraid to do what she wants, but this trait can also get her into trouble, and she still has moments of vulnerability throughout the series that keep her from being perfect. Zen is a slightly mischievous and playful prince, but unlike most princes, we see him having to deal with his responsibilities, such as going to territory under his jurisdiction and making peace between countries using whatever methods he can. He is constantly under pressure, and his status as a prince is both a blessing and a curse, as a tragic event in his past involving a person whom he thought was a friend made him realize being a prince has both benefits and drawbacks for not just himself, but others. Seriously, how many cartoons in any country even go into this kind of stuff?! The only shows I can think of that also tackle the issues royalty face are My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic and Rose of Versailles. For someone who doesn't know much about how royal business goes in the real world, I think the show did a great job in showing the trials and tribulations a prince (or princess) have to go through in order to fulfill their duties. The other characters like Mitsuhide, Kiki, and Obi are also wonderful in their own right. There's even two guards who sometimes pop up every now and again who have very funny scenes and play off of each other very well. Even minor characters are given complex personalities and serve a purpose in the show, while still managing to come off as...well, people! I wish I could write characters like this.\\n\\n\r\nI personally couldn't find anything the show that I actually hated or put me off. But I know some episodes are very character driven and slow paced, and this isn't a show for people who like high octane action or constant melodrama going on. Everything is presented in a down to earth manner, and there's no dragons or magic or alchemy or anything like that. Plus, I liked the soundtrack, but I wouldn't consider it the greatest soundtrack ever. Not only that, the show is very short, having only 12 episodes so far. I say so far because, wonder of wonders, it has a second season coming up, so it'll be able to explore more of its story! Though from what I hear the manga is still ongoing, with 12 volumes out, so the anime, even with 24 episodes, probably won't be able to tell the entire story. But nonetheless, I still find whatever it does tell to be very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a gem in a sea of excrement, Shirayuki-Hime is the anime for you. It's not perfect, but it's a diamond in the rough that deserves all the love and appreciation it can get. You won't regret watching it...but you do require patience and appreciation for atmosphere.",

            "content": "Like many Shoujo shows, they are sweet. Sweet as in they are sugar coated in ingredients that entices people who easily go for anything similar to its flavor. Not that people who follow Shoujo are easy to impress, but it's a genre that many akin to when they do not want a complex story or complex characters. There are some exceptions to this and become classics in their own right. However, there are others that try to do this formula, such as Akagami no Shirayuki-hime, and come across as painfully average in the process.\r\nWhen I say that it is average, or just borderline okay, Imean that there are parts of it that work tremendously to help facilitate the anime from being bad but there are other rusted parts that feel unstable and slightly bring it down a notch. If you do not fit into the demographic that this show typically panders to, most of the problems I'll mention might not be an issue for you. Nevertheless, if you're like me and want to be surprised by an anime of any genre, there are many things to pick out of Akagami no Shirayuki-hime that range from positive or negative.\\n\\n\r\nLet us start with the positive aspects, beginning with Akagami's main heroine, Shirayuki. As far as female characters go, she is what many would figure out as the perfect example of a strong female character. But do not be discouraged if you think the show is going to rub it into your face about how strong she is. Shirayuki's strong charisma and optimism feel very natural and less tact-on to be in league with many other strong anime females in the past. Voiced by the always lovely, Saori Hayami, she adds an excellent level of innocence and personality that gives Shirayuki a likable presence along with her actions. They even play with the damsel in distress plot arc and give it a nice twist to it that makes her capable and true to her character arc. Not that she is a woman because she does this but because she just so happens to be female and succeeds in doing so is where Akagami flourishes.\\n\\n\r\nLike many Shoujo anime, the art style is usually fitting for the characters to look relatively minimalistic and less-overblown, to which Akagami is no exception. However, the art style has nice little tidbits to it that give it a nice pastel atmosphere from the character designs and how the world is drawn. I would not say that it is precisely like a Studio Ghibli production, but various elements seem like inspirations to the studio. The character expression all feel very natural and fluid, not to mention the saturated colors of the characters and backgrounds feel almost as if they were done with a paintbrush that gives it a 1980s aesthetic in modern times.\\n\\n\r\nThat is where, unfortunately, all of the positives grind to a halt. Where most of the problems lie is the plot itself. Is it badly written? Do the characters not have enough development? Is it boring? Both of these can be answered with: Yes, yes, and yes. It is poorly written from the prospect that the plot feels very bland and not well-thought out. From the half-way point into Akagami, I found myself apathetic to what was going on because the plot has nothing to it other than we're just watching Shirayuki try to fit in with this new town that she is living in. And while I do love Shirayuki as a character, nothing else that she does that tries to further the plot does nothing to resonate me with it.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, another big crux to the plot are the other characters besides Shirayuki. It was almost as if the writers took most of their time to focus on how great she is, but forgot that there were other characters to shine as well. Her knight in shining armor, Zen Clarines, is a prime example of this where his entire personality is entirely overshadowed by her's. It comes down to how Zen is portrayed as a knight hopelessly in love with her and the lines and things he does, unknowingly, to win Shirayuki's heart is about as cliched as one can get out of a Shoujo anime. The other characters that fall into the same spectrum as Zen, such as Obi and Rouen, are just as dull and uninteresting as he is; so much so that I had to look up their names so I could write them down on this review.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned about Zen being overshadowed by Shirayuki, their relationship that reaches its climax by the end of Akagami does not heighten my positive reflections of Shirayuki or lower my perception of Zen. It just feels like your typical romance relationship that does not feel surprising by the time you reach the last two episodes. It goes about as you would expect if you are familiar with this kind of story. Not that I was wanting a new way of telling this type of romantic story, but if it wants to do something similar, at least give Zen a better archetype that helps in keeping this from being monotonous.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Akagami no Shirayuki-hime boasts one of the best female characters this year, the plot does not win the best of the year. If it were not also for the magnificent art design, this would have been an extremely forgettable anime to pick out. It was a polarizing experiencing that could have been something more than what it already is if time was spent to write better supporting characters. Akagami was a missed opportunity in being unique, no doubt. It just cannot seem to pass the curse of being another generic Shoujo anime.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: C\\n",

            "content": "Before I start, I'll have to disagree with megaan about some of the points mentioned, and that giving this anime a score of 4 is the biggest insult in anime history. \r\nFirst of all, to state that the characters' personalities are outright flat and that their conversations with each other are boring already showed glaring flaws in the review. Akagami no Shirayuki-hime is not your typical anime nowadays that over-dramatize everything to invoke humor/or just to bring a point across. \r\nThis anime focuses on its more relaxed nature and keeping its innocence. It's like giving a bad review/score for a romance anime because it doesn'thave good fighting scenes. Her review is just flawed in that sense. I will only agree that the plot is abit on the bland side, though a well tradeoff to preserve its relaxed innocent nature. \\n\\n\r\nIf you were looking for an action-packed anime like Shingeki no Kyojin, then this isn't the anime for you. And perhaps meegan reviewed this based on that.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you are into romance and slice of life genre then I'd recommend this to you. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-hime Review: \\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki is unlike your typical cliche romance anime whereby girl meet boy, goes crazy for boy or is only there for ecchi bullshit cliches. It focuses on its calm and more relaxed nature as suggested by its bgm even at the very start of the first episode. Its romance sets them miles apart from your typical shoujo.\\n\\n\r\nOver here, the romance is very pure and innocent. Our beloved characters can hold proper conversations without any cliche moments/ecchi fanservice. The interaction between the characters are very refreshing in that sense. The scenes and conversations are well-crafted and thought-out and sure knows exactly when to be romantic as hell when the appropriate moment arises. \\n\\n\r\nEvery episode makes you go \"awww\" and leaves its viewers a warm fuzzy feeling inside. The love between the protagonists, Zen and Shirayuki are so pure and lovely. Truly the best couple of 2015.\\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-hime is the epitome of romance and truly a gem in anime history of its genre.\\n\\n\r\nA well deserved 10/10.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: Shirayuki(Hayami, Saori), a strong-willed girl with exceptionally rare red hair, led a normal life as a town herbalist in the kingdom of Tanbarun until her beauty attracted the attention of the first prince Raji (Fukuyama, Jun) who requested that she become one of his concubines. Unable to outright refuse his demand due to her social status, she fled the kingdom and had a chance-encounter with a stranger by the name of Zen (Osaka, Ryota) who, after curing him of a poisoned apple meant for her, is discovered to be the second prince of the kingdom ofClarines. In Zen's company, Shirayuki continues on to Clarines and attempts to start her life anew.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nShirayuki, the protagonist of the story, offers refreshing enough characterization - she is intelligent, kind-hearted, and resourceful but her uniqueness resides in how she interacts with the rest of the cast. She avoids the majority of the character tropes associated with the romantic lead and female love interest through her conviction and at times assertive personality both of which I found to be compelling character traits. Moreover, while she may not exemplify the traits of the more typical romantic lead, she does offer a number of instances where she operates within a role-reversal between herself and prince Zen. Though she does not become masculine in this way, her actions more closely resemble that of the a male-lead. An explicit example of this reversal was when she climbed a tree to visit Zen on his balcony. Perhaps my only and most notable qualm concerning Shirayuki is that she exists too closely to a character paradigm and doesn't offer much in the way of character flaws or moments of weakness - her character very purposefully exists in order to overcome the obstacles that would make other typical female characters stumble and in this way is a shade too 'perfect'. \\n\\n\r\nThe lack of complications does not solely reside in Shirayuki and is also present in a decent number of the other cast members. The lack of this trait actually accounts for what I believe to be one of the shows major stumbling points in that, by nature of all of the main characters being goodhearted, sincere, and supportive the tone of the show becomes quite flat. Though they contribute greatly to the feel-good romance nature of the show there aren't all that many diverse characters within the cast. Even someone like Obi who initially was more of a scoundrel-esc character quickly becomes homogenized after his introduction.\\n\\n\r\nTo speak briefly about Zen, there was one major area in which I felt his characterization was quite interesting and well done. He represents a pretty typical depiction of the prince of a kingdom - dashing, good-mannered, and kind and there isn't much else that infringes upon this however I found it remarkable that despite Shirayuki receiving a good number of role reversal scenarios that he was not weakened or made less dominant within their relationship because of it. He possesses equal to or greater agency to anyone else in the story and his resilience and integrity of character in this regard was quite compelling as it, along with Shirayuki's role in the relationship, resulted in something slightly more unique than i would have expected from what is otherwise quite a typical Shoujo romance.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation of the show was delivered in top form and avoided any and all noticeable quality drops throughout its 12 episode run. There were a great many uses of dynamic lighting which added significantly to the more important scenes and the scenes of greatest import were visually delivered quite beautifully. While the character designs were enjoyable by themselves I did find the presence of a fairly dynamic wardrobe to be a decent visual bonus as it made the show feel a bit more alive.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nWhile Shirayuki offers a handful of uncommon character traits the story fails to follow suit and plays out in fairly predictable and typical ways with perhaps the exceptions where it attempts to specifically highlight Shirayuki's characterization. One fortunate thing to note is that the story does offer plenty of romantic progression and so it avoids the route of starving the viewer while simultaneously tantalizing them each episode; in this area the pacing is good. The story initially exhibits some folk-tale influence through the use of poisoned apples and a snow-white-esc premise however this element seems to quickly be forgotten and I think it would have perhaps been more interesting had there been a greater number of allegories or references in this way. \\n\\n\r\nAkagami's story most likely falters for me due to its character reliance. Because the show is less concerned with offering an engaging plot or exploring the world being present and more focused on developing its main two characters both as people and as a romantic couple it comes off as highly reliant on the success or failure of its cast. With that being said, the cheerful and supportive tones in each and every one of the main characters makes for pretty bland and unexciting dialogue. The story doesn't drag but is a bit uneventful outside of furthering character relationships and so not only does it proceed quite typically in the form of many other shoujou romances but offers very little to break away outside of its main character.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music fit the show really well and while it didn't blow me away I think it added significantly to the show. The soundtrack was used especially well to play up key moments of the show to better dramatize them. I think this element of the show could be described as working well for the show while falling short of being interesting in an objective sense.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day Akagami plays out as a typical feel-good romantic show while offering several areas of interest such as its protagonist. Shirayuki's characterization and avoidance of tropes was delivered in a bit of a hamfisted manner however this also allowed the show to more directly parody the stereotypical romantic relationship and so I am of the mind to forgive it in this way. I think the show still offers plenty of potential going forward into its upcoming second cour where the characters could very well better diversify themselves and a more interesting plot might develop. I remain hopeful for the show in the future. \\n\\n\r\nRating: 6\\n\\n\r\nI gave Akagami a 6 because, while it was uneventful in many regards it also avoided being forgettable. Shirayuki and Zen carry the show to a degree and I feel that it's worth watching almost solely because of how it plays with the dynamic of their relationship though it doesn't offer a great deal beyond this. It was a decent show and certainly may turn into something more engaging in the future though ultimately there are better romance stories out there though few that play with its characters in this specific way.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Akagami first and foremost to those interested in the romance genre, more specifically to those who prefer shows that don't spend their time endlessly dancing around the subject of romance but instead are frequently involved with it and see fairly frequent relationship progression. There are a handful of action scenes though they mostly exist to reinforce the setting rather than add to the show's actual diversity of tone and so I don't think it exhibits anything special in this regard. The show is fairly light on drama though some does manifest by means of the romantic tones and so while some drama exists Akagami falls a bit short in terms of quantity to actually exhibit the genre fully.",

            "content": "Supposedly Akagami no Shirayuki is one of the better shoujo animes out there, and I can reluctantly admit to this. However, this also makes me incredibly sad about where shoujo anime is currently at. And the reason, AnS is one of the better shoujo animes is because Shirayuki isn't an idiot and sometimes she does things on her own without the help of the prince. (Note: I do admit the art is very pretty to look at, and Shirayuki + Zen are kinda cute together)\r\nMany reviewers have mentioned how Shirayuki is an independent, strong and intelligent character, and it seems each episode attempts to demonstratethis but somewhat fails. In the second episode( which was an incredibly pointless episode that did not progress the plot whatsoever) Shirayuki gets captured and manages to escape her captor before the prince goes to save her anyway. Am I supposed to be convinced that she isn't a damsel in distress? Also, episode three; another episode in which the show tries to demonstrate again how brave she is, when she gets banned from the castle, but somehow enters anyway, and has a 'showdown'( I say this lightly) with Marquis Haruka. Basically Haruka threatens her and says that intruders should be dealt with immediately, raises his sword towards her (at this point, in which I was like 'HIT HER!') and Shirayuki somehow proves herself by stepping towards it, and Haruka withdraws his sword. HUH??! OH Shirayuki you are so brave and so unordinary. WHAT? \\n\\n\r\nIn a way, the problem with this show is less to do with Shirayuki as a character but more with the lack of tension and conflict in the show. She's a fine character, but I fail to see the specialness that everyone else seems to. The plot isn't strong enough, and the characters aren't interesting enough by themselves. I'm not suggesting that it needs to be more psycho pass- esque but a touch of sabotage(hello prime opportunity during the herbalist test!!!), or even people who don't automatically fall in love with her (yes, you lot- Zen, Ryu, Obi, Mitsuhide, Kiki) would make this a better show.\\n",

            "content": "I'm as much a sucker for romance and quasi-reverse-harem anime as the next girl, but nothing about Akagami no Shirayukihime really drew me in. I suppose the biggest compliment I can give to Akagami no Shirayukihime is that I finished the series. It wasn't bad enough on any level to compel me to stop. That being said, there wasn't too much about it that had me invested in the story, the characters, or any other component of the series. \r\nThe emotional relationship between Shirayuki and the Prince, Zen, is developed to around 90% completion in the first episode -- that is to say, they arepretty much instantly and unreasonably attached to each other from the get-go, which leaves very little room for development as the series goes along. The result is a very boring shoujo anime. \\n\\n\r\nThere's no interesting conflicts between the two. You get no warm-happy feeling watching their relationship blossom. There's no  \"FINALLY!\" moment when the characters reach the realization that they're in love. It pretty much seems to happen INSTANTLY (even if it's not *directly* vocalized), and the rest of the series wanders down this path of \"I-want-to-be-an-herbalist-and-everyone-falls-in-love-with-me!\" which -- while not particularly offensive -- isn't super gripping.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say the series is 'fine,' but I don't think it merits the rating it has. There is no development in the series, in characters' relationships, or in the characters themselves, really. The only characters who seem to change are the ones who go from \"I have my doubts about this Shirayuki person\" to \"Shirayuki is hard-working and great and I might have a crush on her!\" -- and there are quite a few of those, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is actually pretty nice (I'll give it that), but that can't rescue the series. I won't be watching season 2. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Most shoujo female protagonists tend to be weak, so let's make ours the strongest willed person to ever walk across this god-forsaken world.\"\r\nI guess this was roughly the general idea when creators were coming up with the premise of Akagami no Shirayuki-Hime. And I'd gladly support that under normal circumstances. Having a female character who doesn't blush every three minutes does spark a lot of interest and promise in an otherwise very average piece of fiction. Sadly enough, the show is not able to capitalize on its strong premise and instead gives us a world full of empty characters and meaningless emotions. Which is ashame, because this anime really wasn't doomed from the start.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't take a lot of time to realize that the supposedly strongest aspect of the show, that being Shirayuki, is actually the one bringing it down the most. Why? Well, let's start the actual review, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nShirayuki is absolutely perfect. She's strong-willed, intelligent, beautiful, caring, kind, brave, considerate, moral, gutsy, useful, cute when drunk, cool and I don't know what else. Everybody is obsessed with her. It doesn't matter if it's a kid, old woman or a prince of a country, everybody is astonished because of how perfect of a person she is, and how uniquely red her hair is. The first prince fell in love with her just after hearing about her beautiful hair. That's right, he hasn't even seen her at the time and he already knew she was the prettiest girl alive. The second prince fell for her just after a first glance at the striking red of her hair. Random people casually show up out of nowhere just to kidnap her because her hair is just that fabulous. I really do throw around the word 'hair' a lot. Well, watch the show and see for yourself, there is legitimately not an episode that would go without someone admiring Shirayuki's bEAUtIfUl hair. \\n\\n\r\nBack to her characterization as a whole, I thought she was a pretty endearing character at the start. She is different than most females in shoujo romances, and that is a welcome change. It really seemed like the creators genuinely cared about making her a strong character. However, it only took a handful of episodes to realize that it was just a tricky bait. Shirayuki's writing goes nowhere. She's presented as strong in will and never in any other way. Basically every single episode adds just another positive personality trait to her already admirable arsenal. She's never portrayed as a character who's struggling, never makes a bad decision, always comes up with solutions for problems. She is just that amazing. Maybe she could be considered a 'strong' character if we were to talk about her strength in personality. However, she is not a strong character when it comes to writing. Strongly written characters are believable, which means they have flaws. Every human being has flaws. Shirayuki doesn't. She's perfect in every sense of the word, and I find that disgustingly sickening. \\n\\n\r\nWell, now that we got the main point of this show out of the way, you could basically look at any other shoujo romance review because the originality of this show ends exactly when you stop talking about Shirayuki.\\n\\n\r\nHer male counter-part Zen is, surprise surprise, the manliest male in the world, exactly how it tends to be with shoujo characters. Just like Shirayuki, he's perfect. Almost everything I said about her can be said about him. He's also an amazing prince who genuinely cares for all his peasants even though every other politically active character is presented as arrogant and greedy. He's amazing, absolutely flawless. Even his obsession with Shirayuki, which could technically be considered a flaw, or at least weird, is made to be a positive trait in this case because why would the writers of this anime want anyone to have flaws?\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's a pretty convenient question actually, because once we move aside our main 5 characters (of which 3 are not even worth talking about) suddenly its pretty normal for people to have them. Almost every episode presents multiple characters that could be thrown into a pile called \"horrible people\". Shirayuki gets kidnapped by evil guys on daily basis, people who act selfish and arrogant are that much more normal. The point is, these people only exist so that the main two characters could seem that much more incredible. There's someone acting like a douche? Well, be sure that Shirayuki is close enough to start yelling at him and show her strong demeanor. There's someone talking bad about Shirayuki? Well, be sure that Zen is close enough to hear all that and start protecting his end-all-be-all love. It's ridiculous just how perfect the two main characters seem compared to everybody else. I've legit never seen a show so bad at portraying evil. Random people showing up doing bad things with zero IQ just to serve as a foundation so the main characters can act cool and complex for a while. Pathetic writing honestly. \\n\\n\r\nIn which we get to a very important point of Shoujo romances, or just romances in general. That is, of course, relationship development. Well, nothing to write home about here either. Okay, fine... I admit. It's true that the show creates a lot of space for Shirayuki and Zen to properly develop feelings for each other. Good job there. However, the way it goes about it feels very artificial, at least from Zen's point of view. He gets obsessed with Shirayuki basically the second he sees her. It's not rare for him to go out of his responsibilities just to see her pretty face. It doesn't matter if he has tons of paperwork to do as long as Shirayuki is close to chat. It's like that all the time. Whenever Zen pleases, he goes to see her, while never caring about his responsibilities as a prince. Speaking of that, he sure has a lot of time to play around with his love for someone who is part of a royal family. I always thought people like that would be short on time, but apparently, it's no problem for Zen to visit Shirayuki like 15 times a day or spend the night with her somewhere. It's also no problem for him to start freaking out every time she gets into trouble and such. My point is, that this \"love\" doesn't feel anywhere close to reality. I've been in love, I know how things go. Sure, you do think a lot about the person in question but responsibilities always come first, even more so when you are in a position Zen is. There is absolutely no subtlety in his feelings because all he ever thinks about is Shirayuki. We never see him getting involved in royal matters, we never see him doing casual things, all we see him do is talk to Shirayuki or think about her. Now that I think about it, we know basically nothing about him besides how much he loves her. If that's what's called 'raw emotion' nowadays then I'm probably very old-dated for my own generation. \\n\\n\r\nShirayuki's emotions are, in this matter, much more respectable, as we see her engage in more things beyond just socializing with Zen. That bit of humaneness on her part is enough for her feeling to be justifiable and no matter what I'd said about her as a character, her side of the relationship growth was pretty decent. If the show kept some time to portrait Zen's life the same way as Shirayuki's maybe I could view him as something more than just \"a guy who likes a girl with red hair\".\\n\\n\r\nTo not come off as a douche out of this, I also need to mention some of the things I like, though they are pretty modest in numbers. Shirayuki's character was really interesting the first three or four episodes, it's sad that her writing and development later on was shit. Animation remains fairly decent for the most part. I also like the half fantasy/half historical setup for whatever reason. Two midsection episodes containing flashbacks of Zen's past are actually not bad at all. Sadly enough, they are also the only two episodes in which Zen becomes a real character and actually develops a bit, which once again proves how horrible at writing characters people who made this are. You simply cannot throw a couple of flashbacks onto a shallow character and expect him to look better. Development shouldn't be happening in the past. It should be happening in the present.\\n\\n\r\nThat about wraps it up. It has been a long time since I last wrote a review for a non-seasonal show, but I guess that perfectly shows just how frustrating of an experience this anime was for me. What started out with tons of promise quickly faded into generic nothingness. Perhaps that is a sad fate for all shoujo anime.\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-Hime is really good at one thing. At tricking people into thinking that it's better than other shoujo anime. The sad part is that it really could've been one. If the interesting world and intriguing female lead got supported with good development and writing, I don't think I would be sitting here writing this negative review. The bitter taste in my mouth won't go away for a while.\\n\\n\r\nBad shows are just bad. Bad shows which wasted its potential are a general disappointment.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\n(As supplementary material for this review, please refer to my writing on the similarities of this anime, Shirayuki and Snow White Similarities, found here: http://thechuunicorner.com/2016/01/04/shirayuki-and-snow-white-similarities/)\r\n\u201cMirror, mirror, on the wall. Who is the fairest of them all?\u201d This iconic phrase is most often credited to the animated, Disney-made film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. That is actually a pretty difficult question to answer, no matter what is being compared.\r\nI would consider myself a big Disney fan. I like Goofy and Donald \u2013 mostly thanks to my extensive time playing the Kingdom Hearts series \u2013 butI have an affinity for its fairy tales, too. Tarzan, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin are among my favorite animated, fairy tale films (which, coincidentally enough, are also within the Kingdom Hearts series\u2026). There is just something about the blending of the real and the magical, the budding romance, and the supremely happy endings that fills me with pure joy.\\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-hime, otherwise known as Snow White with the Red Hair, is not technically a Disney-made anime, but it is a fairy tale. A tale that instills similar feelings of joy.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nAkagami is about finding one\u2019s path in life. It is about happy fairy tales. It is about romance. But most of all it is about balance. This idea of balance is key to the narrative, balance that rests on a shaky foundation.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the anime often relies on the same set of events. Namely, Shirayuki is in trouble but then Zen comes and saves the day. This happens a lot over the course of the season. Shirayuki is attacked by a selfish prince, so Zen protects her. Shirayuki is kidnapped, so Zen rushes to her side. Shirayuki is going to be disrespectfully used in a public play, so Zen stops the nefarious actions. It can get a bit repetitive watching the same set of events unfold each and every time. But the anime is a fairy tale, so the \u201cdamsel in distress has her knight in shining armor rescue her\u201d is not completely out of place.\\n\\n\r\nZen is not always rescuing Shirayuki, though. In fact, Shirayuki regularly saves herself. She discovers the problem plaguing the soldiers of Fort Laxdo, as well as cures them of their ailments. She is the one that jumps out of the watchtower and into the lake to retrieve the lost whistle. Even when she is kidnapped, before Zen arrives she proves that she is more than capable of handling herself.\\n\\n\r\nThe best moment, however, is after the dinner party, when she does not let Zen come to her but instead insists that she go to him. So she climbs the nearby tree (rather than taking the steps or some other route), leading her to his hand and a private moment between the two of them. In all these scenes, Shirayuki takes the initiative, going against the typical fairy tale structure. This consequently shifts Akagami away from being a one-sided narrative and towards a more balanced one.\\n\\n\r\nBalance is further achieved through the rest of the scenes that are neither all about Zen nor all about Shirayuki, but rather all about the two of them together. During Shirayuki\u2019s herbalist test, she and Zen work together to switch the flowers. The confession scene likewise achieves this balance. Not just that they both confess their feelings of love for one another but also that the writing afterwards flip-flops between Shirayuki and Zen narrating, indicating that the prince and the maiden are now on the same page.\\n\\n\r\nThis balance is what makes the romance feel so right. Akagami is a tale about how Shirayuki and Zen, a man and a woman with different lives and different statuses, share a romantic relationship. So what the first season shows is Zen coming down to be with Shirayuki and Shirayuki climbing up to be with Zen. Zen sneaks away from his guards, he seeks out Shiryuki against his brother\u2019s wishes, and he risks his life for her. Shirayuki, in return, travels to Zen\u2019s country. She trains as an herbalist in the castle. She takes part in the castle\u2019s activities. For both Zen and Shirayuki, they strive to be with each other, equally, in balance.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is the first half to Akagami, this theme on balance starts off strong. It is the anime\u2019s other themes that have yet to be fully explored. The obvious social disparity, the notion of following a path in life, the difficulties romance \u2013 be it the one Shirayuki and Zen share or otherwise \u2013 entails, and so on. The anime certainly alludes to these themes throughout the first half but does not outright expound on them, presumably saving said expounding for the second half. So, for now, not exploring more of its themes is not so much a negative as it is a signal that the continuation should (and better) do so.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the worst missteps that the anime makes is when it tries to make the anime not about Shirayuki and Zen, disrupting the balance the two share. The conflict with Raj is acceptable; that causes the two lovebirds to meet. What ruins the narrative is when Izana kisses Shirayuki on the forehead (after having been hostile towards her) and when Obi clearly has an interest in Shirayuki (ripping off her bandana to see her smile, giving her his prize that he won at the arena, and so on). These are smaller scenes, but nonetheless they are distracting. They get in the way of the romance which, subsequently, gets in the way of Shirayuki and Zen\u2019s balance.\\n\\n\r\nAkagami is also not without its share of poorly executed moments. Shirayuki slapping the medicine out of Raj\u2019s hands was a bit too dramatic. The worst offender, however, was Shirayuki\u2019s spat with Lord Haruka; given the context and direction of the narrative, the scene was overly confrontational. Here, the balance is off. Not with romance but in the mood. Yet, Akagami has its well-executed moments, too. Shirayuki dropping her books and getting flustered as Zen inadvertently grabs her hand is one such scene. Another is when Zen comforts a crying Shirayuki at a window sill. These are the moments when the balance is perfectly struck, romance-, emotion-, and mood-wise.\\n\\n\r\nAkagami is not done telling its tale. There are obvious improvements to be had, but the narrative is at the minimum acceptable for an opening act.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nArguably, the strongest part of Akagami is its wonderful art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime takes place primarily at Zen\u2019s castle, the surrounding grounds and the inner rooms making up most of the backgrounds. In order to combat any feeling of repetition, Akagami lathers its art with dazzling colors and bountiful light. Beautiful pinks, purples, and blues are accentuated by the soft, visible sunlight as well as noticeable sparkles here and there. Greens, oranges, and, of course, reds are likewise supported by the hardness and playfulness of the light. Altogether, the medieval backdrop \u2013 castles, swords, and gardens \u2013 combined with the colors and the light, paints Akagami as the fairy tale that it is.\\n\\n\r\nWhile actual animation never surpasses the stunning artistic direction, the animation still manages to remain at an elevated level. Truth be told, not a whole lot of action takes place. Zen, Mitsuhide, and Kiki fighting some bandits near Fort Laxdo, Zen dueling Izana, and Izana and Mitsuhide defending Zen from a group of marauders make up the most action-heavy scenes with lots of sword swinging and flourishes. Yet this is not the impressive part of the animation. It is the subtler aspects that are. Shirayuki\u2019s hair and outfit swinging as she moves. Her hands clasping Zen\u2019s as they share an intimate moment. The swaying of leaves as a gentle breeze passes by. Everything has a fluidity to it that makes the anime feel alive, much like romance does to those that experience it.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the fairy tale setting and the animation, the show does not play around with the camera too much \u2013 most of its shots are framed around singular characters or a pairing of characters. This, as it turns out, follows the anime\u2019s own balancing motif; having Shirayuki standing in the middle of the shot or showing Shirayuki and Zen opposite each other achieves that sense of balance visually.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs remain consistent, both in terms of quality and balance. Shirayuki\u2019s bright, red hair and stark, green eyes make it easy to see why she is the apple of Zen\u2019s eye. Shirayuki also wears many different outfits over the course of the season. A hooded outfit, her professional, white work coat, and her one-time-only (for now) princess get-up change up her appearance at a regular pace.\\n\\n\r\nShirayuki\u2019s red hair and white coat bring about the balance. Zen is similar; his white hair and striking blue eyes match his white and blue princely outfit, dignifying him while also balancing him. Mitsuhide, with his teal hair and brown outfit, Kiki with her blonde hair and purple gear, and Obi with his short black hair and olive green scarf continue the balance of the designs, coinciding with the anime\u2019s main theme.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAkagami has a medium sized cast. Mitsuhide, Kiki, Ryuu, and Raj are notable members of said cast, though they are not technically the focus. Obi and Izana might arguably be more important than the rest of the side cast, but even they do not have much to go off of beyond their base characterizations. Zen and Shirayuki, however, are ripe for picking.\\n\\n\r\nZen is the easiest to start with. Zen is a dutiful prince. He completes his paperwork, he cares for the people of his country, and he takes responsibility for his own actions. Perhaps most importantly, Zen looks out for Shirayuki. Obviously it is because he is a kindhearted and respectful young man, but it also because he clearly has deep feelings for her.\\n\\n\r\nDespite Zen upholding his status as prince, he often acts of his own volition. He sneaks away from Mitsuhide and Kiki to tease them a bit, he dresses up as a guard to observe his people on \u201cOpen Castle Day\u201d from a different vantage point, and he makes sure to drop whatever he is doing should Shirayuki find herself in trouble. From this list, it is clear that, even when he is not following what he is \u201csupposed\u201d to do, he has the people around him in mind (especially Shirayuki).\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Zen was not always like this. As a child, he was na\u00efve. He rebelled against authority. He hated being seen as someone above others. He understood that everybody compared him to his older, more accomplished brother. All he wanted was to be treated like any other normal kid. Thus, he flocked to Atri, his childhood best friend. Through Atri and Atri\u2019s death, Zen sees firsthand the difference between him and the common man. Atri\u2019s death deeply affects him \u2013 Mitsuhide is, thankfully, there to support the young prince \u2013 but rather than resting on his laurels, Zen vows to become the type of prince, the type of person, that anybody \u2013 be they a recent traitor or a civilian \u2013 can view not as a distant man but as a close friend. Thus, the path he takes leads him down that of kindness, respect, and camaraderie.\\n\\n\r\nShirayuki, in contrast to Zen, is a bit more complex. Shirayuki is not a princess, she is a woman with a knack for herbs and flowers who also happens to have uniquely colored hair. Above anything, though, she wants to forge her own path. She does not like people controlling where she goes, and more importantly she does not like people telling her she cannot do something. Akagami even pokes fun at this during her drunken state; she tries to go to Fort Laxdo, alone, to help the soldiers there in order to apologize to Zen for getting him in trouble.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, Shirayuki is not the best character possible. At least, not yet. Shirayuki acts independently, she is both funny and sweet, and she is undeniably cute. This makes her extremely likable to not just the people around her but also the audience. But she does not necessarily grow as a person. She remains pretty much the same independent, sweet, and cute woman from the moment she cuts her hair to the final light show at the end of this first season.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, outside of a single (and single-framed) flashback, Shirayuki\u2019s past life is unknown. This detail seems unimportant, but it is actually quite clever. Again, Shirayuki is someone who is always moving forward. Dwelling on the past is something she would never consider because that is just not who she is. So, the anime ignoring her past further highlights the ideals that Shirayuki has about following one\u2019s path in life and never looking back. Thus, the path she takes leads her up that of goals, achievements, and dreams.\\n\\n\r\nFor both Zen and Shirayuki, they follow a path of their own design. And as the anime shows, their paths converge. At first, they just crossed. Zen comforting Shirayuki as she cried over his medical records, Shirayuki falling into Zen\u2019s arms, and Zen kissing Shirayuki for the first time in the watchtower. By the end, their paths no longer cross. Now, rather than moving down their path by their lonesome, they are moving on the same path together, hand-in-hand, as the couple they were always meant to be. That is to say, they have achieved a balance that befits them both. A status barrier still separates Shirayuki and Zen, but that barrier, as has been shown time and again, means nothing to them. For them, all that truly matters are each other.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other character details worth noting, those not directly tied to Shirayuki and Zen. Mitsuhide receives a proportionate amount of focus that makes his character more than just a man that guards his prince. Contrarily, Kiki and Gazelt (Shirayuki\u2019s main boss) are sorely lacking in the characterization department. At the same time, the constant shuffling of villains seems like a poor decision since they each become one-offs, but doing this puts Shirayuki and Zen into more scenarios together, leading to more opportunities for the two to connect.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether \u2013 and given that this is the first half of the anime \u2013 the characters, while not amazing, are poised and ready for what is to come in the continuation.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme starts off awkwardly, but maintains its stride following its first few notes. What is most impressive about the OP is the airy quality about it, as if the singing and the instruments are carried by the wind and not by their power alone. The soft background choir and the subtle ambient sounds further contribute to this feeling of lightness. There is this small dip in the middle of the track where the piece somewhat resets itself, and in doing so prevents the release of the tension the song had built up immediately prior, adding weight towards the conclusion of the piece. Combined with the chimes and the rhythmically parallel lyrics, the track makes for a wonderful beginning to every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme is nowhere near as floaty. Instead, the ED chooses a kind of stepwise approach, the beat and the lyrics stepping through the song. In contrast to the OP, the beginning of the piece is the strongest part, starting off orchestral and dance-like in tone. This leads into a mellow, dainty track that more or less follows the general mood of the show. The piece is not fairy tale-esque, hurting its relevancy, but it is at the minimum catchy to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the original soundtrack, it follows in the path of the OP. Almost every piece is grandiose, orchestral in tone and fairy tale in feeling. Instruments like the harp and the flute help to achieve this feeling faster, although the tracks are not without calming violins and shakers. One of the tracks is particularly moving: a slow trumpet, followed by an ensemble of triumph, can only be described as magical. Besides the more uplifting pieces, the anime also includes tracks filled with harrowing violins as well as mysterious guitars for those grim times. But no matter what part of the OST is playing, the music produced is nothing short of stellar.\\n\\n\r\nThe last bit of sound-work is the voice acting which (after careful consideration) sees an average level of performances. Saori Hayami as Shirayuki can easily be said to have performed the best, her womanly and determined way of speaking fitting the red-haired maiden perfectly. But beyond Ms. Hayami\u2019s performance, the rest of the cast is not that noteworthy. Ryota Osaka as Zen has a kind and princely way of speaking, Kaori Nazuka as Kiki speaks as nonchalant as possible, and Nobuhiko Okamoto as Obi as a wily tune to his voice, demonstrating that they each fit their role nicely enough. But nobody reaches the same sense of perfection that Ms. Hayami does throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI will say it until the day I die: I love romance. The love interest blushing, the holding of hands, the much-anticipated first kiss; all of it makes my heart skip a beat.\\n\\n\r\nFor this reason, I really liked this one. While the beginning makes it sort of unclear how Shirayuki feels about Zen \u2013 Zen, in contrast, wears his emotions on his sleeve \u2013 the further along the anime went, the more romance I got, and consequently the happier this anime made me. Zen getting mad at himself for not saving Shirayuki faster while she was trapped on the island was awesome. Shirayuki and Zen telling each other at Fort Laxdo that they are the driving forces for one another is way too adorable. Shirayuki looking absolutely flabbergasted after Zen kissed her, for the first time, following her radiant smile made me laugh out loud due to joy and excitement. Every small flirt, every romantic happening between Shirayuki and Zen put as big of a grin as could fit on my face.\\n\\n\r\nI also like the not-really-said-out-loud-but-probably-more-than-likely romantic pairing between Mitsuhide and Kiki. Literally nothing happens romantically between them, but I can see the anime taking that direction if it wanted (and I hope that it does).\\n\\n\r\nOne part of the anime that I take offense to is Obi\u2019s interest in Shirayuki. He seems like a kind dude, but at the same time the anime trying to make it seem as if he wants to be more than just friends with Shirayuki is irritating to say the least. His presence gets in the way of Shirayuki and Zen, which means his presence gets in the way of the romance, which also means his presence gets in the way of my happiness. I think he has a place in the anime, just not as the faux-rival the show is somewhat designing him to be.\\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-hime is a fairy tale in anime form. The characters\u2019 pathfinding, the stunning art and animation, and the wonderful romance come together to create a nice experience. Some hiccups do exist \u2013 such as some faltering with the story and portions of the sound-work \u2013 but they are not so egregious that they outright ruin what the show has started. To answer the mirror\u2019s earlier question, while Shirayuki and the gang are not the fairest of them all, they are certainly high up on the list.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, strong theme on balance leads to equally strong romance, some distractions throughout, with a mix of both well- and not-well-executed scenes\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, beautiful art, crisp animation, and thoughtful character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Zen starts off strong, Shirayuki, while extremely likable, needs a bit more work, but the two together prove that not every path has to be taken alone\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, okay ED, great OST, okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, the high amount of romance is divine, but Obi\u2019s presence I could do without\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "The trigger to the female main character Shirayuki meeting who she'll meet, getting into messes she'll be getting into is all because of her red hair, but in the anime you have a silver haired prince, a blue haired attendant and a dark green haired character, it makes no sense for her hair to be the solely unique one.\r\nApart from that, the story development is very entertaining, the anime doesn't empathise her looks too much and focuses on a good character build. But the character backgrounds of most characters are lacking or very anti-climatically explained and the protagonists don't really have an antagonist to balanceit out. You could say it's too happy go lucky, no matter what happens it'll turn out well for the protagonists.\\n\r\nThe female protagonist is a bit too perfect in that aspect as well, considering she's living in a medieval timeline, living alone, but targeted by many for her rare red hair colour, she bears no grudge towards anybody, even naive at the present and in the future too. She is independent, headstrong and doesn't falter in front of hardships. Admirable but considering it logically it's a too good to be true story of a girl meeting her prince charming. (In comparison the male protagonist faces several more realistic hardships)",

When reading the manga, I really liked the ethnic & detailed background, and feel. I would have liked it if the anime used more realistic colours with less vividness. \r\nAlso, I feel that the anime puts more power into the romance parts rather than loyalty, pride, and responsibility, that Ifound made the story very deep and meaningful. I really liked the choice of the voice actor for Shirayuki but I hoped she would have talked with more strength in her words. I couldn't feel the strong and responsible character she should have. With Mitsuhide, I think the anime makes him appear too flimsy, while he is more down to earth in the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThese are opinions that I had because I read the manga before and can't help but compare because I love the manga so much. lol \\n",

            "content": "TL;DR: If you like a story that resembles a Disney movie, romantic cliches, heartwarming romance, and like having everything go your way in terms of story, give this a watch. If you don't like very stereotypical shoujo romance anime, I wouldn't suggest this anime in particular, but give it a go.\r\nHaving been a fan of the manga for a while and not being aware there was an anime adaptation the whole time, I was ecstatic beyond belief to begin the first episode in the two season series we've all come to know and love. Personally, the premise of the story reminded me of something thatwould come from Disney; though that didn't bother me at all.\\n\r\n      The basic synopsis of the anime, is that Shirayuki (Snow White), known for her apple red-hair (oh, the irony) and her expertise in herbalism, is chosen to become a concubine for the prince in her home-country, Raj Schenazade. In an act of defiance, Shirayuki decides to cut her hair, essentially quit her old life as an herbalist in Tanbarun and crosses the border into a neighbouring kingdom, Clarines. From there, she has a fateful encounter with a white-haired boy roughly the same age; and from there, the two develop a long-lasting relationship filled with adventure, romance, and well; more romance.\\n\r\n    The story was something that felt very straight-forward and linear; following a path other anime of the similar demographic have taken. Though that may be true, something about the simplicity of the story and the smooth transitioning as well as the development of the different relationships in the anime made it very magical, or maybe even Disney-like, per se.\\n\r\n     The art throughout the anime; the different scenes involving the castle, the city, the environment in general; I have to give it to Bones, the art was something I really appreciated for its exquisiteness all throughout, and was something that felt really soothing to me as I continued to watch. The quality of the art was very consistent and accurately displayed the mood, whether it be warm and fuzzy, or stone-cold; showing no visible drop in quality throughout the series. Heck, I'd even say the quality got visibly better between the seasons. \\n\r\n    The selling point in the anime for me would've definitely been the music. Other reviews I've seen haven't really talked about the music in particular, but the soundtracks played throughout the anime at pivotal moments made it all the more heartwarming, giving me an \"Awwwww..\" feeling as I continued to watch in delight. It's been a month since I downloaded some of the soundtracks on my phone, and I still give it a listen when I feel like reliving those warm moments from the anime.\\n\r\n   All in all, the character development between the two would probably be, fairly linear to say the least. It feels like everything was set to follow the most stereotypical shoujo cliche possible, but reluctantly I'd have to say that even then, Akagami no Shirayukihime is one of the better shoujo animes out there. I'd definitely give this a watch if you want everything to go your way and not have to worry in the least about any obstacles the two lovebirds face.\\n\r\n    To conclude, I just had to give this anime a 10/10 for enjoyment, and a 9/10 overall. It was something I was able to follow along with without much effort, and the characters, the art, the sound, and the story all mixed in were very enjoyable and very heartwarming to watch. I would DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone who enjoys shoujo anime / manga and is looking for a good, cliche, heartwarming relationship between two lovers.\\n",

            "content": "Honestly, it's not for everyone.\r\nI myself have a few complaints in the way of how bland Zen is for a majority of the first season and the sheer amount of time Shirayuki falls down (literally, I mean). I don't really think it's super unique, either. \r\nHere are the things Akagami no Shirayuki-hime does right, in my opinion. 1) It doesn't lead you on. You see the relationship, you know it's going somewhere, and it does. 2) Shirayuki actually works to stay by Zen's side. It's easy to have a story line where seemingly unimportant girl meets prince, falls in love, realizes the social gap, andthen some unforeseen circumstance turns her into someone who can stay by his side. Shirayuki doesn't have that. 3) Not all bad guys stay bad guys, not all good guys act like good guys, and not all girls are evil. This general hallmark of shojo romance is annoying and I'm glad it could be subverted here. 4) Zen doesn't absolutely detest his position. It happens so often, you have a prince who doesn't want to be a prince and, without any consideration for his actions, runs away. Sure, Zen acts more freely and has some conflict about being a prince, but its justified in story and he still takes his status into consideration even when Shirayuki is involved.\\n\r\nNot saying it's perfect, or original, or that everyone should like it, but I think it's pretty good.",

            "content": "The season is coming to a close, and here I am, waiting for the second cour of this season to come around. Akagami no Shirayukihime is the definition of a story thats not special, but yet its special in its own way. The series consists of relaxing and simplistic story. With a lot of stuff coming around from the anime. It's not personally a 10/10 anime due to some sort of issues I have with the series.\r\nOf course that doesn't mean the show is terrible or atrocious. Of course not. The series is essentially a good watch but not towards the hype that I washearing before it aired.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story pretty much is this in a simplistic way. Our female protagonist got in a problem in her own town, she goes away, and meets prince charming one day, then later on she decided to go with him to Clarines to become what she wants to be. Sound simple enough eh? Im not good at explaining but thats the summary of the series in a manner. The story as much as I can say its not that great. The reason why is because its technically nothing special about it. Its pretty much some of the same things I saw before. But this is more so fairy tale wise storyline. The story is not terrible but its not great either. There were a few moments in the anime that got me intrigued and that would be the process of the main heroine during her tasks as an herbalist. That makes it special in its own way because you can see the chemistry of medicines, as well with simple explanations. The only issue I had with the story its the romance. It felt like a little forced yet weird, thats not technically a bad thing because that actually happens sometimes in anime, but it feels extremely jarring and a bit out of place. That would be the only issue I had with the series. Overall the story is decent and simplistic. It doesn't force you for the most part and its essentially a dose of relaxing moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: One thing the series has as the strong point would be the characters. Their personalities are so well presented and as well with their interactions in the series. It looks natural and nicely done, its really nice how they interact with each other in every way and how they seem to go along at least to an extent. Every member took a role at least and did not became much of a irrelevance to the story. For the main cast my favorite character of the series is Shirayuki. She's very determined, sacrificial and also strong in a lot of ways. She's also brave and she has courage. She's not your stereotypical weak character trope since a lot of the times in anime, the female protagonist looks more like a weak role and does not take part at all, or becomes a damsel in distress where she has to be saved by the main hero. Thats also something I love about the show. As for the others they did took a role to become more of relevance and a role for one another. For example Zen's friend (from the present) and body guard in which we get a bit of insight of the past. Ryu who also became a better person or nicer thanks to Shirayuki, and other things I can say. I have a bit of problem with some characters of the series but overall the characters are well done for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: This is one of the strongest points of the series. The studio behind this series is none other than Studio Bones, who's the studio behind works such as Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Noragami, Soul Eater, etc. The show took a presentation of marvelous scenery and bright colors. It looks a lot like the actual nature and it looks like the whole color of rainbows. The art is bright colored and also lively, natural, and very well detailed with its nature areas. Its very well done and brightly I will say that I give Bravo to Bones. The animation as well is very well done with smooth motion and when the fights comes around it gives an excellent fluid motion.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: The music department is another great essential part of the series. The music itself for me its quite memorable as it does give a soft yet smooth and soothing songs and ost to compel the scenarios, where its done right for a lot of the times. Its relaxing and using instrumental approaches makes the genres fit perfectly as well. For the sound its also sound realistic when you hear from the bird chirping towards the wind, its just nicely done for my eyes. The voice acting as well took the spot as the voices do fit with the characters personalities and characteristics, which I feel happy for Bones for picking them right.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: My personal enjoyment would be even tho I had a tad bits of issues with the series, it does have a lot of the moments I enjoy overall, including the chemistry and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.8/10\\n\\n\r\nIts a very good show compelled with a good cast, great art and animation, fitting music and of course a decent story.",

            "content": "Red hair - most commonly referred to as the hair color of the perfect girl, at least for me. It is indeed special, so special actually that, according to this anime, it warrants the attention of not only one, but two princes! You don't believe me? Yeah, I don't believe myself either. Or this anime while we're at it. \r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-hime is an odd specimen of anime - mainly because it's rather average in both the story and characters, yet it still somehow captivates you. By all means, it's nothing special, but it still somehow etches itself in your mind and makes you thinkof it, at least a little. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Pros/cons\\n\\n\r\n+ Simple story\\n\r\n+ Beautiful art design and scenery\\n\r\n+ Good voice acting\\n\r\n+ Relatively interesting side characters \\n\r\n+ Quite enjoyable as the whole\\n\r\n+ Large room to grow\\n\\n\r\n- Underwhelming main duo\\n\r\n- Lack of interesting plots within the story\\n\r\n- First half is quite episodic and most things from it are never mentioned again\\n\r\n- Too goody-goody for me\\n\\n\r\nThe story on Akagami is no feat of any kind; it's your standard common girl meets a prince and problems ensue, and it isn't even executed that well. As such ordinary story, it has your standard set of disapproving characters to whom our main girl needs to prove her worth, a set of characters that don't think too highly of royalty etc., you get the point. First half of Akagami is purely of episodic nature, as our main girl, Shirayuki, faces ordeals that come with being close with a prince and having an unexpectedly distinct hair. The best thing I can say about the story is that its simplicity is good for this anime - it's straightforward and you know what to expect, but still somewhat charming enough for you not to go down on it too hard. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, there isn't much of the story here - aside from our main girl 'proving' to everyone around her how she's unique and special enough, despite being a commoner, to stand by prince's side. Sadly, none of those moments are really striking enough to be memorable, and it all falls into sideways by the time next episode/mini-arc rolls around. It's relaxing enough, though, as it doesn't have melodramatic feeling to it, and the problems are never truly exaggerated so it's something to be appreciative of when it comes to this type of anime.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother decent point of it is the dialogue; although, at times, it tries way too hard to be abstract and artistic, for the most part it keeps itself cool, calm and collected. Aside from a few scenes, there were never really times when I had a hard time believing that someone would utter such sentence, so props for that. \\n\\n\r\nProduction values, on the other hand, are right high. Art design is beautiful, and more than a few scenes have etched themselves in my mind and I'll probably have a hard time forgetting them, if at all. Designs of characters, while not a standout, are well presented and each character has its own uniqueness - mainly related to the color of hair, unfortunately. There's a whole spectrum of colors here - red, blue, white, blonde, brown, black, but most are done well enough in a rather realistic matter, if you'd believe it. \\n\\n\r\nScenery though is definitely the high point, as it boasts some breathtaking pieces in nearly all episodes. Gardens, sunsets, ocean - the high driving force of art department, and it's apparent that a lot of work has been put into those scenes. \\n\\n\r\nOn the sound department there isn't really much to say. All voice actors did their job well enough and are deserving of praise, and even the music was quite solid, despite me never truly 'feeling it'. Ambiance sounds to hold the scenery back a little bit, but not by a large margin. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters though, it's more of a hit and miss. Our main duo, Shirayuki and Zed, were far too goody-goody for me. They don't seem to hold grudges and, even if they do, they don't last for very long. This is especially the case with Shirayuki. \\n\\n\r\nHer character doesn't have the appeal of someone who'd bewitch half the guys in the kingdom, princes included. Aside from her hair, there's nothing truly special about her character; yes, she's hardworking and honest, but those aren't the traits she should be praised for. On the other hand, her rather humane nature is quite refreshing, since she really doesn't go balls-to-the-walls when unexpected things happen and deals with them rationally. Despite that, though, I feel like her character could have used a little bit more refinement, and she should have been given some sort of a edge to go along her honest personality. As it stands, she's far too dull in my opinion to hold the show, and the affection of so many people, on her own.\\n\\n\r\nMost of what I said about Shirayuki applies to Zen as well; I feel that, as a prince who knows how people work and function, he's far too goody-goody for me to look at him and believe it. Although, at times, we do see the other side of him, or rather the side that should be dominant, there weren't too many moments where he acted like an actual prince for me to consider him a well written character. Definitely better than Shirayuki, but not by a large margin. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the rest of the cast, only two really stand out: Obi, and the first prince. Obi's a rather intriguing character and there really isn't a dull moment with him on the screen. He has the offbeat personality and often pokes fun at things I would poke fun at. He's laid back, yet still manages to be helpful. In my opinion, Zen should have had his personality as it would have been far more fun to watch him. Nonetheless, definitely the high point of the cast, and I wish he'd have gotten far more screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThe other one is the First Prince. His character starts off as your everyday pompous asshole prince, but it does't take too long to realize that he's just really acting like any person of royalty would. Of all the cast, despite receiving rather low amount of screen time, he seems to be the most complex character and one I wish they'd explore more in the second season. \\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-hime was a rather relaxing and enjoyable watch. Although nothing extraordinary, and a first few episodes were rather dull, it was still something I consider worth my while. With the 2nd season out, I'm hoping for more dynamic between main duo as well as more of the story. As it stands though, on its own, Akagami is good enough to be viewed by anyone interested in a rather relaxing anime with cute romance and decent side characters.",

            "content": "it is souls that always has a prince and a citizen of another country as a story.\r\nShirayuki is a simple girl with a very particular characteristic: a head of intense red that certainly does not go unnoticed. To notice it is just right Raji, prince of his native town, Tambarun, who, intrigued by the girl's peculiar hair color, decides to take her as a concubine. Shirayuki doesn't even think about pleasing the stupid prince and runs away. The meeting of destiny takes place in a forest, when it encounters a boy to whom it will heal wounds. Our protagonist is in fact an herbalist andmakes the most of her knowledge to save Zen, which we will discover is the second prince of a neighboring country, Clarines. If it is true that, as Zen says, red is the color of destiny, even their encounter is not accidental and Shirayuki will soon find himself at the palace of the handsome little prince for his apprenticeship as court herbalist. From this moment begins the new life of the girl, firm and determined to build step by step a life and a destiny of which she will be the creator herself, without giving up, as in any self-respecting romantic fairy tale, love.\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayukihime is therefore presented as a simple story, made up of genuine characters and not at all complex, who in a fairly transparent manner show feelings, aims and emotions. If the series is therefore a romantic slice of life set in the time of ladies and knights, fun, simple, that sometimes adds a pinch of adventure, inevitably it lacks bite compared to other similar series, standing on a quiet course that only occasionally grants some emotional flicker. This certainly does not mean that the series is necessarily boring, but a bit of extra verve and a deeper understanding of the characters would have helped to make it more intense and active.\\n\r\nIt should also be noted that Shirayuki and Zen, almost absolute protagonists, are characters that are a bit over-done and finished, that starting from a fairly predefined character base, do not evolve particularly, as if they were already complete as people and characters. Shirayuki, who has no obvious defects, looks like a heroine too perfect while the adorable blue Prince Zen is ... a little too \"blue\". Despite renewing their good intentions of personal and work growth every day, in reality they seem already perfect as they are, even though Zen sometimes shows a slightly childish character (but always remaining in the field of adorability). In short, the less perfect and constantly evolving characters would have made, in my opinion, the most compelling and engaging series, in the same way, a deepening of the other characters would have helped to give a sense of true chorus to the work (an example: the Kiki's story has been pretty synthesized, making you lose a lot of what the character is).\\n\r\nGraphically the anime is well done and is very detailed. The framerate is very nice. In addition, the anime constantly maintains a very high brightness level, which defines all the symbolic characteristics of the characters (Shirayuki's hair, for example).\\n\r\nThe music is comparable to that used in fairy tales, and it is no coincidence that this anime has a very fairy-tale and sweet plot.\\n\r\nThe characters are well studied and have very original characteristics; Shirayuki with her hair and Zen with her \"childish and in love\" attitude. But the one who gives the most attention is without a doubt Obi, clearly inspired by the character of Naruto for his eyes and his agility.",

            "content": "Despite what harsh anime critics may try to argue, sometimes enjoyable shows can just be FUN. Simple as that. Going into something called 'Snow White with the Red Hair' odds are, it's not going to be some overly complex story. It's a love story, a fairy tale to an extent (minus any fantasy). This show is just straight up cute, fun, and enjoyable to watch. It's easy. And using words like \"fun\" and \"cute\" probably sound uneducated and silly, but I assure you that isn't the case. There are different forms of art for different people, different moods, and different mindsets. Sometimes we want darkand twisted stories, sometimes we want comedy, and sometimes we just want easy. This, is one of those shows. \\n\r\nThe animation is beautiful actually. It's very clean cut and in my opinion, significantly more enjoyable than other anime styles I've seen. It just feels natural and clean. \\n\r\nThe music isn't my favorite, I'll be honest. Theme songs are usually a big deciding factor to me on if I'll like an anime or not. But not this one. The theme is frankly... just boring. But, the show is still good despite it. I guess it's just as they say, can't judge a book by it's cover. So I guess it's: can't judge an anime by it's opening theme song. \\n\r\nCharacters are kind of run of the mill, nothing about them is exceptionally new. But guess what, no art is original. There is nothing wrong with recognizing characters easily. They are still just as likable, regardless if you've seen other similar characters in past shows. Zen is charismatic, handsome, and constantly aims to better himself. That's a good quality for a main character to have, regardless if it's original or not. And Shirayukiis is an exquisite female lead. I always have a soft spot for strong, independent female leads, and this one is no exception. Shirayukii obviously has feelings for Zen from the get go, but she doesn't let this make her a weakling. She has been kidnapped and been the \"damsel in distress\" but never does she ACT like on. Even when in a bad situation with no escape, she is headstrong and thinks for herself, never one just hoping for her savior prince to come, even though he always does. She also, is the hero many times. That characteristic alone, is quite refreshing and makes the show immensely more enjoyable. \\n\r\nThis show kind of has a bad wrap on here, but it really shouldn't. Simple and fun does not mean bad. It means simple and fun.",

            "content": "Akagami no Shirayuki-hime has been riddled with so many plot holes it had hurt my eyes. \r\nI tried for a few years to just get past the first half of the first episode and it took me until my fifth time through to get through just that. I found myself always pausing to rant about a certain plothole or just how stupid and contrived a situation was. All throughout the first half, I saw ranting and screaming at every stupid situation that was presented to us. Every situation is supposed to build up the main character Shirayuki who is so stagnant as a character thatit melts the mind. The whole appeal is that you get this cute love story between a prince and a commoner and it just makes me want to hit my head step of the way. I genuinely thought that only one seen had been competently executed because it was actually cute and made some sense, however, my praise for that one scene cannot be shared with the rest of this show.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on I find that perhaps my main problem with this is that I thought the show would be what the description says. A show where a girl with red hair runs away from a kingdom, however, I find that I was sorely mistaken as the problem we are presented within the description is solved in the first episode. That is how every episode plays out as well, the problem is presented and then the problem is solved and every time I want to scream because I as a viewer do not care about the problem that is presented in that episode so every conclusion is duller than the last.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I don't find myself sharing the same praise for the art as many other people have. Starting off the character designs are competent but hardly new or impressive. Every character is just so bland I couldn't even consider it good. Secondly, we get these janky close of shots of characters and sometimes it's so unappealing to the eye's I get wildly frustrated. I am a firm believer that if we get a close-up more detail should be involved however this show rarely adds extra detail when doing said close-up. The only place I can find praise in the art is with some of the backgrounds. Some backgrounds are super pretty and look really nice and it adds a feeling of depth compared to the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I found the show boring and in lack of competence.\\n\\n",

The atmosphere feels very much like a pseudo-fairy tale taking place in a grounded setting. The lack of stakes is also a huge flaw considering the dilemmas the MC had to go through 6/10\r\nCharacters: They are just as simplistic and only come off as a bit charming due to their actions and some of the jokes that occur between them. Again not bad but nothing too special. Fairly enjoyable on the surface and that's about it forthem. They lack depth and merely have one or two backstories to make them anymore interesting. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: The production values are what breathed life into this series. The animation is gracefully done when it needs to be and the soundtrack effectively established the relatively calm tone of the show. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I had a fine time watching this, even though the script is very formulaic the presentation of the show is what ultimately won me over. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It was ok, it's not a terrible show but it hasn't done much of anything to really make itself stand out. It's fine for a one-time watch and that's it.",

It had a sense of purpose with its romance, and you can tell by episode 5 how fast this season is going to go. \r\nStory(8)\r\nThe story follows the relationship between Shirayuki and Zen(2nd prince) as it grows and develops. Really just a typical romance story, but that doesn't stop it from being something worth watching. The execution was just spot on, and every scene was animated beautifully. I do have my complaints however, but those are just complaints aimedat the shoujo demographic as a whole so i won't say anything xD.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9)\\n\r\nThe art is gorgeous, beautiful bright colors, and vibrant scenery. The animation starts out great, but later down the road, the animation took a dip in quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound(9)\\n\r\nThe music gave a more relaxed feel, as well keeping the romantic atmosphere afloat \\n\\n\r\nCharacters(8)\\n\r\nThe characters are pushed to the side to focus more on the budding relationship of Zen and Shirayuki. The other characters, Mitsuhide, Kiki, and Obi are used as catalysts to speed up the growth of their relationship. However Obi seems to grow closer to Shirayuki, and starts to show signs of feelings for her.  That leaves me with the idea that there will be some kind of love triangle, and I don't know how i feel about that. I'll see for myself when i take the time to sit down and watch the 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9)\\n\r\nAkagami is really enjoyable, it left me with more to be desired in the next episode, and when it was all done I didn't feel as though my time was wasted. Hopefully by the end of the 2nd season, i'll feel the same way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9)\\n\r\nI recommend Akagami to those who love a good romance and are like me when it comes to shoujo xD.",

            "content": "Story: 8/10\r\n-The story to this anime is simple, yet enjoyable; however, there are a few minor issues I ran into while watching the anime. For one, the anime CONSTANTLY reminds the audience of Shirayuki's \"unusual red hair\" which gets quite repetitive.  \r\n-The anime also throws out a few references to the original Snow White such as poisoned apples, \"Mirror, Mirror on the wall,\" etc.; however, it's a completely different story.\r\nCharacters: 8.5/10\r\n-The two main protagonists, Shirayuki and Zen, are the main highlights of this anime.  Shirayuki is portrayed as a very kind, yet strong willed and determined woman, who works VERY hard to reachher goals of becoming a court pharmacist. My only problem with this character is that so far, we know little about her backstory, for example, it's been said she was raised by her grandparents, but there's not much more to it that that.   Zen is portrayed as a prince who cares for all of his friends, especially Shirayuki.  He goes to great lengths to rescue her when she's in trouble and the relationship between him and her is downright adorable.  Fortunately, he doesn't hold the same problem Shirayuki has, as there is an entire episode dedicated to his backstory.\\n\r\n-As for the side characters, they could have been a bit better developed, but some of this is resolved in the second season.  For example, Prince Raji is initially a selfish brat who would abuse his power to get whatever he wants, but in the second season, after Shirayuki visits his kingdom to improve their relationship, he becomes much more accepting of the people around him.\\n\r\n-Some of the villains are quite pathetic though, for example, in the tenth episode, the villain laughs maniacally at almost everything.  However, the villain in the second season was very well executed in things such as kidnapping Shirayuki.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 8.5/10\\n\r\n-For the most part, the animation is quite pretty; very colorful and detailed.  However, it does drop in certain scenes.  Does this ruin the show? Absolutely not. Just distracting.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\n-The music really sets the tone for the show.  And the openings are very catchy and upbeat.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\r\n-I really enjoyed this anime, although a little cheesy in certain scenes, it's a very cute, relaxing, and interesting anime.  Is it perfect? No. But from any of the flaws I've mentioned, the anime seems to redeem some of them later on... ...except for the whole thing about Shirayuki's hair.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 9/10\\n\r\n-If you like a lighthearted historical romance, then this anime is for you.\\n",

We get introduced to this world of kingdoms where the prince has to keep up with his olbigations adn we see him doing his job other than justhanging around his love interest forgetting about the rest of the world as it usually tends to happen. Shirayuki nontheless has a purpose staying in the castle as court herbalist and actually does things by her own merits. If you like historical anime then you are also most likely to enjoy this, and also the art is very pretty and the music, though not my favourite, is incredibly perfect for the atmosphere the anime is trying to create. \\n\\n\r\ni enjoyed this pretty much and i am very excited for the next season coming soon!",

Everyone just looks so sleek and colorful that I could stare at them all day. \\n\\n\r\nThe music isn't anything special or extraordinarily memorable in my opinion, but I do think that the opening has a certain charm to it. I think it's really more the opening video than the song that gets to me, though.\\n\\n\r\nBeing only twelve episodes, they haven't gone into huge depth in the anime with many of the characters, but I don't really have any criticism for any of them. I love both Shirayuki and Zen the best. Shirayuki is a surprisingly likable female protagonist in that, unlike many fairytale-type heroines, she is strong and resourceful. Although she does need to be saved quite a few times in the series, she doesn't just sit around and wait like a damsel in distress, either. She's a smart girl and thinks things through, and I find myself cheering for her quite often. Zen is also a likeable character; he's heroic and dashing, as fairytale princes should be, but he is also kind and respectful to Shirayuki and does whatever he can to help her acheive her goals. Watching their adorable relationship develop is just so much fun :)\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Akagami no Shirayuki-hime is definitely one of my new favorites. I would probably recommend it to you if you like a sweet story, or otherwise enjoy fairytales or a good Disney movie. I think I might have to pick up the manga, sometime.",

            "content": "Short and sweet review. Do you know what to expect from romance anime and are tired of people pointing out the \"genre stereotypes\" and then judging the anime only around that? Just want to know the important stuff and if you should watch it? I've got you covered.\r\nNote: This is a review of the entire 24 episode series.\r\nI put off watching this one because of the \"Snow White\" title. I assumed it had something to do with the classic story. But I was wrong. It literally has almost nothing to do with it.\r\nA girl with uncommon red hair is forced to flee her home countryafter being pursued by an arrogant prince. She winds up meeting the prince of a neighboring country while fleeing her pursuers and goes with him and his entourage back to the neighboring country. The story focuses on her as she strives to make a name for herself as a court herbalist and overcome people's skepticism about her as she grows closer to the prince in the country she escaped to.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely loved this show, until the end. The pacing, the characters, the art, the music. It was all great. I enjoyed every episode and flew through it because of how good it was. I hate romances that don't progress, and this one moved at a nice pace. I have no complaints about the show as a whole. It had a nice balance of action, drama, romance, and plot twists, which made it satisfying to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is the ending. This is another show that ended before it was complete. They try to give us the standard \"Oh no we needed like another 24-48 episodes to properly deliver the ending of the story so here is an ambiguous shot of the characters together to give the impression their story continues and they stay together\" ending. And I hate when romance anime do that.\\n\\n\r\nMost genres can get away with series cliffhangers where there is no real resolution. But romances that do this ruin it. I was so invested in this story, and then it just ends. No resolution, no finding out what happens to them, just over.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, I realize there is a manga I could read if I wanted a complete story arc. But I'm tired of that being the easy out for these anime that refuse to give us a resolution to the story we get invested in. I shouldn't have to change the type of media I am consuming just to have a resolution to the story. It's crap, and studios that do this just piss me off.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to recommend this show given that the ending is just non-existent, but everything else was so good that I think it is still worth it.\\n\\n\r\nHIGHLIGHTS: Everything except the ending, great characters, pacing, and story (tried and true plot, but it's still entertaining)\\n\\n\r\nDISAPPOINTMENTS: Oh my god, why make a romance anime without an ending? WHHYYYYYY?!?!?!",

The female lead is brave , strong and independent.\r\nThe idea and story line for this anime is just outstanding ...... If you love romance and fantasy or if strong female lead is your thing..... Akagami no shirayuki-hime is a must watch.\r\nThe plot and the characters really fit together and you will be absorbed in this anime when you start watching it.\r\nAkagami no shirayuki-hime is overly simplistic but unique in its own way. You will not get bored by its simplicity but will be absorbed in the show.\r\nThe art is also good. You can't call it realisticbut it is pretty good.\\n\r\nThe sound really fitted with the characters and the background music was also good. \\n\r\nPersonally I enjoyed this show and I recommend this show to every otaku out there......

I love the twist on the snow white tale, I love Prince Zen and Shirayuki, I love the characters, the art, the story, the romance, the adventure, the EVERYTHING!!!! I find it a wonderful choice to start out with. It is very appropriate, a little bad language, mild violence, but on the whole, it is probably the most appropriateanime I have found, great for kids with high morals!! The romance is squeal worthy and the plot is great! I really, really enjoyed this anime and would recommend it to anyone!!! :D",

            "content": "If dwarves were ever involved in this production, Disney would probably make sure it never saw the light of day. Thankfully, no dwarves are involved in this series.\r\nThe only resemblance to the classic Grimm fairy tale is a prop in the first arc of the production, and the word \"apple\" in the description of Shirayuki's hair. That's about it. Instead of a princess in exile living with a bunch of dwarves, Shirayuki is a humble herbalist living in the city. When the local spoiled prince decides he wants her as his plaything, she cuts off most of her hair, leaves it for the prince (\"...since you appear to like my hair more than I do...\"), and makes Billy Big-steps in the general direction away from the prince.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I saw that scene, I applauded and said, \"Well, he's going to need a bathtub full of lotion for that burn.\" This is the sort of spirit and quick thinking that is so often missing from heroine characters, and she demonstrates that quick mind at critical moments during the show. Sure, it's a \"they all live happily ever after\" kind of fairy tale (and I totally understand that this kind of predictability can be dull), but the way she gets out of bad situations is usually with her brain, and a little help from Prince Charming, I mean, Zen. The only exception is if she's imprisoned (this will come back to bite her character). I'm fine with the scenarios in this show, where every bad situation ends in a happy ending, because it does a decent job of making me wonder, \"All right, Shirayuki, how are you going to get out of this one?\"\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Zen, it's kinda fun to see a Prince Charming character who isn't dressed in white armor and riding a white horse, but instead, a guy who would much rather take a nap in the woods than do boring government work. He's a bit like Shouta Kazehaya from KimiTodo-- he's charming, and he seems flawless, but his biggest weakness is the heroine.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's a weakness I could point out, it's probably the villains and supporting characters. Because Shirayuki and Zen are the central foci of the show, everyone else isn't nearly as well fleshed-out (even with the \"flashback\" episodes). The villains are basically Bad Guy tropes of various forms-- we have a spoiled brat, a couple of manipulative gaslighters, and a cheating aristocrat. This adds to predictability, which could downgrade the experience for some.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the show is easy on the eyes. Nothing spectacular, but nothing conspicuously awful either. The soundtrack is a good orchestral one, the melodies for some reason bring to mind the audio from classic Disney films. I'm struggling to remember details and style, which probably means I should re-watch.\\n\\n\r\nAll told, a solid production for a straight-ahead, slow romantic drama. I particularly like how Shirayuki was written with a brain and not just another pretty face.\\n",

            "content": "this review doesn't contain any spoilers and will be for both the first and second season of this anime.\r\nstory; 8/10\r\nThe story follows a young girl, Shirayuki, who possesses unusual beautiful red hair.\r\nWhile in some moments, you might feel like they have exaggerated the appeal of this hair color and most of the plot revolves around it, please note that this anime is made to be cheesy. And that's mainly why most liked it (including me) I mean it's shoujo after all.\r\nNow, Shirayuki lives in the country called Tanbarun and works as a pharmacist, as she knows a lot about herbs and medicine.\r\nThe prince of herhome country, asks her to become his mistress, just because of her hair, so she cuts it and runs off to Clarines, a neighboring country.\\n\\n\r\nThere, she meets Zen, Mitsuhide and Kiki, who she befriends. And Zen turns out to be the second prince of Clarines.\\n\\n\r\nThere, she starts working on becoming a court herbalist of Clarines.\\n\\n\r\nIt is kind of clich\u00e9, I mean you can just guess they're gonna fall in love and such. Also, I am not a big fan of shoujo.\\n\\n\r\nYet, to be honest, this anime has a weird habit of finding a way to hook you up more in each episode. The main plot might not look that exciting to you and it is somewhat predictable, but it is clear, straightforward and pretty nice actually.\\n\\n\\n\r\nart; 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is what i loved the most, to be completely honest. It is very pleasing and really beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just great I'm telling you.\\n\\n\r\nThe scenes are absolutely gorgeous and I don't know I just like it a lot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nsound; 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings were nice and really fitting to the anime, I definitely didn't dislike them, but I can easily say that I forgot all about them the minute I finished the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI also quite liked the soundtrack. Just like the openings and endings, the soundtrack is extremely fitting in each moment and well chosen, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThey are pretty light and don't distract you from the anime and are really enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\r\ncharacters; 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character developments are not massive for the main characters. There is, of course, but the anime seems to focus more on the secondary characters' developments.\\n\\n\r\nWhy? Well I feel like the mains keep influencing the people around them, just like they charm the audience, in a way.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, you might not see a lot of character development in Zen and Shirayuki but instead in people like Raj, Obi, etc.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, what I loved about the characters is that they're quite realistic.\\n\\n\r\nYou might feel like Shirayuki is a bit... too loved in some moments, but in the end, she doesn't have any supernatural ability, she's not overly badass, nor too weak; she's simply realistic.\\n\\n\r\nShe's bold, strong-willed, hardworking, selfless and kindheartedj but it never seems out of place or too clich\u00e9-like. I've never been able to see her as a Mary Sue.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Zen is really strong and very stubborn, he is also hardworking. He's really nice to other people and is absolutely adorable in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end, it's not just them, there are tons of amazing characters that have lots of potential. (my favorites are Obi and Raj, just saying)\\n\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment; 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEven if I sometimes got bored, as I said before this anime has a habit of finding ways and plots to hook me up more in each episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty slow-paced also but is somewhat always satisfying in the end?\\n\\n\r\nI loved the anime and I'm looking forward to reading the manga as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\noverall; 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-hime is a really good anime, in my opinion, and I think people should really give it a shot, because it's worth it.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're searching for a cheesy yet interesting plotline with cute couples and awesome characters; look no more! This anime will be perfect for you.",

While there is a premise, and the show has a few \u2018story arcs\u2019 in a sense, much ofthe show will feel very much like a slice-of-life anime. The premise, events, and the conflicts introduced themselves are not particularly original. Overall, the plot takes a backseat in favour of developing its characters\u2019 relationships, and this is where I think this show shines.\\n\\n\r\nThe focus the characters and their dynamics means that they become believable. Instead of falling into the easy stereotypes of the characters\u2019 roles (e.g. the devoted aide, the antagonistic older prince), and expecting those stereotypes to be accepted for what they are, major characters' motivations are established through a good balance of backstory and interaction, and in a very straightforward manner. This also means that it doesn\u2019t feel like the show treats its audience like idiots. Everything is given a strong foundation, allowing the show to progress unhindered by contradictions that need to be hurriedly explained away.\\n\\n\r\nThis is especially enjoyable to experience as Zen and Shirayuki\u2019s relationship progresses. From the beginning of the show, Shirayuki is established as an intelligent, independent character who wishes to live by her own merit. She is a \u2018strong female character\u2019, but in a believable way - her strengths manifest in multiple dimensions, but so do her weaknesses. Most importantly, these traits are not tossed to the side in favour of her pursuing a romance. Zen, as well, is refreshing as a male protagonist. Despite the evident power imbalance in the relationship, which is one of the most major sources of conflict in the show, he is at all times respectful of Shirayuki\u2019s need to be independent, a trait that he retains as his romantic feelings for her grow. When their relationship culminates towards the end of the show, it remains apparent that Zen values Shirayuki's friendship, companionship and intelligence over his own feelings. It is satisfyingly evident that their relationship is built on mutual respect, trust, and love. \\n\\n\r\nTechnically, this anime is well-executed. As an old fan of the manga, I was initially disappointed at the slight change in style, however, the show is vibrant, the animation smooth, and the art mostly consistent. While there is no particular flourish to the show, it still at time manages to be a visual treat. The sound is good, with the music serving its purpose in terms of establishing atmosphere and elevating emotional scenes, though not particularly memorable\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is one I can easily recommend to anyone looking for a feel-good romance shoujo anime, and perhaps some people outside of that description. \\n",

Seriously she should have kept it, she was still found anyways :(.\r\nAlso, I don't really like how the main character is loved by like everyone... I mean maybe one or two people but when almost everyone in the anime likes her it's kind of weird.\r\nAnyways, I really liked the romance of the story and the storyline overall. I liked how the relationship progressed between thetwo main characters. It could be very romantic during some scenes. I liked how cute and romantic this story was.\\n\\n\r\nIt also had a few really sad scenes at some points...\\n\\n\r\nI feel bad for one of the characters though who is not seen the same way by the main character, but begins to see her in that way. She doesn't really notice it although.\\n\\n\r\nI will definitely be watching the second season, just waiting for the 12th episode to come out first so I don't have to wait in suspense if I catch up on it before it's released. ^-^\\n",

            "content": "Now, let me tell you why Akagami no Shirayuki-hime stole my heart:\r\nStory-8: Now, I may be biased because I love this anime, but the story really isn't bad. The female lead isn't useless and the male lead isn't perfect, and their romance is something else. I must applaud the script writer. This anime is the definition of my perfect romance. Shirayuki flees to another kingdom to escape marriage to a selfish prince. And on her way she meets Zen, second prince of Clarines. But the thing is, Zen doesn't try to swoon in and steal Shirayuki, and Shirayuki isn't crazy in love with Zen. Theirromance is something I've never seen. It's so realistic, yet such a child's fantasy. It's perfect.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8: The art is beautiful. It's not stunning, but beautiful. The town is so whimsical, but still practical. The characters and their attire are proportionate and not too revealing or impractical (you know what I'm talking about). It's great.\\n\\n\r\nSound-6: The only thing that wasn't phenomenal was the sound. The voices of the characters were practical, nothing super annoying, and the nature sounds (tree rustling, birds, etc.) were accurate. But the music in general wasn't anything too great. I enjoyed the soundtrack in the intro and outdo, but otherwise it could have been better. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-9: I am very emotionally attached to the characters. As the story progresses you learn to love every single character, even if they're the bad guys. Not to mention the main characters are super 'human.' Meaning, they portray their emotions just like us. There isn't any crazy super powers or drama queens. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9: I would say it's pretty obvious that I really enjoyed this anime. I am definitely planning to re-watch this anime and read the manga. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-10: Outstanding by all means. This anime is my ideal romance with everything a anime should have.",

            "content": "This Review Applies to Both Seasons of Akagami no Shirayuki-hime\r\nIt is rare that I stumble upon a genuinely light hearted but also entertaining romance story. Especially when the Romance story is set in medieval times, and it found itself to be one of the more enjoyable and interesting show even though, not much happened. (The video review is up on my channel, here is the written)\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nOnce upon a time, there was girl with beautiful Red Hair, which is considered to be very rare and very special in this world. The girl, Shirayuki gets asked to become the prince\u2019s concubine. Shirayuki of course uncomfortablewith the idea and knowing will pursue her, she runs off looking for a new life. Along the way she meets Prince Zen from the Kingdom of Clarines. After a shaky a start with the Zen, the two hit off off and begin to respect each other. But neither one of them wants to feel like a burden or give off the wrong impression to each other. Shirayuki begins to live in Clarines and she becomes a Herbal Medicine Doctor in the Kingdom in order for her to stand on equal footing as Zen. While Zen on the other hand, makes sure he does his job responsibly, to make sure Shirayuki doesn\u2019t get the wrong impression of him. And you can probably tell where the Romance in this story is already.\\n\\n\r\nI really like the stories of Shirayuki and Zen and their friends, most are really entertaining and interesting to watch. I kind of wish I knew where the story was going at the start and was hoping for a little more focus on the actual relationship between Shirayuki and Zen, because at times you wouldn\u2019t really know where they are in their relationship. This show is basically broken into a lot of arcs that is all about the characters building chemistry with each other. But with a lack of overall plot goal and ending, you really don\u2019t get into the story that much. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the setting of the show and the whole world building and the general story isn\u2019t interesting, because it is. Even though it has little focus, it is still interesting, and that is because of the character dynamics. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, Shirayuki is the main protagonist and just some fun trivia, \u2018Shira\u2019 means \u2018white\u2019 and \u2018yuki\u2019 means \u2018snow\u2019 so you get the idea where the name Snow White comes from in this show. Shirayuki gets quite the development considering the show is involved around her. She learns about her new life and realises she needs to earn the respect in order to stand on equal footing with the prince. She doesn\u2019t want be portrayed as a typical damsel spoilt princess, that doesn\u2019t suit her. So she works hard to gain respect from everyone. Of course along the way she changes those around her especially when it came to Obi, her bodyguard and surprisingly Prince Raj, from Tabarun the country she ran away from. As the show progresses she starts developing feelings of Zen, and I would\u2019ve love to see more in their lovers relationship.\\n\\n\r\nZen is other character in this relationship. Zen is a the Prince of Clarines. Zen on the other hand is considered to be a well-respected Prince, although he doesn\u2019t show that much enthusiasm to his role, that doesn\u2019t stop him from doing his job when needed. Due to him giving off the wrong impression on Shirayuki when they first met, he actually starts trying harder to gaining Shirayuki\u2019s respect, so she doesn\u2019t get the wrong impression on him, because he knew how she saw how up themselves royalty can be. Zen, like Shirayuki develops with others around him and starts learning more how he can become a good respected Prince, of course as well he himself starts developing feelings for Shirayuki. \\n\\n\r\nObi, is Shirayuki\u2019s bodyguard and Zen\u2019s messenger. Although Obi starts off completely on wrong foot trying with both them, with him being ordered to threaten Shirayuki and losing Zen\u2019s trust at first, he probably gets the most development in the series. He starts learn about his friends and grows as a person who is trying to fix his old habits and genuinely shows concern to all the other characters. This while being the best third wheel, anyone can ask for. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I think is the best aspect of the show is the characters in general, and even the supporting cast get enough time and development, so we genuinely show much more interest in them as well. Mitsuhide and Kiki, Zen\u2019s bodyguards actually get backstories of how they all came to be, which is a really nice added to touch to make us care about these characters. And I wasn\u2019t even expecting this, even, Prince Raj, who Shirayuki ran away from initially, gets amazing development during the second cour. All the supporting characters are interesting and get enough growth for you to genuinely take interest in them and they all play with each other so well. Their interactions are really well done.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 8/10 6/10\\n\\n\r\nBeing made by studio Bones, I usually would expect quite top notch animation. And it definitely shines in this anime. The scenery in this medieval fantasy world looks gorgeous and the colours are amazing to look at.  Each character has unique designs, so it\u2019s easy to tell each of them apart. What I love about the animation, is that even though its mostly light hearted, so you don\u2019t see too much action, but when they do, it\u2019s generally pretty subtle and good, which fits with the show. Except for one noticeable scene where Obi was fighting. If there is one thing they done perfectly is, get Shirayuki\u2019s hair done right, because if having Red hair is special in their world, you better bet that the red hair is beautiful, which it is. It\u2019s really refreshing to look at.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack you get a pretty standard tracklist of classical music. Really mellow most of the time with nothing really standing out too much. It does feel like classical orchestra, but in honesty it kind of sounds all very similar. Even for the more intense scenes, it just feels like they\u2019re playing it faster. The Opening songs are really nice to listen to. I like the light hearted upbeat vibe or the first opening, whereas the second opening really sounds like something for an adventure anime. Oh yeah and the voice actress of Shirayuki sing the opening. The ending songs, aren\u2019t really that special, it\u2019s ok, but rather forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor me this was one of the surprising shows I\u2019ve watched. I genuinely wasn\u2019t very interested in watching something like this, but as it went on, it caught my attention and I started loving it. Because the characters are all amazing and their interactions with each other a really well written. Add that with the fact every character is trying to achieve something of their own, makes it worth watching, because it\u2019s interesting to see where they go from where they started. The show is a bit slow to start off with, as you don\u2019t really see much focus during the first cour, however during the second cour, there is a lot more happening to leading to more exciting storylines to follow.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs near towards the end of the review, I give the story a 7. Even though the overall story seems a bit lacking with not much focus, the individual arcs are interesting enough to watch, while the world building is done very well, to keep us engaged.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound, I give it a 8 and 6. The art style looks wonderful, it\u2019s beautiful to look at. It really showcases the fantasy world the characters are in. Some of the animation is inconsistent, and the action scenes aren\u2019t really exciting. But they completely nailed Shirayuki\u2019s hair colour. The soundtrack uses good classical music, although it can get repetitive. The openings are great though, they really bring out a nice adventure and light hearted vibe.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters I give it a 10. I loved how every character was fleshed out and not many characters were left behind. Each character got surprisingly good development. And the chemistry among the characters are a joy to watch. Shirayuki and Zen\u2019s relationship was done very well, and I loved how they played on each other perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nAs for my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 8. There wasn\u2019t really too much exciting things happening in the anime, it was more of an interesting watch, due to seeing how the relationships grew among the characters. However the world building and character interactions are what made this anime very enjoyable to watch. It has a cute romance plot I can get behind as well.\\n\\n\r\nSo for the overall score after rounding it all up, I give Akagami no Shirayukihime a 8/10. It\u2019s a really character focused anime, they really bring out the potential in all their characters. I recommend this anime to Shoujo fans, especially if you love Romance anime and maybe those who would love to watch medieval slice of life.",

            "content": "A simple story with somewhat compelling characters. It's definitely a shoujo anime/manga with many sweet and innocent scenes. Some may be cheesy, some may be cliches, and some may contain both. But otherwise, what romantic film isn't these days. The drama is very light, and I feel like I was watching an Atelier series, a JRPG game with usually, it is the female as heroine. Overall, it is a must for people who are into romance, fantasy, and somewhat unrealistic characters. If you want to read more of my review, look no more, because I'll explain more in depth on the bottom. For those whojust want to know right away, simply don't watch it if you aren't into romantic cheesy and cliches moments. But otherwise, it wouldn't hurt to watch one or two episode for people who aren't into romance.\\n\\n\r\nStory: It rather plain and simple, which isn't a bad thing. Sometimes making a story-line that is too complex and confusing can simply ruin the whole show. For a romantic show, a simple story-line is the way to go. Without spoiling anything much, it simply about a girl who wants to choose her own path rather than being forced by another. Upon meeting a person, she became interest in this person and wish to know more as she pursue her answer. Eventually, she does find her answer early on, the person she met also start having feelings for her. And as each episode goes, the story also develops. The bad part is there is no absolute twist. Not much of a plot and not much of a story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm not much of an art person so I don't have much to say other than it is a delight to look at. I don't feel impulse even with characters who \"bad\" people or \"antagonist\" themselves. This can be a good thing and a bad thing. Since I don't feel anything much from a bad person, it also say that they're not really unique and memorable like how I see Griffith in Berserk as a cool, yet horrifying character. But the art does stand out in its' own merit and that is the fantasy setting. Because of that, everything and everywhere I look feels a lot more like the Atelier series, in which I very much like playing. It feel calming, spiritually, and just want you to smile awkwardly. But otherwise, if there is a bad, it would be that it can be bland at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Perhaps I may be bias in this one because I love violin sounds. Pretty much any classical playing is my favorite sounds. I would give this a 10/10, but I felt most of the music was, more or less, the same thing. However, that's the only the only down part. Everything else is really nice to listen to. It felt really appropriate to the setting of Fantasy and Romance genre. Opening and ending are great as it is, but probably could be better. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: As well as the story was simplistic, characters felt a little too simple and unrealistic as well. I like that the main characters are nice and sweet, but it feel like one-dimensional. I understand, there is still the 2nd season, in which, I haven't watch, but I felt the character development is fine, but should have more personality to them. I feel like the characters are \"too good to be true.\" Yes, it is a fantasy-romantic genre, and yes, it is an anime. But even anime can try to be realistic in someway. And by realistic, I mean believable. When watching the complete first season, Shirayuki feels a like a passionate (mentally) strong woman, but also with kindness and her concern for other over herself. This wouldn't be a bad thing if there wasn't so many anime character like her already. I would like to see her angry side. Same goes to Prince Zen. but at least, on Zen's side, there a little more to it because he has more background story so far. Obi as far as it goes, a mysterious character. Hopefully we learn more about him. Mitsuhide can be a interesting character, but for now, I feel like he is just there for convenient moments. For Kiki, I don't know what to say, is she just a simple caretaker for Prince Zen, or what, I don't know what other role she play, but she is even more mysterious than Obi. As far as it goes, there should never be two people with mysterious background because it lacks depth for each characters. I hope it does goes more into it for Second season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Like I have said, it was very much like watching an Atelier series, but instead of playing the game, I am watching it. It definitely  a good watch in my book, but I can see why some people may get bored with it at some point as it doesn't really add anything much to the story other than watching characters develop and making the story themselves.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's a good show to watch. There are obvious flaws, but not enough to say that it is a terrible anime. But I highly recommend that you only watch it if you into light-humor with nice Fantasy setting and strongly into romance. Of course, it's also a good show to relax from all seriousness. If none of this speak to you, look somewhere else.",

It's like the author thought, hey she is strong, this is not a cliche, and then puts her in all the cliche situations possible.\r\nZen is the gallant prince, brave, just and handsome, textbook cliche.\r\nThe story is brain dead, just from seeing the first episodes. She has red hair and so everyone seems to want to rape, sell or hurt her for some reason, unless they are not which means they absolutely loveher. They don't even explain what is wrong with her having red hair, people just say it is rare. That is all nice, hey, red hair is not that common anyway, but just as this is said a character who is a friend of the prince walks in with green hair and no one bats an eye.  In one part she is in distress and almost gets out unaided and I was like, hey maybe I misjudged... nope. The bad guy tells her that even if she escapes they are in a mountain only he knows well. Surprise, just as he is about to hit her the prince appears. Check this, it has been a whole day of her kidnapping, he takes a ship to get where she was exploring, for some reason climbs the exact mountain only the bad guy knew, like he had a GPS tracker on her and saves her just in the nick of time, and this is never explained (which is obvious, after all there is basically no way to justify this scene) Hey, I love a good romance story, but this one is not even trying, so I am not gonna try either.\\n",

            "content": "Snow White is the oldest Disney\u2019s princess fairy tale, it portrays a woman characteristics that is weak, good-for-nothing-except-house-chores. It is indeed a fairy tale, where you were saved by your stranger prince from your evil step-mother, but it does not tackle woman\u2019s ability of self-independence. Here in Akagami no Shirayuki-hime, Shirayuki is an herbalist, an independent, intelligent and skilled woman. She is wise, dependable and mature way beyond her age, as she supports her living by herself. The story would be fantastic if only it was been discussed properly. It is absurd thatpeople will go crazy too much just because one person was born with such rarity. It\u2019s okay that people will go on talk about it everywhere; I understand that, but to kidnap one? To offer such social status just for that is a complete nonsense. The story itself is too fast-paced, wherein too much events are occurring at the same time, which results in poor deliberation of proper storyline from the beginning to the end. Most of anime only have 12 episodes, which most anime released nowadays are poor with the development no matter how much the idea; the structure of the story is magnificent as our favorite fairy tale unicorn. Akagami no Shirayuki-hime has joined the bandwagon of poor anime; no matter how much potential I can see if only it was portrayed professionally. The relationship and self-development is the main reason for its destruction, it was too sudden, and then it was not. The character\u2019s development is deadly confusing; it has no path where it\u2019s headed to. Akagami no Shirayuki-hime can have both turn of events: with or without having climax. Climax is very important in every art because it brings heaviness- more depth to the portrait it wants to deliver. Which more reason why Akagami no Shirayuki-hime is such a \u201cbummer\u201d for being wasted when it has such a lot of potential, there\u2019s no many anime that can give out both options of with or without climax. If there are in these 12 episodes, you can certainly not see it, as if it was being transparent to half percent which is not good, because an excellent story should be absolute. This anime was not executed as it meant to.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m sure of this anime is that Shirayuki is so loved by everyone. People love and go for her is because of her unusual hair color, which all the reason why she ran from Tanbarun, her specialness from her red hair is what prince Raj of her country wants her to be his concubine, which is why she cut her hair and flee away from home, only to run to the second prince of her country\u2019s neighboring kingdom. What a coincidence! She threw her life in Tanbarun, her beloved home, where all people adore her, just because prince Raj wants to pamper her like a wife without actually marrying her. She could have a talk to the prince or when the tables have been turned, she could have escape from prison and be her own superhero. Zen saved her, which has been instantly become her \u2018special friend\u2019. What mostly annoys me is that feelings between Zen and Shirayuki developed too suddenly, too fast, too rushed. I could already feel from the second episode that Zen and Shirayuk have feelings for each other, too obvious. They should have self-development first, building relationships with each other, to bring a castle of proper shoujo romance. Instead of watching a dove wrapped themselves like a heart-shaped in the pond, I\u2019m watching instead a 3-year old boy and girl telling themselves they are in love. I can find the proper development to Obi when it comes to love, slowly but absolute. Curious to wondering, Obi is slowly approaching to find what affection is, carefully but surely, Obi has captured me to raise my hand in volunteer to be his \u201cshoujo\u201d instead.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not a picky eater, and that goes same to graphics and sounds. I actually don\u2019t care if the transition of the graphics is too much or too little because I believe that animation is not important, the story, the character development and the enjoyment should be the standard of judging whether or not the anime is worth the hype. Although there are few things to comment, like the at the first episode when prince Raj is panicking when Zen revealed himself as the second prince of Clarines, instead of watching a defeat, I\u2019m watching instead a gag because of prince Raj\u2019s face. It would be also great if they would add more music, give more intensity while events are happening.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of this anime is\u2026 meh. Not boring but not exciting. I did quite enjoy this anime because for the reason I keep on wondering and searching when this anime will have a character development, which later revealed that there\u2019s no such thing. Turns out my hype over it was good for nothing. I honestly enjoyed the hug and kissing scene other than that, no more else. Glad those scenes are unexpected and surprising.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s nothing about Shirayuki\u2019s life that is a problem. She was happy before and she is happy now. She passed easily the test for Clarines\u2019 court apprentice herbalist, there\u2019s nothing hard for Shirayuki\u2019s life, she stood up for herself before, and same goes for the present time too. This is just a story of protagonist\u2019s life being simply perfect at every corner, which there\u2019s no reason why you don\u2019t need to tell it anymore to anybody. There\u2019s no meaning if there is nothing to stake, like I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, this would be a potential anime if there is really a struggle and growth of characters, but it doesn\u2019t exist here. There\u2019s so much story to tell about Shirayuki and the people around her like Zen, Raj, Kiki, Mitsuhide and Obi, but it didn\u2019t happen. Thus, this anime became a supposed-to-be-a-great-potential to a shame.",

            "content": "So because I just finished this anime and everything is still fresh on my mind I thought I'd write a review for it since it's been a pretty popular this year for romance anime. \r\nStarting off I just want to put out there that while the title is Snow White with the Red Hair the story has very little relation to the original tale of Disney's Snow White. Like maybe the first 2 episodes and a little later in the series play to similar story aspects. So don't expect 7 little men and a beautiful heroine being poisoned by a witch only to be broughtback with a kiss.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime pretty much is a story of it's own and it's like they just threw references to the original in across the series and went with it. Frankly, I think I'd think this would have been more creative if the name of the series was different and it had the references of snow white kept in it. It would have gotten a few more points from me if that was the case.  \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, with that aside this series is very popular for a fairy tale story concepts of princes and princesses falling in love, and with having that sort of concept I must say it's not that bad of a story. I don't think some people reviewing or talking about this anime are really considering that this is mainly targeted and popular amongst adolescent girls. I mean it's somewhat based on the original snow white so by default it's going to be very cheesy and clich\u00e9. \\n\\n\r\nSome flaws I did find aside from the cheesy and clich\u00e9 concepts were the triangles of love and this odd heroine appeal that continue up into season 2. This girl is a red haired beauty and I guess it is weird to have apple red hair but if she's going to have that sort of hair and it be centered around why she's so unique then why doesn't everyone have normal hair color where it stands out even more? Most of the characters do have pretty normal hair colors, but one of the guards literally has greenish blue hair. Like why is she special and not him? \\n\\n\r\nAside from that the love triangles, for which I'm holding back details to prevent spoilers, are sort of nonsense. Like it's okay if it's between two princes or something but most every man she knows sort of likes her on the side. It's to the point of reverse harem even though it's obvious she only has feelings for one guy. Which even if you like that sort of thing it's sort of like they cut the romance down a lot. \\n\\n\r\nThere is 2 seasons of this anime and there really isn't a ton of development between the romance between Snow White and Zen, who from the first episodes is obviously the main love interest. It's kind of consistent on they like each other but sort of just like best friends who occasionally kiss, but if you like that gentle sort of slow progressing romance then that probably won't bother you as much. I just expected more I guess especially since from reading up there won't be another season. \\n\\n\r\nOn some things I liked, I enjoyed the humor in this series for it keeps things more light and not so dry. Also most of the characters I really enkoyed their independent personalities and the sort of direction they give to advancing the story. You can really see the connections to the characters and how they grow in response to others. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character, while the epitome of someone with first world problems, is also not that dull and boring because she's very determined and strong. She's not a typical ditz and she doesn't let a relationship with royalty affect determination she has. I find it interesting she's a healer in this story too because I think it shows she's very intelligent and all though this sort of perfection and courage might not be appealing I actually enjoyed it. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was okay I think personally this first season was a little bit better in my taste, but that's a preference thing on what kind of story elements you enjoy. As far as the second season I think more could have been explained or progressed but still that's my opinion. The art was very beautiful and the color of the imagery really stood out because the scenery is so bright and detailed. As well as the music which stayed true the type of time period elements as well as being very graceful and pretty. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I thought this was a good anime, thought a lot of things could have been better executed, but for the most part it wasn't bad. This is something I'd probably more enjoy like 3 years ago or maybe someone younger who likes fairy tale romance might like. If you're older this is obviously probably going to bore you or you might think this anime is lacking so I'd say if you want to pass it off go for it but be aware of target audience. It's not my favorite of the year but I think it holds it's own.",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite mangas and the anime adaptation has done a wonderful job with it. It's hard to know if my rating or review is overly biased but, if it is, that's only because I've been won over by these characters from quite a long while ago.\r\nI appreciate the fact that the story is willing to take older, tried and true elements and work with them in a way that shows a uniqueness and creativity. I think people sometimes miss the actual tie-ins with the old fairy tale Snow White but I feel like recognizing that helps to appreciate the meld ofEastern and Western sensibilities. We see the fairy tale elements of a young girl facing powerful nobility and having to take refuge in the woods. We have the prince charming. We even have the poisoned apples. Some of the common shoujo tropes make appearances throughout and anyone with familiarity will spot them weaving through. Not making any changes would have resulted in something predictable and uninteresting and over-compensating and just fully reinventing the wheel here would have been too much. This anime addresses these plot points and story arcs with grace and a clear direction. The one fault that could possibly hold water is how long it really takes to really get to something meaty. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was done incredibly well. Attention to detail was spot-on, beautiful backgrounds with intricate work colored every scene, animations were smooth and the lighting was just absolutely stunning. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are almost too good. I do actually mean that as a slight criticism. A little too perfect, even in their shortcomings, and a little too unrealistic. But, despite that, they're easy to fall in love with. Our main character takes a while to flesh out as she comes across a little too two dimensional in the beginning and it's not until we see her face difficulties within herself that she really begins to feel real. The male lead and side characters are easy to love almost from the get-go and the interactions between the group show a very healthy and wonderful dynamic that helps to keep the story propped up well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime may not be for everyone. If you want a lot of action or high levels of drama you won't find it here. This isn't an anime to get your adrenaline pumping or keep you in suspense. This is, however, a very sweet story with solid characters. It's good for a bolstering of the heart.",

However, when I checked it out, the first episode didn't really have a hook or anything special to it. The rest of the episodes were decent but not very enjoyable. I think this anime could've had a ton of potential, but the story was just way too unstable.

However, I do think that the characters were constructed beautifully, andwere pleasing to watch interact.

            "content": "Alright, so, I put my rating as a 5 and I'll tell you why:\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe story/plot is going absolutely no where in this anime. So first red hair (I forgot her name,so I'll just call her red hair) was in a village with a happy life. Then, the horny-ass prince suddenly liked her because of her hair color. Like WTF?! Who the hell would like someone just because of a hair color? Red hair's hair has NO relation to the story whatsoever. The only reason they put her with red hair is because they needed an excuse for red hair to run away and tofind her \"prince\" in the forest. Also, when red hair meets Prince Zen and becomes the castle's herbalist, she just went back to what her old-self was back in the village, but only in a castle and with shorter hair. The romance wasn't that good either. Actually, the only romance I saw was only in ONE episode in the whole series. At the start I was hooked in, but after the I don't know 6th, 7th, or 8th episode it was just getting plain boring.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I think the only decent thing about this anime is the art. The art was okay, not so wowing or anything. Sometimes, the background was dull or boring.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSo, I really don't judge an anime based on the intro or outro, mostly because I skip them. But I do judge based on voice overs. The voice over was decent nothing that special. I've heard better though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters... where to start. Oh yeah, the characters don't get developed whatsoever. Period. End of story. Actually, let me add on something... perfect lives. Red hair's life is so perfect that it's boring as hell.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you want an anime where characters get developed, has a good romance, and has a plot twist, or actually a GOOD plot, then I wouldn't recommend this to you.",

Zen the main male protagonist isn't a cliche either, he doesn't automatically trust Shirayuki, she earns it for herself. They're is a certain respect between the characters that makes it seem real, as they actually go through character development. (plus they are like the cutest relationship ever) the bond they share is so amazing.\r\nThe art is quite well done, thoughthe characters do look quite a bit childish. The story itself moves fast in the first episode, and has similarities to snow white, but after the first episode things move away from that base. The story overall looks enjoyable, and if sticking close to the manga could end up a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Note: This review covers my overall thoughts of both seasons of Snow White with the Red Hair.\r\nAs its title would suggest, Snow White with the Red Hair is a fairy tale romance, with most of the typical trappings of the genre. The plot is simple, straight forward, and heavily focused on the romance, the writing can be very corny and schmultz-y, and the ending is the same as every fairy tale you have heard. However, if you are looking for a romance anime, and don't mind dialogue that can occasionally be too corny for its own good, then Snow White with the Red Hair mightbe the perfect show for you. This show does have a romance that avoids other love story cliches that, like me, you might find annoying. There are no love triangles, pointless drama, or unnecessary drama that is just meant to jerk the audience around. More importantly, our lead characters are not just 2 dimensional, tropes (tsundere, kuudere, dandere, etc.) that are often found in romance anime. The romance in this show is, for the most part, very believable and our two lead characters  are actually 3 dimensional characters that are capable of displaying more than 2 emotions.\\n\r\nPerhaps it is my lack of a lot of experience with romance animes that causes me to rate this series so highly, but I think this show has a great romance. The show avoids a lot of annoying cliches found in romance anime, and love stories in general, the romance is very believable, and our lead characters are 3 dimensional and actually have pretty good chemistry.",

In this anime, protagonists: Shirayuki and Zen just suddenly fall in love with each other for no particular deep reason. Just, for some reason they're attracted to each other and for some reason they're suddenly inseparable and the best of friends. This anime has no particular solid plot whatsoever. I have picked up this anime just because it was recommended as something similar to Akatsuki no Yona. Believe me, it's a real disappointment. True enough, Shirayuki has balls ofsteel, can fend for herself and all that and has red hair just like Yona, but it's just that. No other similarity. Anime has other characters you would barely care about as they don't have any particular back story and would leave you without any attachment to any of them thus wouldn't care about their existence in the first place. I don't get why this anime even got a second season at all.",

            "content": "As someone who has delved into writing romantic stories and relationships, I can say with experience that it is far more difficult than most other forms of stories. Creating a believable, likable, and fun relationship that progresses and evolves both characters is something commendable and very difficult. And that is easily the greatest success of Snow White with the Red Hair.\r\nEven a big fan of the show like me can admit that the story is nothing all that special, it mostly just follows the characters on their endeavors and explores their relationships. But, it does it's job without feeling complicated or holding the show back.\r\nThebest part of the show is the characters. First is Shirayuki, who is a very likable main protagonist. I like how she is mature and mostly independent, feeling the need to solve things without help. She's kind hearted, sweet, and well rounded. Zen is also a great character. He's a very well spoken individual who can be pretty awesome when he wants to be. He is a bit rebellious, but also cares about his people and does his best to be a good prince. His two aides of Kiki and Mitsuhide are also fun characters, who have a fun dynamic with both each other, as well as Zen and Shirayuki. I especially like the dynamic between Mitsuhide and Zen, they feel like genuine friends. The last main character is Obi, who I find hard to explain, but nonetheless, he is a ton of fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and the animation are both quite good, while not exactly being too noteworthy to explain in detail. They do their jobs just fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance between Zen and Shirayuki feels alive and well written, as the two have a lot of great banter and genuinely sweet moments that help build them as characters. They don't just say they're in love and kiss a lot, they actually act like it, by doing whatever they can for the other. They talk about their feelings, their worries, what they like about the other, while making it all still interesting. And this, like I said before, is the strongest element of the anime, and what helps make both of these characters stick out to me.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the anime might not be anything unique, it still shines as a great example of romance and characters done totally right. It brought me a lot of joy and good feelings while still having great substance. It also gave me a lot of Spice and Wolf vibes, which, if you enjoy this anime, you should see that one, and vice versa. It has risen to be one of my top 5 favorites for good reasons.",

There's not so many twisty turns and plots, but the characters drive the story forward in such a way that elaborate plots aren't necessary. The main female protagonist, Shirayuki, is a confident, wholesome, intelligent woman. I love that she's an herbalist. The way she uses her herbal skills to handle situations was clever; She proves you don't always need fancy martial arts skills to get out of trouble. Another thing: In some stories you will get interactions that seem unrealistic, exaggerated even. Not so much inAkagami no Shirayuki hime. Characters on the show don't always explicitly say how they feel, but show us in subtle ways. To me that's how it is in real life. Of course I appreciated the romantic aspects of this show, this was easily one of the best romance anime I've watched ;) But actually, Akagami no Shirayuki hime showed the camaraderie in platonic relationships as well, in a way which I appreciated. Man I wish there was a 3rd season.",

I'll give you some examples. They looked so completely unique and gorgeous. I wish I had those costumes. FIND EXAMPLES OF COSTUMES\r\nAnd in a turn of events that is completely unlike me...I'll admit that I sorta-kinda liked the romance. The lovers were sweet on each other. I really liked allthose epic hug scenes. (Which basically were fake outs on Zen's part.) And the promise they made? Pretty cute. But I'm not entirely won over. Not yet. Prove that you deserve each other\\n\r\nDislikes:\\n\\n\r\nShirayuki is a boring girl...but a smart one. I didn't particularly care for her Disney princess personality. She was too kind. It annoyed me. She had no depth. But she, admittedly, quite smart. She figures out the answers to problems quite quickly. (But I figured some of it out before she did. So HA! I'm kidding.) For example, the mysterious illness in Ladox was something she figured out quickly. I figured it out too, but I think everyone did. (It was pretty obvious.) But she was quite smart. Not very...perceptive, though.\\n\r\nIn the beginning and end of almost every episode, one of the two main characters (Zen or Shirayuki) would talk about paths and fate. And it made me annoyed. Why in the world would they keep mentioning it? One time is fine. More than one is just...tiresome. I kept skipping those parts. It was a serious waste of time.",

I try to explain it in the categories, because everything felt special. \r\nStory: As a story, you have many of the same tropes that you have, but it surrounds what I would call  the relationships, that Shirayuki experiences during her time in the castle (not really trying to go into detail because i'm avoiding spoilers).  The story I'll give an 8. \r\nArt: As art I can describe it in one word beautiful.  It really does suckyou in, due to the fact that the show takes it time to make you love the setting around you. Even from the opening alone it shows how well the art is done. The art I give a 9. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Now im going to start this off with the intro, and ending stuff. Honesty I did not care for the opening, or the ending. Both of them are great do not get me wrong, but it really takes a lot to get me into an opening.  As for watching it Sub, or Dub I did watched the dub.  The dub, is worth watching (and I know a lot of people will say that they don't watch dubs but this one worth it). The dub has Austin Tinstale which he has become a if he in it I watch it (because I liked him in 91 Days). The sound I give a 7. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Something interested  in me in the characters in this show. Shirayuki is not a dansal in distress which I loved,  It great and refreshing to see a girl who does not depend on anyone else. Even though Zen (the main male) is protective of her, she is still independent for herself. The side characters can b the comic relif at times, but they are important too. Characters are a solid 10 for me \\n\\n\r\n'Enjoyment, and Overall: As an enjoyment value I give it a 9, I got what I needed to enjoy it. Overall value is an 8, I will be giving the second season a watch definitely  recommend this, for people who want a strong female character, and for something a little light on the fantasy side.",

            "content": "TL;DR Above Average anime with good visuals and characters. It does feel a bit cliche at many points, and does not know whether it wants to be a romantic-comedy with dramatic elements or a pure 50/50 between romcom and drama. This confusion lead to me feeling it had a long run time, despite only being 12 episodes long.\r\nI really like romance anime, and I like the idea of re-imagining Snow White as a story line. When I heard this anime came out with fairly good reviews, I put most of the other anime I had been watching to allow myself some time to watch this.I did not expect to find the next golden standard of anime with this one, but an enjoyable experience. For the most part, I was satisfied when I finished this season of Snow White with Red Hair.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Snow White with Red Hair is a pretty standard fantasy, romantic-comedy where a common girl who is unusually beautiful compared to the rest of the commoners finds a prince of another land who falls in love with her. After this realization, the anime turns into a slowly growing tale of affection between its two main characters Shirayuki and Zen. It is also a tale that emphasizes how the importance of hard work and contacts can lead you to hopefully to that \"happily ever after\" ending that many of us have been instilled from many forms of entertainment. While all of those ideas and morals are great to try to have within an anime, which isn't a totally unique message to send, this anime does lag down quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I think it lags is because the story does not know what it wants to become. There is plenty of instances where viewers learn about herbology and alchemy through Shirayuki's lens, and political acumen through Zen's life. However, it clashes with itself due to the show's sense of comedy, which is very innocent in its nature. The show doesn't know if it wants to be a romcom with serious elements like Oregairu or anime that is 50/50 romance to serious tensions like Spice and Wolf.\\n\\n\r\nThis confusion only grows stronger when I look at its list of characters: Obi, Zen, Shirayuki, Kiki, Mitsuhide, and Izana. All of them seem to have the same level of ditziness, but extreme seriousness. While I would say that works in a lot of anime, it only added to the confusion due to the lack of focus of the storyline in this anime. All the characters felt like added timelines to what should be a good, disposable anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I say it's ok to have a disposable anime is due to the fact that, this show's whole premise feels overused already. I feel like there is not a need for a show like this unless it's willing to push the note to extremely places. And, it definitely does not.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I conclude, I will say that this anime does look very nice. The world is beautifully animated with bright colors and shadowing that gives a nice finish to the overall series. The way that this series does wind is quiet calming to me as well. The animation can get choppy at points, especially during the middle parts of the series when characters are doing fine motor actions like grinding up stuff or getting off horses. Additionally, the sound in this show is nothing to write home about. The opening and ending were ok at best, and I cannot seem to remember any of the background tracks during the show. I wouldn't say it has a bad soundtrack because nothing sounded off-kilter to me. It definitely does not stand out though.\\n\\n\r\nSnow White with Red Hair is a romantic-comedy, despite all of my bagging on it, is an above average anime. It has great looking visuals and likable characters. The biggest problems that I have with this show is that its story doesn't know, if it wants to be serious or light-hearted. I am fine with either option, but this constant switching back and forth slowed down the pacing of this anime to where it felt like a slog to finish the last few episodes. If you are looking for a solid romantic-comedy anime to spend a few hours with, I would say this might be worth a look. (6.6/10)",

            "content": "-Plot and Story Line-\r\nFor a twelve episode long anime, the story line is pretty solid and even tough you get the feeling that the plot is a little bit forced and rushed it actually fits pretty good. I loved the fact that they did not only concentrate on the relationship between Zen and Shirayuki although it is the main story line. There were a couple of side stories, a couple of background stories and some little extra story lines that supported the main one.\r\nMost important thing for me, there were no plot holes and the story is pretty interesting too. I also had to laughhard a couple of times. This anime is awesome if you just want to relax and forget your problems for a couple of hours. It makes your heart melt a couple of times but it doesn't cause any stress and that kind of stuff. My recommendation, watch it over the weekend after a hard week and you'll feel much better right after. \\n\r\nOne thing that'll made me remember this anime is definitely the, let's say, character trend in anime. The thing that Sakura did in Naruto or Yona in Yona of the Dawn is actually better known in some cartoons as Mulan and The legend of Korra. The main character cuts her long hair to show that she is a new person now and that she is taking another, stronger and more independent path than before. I personally loved that move, because I love independent and strong female characters, but seeing it a couple of times now, it got a bit boring. I don't thing it will fascinate me in another anime again,  but we shall see. \\n\r\nTrue the anime is cute but I don't think I could watch the second season. At least not now. There is too much cliche romance in it and I found that a bit annoying. But, I am not a great romance fan, meaning it is actually my subjective way of thinking. If you like romance, you'll love Akagami no Shirayuki-hime. \\n\r\nStill, the anime is not perfect which is why I rated it as a 8 on MAl. One reason is the lack in background information about Shirayuki's life. Where are her parents? What did she do all her life? Where does she come from if her hair was so unusual? Not sure if the second season tells us more, but the first one left a huge question mark in my head. \\n\r\nIn the end I gotta say, I wouldn't have mind if there were a couple of episodes more between the beginning and the highlight of the first season. The show was cute, nice to watch and interesting. Thumbs up!\\n\\n\r\n-Characters- \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the second reason I rated this anime with an 8. They are too perfect to be good cahracters. I always say, characters with flaws are better because they have sth to work on when it comes to their personality. That's what makes them interesting.\\n\\n\r\n-Animation and Style-\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one segment of this anime that deserves a higher note than 10/10 then it is the animation. It is really awesome and beautiful. I can't remember any anime that had such a good animation. Truly amazing. Bright and colorful settings, detailed characters and backgrounds and amazing details.  When it comes to the style of Akagami no Shirayuki-hime, there is nothing much to say. Just like the animation, it is flawless. I loved it and will definitely from now on use this anime as an example of amazing animation. One more thing. While watching the first episode I actually thought of quitting because I found it a little bit stupid in the beginning, but I continued because of the animation. I couldn't miss such a great animation work being someone that hates and usually skips anime with bad animation.  \\n\\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion-\\n\r\nIf you had a really thug week and you need an anime just to relax and forget about the world for a day, watch Akagami no Shirayuki-hime. It will take you on a little journey, to a different universe where everything is nice, cute and perfect. It will melt your heart in a couple of scenes but you will survive it. I liked the anime even though it was annoying in some moments but you can get over it. The animation and the character and background looks will please your eyes like no anime before. Give it a try and if you decide to watch the second season too, tell me how it was. \\n\\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl <3",

            "content": "The concept for the anime is refreshing and the story is very wall written, both as an overarching plot and as individual episodes. I was especially thankful that episodes were very well self contained, with no unnecessary cliffhangers bogging down the story. It made them flow very naturally into each other and hadn't even noticed I'd watched all twelve episodes. \r\nThere was noting to complain about with the art, but neither were there enough om-gawd moments to warrant it a perfect score. The same is true for the sound.\r\nI enjoyed watching the characters unfold and develop, but some of the minor characters and episodic villainswere slightly cliched. Additionally I wanted the former noble from early in the series to be a recurring character.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, I didn't even notice that as the anime went and finished. That was because I was having such a good time watching I forgot how long I'd been watching. A very enjoyable anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it did nothing wrong and did a lot right, but it didn't go above and beyond my expectations of it. It was a fabulous anime and I am looking forward to watching the second season; but I worry that season two will make the same mistake several anime do, and will take the beautiful ending from season one, open it back up and then not end it properly come season's end.",

            "content": "Mirror, mirror, on the wall, what anime is among the most romantic of them all? Could it be one where the protagonist is a girl with hair the color of apples, and she falls in love with the second prince of a country that is not her own? Oh my, I'd say that's very romantic! How could I have encountered it other than it being among the July 2015 anime I missed out on and deeply regret doing so? More importantly, now that I've watched it, what do I think of it?\r\nWell, you shall find out by reading my review of season one of SnowWhite with the Red Hair, known in Japanese as Akagami no Shirayuki-hime.\\n\\n\r\nSnow White with the Red Hair follows a girl named Shirayuki (meaning snow white), who is an herbalist with bright red hair. She ends up catching the attention of Prince Raji, the prince of her country of Tanbarun, and he tries to make her his concubine. Shirayuki responds by cutting her hair and escapes to the neighboring country of Clarines. She ends up meeting the second prince of Clarines, Zen, and his two aides, Mitsuhide and Kiki, and she ends up being saved from Prince Raji by them. It is then that Shirayuki decides to become a court herbalist for Clarines. As Shirayuki aims for a new life in Clarines and Zen tries to become a worthy prince, they support each other, and a romance blossoms between the two.\\n\\n\r\nI should start by saying the animation is among the most beautiful I've ever seen. Bones has done great animation before, like in Space Dandy, Noragami, Ouran High School Host Club, and more, but the animation in Snow White with the Red Hair is definitely up there with the best. I've fallen completely in love with the opening theme, \"Yasashii Kibou\" by Saori Hayami, and the ending theme, \"Kizuna ni Nosete\" by eyelis, is a very good song, too. I watched this anime's English dub, and I'd say that Funimation has nailed yet another dub. The voice actors had performed very well, especially Brina Palencia as Shirayuki and Josh Grelle as Prince Zen.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was quite an easygoing one, but it definitely provided a lot of character development. Speaking of characters, this anime had a lot of great characters. Shirayuki is a strong protagonist, and it's admirable how she always works hard. Zen is equally as likable, if not more; it's clear that he really cares about Clarines and its people. I honestly didn't know how to think of Obi, who works for Zen, at first, but I eventually grew to like him. There are also a lot of interesting side characters, but I think the side character that stood out to me the most was Mitsuhide; I really liked his friendship with Zen.\\n\\n\r\nWhat could be the best part about this anime, though? Well, it doesn't take a detective to figure out that I'm talking about the romance between Shirayuki and Zen! They had a very strong bond as friends, but whenever they would have those tender, romantic moments, I just can't help but smile. This is probably going to be a bit of a spoiler, but the best part is that they actually confess their feelings for each other instead of letting it drag on for too long! ....Okay, I lied; it was very late in the season when they confessed. Hey, thank God for the currently-airing-at-the-time-of-this-review season two, right? This means we'll actually get to see them as a couple, albeit in a different season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Snow White with the Red Hair is off to a fantastic start. I'd recommend it to anyone who is in the mood for a great romance anime. Be warned, though, not to bite into the apple that makes you think it's anything like the fairy tale \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", because although there are two references in the first episode, it's poison not to think of it as anything less of its own story.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: If you\u2019re a fanboy or apologist who can\u2019t even critique outside of the box you\u2019ve constructed for yourself, then please fuck off? \r\n\tApparently red hair makes you famous like dank memes - Shirayuki no Akagami review\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki, or Snow White with the Red Hair is about Shirayuki a girl with an apple colored red hair who\u2019s trying to escape from the obsessive and pampered Prince Raj, and is indefinitely saved by the second Prince of Clarines, Zen. There our journey begins. I\u2019d say there isn\u2019t exactly a story, as suppose to it being more of things happening in their everyday life. Correct meif I\u2019m wrong. Still, I found this show an enjoyable watch not just because it\u2019s cute, rather that the characters are well crafted and suited for the entire premise and concept of the setting. Which of course makes it cute? Well sounds a bit redundant there but good characters equate to an overall elation. But more importantly, did it piss me off? No. But it\u2019s not without its criticism. One such I have is where are the king and queen in all of this, did I miss something? I know for sure they\u2019ve never been mentioned.\\n\\n\r\n\tNow let's get art and sound out of the way. Bones the studio behind shows such as Wolf\u2019s Rain and Eureka Seven, they put effort where it was needed, the entirety of Akagami no Shirayuki. Voice acting is subtle and adds onto the emotions of each character, while not exasperatedly intense nor fantastic, it holds up well enough. The soundtrack greatly helps improve your pleasure of watching this show. It gives off the romantic vibe well placed in scenes appropriate to a scene\u2019s tone. The opening and ending are just a good listen and it captures that lovely prince and princess esque feeling, a little bit.\\n\\n\r\n\tAh, characters, probably the most important element of any show, with the story being the latter. I\u2019ll just say I\u2019m not well verse in shoujo, but that doesn\u2019t mean my points are invalid. I watch more than just anime, I am such a screen junkie, I\u2019ve watched tons of movies and T.V. shows that I can tell if something is cliche or just unbelievably stupid. Even if a lot of reviews are saying there are shoujo cliches in Akagami no Shirayuki, then I\u2019d have to disagree and say, it\u2019s a well crafted cliche done well. But that\u2019s the point I want to make. I\u2019ve digressed far enough. Our main heroine, Shirayuki, is somehow a unique person because of her red hair, but I found it odd that there is also people like Zen with white hair and Mitsuhide with green/blue hair? What am I saying? I\u2019m nit picking now. But still it\u2019s odd, wouldn\u2019t you say so as well? Anyhow, Shirayuki proves in the first few episodes that she is a capable main protagonist and heroine by showing and using her knowledge of herbalism, and wits to escape dangers such as the bandit guy who kidnapped her. While I don\u2019t think she could\u2019ve taken the handle of the series on her own, it is because her dynamic as well as Zen rely on each other. The second Prince of Clarines, Zen, for a while is your typical prince who disobeys his work and goes off to play around like the common man. But as progression comes by, we learn just how dark and gritty the series can get, and a reasonably good explanation for why Zen acts the way he does. Both Shirayuki and Zen are of a ying/yang, each with their own character flaws that compensate for one another. Mitsuhide, Kiki, and Obi\u2019s role are to play as the consolation for Zen at moments of his dark past or troubles as the prince, or with Shirayuki. They offer enough to the overall narrative, doing their job as written to help progress the character development of our protagonists. Although I find it weird that Obi is listed as a main character, I can see subtle but very obvious hints to why they may have, and I pretty much guessed it before clicking on his spoiler button. One of the key focuses of the character is the relation of royalty and the common man. It is good to see that Zen is a progressive character, but not without his struggles to push past the dark past that holds him back at times. And then he would eventually do that one \u2018thing\u2019 we all want to see in a romance, much appreciated, earlier than we\u2019d expect. Other characters like the first Prince of Clarines, Izana and the herbalist people, they do their part to help as well to develop our main character\u2019s resolve and teach them along the way. Overall characters, they are crafted exceptionally for what it is.\\n\\n\r\n\tTo end this all, this show earns a 8/10, and misses my badass seal of approval. Akagami no Shirayuki proves to be a good watch and one I can\u2019t necessarily recommend, even though looking at my score it should be, it\u2019s not anything special, just well crafted. However if you\u2019re looking for a \u2018similar\u2019 show I \u2018d say watch Akatsuki no Yona, that show is dank overall, even though the first 3 episodes or may probably turn you off, it almost certainly did for me, but it pays off tremendously. Akagami no Shirayuki did you like it? What did you think of it? Planning on watching it because of this review? Comment on my page to let me know you enjoyed my rational and logical review.",

But quite solid as well. No plot holes, no cringe-y moments in the romantic moments of the show, the romance is actually really cute and well-developed. Same for the comedy. About action, well it's not really there, if you mean by action something intense, somehow lasting and sortof dark. The anime has a strong slice of life feeling IMO and it's a great match with the imaginary medieval scenery of it. Also, the pacing is really good. Everything about the plot creates a warm and relaxing atmosphere for someone who watches Akagami no Shirayuki-hime, an atmoshpere I associate with my feeling of everlasting rest when I am lying on my bed covered with my blanket. During the first 5 episodes you might wonder where does the anime aim at because the main characterization is still not 100% complete, but don't feel like you might end up wasting your time, things become pretty clear afterwards, maybe even predictable for some, but still upcatching and enjoyable. This first season will surely seem to many of you too calm, but that gets balanced by the beggining of the second season, which I am gonna review after finishing this review, so don't feel like there is no evolution in the story, it's just the beggining. \\n\\n\r\nART: 9-9.5/10\\n\r\nBeautiful backgrounds, beautiful character designs, incredibly good colouring. Then why not a 10? Well, because I might have wanted some extra detail in the character's faces, but that's just me extremely nitpicking now, everyone looks so damn attractive.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nI really like the score, very light and discreet, perfect match with the picture.  I love the opening, it's just really beautiful and I also praise the singer, who is also the main protagonist's, Shirayuki's, voice actress.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\r\nGreat character development, perfectly formed to fit the anime's general aura, they are light, some of them cute and funny, straightforward, balanced and not overdramatic at all. Every character, especially the main cast, feels complete and interesting. When it comes to the main heroes and heroines particularly, I think they shine even more when they are all together. You might just miss that extra something that will make you able to *love* them, not just to really really like them because well... everything is done right.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8/10\\n\r\nI had a great time watching it, I enjoyed the characters, their funny, serious and romantic moments, and went immediately to the second season, hoping that some things will be excelled there.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\r\nI think that Akagame no Shirayuki-hime is surely gonna entertain a lot those who are interesting in the anime genres it represents. It was treated very well and it was really well made. I suggest you watch directly the second season because you will get a wider aspect of the show and trully feel the whole experience.",

            "content": "I'm sure Akagami no Shirayukihime would be great to watch as a stand alone, but seeing as how I'm first and foremost a fan of the manga, the anime was disappointing. What disappoints me the most is how the characters in the anime are portrayed differently than in the manga. Characters like Zen and Mitsuhide are passable, but I'm ambivalent about Obi, and even more so about the female characters Shirayuki and Kiki. Starting with Obi, while he is mischievous and playful to a degree in the manga, there are instances where they over-amplify these characteristics in the anime that seem gratuitous. Kiki, who isconstantly solemn faced even when she is teasing others (most notably Mitsuhide), gave me a stupefied double take when she was seen acting AND looking coy with Obi in the show. Shirayuki, though known to show more expressions than Kiki, is also a serious and poised character. While Shirayuki does have her moments of fumbling and gracelessness, those moments in which they appear in the show seem ill-fitting. It also doesn't help that the voice actress makes Shirayuki sound naive and overemotional when I imagined it to be more calm and charismatic.",

            "content": "This is the best Shoujo anime I've ever seen. That's not saying much, because I don't think Shoujo as a genre has much to offer in the first place, but if you like watching two characters totally meant for each other fall head over heels in love with one another and in general gooey, happy feelings, then this show is for you.\r\nBe aware, though, that this is only the first season, and another cour is already planned for release in Winter 2016.\r\nStarting us off will be the story department. It's nothing that hasn't been done before, what with the handsome prince saving the beautiful maidenfrom certain disaster and all that jazz. But this show pulls it off that I feel is actually sort of believable given its medieval setting, and I didn't mind the more cliche aspects of it, since there were little things here and there that made it feel more realistic. The main heroine, Shirayuki, for example, is actually a talented herbalist, and her goal in getting closer to the prince, whom she's obviously fallen for after having been saved by him, is to become an official court herbalist. She actually has a talent that she uses and improves on, and she's incredibly hardworking, which was refreshing to see. She also is pretty competent on her own, and in most dire situations she gets herself into, she often is able to almost pull herself out of it, and it ends up making one feel that, though she didn't need the Prince's help, it's still nice to see the guy save the girl at the end of the day because rainbows and butterflies. But overall, the story doesn't actually do anything special, and it's really just about an unlikely relationship between two people of different classes and how they struggle to come to grips with their feelings for each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is where I was actually expecting something better considering it was done by Studio Bones, but I actually found the character designs and background art to be pretty boring. Nothing bad, but everything kind of screamed generic, even though you technically could say it was all fairly pretty looking. The animation was pretty good, again, no stand out moments in particular besides perhaps a certain fireworks scene toward the end of the series, but there wasn't ever really much to anime in the first place. There is a lot of dialogue, a lot of viewing scenery, but also several fight scenes, and those are all actually well done. I appreciated their inclusion to break up the monotony of courtly meetings, walks in the courtyard, office discussions, and other fairly boring events, animation-wise.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was all very pretty. That's honestly the best way I can describe it. Not beautiful, but it was pretty. The tracks were often very soothing, and just added to that same \"gooey\" feeling of fluttering happy feelings of the show. Voice acting was pretty good, but I felt like the MC prince Zen was trying way too hard for a lot of his lines. Hayami Saori does a good job as usual portraying the plucky Shirayuki, but I don't actually like her voice that much in the first place, so it was a struggle for me personally. She did a good job though. Also, the OP and ED are very good and pleasant to listen to every time.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the best thing about this show. Everything is set up to be the most generic idea for a show ever imagined, but the things you learn about the characters and the way they act are refreshing actually. Shirayuki, as I mentioned before, is actually capable of taking care of herself, and she doesn't actually need to be rescued in most situations. She has convictions and goals, and she actively works to achieve those goals. Zen is a lot more nuanced of a character, and his motivations and backstory are both very interesting. The flashbacks of his past actually add a lot to his character, and he feels very complex and I'm not sure I know everything about him yet, which is good. The side characters get barely any attention, but they're side characters in a shoujo after all.\\n\\n\r\nObjectively speaking, I'd only rate this show a 7 or 8, but enjoyment-wise, I'd give it a solid 9. If the visuals had been more impressive or the soundtrack more moving, I'd have given it a 10. But honestly, it just did the right things. It was gooey, that's really the best word to describe it. Just feels good, man.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a nice break from predictable shoujos in that it presents its story in an interesting way that just lets you take a break from life. It doesn't require serious thinking, nor is it tiresome or boring, or nauseating even. It feels good.",

Maybe some interesting storylines but nothing too major. \r\nAnS is one of those anime you may want to watch every so often, when you are depressed or when you just want to watch a light hearted spring-like anime.

            "content": "I\u2019m please to say that going into \u2018Akagami no Shirayuki-Hime\u2019 I had expectations and they were fulfilled to say the least. I loved this anime. So what can you expect if you decided to give it a chance?\r\nFirst of all \u2013and very crucial- it is a Fairy Tale. Which means it is very romanticized and cutesy. Not that there isn\u2019t some action! Like regular fairy tales there are parts with swordfights, damsels in distress and evil people that want to harm said damsels.\r\nThe Characters are good! And Shirayuki is not a damsel really. But due to her hair colour and connections to the prince doesget herself involved in all sorts of situations. She\u2019s a bit blunt at points but the anime is a shoujo fairy tale, so I can\u2019t really complain knowing that. Would I preferred her being a bit more kickass? Yes. And is she a little too perfect? Yes, again. I will admit that. But, it never reached a point where she made me sigh in exasperation and say \u2018ok, now you\u2019re just messing with me!\u2019 She does talk back and runs into action when she needs to.\\n\\n\r\nZen is also a fairy tale prince. For anyone who has seen \u2018Kaichou wa Maid Sama\u2019 reminds me a lot of Usui. He is a bit too perfect as well. But, like Shirayuki, that character aspect never really did annoy me. He can get carried away and has a tragic past \u2013as all Shoujo manga/anime boys should have apparently- but I never hated him for that. On the contrary he is sweet and caring and that is totally fine in my book.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that really pleased and I will sound immature for saying so but, I\u2019m an otaku woman and I appreciate that in anime, were the rich palette of guys. Good, evil, sweet, mischievous; there are types for all kinds of preferences. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the first episode I understood the feeling of this anime. It\u2019s very relaxing in general. Even if there\u2019s conflict throughout the episode it never tires the viewer. At the same time, whatever conflicts are taking place, they are resolved by the end of the episode. By the end of the anime \u2013and I don\u2019t really think I\u2019m spoiling anything here- everything is resolved and we get our happy fairy tale ending. Well, not really ending, as there is a sequel.\\n\r\nAn anime I immediately compared it too is \u2018The World is still Beautiful\u2019 a.k.a. \u2018Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii\u2019 If you like that Anime I recommend watching \u2018Akagame no Shirayuki-Hime\u2019 and vice versa.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, it\u2019s a beautifully drawn anime, with interesting ( a bit too perfect sometimes) characters and good plot that never tired me. If you are into hardcore action, this anime is not really for you. If you want a light adventure, that contains a bit of humor and romance with cutesy moments then \u2018Akagami no Shirayuki\u2019 just might be for you.\\n",

            "content": "I'm not a veteran of romance stories, especially not romance anime, but I still feel confident in saying this was a good show.\r\nAt first glance, It didn\u2019t *succumb* to the more harmful tropes of the genre, but they were still there.  It flowed naturally, kept good pacing and focus throughout, had interesting conflict that tied directly to the character's development, even if the story does not feel complete.  There's a second season coming, so we can't judge it for that.\r\nThe story focuses on Shirayuki, a young herbalist girl with rare bright red hair.  She draws the attention of a sleazy local lord,and in her attempt to escape, she runs into Zen, the prince of a neighboring country.  The parody on the Snow White fairy tale is brief and clever, complete with a poisoned apple.  Zen rescues her, and she eventually finds her way to his castle to study as a court herbalist.  They develop a close friendship, and while it is obvious from the beginning how Zen feels and where the story is going, it doesn\u2019t feel rushed.  The world doesn\u2019t bend over backwards to accommodate their budding relationship.  \\n\\n\r\nTypical romance clich\u00e9s are sidestepped, but not avoided.  I was interested to find that many of the typical tropes I disliked so much were there: the misunderstanding, the love triangle, the shock of one towards the other\u2019s feelings.  However, they were all handled well.  The love triangle was handled as if both men involved were mature adults who wanted the best for her.  One stepped aside without making it an issue, while the other never noticed (very much like Sydney Carton).  The way Shirayuki reacted to Zen\u2019s kiss was natural.  It didn\u2019t feel written.  The misunderstanding is treated more as Shirayuki trying to sort out her feelings rather than either one being unreasonable (or stupid).  Unlike in other stories, this flows naturally into the resolution, and doesn\u2019t come to a halt and jerk into the opposite direction.  \\n\\n\r\nThis story was impressive because it felt real.  It felt like someone were actually recounting a romance between to real individuals.  Their reactions, their motivations, their weaknesses, their decisions: it all seemed reasonable and human.  So often I find that elements of the story or the characters themselves are exaggerated, and I\u2019ve always found that unnecessary.  This story proved what I believed all along: a real romance is exciting and vibrant all on its own.  Seeing two people fall in love is something we love to watch in real life; why not leave it that way when telling a story?  \\n\\n\r\nThe romance transitioned so smoothly out of their friendship, but if I had to nitpick, Zen seemed to pop up everywhere.  I thought he seemed a little clingy because of this, even though it wouldn\u2019t have seemed that way to the characters.  What we see as day by day may be weeks for them (still, the author is aware of this, so\u2026).  Also, the situation seems a little too perfect.  The character are never asked to give up anything, but I can only assume that's because this is the beginning of a longer story.  For that reason, I can overlook the lack of a deeper story arc.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a great story.  It begins well and ends in a satisfying way, which is rare enough to appreciate.",

            "content": "Akagami no Shirayuki-hime\r\nRomantic fairy tale, anyone?\r\nThis story is about love, hardship, dangerous encounters, good humour, and peril. Did I say dangerous twice? The reason why I find this anime to be so enticing is that this anime teachers lessons, just like a fairy tale should. There always has to be heroes in this world.\r\nI'll start with a quick summary of the main plot.\r\nOne day as a young girl begins to pack up her herbalist supplies, a royal attendant bursts into her local shop and demands that she fall in love with the prince of her country. She stands mortified that such a request be askedof herself, and proceeds to escape the country in search of somewhere safe. From there, her wonderful adventure begins within a new country and with a chance encounter with a fellow who will change her life.\\n\\n\r\nWhat can we learn here? \\n\r\n1) The main character is a herbalist in profession. She probably enjoys discovering new remedies to cure illness and wounds.\\n\r\n2) The royal family within her home country rules with a tyranny hand based upon how the attendant burst into the shop.  The main character has good reason for wanting to escape.\\n\r\n3) Leaving the country on her own means that she must hone some type of independent skills, and also is the type of person to build strong bonds with others in order to survive.\\n\r\n4) Keep in mind that this is a fairy tale and so really dramatic events will ensue.\\n\\n\r\nPay attention to the morals taught in this anime. You might just learn something useful.\\n\\n\r\nAlrighty, I will carry on with the ratings:\\n\r\nStory - 9 - This solid slice of life genre follows one main goal. The commoner girl and prince must find love without upsetting the kingdom. As well, few questions were left unanswered here, but the story line does enough of a job to allow the viewer to make an educated guess as to how those questions are answered and how those stories will end.\\n\r\nGraphics - 9 - Very very bright and detailed graphics. Sometimes even eye-poppingly bright. This all gives a feeling of richness to the colour.\\n\r\nCharacters - 9 - The anime does a fine job in explaining the depth of characters and how they relate to one another.  Even the villains are given good reason for their actions, however selfish those actions may be.\\n\r\nMusic - 9 - Kind of like a beautiful state of trance at times. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9 - The avg divides flawlessly on this one. Perfect 9 in the romance category.\\n\r\nRecommended - Unless fairy tales are too joyously offensive for you, I recommend this to you hoping that you are interested in an innocent bucket of love.",

A Prince and a peasant so to say.\r\nBut our female lead isn't useless, while not physically strong, her knowledge and  earnestness shows how strong she canbe to the world and people around her.\\n\\n\r\nAnd our male lead isn't perfect. He needs to learn how to be with people, how to properly dictate his actions and make sure his leadership and power isn't misused.\\n\\n\r\nHow these two have growth in personality, goals, and their relationship. It's just so damn uplifting. Even when there is strife, they continue to push forward to make sure they can move on.\\n\\n\r\nOur couple aren't the only enjoyable ones here, the others who are supporting or against our couple are also awesome to have on screen. This is especially so in the second season, where returning characters or new, a viewer can get so happy to see what they do.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season also gets the story and characters to be better and better.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest salt in the wound for me, was that there IS NO DAMN WEDDING EPISODE. Frig, maybe I just want to see more of the couple embrace each other. No, that's exactly what I want.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a great watch for romance, while some may call it cheesy, I think its \"LOOK AT THEM, THEY'RE SO GOOD TOGETHER. YES!

            "content": "Akagami no Shirayuki-hime or Snow White with Red Hair is a nice change from the typical shoujo genre. In the past while watching or reading other shoujo works, a common point is to have the main heroine and her love interest go through some kind of strife in their relationship. This device can easily take up a majority of the plot over the course of many episodes, and really affects the delivery of the story. Thankful this show tries to act smarter than this and overall tries to avoids anything of the sort. If you are hesitant to give this show a watch over suchdrama, then fear not. Moving onwards, the characters are fairly typical, you have the lead and her love interest, and a few side characters in the background to move the plot along. To give the show credit, it tries to give them at least some characterization, so that they aren't fictional nobodies by the end of the story, though as you would expect from a shoujo, a lot of effort goes towards the advancing of the relationship between the two leads. Up next is the sound, and to be honest it's fairly bland, you have your sad background music when there's a sad scene, and the bubbly happy stuff if the scene is comedic or happy. The opening and ending songs aren't much better and overall they're really forgettable. Overall I myself had a pleasant experience with this piece, and I would recommend this to people who enjoy the genre.",

It's refreshing and is recommended for those who want an anime which they will just smile whilst watching it.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is about a girl with exceptionally red hair, who leaves her home country because the Prince of her country orders her to be his concubine. Not wanting to loose her freedom she cuts her hair and runs away. She then soon meets Zen  who accompanies her to the path she wants to take to her own story,too her own life... Right off the bat this story hassome elements of a typical shoujo anime where the female lead meets a Prince. However, this story breaks a few conventions of shoujo and makes the female lead actually fend for herself sometimes and not rely on the male lead to save her sweet ass. Other anime do this as well but the one thing I love about this show is that she is very smart and dependable and the characters contrast together well.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI never really focused on the art style of anime but I tried looking at how the art work was in this anime. I liked the look of the characters they looked aesthetically pleasing to me especially the eyes. The backgrounds were also very crisp and had a good look to them.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAt first I didn't really like the sound track because I'm not really that into light hearted music. However after some episodes without skipping the opening or ending I got into it. The ending was my favourite out of all the songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nShirayuki: A smart girl who can defend for herself but she has a hard time asking for help. She can be a bit stubborn but she means well. This is what I mainly like about her, even she has a side that she wants to fix about herself,the stubbornness. \\n\\n\r\nZen: Zen is also stubborn as well. He loves his country and the people who support him. He likes acting on things and doesn't like sitting back doing nothing. But of course he sometimes can't do most things like he wants to because of his social status but he finds a way to around it.\\n\\n\r\nShirayuki and Zen's relationship is something I wish for myself in the future to be honest. They are naturally romantic with each other even when they started off as friends. It just came naturally and you can see the friendship and strong bond they have. This was the key thing that made me fall in love with this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I watched this a few times before I even had a MAL account and I still would. I still remember the the first time I watched it when it was airing and every time after school i would come home from a stressful day at school and watch it. It took my mind of things that were going on in real life and just made me really happy. Even now it still makes me happy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend to those who want to watch something that will make them smile and also to those who want something that doesn't fit the conventions of normal shoujo anime's (not like there is anything wrong with them but they can get a bit boring at times) It might not be for people who aren't really into the whole romance thing and more into shounen and the likes but it's a good experience.",

            "content": "Romance anime should show how does the love story progresses. They show it through how the couple actually develops throughout the story, having the realization that they need each other by their side. The problem is, when there is too much emotion in a certain scene, the actions made by the characters sometimes turn into a unreasonable one. The problem with unreasonable actions or the ones that you call \"that escalated quickly\" scenes in anime, the emotion that the scene tries impose to the character actually turns into comedic one or becomes laughable at that point, making you think that the characters itself are stupidor idiots.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like in this anime is that the character developments are well explained. At the start of the anime, Shirayuki is actually confused on what \"path\" she should take until she meets Zen, which also had his own problems in his princely life. Shirayuki's fiery personality and stubbornness actually makes her character cool. But sometimes, Shirayuki's actions in the anime are sometimes jumpy. When someone actually forces you to be brought to the prince at once, you won't just cut your hair and leave the country. At that point, what I thought is where is Shirayuki's family or friends. I actually got disappointed at the part where she cuts her hair because that made her beauty lesser, and sometimes I lack the past about Shirayuki. Like how she became a herbalist and why is she even alone in her house? Overall, I like Shirayuki and she's the prettiest girl I've ever in anime (but she cut her hair). What I like with the character of Zen is his life throwbacks are too deep and how he developed his way of thinking. It portrays that everyone should not wish of a royal life because you don't know what Zen is going through. These realizations that spouted from the anime is another thing why I liked the anime. Zen also makes \"jumpy\" actions, which happened on the tower where he kissed Shirayuki after looking in her injury. Some characters could've been developed more, like the royal guards or the court herbalist. But all in all, the story is clear and the you won't feel incomplete after the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor a romance anime lover, this will definitely a good choice.",

The only flaw is that most of the characters have no flaws. \r\nShirayuki is kind, hardworking, and a talented herbalist. I can see why everyone who meets her likes her--she's just one of those people who can brighten your day. She also has a solid level of sass and cleverness that always takes people by surprise. She's not intimidated by riches or rank, but hasnone of the recklessness that we usually associate with that attitude. \\n\\n\r\nEven though her romance with Prince Zen is completely obvious from the beginning, I do like their dynamic and the way they build mutual respect before they even approach the romance angle.\\n\\n\r\nI want to shout out to the animators for their masterful use of lighting in this show. Not just the traditional shoujo sparkles, each landscape scene (especially the ones at sunrise) is absolutely beautiful.\\n\\n",

An anime with a modern twist to the Snow White story! (albeit better) The story is quite intriguing, following the lives of Shirayuki and Prince Zen (and all the other supporting characters!) The art is so lovely, along with the sound. (I swear I got the first opening song stuck in my head for a few days.) The character development is quite amazing, especially for both Shirayuki and Zen. It also contains small quirks and hilarious bits. It also has thosescenes where you would just bury your face on a pillow from how precious Shirayuki and Zen is. The problems arising on episodes are really good and tested each character quite well. A light-weight anime that would get your heart enjoying every bit of the ride.\\n\\n\r\nSo, 10/10? :~)",

Even though the fairy tale may have been the inspiration for this anime, it is very unique. (So don't compare this to Disney's Snow White in the slightest!)\r\nI was a little worried that the main girl (Shirayuki) was going to turn into a weak, pathetic female lead that is more useless and annoying than anything else (like Haruka in Uta no Prince-sama). Luckily, this was not the case! \r\nThe story felt a little slow in the middle, but it picked up and season 2 iseven better than season 1. The animation is gorgeous. The Prince is gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a lover of Shojo, make sure this anime is a priority on your \"must watch\" list.",

The show even made me love a character i hated in the first episode, love in his next appearance, and the main couple is so cute they had me smiling like an idiot every time they were on screen together\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10- Like i said earlier, the main couple is so cute that they managed to make me have a huge smile on my face every time they interacted, and that is quite the feat for me. I also love watching the story unfold and watching all the characters interact in different ways, as well as watch Shirayuki herself gain the respect of those around her. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10/10",

I also enjoyed seeing the progression with the main characters and how they overcome challenges that are presented to them. If you are a fan of romance I highly recommend this anime to you. The series is also very unique because it relatesto fair tales but doesn't follow them completely, which leads to a new story for the series.",

I started to watch it because i was bored and it really helped me that day. Thank you Shirayuki.\r\nStory : 6 / 10\r\nThere is not much to say about its story. The first episode goes really fast, Shirayuki leaves here city and randomly meets the prince. After some diverse adventures that really shows how brave is Shirayuki, she starts to work to stay withthe prince just by herself and i think that part of the anime was the most interesting.\\n\r\nOnce she's set in the castle, some random twists pops out and the anime slowly goes toward its end. The love between Shirayuki and the prince grows at the same time (despite the first prince pressure) and they end up both together. Yay ! Happy end. The story sometimes lack \"credibility\" (can't find another word) so, alas!, i can't rate it highter than a fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nAmbiance : 7 / 10\\n\\n\r\nAs a huge OST fan, i often listen to incredibly intense soundtracks and i must say i'm not frustrated at all by Akagami no Shirayuki-hime's. The OSTs and sound effects are really light but fit the anime action pretty well. However, i didn't even fully listen to the opening even the first time because of how BORING it was.\\n\r\nFor the graphic part, the anime, without having an outstanding animation and chara design, is pretty good and is a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nLore : 5 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI believe Shirayuki lives in a paper-made world. It has almost no story nor specificities when it's not about herbs. I guess this lack of information participate in the anime simplicity but it's simple really sad we don't know a single thing about the place our heroin lives.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 9 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI loved almost every character of the anime. The story may be straight forward, it doesn't mean the characters are all stereotypes.\\n\r\nShirayuki is not the weak and reliant little girl that she could have been. She fights enemies and life with incredible courage and strengh, never gives anything up and always stays straightforward and sincere in any situation. And she is lovely.\\n\r\nZen one of the kindest character i've ever seen in anime and even with his entourage's pressure, i never renounce to Shirayuki.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial mention to Obi which totally reminds me Izaya Orihara in his sneaky ways.",

            "content": "A very poor excuse of a romance anime. You probably won't find a more generic and unrealistic couple in any other anime. Basically, the two main characters fall in love with each other for no particular reason whatsoever. After they become a couple, they have no fights or conflicts of any sort, and they're pretty much a perfect lovey-dovey couple. For an anime centered around romance, it probably helps to have a romance that actually contains meaningful and realistic development. You'll find nothing like that here, this is paint-by-numbers Disney-esque romance. That being said, the artwork and music in this anime is absolutely tremendous, andthe female MC is a pretty cool character.\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n+ Tremendous artwork\\n\r\n+ Nice musical score\\n\r\n+ Female MC is a cool character\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n- Absolutely horrendous romance\\n\r\n- It's just..... boring\\n\r\n- Central plot seems non-existent\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: 6/10",

            "content": "It seems that every year, I grow to appreciate the art of animation every year, by growing fonder of different studios, actors, techniques, narrative styles, and directors and the conclusion I have come to is that without Japanese animation, I would not harbor the appreciation for storytelling that I possess now. It takes a special kind of show to remind me of that to the point that I am left breathless by what has transpired. Akagami no Shirayuki-hime, or Snow White with the Red Hair, is that show.\r\nIn the kingdom of Tanbarun lives a beautiful young woman with beautiful hair, bright and red as anapple, a trait said to be unusual in this world. Her name is Shirayuki, and she is a herbalist. But one day, the mischievous Prince Raj hears of her and demands that she become his concubine. Not wanting any part of his wicked plans, she spends all night concocting medicine for every one of her clients in town, packs up her things, and cuts her long hair short, leaving the remainder on the window sill for the devious prince who craved it so. As she leaves she meets Zen, the prince of Clarines, and together, they chart a path to Zen's homeland so that Shirayuki may follow her dreams, not stopping for anyone or anything. And so begins a young woman's journey of discovery, adventure, and love.\\n\\n\r\nAkagami is just as much a story of empowerment as it is a story of love. Shirayuki is the single greatest female character in anime and I am aware of the weight of such a claim. She constantly faces danger head on using her wits rather than resorting to combat to solve her disputes and her willingness to stand up to those who think less of her for her social class is an inspiring sight that deserves to be seen. She is the type of character I will tell stories about to my future children, especially if I have a daughter. When she meets Zen, the male lead and love interest of the show, they certainly make for great friends and perhaps she is attracted to him, but her motivations for going to his country with him are not to pursue him but to achieve her own dreams. She wants to be a court herbalist in his kingdom because herbology is a passion of hers. It is an extension of her desire to help people. Yet despite this, the show doesn't ever judge her for also having real feelings for Zen and neither should it. She proves time and time again through the show that she is entirely in control of her destiny, and when that control is taken away, she fights using her knowledge rather than brawn as it would go against her character to do otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nZen is likewise a phenomenal character. His romance with Shirayuki is handled beautifully and the two talk with one another in a way that breaks down the barriers of their social classes, establishing each other as equals. When Shirayuki's life is in danger, Zen scolds her for acting rashly in order to prove that someone is after her, but Shirayuki confidently affirms that she is aware of the dangers and doesn't need to be scolded. And Zen compromises with her. The two are a paragon of trust and friendship, which makes the romantic development so much sweeter in the long run. His protective nature is inspiring but he doesn't overdo it and fully trusts Shirayuki.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the rest of the cast is delightful as well, from Zen's two attendants, Mitsuhide and Kiki, to the mischievous Obi, to the Chief herbalist, to Shirayuki's young partner Ryuu, the cast is beaming with personality and charm. Even Raj, despite being an antagonist at first, grows to be likable, if a bit of a goof. Aiding in the character department is the acting. Funimation's dub for Akagami is the best dub I have heard from them in a while, with the honorable mentions being Brina Palencia as Shirayuki, Josh Grelle as Zen, and Rachel Robinson as Garack Gazelt. If you are going to watch this show, watch it dubbed. It is worth it, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe this show in one phrase, it would be \"Ghibli-esque.\" The visuals, vocal performances, and music all come together to make a show that captures the wonder and beauty that captivated me about movies such as Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, or the Cat Returns. The animation is done by Studio Bones, who I praised in my review of Kekkai Sensen as being the best animation studio in the world. This show is no different in terms of visual quality. It is beautiful and I can't imagine any other studio creating the same environments nearly as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is directed by Masahiro Ando, who's resume speaks for itself. He directed Sword of the Stranger, a truly phenomenal hidden gem of the late 2000's and he also was the choreographer for the Cowboy Bebop movie and a key animator on some of the most critically acclaimed anime of all time. The guy might not get as much recognition as other big directors in the industry, but he is more than worthy of the respect.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is composed by Michiru Oshima, who has previously worked on the original Fullmetal Alchemist, Little Witch Academia, and Rokka no Yuusha, among many others. Her music works best for bright and colorful fantasy shows such as this. The feeling of joy that one receives by listening to her tracks almost makes her music easily identifiable. Without even knowing her name or knowing her involvement with other shows, I could tell she was that I was listening to her music just by listening to it when I watched Rokka no Yuusha a few months back.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I rewatched the first season of Akagami with my sister in preparation for this review, she didn't quite understand after the first couple of episodes why I held the show in such high regard. She was captivated and wanted to continue because she enjoyed it, but she hadn't quite yet understood why I loved it so much. Seeing the characters grow stronger and closer together made it clear, and rewatching it strengthened my resolve in concluding that Akagami no Shirayuki-hime is a happy, beautiful, romantic masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nThis show shows me the reason I watch Anime: To let my mind wander and to immerse myself in the machinations of creators who love to let their imaginations run wild just like me and who want to leave an impression on my mind, and my heart. I wish there was more I could do to thank them.\\n\\n\r\nWHERE TO WATCH IT:\\n\\n\r\nAkagami no Shirayuki-hime is available for legal streaming through Funimation Now and available on Blu-ray and DVD. Season 2 will be released on DVD on April 25th, 2017. Expect a review or at least a recommendation for that season as well after I have rewatched it.",

            "content": "~Story~ 8 \r\nThis story is about young Shirayuki. She runs from her kingdom because due to her rare hair color, Shirayuki gets a proposal to be a concubine of the foolish but famous prince Raji. While traveling, she meets a boy named Zen, who accidentally gets injured, and she boldly cures his wounds. They become friends, and she finds out than Zen is actually a prince and he saves her from being taken by Raji. They later go to his palace, where she applies for the job as the court herbalist to be able to go freely to the castle where Zen is. \r\n~Art~ 8\\n\r\nThe art is fluent and the characters look stunning, mind you it's not just the characters that look absolutely amazing it's also the backgrounds that make me watch with awe. It is truly a skill to be able to make such art. \\n\r\n~Sound~ 8 \\n\r\nThe opening song was beautiful and catchy, same with the ending although it was more sweet then beautiful. I enjoyed the voice actors for the English dub, but seeing how I did not watch the sub I cannot give my personal opinion on the voice acting on that side, but I'm sure it too was lovely. \\n\r\n~Character~ 9 \\n\r\nI loved the characters in this anime. They were funny and sweet and truly amusing to watch. Shirayuki defies the traits of a typical shoujo lead. She is socially capable, strong-willed, is not afraid to speak her mind and has actually has a brain which knows her limits. Shirayuki holds her own and yearns to seek position for her to see Zen as her equal.  she is very rational and thinks before she acts.  Zen, on the other hand, might err at times to your typical male shoujo character but a closer examination reveals that he is not. While he is kind, his past (a very painful one, mind you) reveals what made him like he is as portrayed. He might be likable and composed but his aversion to his much lord brother is palpable. He also narrowly avoided the sparkly main lead syndrome by toning down some of his traits and by not giving him a chick magnet role.  All other recurring characters were also given ample time to get some development. Mitsuhide and Izana benefited from Zen's flashback of his past so much that it can be also viewed that certain story was theirs and not Zen's. They were also elevated from plot device to actual characters which interact with the leads (and contribute to their future paths) without the feeling of emotional manipulation. Obi, on the other hand, is a very interesting oddball which complemented Zen's calm nature. He is quite perceptive and throws statements which drive the series to a positive direction. \\n\r\n ~enjoyment~ 10 \\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. Although it may seem silly but I actually really admire Shirayuki, she is strong willed, intelligent, and she has my dream job. I loved watching how everyone interacted and how all their relationships progressed.  \\n\r\n~overall~ 9 \\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime to everyone. No it does not have magic powers and different dimensions, but it has a sweet love story. Plus it is set in a more old time fashion, with princes and court herbalists.",

For me having an \"ordinary\" girl take great leaps and bounds in her own life, leaving everything she knew on a whim, is something I can relate to.
