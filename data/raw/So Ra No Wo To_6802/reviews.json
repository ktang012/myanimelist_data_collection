            "content": "\"Amazing Grace! (how sweet the sound),\r\n   That saved a wretch like me!\r\nI once was lost, but now am found,\r\n   Was blind, but now I see...\"\r\nJohn Newton and William Cowper (Olney Hymns - 1779).\r\nThe problem with first impressions is that all too often they are wrong, and this is one of the main reasons why a number of great shows don't get the recognition they deserve. Unfortunately, every season more anime are added to that list.\r\nSora no Woto (Sounds of the Skies), is one example of this mindset at work.\r\nThe series is the first production of a new initiative known as Animeno Chikara (The Power of Anime), which is essentially a collaboration between TV Tokyo's anime department and Aniplex that was established in 2009 . Part of the mandate for this project is to create and produce original anime which are not based on any previously published material (so manga, novel and game adaptations are out of the window). One of the advantages of this is that the writers have far fewer restrictions placed on them from the outset, and it seems as though this freedom has been put to good use here.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a young girl, Sorami Kanata, who, having heard a trumpet rendition of \"Amazing Grace\" played by a mysterious female soldier, has resolved to become a bugler. She is assigned to the 1121st Platoon, who are stationed at the Time Keeping Bastion in the town of Seize, and is taken under the wing of Master Sergeant Rio Kazumiya.\\n\\n\r\nNow, one would be forgiven for initially thinking that this series is nothing more than K-On! in the army, especially given that the character design is very similar between the two anime (I thought like that too, at first). However, the differences between the two shows are palpable from the very first moments of Sora no Woto. The plot, which is more on the episodic side for the most part, is far more reminiscent of Haibane Renmei, and although there are a few points that deserved more focus, the story is actually very well crafted. The pacing is extremely good throughout the series, and the seemingly slow progression promotes a feeling of relaxation rather than boredom in a manner very similar to Aria.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that really captures the viewer though, is the bittersweet yet hopeful undertone running through the series, and nowhere is this more prominent than in the characters. While each of them are somewhat stereotypical, the show develops in such a way that the story becomes inclusive of them, rather than having one true lead while the other \"leads\" are nothing more than glorified support. The upshot of this is that, come the end of the series, the viewer is left with a sense of catharsis that very few shows manage to achieve, especially ones that, at first glance, fit the \"moe\" archetype.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the supposed problems with Sora no Woto is the fact that the characters are designed with moe in mind, however the show is surprising in that, while the characters are reminiscent of certain other shows, this is where much of the similarity ends. In all honesty I found the character design somewhat off-putting at first, however this perception was dispelled very quickly as, although the characters are very clearly \"moe\" in their design, the fact is that this allows for a great deal of expression as well - something that is put to good use throughout the series. What is most surprising though, is the distinct lack of visual hooks associated with this sort of character design, in particular things like fan service. Instead, the series uses the characters in a manner that is far removed from the norm, and the effect of this is that, come the end of the series, one really begins to wonder why everyone made such a fuss over K-On!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, the series is very good, especially with character and vehicle movements. There is a fluid, almost naturalistic, flow to the animation which is present even during the scenes in which very little happens. The biggest pluses though, are the backgrounds and settings. Unlike most \"moe\" anime, the attention to detail in this area is truly good, with much of the scenery being evocative of old European towns, villages and countryside. As well as the visual style of the settings, the show also includes a number of European references (Helvetia is Switzerland for example, the Romans speak German, etc), all of which add to the series, and allow the viewer to become more absorbed in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe acting is pretty good throughout the anime, and many of seiyuu really show their talent with their respective characters. Granted there are a few moments where Sora no Woto slips into \"moe speaking mode\", however these become fewer as the series progresses. The real star of the show though, is the music, in particular the lone trumpet playing \"Amazing Grace\".\\n\\n\r\nNow, one thing that should be clarified here is just how important that one hymn is to this show. Hearing it is what spurs Kanata into becoming a bugler, but it's also something that links a number of disparate threads throughout the series. The hymn is about salvation and redemption, and ultimately that's what this series is all about. To be honest though, whenever I heard it, all of that didn't matter. The image of the lone bugler playing that song is one of the most evocative to appear in anime for a long, long time, and is made more powerful because this show is effectively about the effects of war, not just on the common people or the military support staff, but also on those who fight.\\n\\n\r\nIn effect, this is what makes the characters in Sora no Woto so very different to what one would expect. While there is a degree of stereotype to them, the show is careful not to let these personality traits take over, and as the series progresses the characters are allowed to not simply grow, but to evolve, something which although limited at times, is laudable as this type of development is rare in anime.\\n\\n\r\nSora no Woto is, by any measure, as much a character piece as Haibane Renmei, Kino no Tabi, or any other show of that ilk. While those other shows may have far more character development, this series is no slouch, indeed some of the characterisations are extremely powerful, especially Illya Arkadia, a character who doesn't appear too often and has very few lines, but whose presence is almost tangible throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be clear by now that I enjoyed this series immensely, something which I still find somewhat surprising given that I initially avoided it because I expected something extremely \"light and fluffy\" like K-On! To say that Sora no Woto has far more substance than the series it looks like is an understatement, and while the difference may not sit well with die hard K-On! fans, it should be noted that the aim of this show isn't simply to entertain, but to tell a story. The subject matter is open to interpretation, but the inclusion of possibly the most recognisable hymn in the world speaks volumes about how the series should be perceived.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Sora no Woto does have some \"light and fluffy\" elements to it, but ultimately it's a tale of salvation, redemption and hope, and it's because of this that the series stands apart from many of it's visual counterparts.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes the resemblance is only skin deep.",

            "content": "\"Someone was saying the world is ending. But I like this world.\"\r\nWhen So Ra No Wo To was first announced on the winter season roster, I wasn't planning on watching it. Despite reading the plot synopsis, I did not think it was a 'moeblob in the army' kind of story. That only came later when many, many people decided to put labels on it. Still, I wasn't inclined to watch the series. That is, until I saw the beautiful concept artwork by Kishida Mel. It was amazing and it made me want to see the series in spite of the much talked about art shifttowards moe.  (By the way, if anyone knows where I can find more of this art, feel free to tell me as I only have the two widely distributed images.)\\n\\n\r\nI will say it once at the beginning of this review: this is not a moe series. It has moe character designs, it has some familiar character archetypes, but it is not a moe series. There is no pandering sexual material nor is there any outright moe or fanservice outside of episode 8 (if you consider that fanservice). There is a difference between a character like Kanata, who is inexperienced and idealistic because of her youth, and someone like Yui, who is a helpless mess of idiotball. I know that it's easy to be cynical and look down upon anybody who isn't a realistic superman with mature character flaws considering the current state of commercial anime, but if you can't recognize the difference between these two characters, you will probably never be able to enjoy this series.\\n\\n\r\nI was already caught when I watched the first episode. This was the single best premiere of the new season. On the other two hyped up series of the season:  Durarara!!'s first episode was only told from the point of view of one character and would need the added perspectives of episode 2 onward to develop it into the great series it is. Dance in the Vampire Bund, on the other hand, went the Haruhi route of having the first episode have little to do with the story arc of the series, instead vying to prove the premise of the existence of it's title species.\\n\\n\r\nSora no Woto, on the other hand, set up everything in the series from episode 1. Whether you loved or hated the show, very few question the sheer potential and number of possibilities that could spring from the series, especially considering it was anime original material. It set up the characters Rio and Kanata: one, a talented but cold and mature veteran, and the other, a bright and optismistic newcomer. It sets up the wonderous setting: the village of Seize, a quiet town that has become a corner of the habitable earth, and the world itself. And what a world it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe settting of Sora no Woto is a character in and of itself, and much of the intrigue of the first few episodes is trying to discover just what happened to the people that live here. Being a slice of life series, the series portrays the extraordinary in the mundane. Something terrible has happened to this world. There is no life left in the oceans. Entire species' have been wiped out, and humans aren't doing too well themselves. French and English objects are common place, and Japanese is a forgotten language. Technology that we would marvel as futuristic is considered ancient. In the first episode, we see something deep in a river that could not be explained by anything present in our world. Everything we find normal are leftovers of an era gone by.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, the characters themselves are so fantastically ordinary. Despite the possibility and potential for this show to jump off into the land of fantasy or science fiction in the very next episode, there is a realism that permeates this series. This is no dark, dystopic vision, despite all the characters referencing a near apocalypse in the recent past. There is no police state, nor is there a heavy presence of the military. In fact, there are only five members of the military in the entire town. Two of them are women, three of them of are kids, all of them care little for war and all that comes with it. And watching the members of this village go through their daily lives, be it a glass-blower, a shopkeeper, a pair of orphans and their young guardian, or an elderly woman living in solitude in the mountains, you get the feeling that this is what it would be like. This is how people try to move on. Despite the fact that there are ongoing peace talks, there is no talk of peace in Seize, nor is talk of war. This place is so far away from civilization, you wonder why the military even have an outpost here. Then you realize that just a few miles from this town where war \"could never happen,\" there is barren, empty place known as No Man's Land. And something terrible happened there.\\n\\n\r\nWhen watching this series, you really get the impression that the writers and producers have done an immense amount of research. There is a strange mix of culture and history in this world, with art and architectural references abound. The story takes place in a small European town, and the architecture, landscape, artifacts, even the plantlife are portrayed correctly. There were no corners cut when they were creating the atmosphere of this series. While the animation is ordinary, it is the vivid and detailed artwork that make this series memorable. From the aging suburban buildings, to the fresh and maintained farmlands, to the lifeless desert with \"modern\" skyscrapers peeking out of the sand, to the untamed woods, the beautiful snowfields, and the distant mountains covered with deteriorating ruins of the futuristic technology of the old days. Everything is coloured and detailed wonderfully, and sprinkled with the anthropologic evidence of the time of war. This place was once important. Now it is not.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has great sound, period. Being a series where music is a big part of the plot, it is to be expected. The sound is crisp and clean, voice acting is top notch and stays in character, and the original musical composition is much more akin to \"traditional\" European classical music as opposed to your standard, synthetically orchestrated background music. A French vocal piece, the orchestra work at the end of episode 10, the music over the end credits of the final episode, and the numerous trumpet solos and renditions of \"Amazing Grace\" are some of the highlights. The opening sequence is visually stunning, with a very aged, mythological feel, and a retelling of a not-so-much-a-fairy-tale story you will hear in the first episode. The ending is a catchy song with visuals that once again serve to remind us that this series is not about moe caricatures. It is about a group of people that share bonds, experience hardships, laugh with and criticize each other. Friendship is a very important theme in this series.\\n\\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\r\n(For the remainder of this review, I will be discussing the plot, characters, and themes of the series, and there will be MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS after the break, including events from the finale episode. So, for all of you that haven't yet watched the series, I really encourage you to watch it now. If you still don't plan on it, I encourage you to read the rest of the review.)\\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n\r\nWhen I started this series, I had to admit that the characters were the weakest part of this story. The supporting and minor characters were all very well done and helped to create a rich environment, but the main characters weren't so fortunate. They were all likable, but you couldn't really deny that they were cliche, sprung from the regular anime archetypes and lacking the depth that I'd really want to see in this show.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Sora no Woto managed to subvert the standard cliches that befall this type of series. The characterization is archetypical -- that is undeniable. But the depth and development that these characters get is not. I attribute a lot of this success to the way the series structured its episodes. Like another currently airing series, Durarara!!, this show has character centric episodes. Episode 1 and 8 are Kanata, 2 and 9 are Kureha, 3 and 10 are Rio, 4 and 11 are Noel, 7 is Filicia, 5 is about the youngsters of our group developing a bond that will stick forever, 6 is about the town of Seize and its secrets, and 12 is about the very world itself. Now while the plot progresses from episode to episode, if you were to watch, say, episode 4 followed by episode 11, you would see all the pieces of Noel's character come together. The question she poses to Kanata in episode 4 regarding the tank and what evil could come of it now makes sense because she is looking to make up for the atrocities she made possible in the past.\\n\\n\r\nMore examples. Look at episode 2 and then 9. Kureha's speech about being self-sufficient, as well as that small flashback of her being powerfully embraced by Rio in 2 are given their background in 9. She needs to be independent because she is an orphan and grew up having to do everything herself, and lectures a little brat about it. She looks up to Filicia and Rio as her mother and father, respectively. Look at episode 3 and 10, where we see a young Rio looking up to Iliya, and how she avoids the townsfolk and tries to deal with thing herself. Now take episode 10, where her relationship and responsibilities as Iliya's sister are revealed, as well as the fact that she has been running away from them all her life. Episode 3 is titled \"Rio Runs.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe only character that doesn't really fall into this pattern is Kanata herself. But I think we can all see by now that Kanata is a little special. While Kureha constantly derides her, she also becomes her best friend. While Rio smirks at her naivety, she also wishes she were a bit like her. Noel is so out of it that she already considers Kanata someone to look up to, or at least sleep on. And Filicia of course, with her maturity veiled behind a decieving but honest smile, already knew all of this. Kanata is a fool by there standards. She hasn't gone through much hardship. She lived on farm, happily with both of her parents. She is a kid and she knows it. She wasn't forced to grow up quickly like the other four girls of this series. She is average is just about every way. And that is precisely why she changes her companions so much.\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason why this series succeeds is the sheer attention to detail that it bestows upon the characters and plot. In episode 7, when Filicia runs out of the room, Noel stops Rio to go after her herself, telling Rio that she is the only one that understands Filicia's trauma. Compare this to her later mental breakdown in episode 11. During Filicia's flashback to the war, we see the reflection of a giant, unholy wing in the mirrors of a high rise building. At the end of episode 7, when the girls are sending spirits down the river, Noel sends no one because their numbers are too many to count. (Wow, a lot of these happened in episode 7.) Episode 10 featured the story of a woman living alone, waiting for the man she loved to return to her. In any other series, this would have either been a filler stretched for the length of an episode, or shoehorned into a regular episode clumsily. But in Sora no Woto, it is brilliantly used as a foil for Rio's own feelings, and both stories are poetically resolved by the end of the twenty minute episode. I must applaud the director and the writers for the skillful execution of stories like these.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't just the characters. While you could say that the plot of this series was pretty simple in the present, the scope and amount of thought that went into detailing this world is immense. This series developed a beautiful mythology of its world, with concepts such as the angels, the fossil in the river, the ghosts in the abandoned school, the Takemikazuchi, the old era tanks and technology, the security system with Japanese characters out in the woods, No Man's Land, the Invisible Reaper, the political discourse going on in the capital, events of the war, and historical figures such as Princess Iliya, Desert Claus, the Demon of Vingt, and the Witch of Helvetia. Where did the fossil's head go? Were angels supernatural or extraterrestrial? Why is Japanese a forgotten language? With all this technology, why did the military use trumpets to communicate? Was it because of an A.I. virus or something else? The amount of history and cultural depth is awe-inspiring, and the open-endedness blurs the lines between science, fantasy, and reality. When combined with the beautiful visuals and emotion-filled music, it makes for a religious experience.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a lot of mysteries in this series, especially regarding the setting and what happened in the past. Those were the main reasons I couldn't wait to watch a new episode every week. This show didn't answer any of them. And by the end of the last episode, I didn't care.\\n\\n\r\n\"You have suffered enough.\"\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Sora no Woto is a story of redemption and the constant hum of Amazing Grace hammers that home. It is the story of a group of people who appear cute and harmless on the outside, but are quickly shown to be haunted by a past they can not escape. Much like the world they live in. And by the end of this series, they all come full circle. At the end of episode 11, I thought there was simply too much to be resolved. But sure enough, all of the threads that were left dangling throughout the course of the series were woven together into a beautiful fabric. And that was the real miracle of this series, not Kanata's trumpet-playing at the end.\\n\\n\r\nNoel wanted to be forgiven for the lives she took as the Witch of Helvetia, and she is, even moreso by a solidier of the nation she massacred. Kureha played the \"bad guy\" military realist all her life because she was an only child, despite having her entire family. Her mom was cheerfully aloof while dealing with her own problems in secret, her dad was the only girl she looked up to but she was long gone now, and her two sisters were both airheads, one having a reason for it and the other just being that way. And at the end, she breaks down, finally admitting that she doesn't want to be alone anymore. And she is embraced by her family, who were always standing with her the entire time. Filicia wants to put an end to war once and for all so that she is the last person that has to watch all her friends die before their very eyes, and she takes the first step in ensuring that future.  Rio avoided following in her sister's footsteps all her life, but in the end, she does what she must, having been inspired by Kanata and the rest of her new sisters. And the reward is far beyond anything she ever imagined. Kanata's goal of learning how to play the trumpet quickly becomes synonomous with saving the very world itself. And she does.\\n\\n\r\n\"Even if no one else forgives you, I will.\"\\n\\n\r\nAisha says these words to Noel in the finale. But after watching the whole series and taking a step back to soak it all in, I believe these words are referring to the world itself. The people of this world have experienced a very terrible thing: a war of unimaginable proportion, so widescale that nearly everything they held dear is now gone. The people of Seize try to move on with their lives, but they can't. The soldiers don't wish to fight, yet they still do. The reality is that no one has moved on. The peace talks are deteriorating. War is on the horizon despite how quiet the world has become. Because the people of this world have not forgiven themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of Sora no Woto was not a miracle. As Kanata has stated time and time again throughout the series: She is just a girl who wants to play the trumpet, to communicate people's thoughts through music. She is just the messenger. And as she plays her trumpet atop the Takemikazuchi, to the armies of both Helvetia and and the Holy Roman Empire, she is doing just that. All throughout the series, she is both complimented and condoned for her innocence. And yet in the end, it is because of her pure heart that she realizes the message first: she loves this world. As does everyone else, but they have forgotten. By tragedy, loss, heartbreak, and the false idea that they could move on without forgiving themselves, they have forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nA big reason why I love this show is because it reminds me of two series that I hold very dear: Haibane Renmei and The 08th M.S. Team. Both are series with heavy slice of life elements, yet manage to explore philosophical and war themes. After seeing the first episode, I knew that this series would start off as a happy-go-lucky slice of life but would eventually tread deep into darker territory. The opening sequence and the foreshadowing of the girls reliving the myth of the Fire Maidens made it even more likely. By around episode 4, I learned that this series was done by the director of Elfen Lied, at which point I had no doubt there would be a tragic ending.  I thought this series would have the world reunite against the revived angel, where war would return with numerous losses. Eventually, the five girls would have to make a tremendous sacrifice and end up becoming the very Maidens they looked up to. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Sora no Woto gave me an ending I never knew I wanted. It was humanity itself that was its own worst enemy. It fought a war, but at what cost? It was humanity that felt the guilt of the old ages, and it was humanity that was unable to find redemption. When Yumina began to retell the legend of Fire Maidens, it was an emotional experience. The moment I saw Aisha as the angel, I realized for the first time what this show was tring to accomplish. I knew it wasn't going to come back to the angel fossil or any of the other questions they raised, because they weren't important anymore. The girls do indeed make their own Odyssey-like epic and become like the Maidens of the legend but not like I thought they would. They weren't burned at the stake like the Maidens either -- humanity has become much more forgiving.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, Sora no Woto is the story of a girl who makes the world remember what they had all along: forgiveness. Whose message was it? I can't answer that question. Nevertheless, it was a sound in the sky, and it was heard by five girls who, after finding peace in their own redemption, take it upon themselves to share that message with the rest of the world. But maybe that's a miracle all by itself.",

            "content": "Five different girls in military and their lives. Interesting? Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t. This anime is a true example of what happens, if you try to do too much at once on the weak and uninspiring basis. \r\nSora no woto, aka \u2018Sound of the Sky\u2019 is a mixed culture setting war zone folktale involving a young girl who only came to military to play nice trumpet. If you just read the synopsis, it seems like a very unique and refreshing idea for slice of life genre anime. Sadly, it is not, because the major problem that this anime falls down is from the concept from thestart. When you think of slice of life genre, the most important thing is always consistency on everything. Theme, settings, plot, relevance, comedy, all these thing has to be in balanced and united by one main flow of atmosphere. Sora no woto ultimately fails to do that.\\n\\n\r\nThink about the setting of this anime first. There is a war and a town. Only soldiers there in that huge fat town are 5 females, three of them is not even capable of using the guns right. Trumpet is being used for the military communication, and yet they have extremely advanced tank we\u2019ve never seen in any animes. Mixed culture of Europe and Japan looks just awkward as it is. There are all sorts of mysteries arising, yet none of them is properly solved or introduced. Yes, this anime doesn\u2019t make sense of anything. My understanding of 'making sense' is completely different from Gurren Lagann pierce through the time adventure with galaxy sized robot, it's more about the relationship between its circumstance. Sora no woto always involves the paradoxical elements at the same times, and tries to tell two completely irrelevant lines of the story. I\u2019m just utterly surprised that this anime actually ended with this horribly introduced setting and backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no real plot we can call; it just portrays the life of 5 girls in military. It\u2019s basically a war zone, so it partially success on telling this story of blood and massacre that those disasters create (*Or not, perhaps. I'm just making this up). Some episode actually does make us to become a bit emotional. It was pretty nice. The problem is, it still doesn\u2019t make \u2018sense\u2019. The whole this creation of story looks like giant piece of junk art, chucked in random elements together in one; even Homer Simpson can make that kind of stinkers. I\u2019m seriously concerning about the ability of script writers for this anime. Conversations are very unintelligent and none of them is memorable. I mean, what the hack is all of those flat, cheap, overused and retarded jokes? I mean, they just don\u2019t work for me. From my theory, this happened due to indecisive nature of the staffs who\u2019s trying to make anime deep and emotional but funny and cheap at the same time. Anime clich\u00e9s with fanservices and terror of war just don\u2019t match; they are basically trying to something that is facing the complete opposite directions. It will never work. Those writers tried to do two things at once; they wanted war drama which will make some of emotional scenes that will cry people in a river, but at the same time, they wanted moe appeals, for financial issues. Well, if they had ability, they really could've used those services in 'appropriate' moment, then I will at least say 'oh well, they wrapped up war and moe nicely'. It doesn't. Some episodes were totally tainted by irrelevant use of moe fanservices, and these taints ruins the whole flow of the mood.\\n\\n\r\nNot just that; maybe the idea of war itself is actually the reason that Sora no Woto breaks apart. I\u2019m not saying war is such a bad theme or whatever. It is just overused way too much. *War is bad thing! I\u2019ll protect this village from that bad thing!*\u2026 seriously, everyone knows that. War is bad, and should be prevented whatsoever; and this anime tries to tell us about \u2018THAT\u2019. For 12 episodes long series, only thing it said is this one philosophical and complex phrase; \u2018WAR IS BAD\u2019, but nothing else excluding the pee joke. Shallow\u2026 way too much shallow\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nEpisode is very, very inconsistent. Some episodes are alright, trying to raise our hopes a bit more. Later, it crushes by terribly executed episodes that are absolutely pointless to put. When some scenes are well concerned, other parts are just utterly boring. It is sad that there are only a few \u2018truly\u2019 good scenes, but almost about 15 minutes per episode is just futile. With this shallow plot and setting, it can only do stretching itself out to fill the bottle of 25 minutes. Those filled materials are the main cause of this boredom, and occurred due to simplistic storyline. If they\u2019ve made some solid basis at the start, this never happened.\\n\\n\r\nThing I can praise on this anime is BG art. It was one of the most gorgeous looking scenes I\u2019ve seen in a while. It is breath-taking, and all those buildings, trees, lakes, cliffs, bridges form a perfect harmony, contrast what I\u2019ve seen in its story. I was utterly surprised about all the animation quality from this anime. CG tank (although it doesn\u2019t make sense) looks great and very well animated. OP animation had some beautiful and abstract art works. On the other hand, it might be just me, but I hate that character design so much. That\u2019s one of the major reasons why I hated K-On. This part of me is pretty much biased, so I will not count this part on the rating; amazing BG art covers all.\\n\\n\r\nSound is another astonishing thing; I just love classics and violins. A lot of them sounds greatly, although most of time, they are used in inappropriate time. OP is not bad; serious and calming although it was not that candy for me, but ED was seriously mismatching the theme of war. It was funny seeing this difference between opening, ending songs, since that\u2019s what they exactly did for the plot of the anime. OP = War drama!! ED = MOE MOE!!\\n\\n\r\nSadly, characters in this anime are the most stereotypical, and uninteresting ones I\u2019ve ever seen. I felt like being tortured watching all those crappy clich\u00e9 treatments. Starting with Katana, she joined military only to learn how to play trumpet. She is really bad at it, but in certain episode, she just miraculously learns how to play it perfectly, for some superficial reason. \u2018LOL SHII IZU SUCH A GENIUUSSU!!\u2019. Hell no, that\u2019s brainless on the side of production staffs. She is enthusiastic, cute and na\u00efve; so typical. There is nothing special or interesting thing about this character at all. \\n\\n\r\nNext, we have Kureha, tsundere. Actually, one of those annoying ones. She acts all over the place spreading her faggotry like \u2018Katana we are fuckin soldiers, it\u2019s a SERIOUS BUSINESS, don\u2019t play like weabooooz.\u2019 Yet, she can\u2019t even hold her gun tight. This is just another clich\u00e9d character, and we can expect nothing new from her. Same goes to silent moe Noel-chan and typical mother type glassed girl whose existence makes no sense. Only character I can say \u2018not that bad\u2019 is Rio; the only person there who in fact make sense being a soldier. She is cool and gets annoyed a lot for the \u2018proper\u2019 reason, such as Katana being empty-headed. She still has major bullshit things that make everything senseless, but better than all the other lowly characters. Ultimately, the character lacks some large amount of depth overall. Their reaction is so predictable due to the oversimplified personality. They are all clich\u00e9d and uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy watching this? Try to throw yourself into the trash-bin and swim; you will find it more enjoyable than this shit. It was more of pain; everything absolutely makes no sense, and is more of quasi-experiment without a single noticeable moments. I\u2019m just terribly disappointed how this gorgeous art and my favourite classical music background OST got wasted for this terrible series.\\n\\n\r\nSora no woto had a potential. So, I just blame production staffs and industrial crisis. Hurr durr.",

            "content": "Sora no Woto is a show that tries to do a lot at once. It isn't just a moeblobs show, and it's not just about fighting. It looks like a regular World War II setting at first, but as you continue to watch you learn it's actually a future setting, where life is scarce, systems of writing and music have been forgotten, and the resulting setting is a mashup of many, many cultures, probably at this point, indistinguishable from one another to the characters. \r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story lacks a forward direction. However, for that reason, as you begin to understand why things are going on,it makes it a much more enjoyable experience. As I mentioned above, if you're looking for a straight-out war show, look elsewhere. If you want to watch \"cute girls doing cute things in cute ways\", you may like Sora no Woto, though in recent episodes (6, 7) the story overall has taken a darker shade, as some of the truths around the 1121st platoon come to surface. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe animation of the characters themselves was a little unsavory in the very first episode. However, it has become smoother (or maybe I've just gotten used to it)... but the real beauty in this show is in the backgrounds. The setting itself is based off the city of Cuenca, Spain, a city built in a mountainous range, with a variety of steep cliffs and water. This is well represented in the show, where most of the backgrounds make you stop and watch them instead of the characters, if you happen to notice that kind of thing. That being said, make sure you watch this show in at least 720p. ;D\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThere's a wide variety of sounds in Sora no Woto, but the most noteworthy is the music. Not the background music - the music that comes from bugles, which is a focal point early on in the series. When the main character, Kanata, first begins to play the bugle, there's not much that can express the sounds that come out of that instrument. Myself being a trumpet player, I couldn't help but laugh the second I heard it, and once again laugh when Kanata suddenly vastly improves with one small piece of advice. In addition, the OP theme, by Kalafina (known for their work in the Kara no Kyoukai series) seems a little flavorless at first, but as the series progresses, it more closely resembles the overall feeling of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEverybody seems to think Sora no Woto takes the characters from K-On! and puts them in a different setting. Honestly, that's just wrong. While they do look similar, the characters in Sora no Woto have much, MUCH more depth to them than the K-On! cast. Each character shows many sides, straying away from static personalities, though to be fair, it does employ anime archetypes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nFrom beginning to end, each episode so far has been enjoyable, to where when it ends, I wonder, \"It's already over?\" This show keeps you guessing what's going to happen next, and why some of the small subtleties are how they are. At the very least, the animation staff did a decent bit of research, and they are putting forth an effort to keep things consistent across each episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI know, mathematically that's not the average of the scores. So far, though, this has been among the best shows this season, and with the production of bonus episodes, a manga, and a visual novel, odds are it's going to maintain the same high standard of quality throughout.",

            "content": "Well let's just clear some things up now. THIS IS NOT FREAKIN' K-ON IN THE FREAKIN MILITARY. All right, now that that's over with let's start with the review of The Sound of the Skies, aka So Ra No Wo To. (This will be a quick one since I wrote one before but it got deleted when my computer got the blue screen.)\r\nOkay so the story and the characters, even if they're pretty cliche, are actually quite good in their own right. The pacing is pretty good, characters are well developed and believable enough to not be Mary Sues. The voices also fit each andevery character very well.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound is amazing in their own right. The artstyle of the characters are very similar to K-ON's, but the backgrounds and backdrops are radically different. It's jaw-dropping. (Okay, not for me, but it's still very different.) It even gives 5 Centimeters per Second a rival.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is different than K-ON's, too. Rather the songs are moreso comparible to the Team ICO video game series. (There's ICO, Shadow of the Colossus, and The Last Guardian.) Basically, it has very well composed songs for the orchestra to play and it sometimes focuses on a single particular instrument throughout the anime. (It would be the trumpet in this show). So really, it's always a crowning music of awesome.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this anime a lot. It was well rounded and gave enough awesome moments to make up for the less than creative story and characters. Therefore, I give this rating a \"Kick-Ass\" for it's awesomeness.\\n\\n\r\nSo, you might still think that this relates to K-ON, (you know just like Skip Beat or White Album), and you are completely wrong. Only the artstyle and sharing of the music genre are the only things that are similar about it. The character animations are basically the same, but there's enough contrasts in The Sound of the Skies that make it immensly better anyways.\\n\\n\r\nI'll concede that both of the animes use music as a part of their themes. But K-ON's is more like \"Using music to save our club\" than The Sound of the Skies \"Using music to understand more about ourselves and the world\". So if anybody still tells you that the both of the animes are the same, then please don't believe them and let them know that they're jerkasses that only watch the first ten minutes of a show and make judgement upon them.\\n\\n\r\nAlso if you're wondering what the soundtrack's going to sound like then here (By the way, it's not from The Sound of the Skies but from ICO. This is just to get you prepared for what it's going to be similar to.): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DipbshLI8PA\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I hate my life",

            "content": "As always, there is a rare gem every season that pops up and surprises me.  It has been compared to as a K-On in the military but to me, I feel it would be more to suitable to describe it as Aria in the military though I digress.\r\nSora no Woto, is a deceptive little thing about what it really wants to be with the plot.  Young Sorami Kanata, a bugler and a private of the Helvetian army, arrives as the new meat of the 1121st, an all female tank crew/squadron.  Suffice to say, a slice of life romp ensues.  Albeit, itis one with slightly dark undertones here and there.  You'd almost forget about them until the masterstroke at the end arrives, heralding the end of the almost idyllic life of the Maidens of the Time-Telling Fortress.  But the end, comes almost too fast, yet still feeling it could have been resolved earlier.  Its a quick succession of events towards the end but it still manages to follow through to a satisfying conclusion.  Not perfect, but still very good.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it is outstanding.  The bright backgrounds and lighting really help make the setting feel alive.  All of Sora no Woto is beautifully animated, whether from the Takemicaduchi and myriad tanks in 3D to the expressive characters.  It helps that the quality doesn't suffer at any point either.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to go with this art, is also an outstanding sound department.  The background music really does this series justice, coming in just at the right time.  Supporting the scenes actively without being overbearing.  That is not to say the voice acting or the effects were poor.  They were indeed fitting but the props really have to go out background music.  That is not to say, actual music is not played.  As a signaller of the tank crew, our little heroine doles out a piece that has touched many hearts, hers included, before the story even started.  Another touching piece would be the French, I believe, insert song.  But now I'm just listing things.  Even so, I am still wishing to hear them outside of the anime in all their glory.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are as I've already mentioned, very expressive.  I really don't know what to say here.  I was just along for the ride as everyone told their own stories and talked more about themselves.  At the main characters did.  Though, special mention goes some of the minor characters as, Colonel Hopkins, or Major Krauss despite their limited appearances.  Heck, everyone is accounted for, even if they only say few lines.  Which is nice attention to detail.\\n\\n\r\nI love Sora no Woto, it cannot be said enough.  Simply because the world is so fascinating and colourful despite the actual backstory.  Most if not all the minor details I would have picked at are well done.  Though there are occasional slip ups, but that's because there so much detail.  The atmosphere traps me further in enjoyment the farther it goes but better still, there is a moral here if you looked for it.  Not that I'm one for such things but as always, I'd rather have you, the reader, find out for yourself.  This is something I recommend strongly as a must watch of the season.\\n",

            "content": "SPOILER-FREE\u2122\r\nThere are very few anime with as bad a case of mistaken identity as Sound of the Sky, also known as Sora no Woto or, if you\u2019re kind of a jerk, So Ra No Wo To. Honestly most people will take one look at the art and character designs and think one thing: K-ON\r\nAnd this is really a shame because other than a couple of similarities in character design, Sound of the Sky shines on its own with no relation under the surface to our favorite (or least favorite) slice of life. This issue has led to Sound of the Sky\u2019s problem, a nice wayto phrase it is to say it\u2019s a hidden gem, a less polite term would be \u201csold like cold cakes.\u201d Some skipped it thinking it would be moe SoL comedy #284, others were disappointed that it wasn\u2019t just that, the bottom line is it was not and still is not especially popular.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a tragedy that preconceptions blinded many people to the merits of Sound of the Sky. However, I wager most people who seriously watch it will be surprised. Sound of the Sky is truly special, there is no anime quite like it.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt isn\u2019t easy to pin one of our familiar anime genres to Sound of the Sky. I suppose the term \u201cslice of life\u201d wouldn\u2019t be entirely inaccurate, but it\u2019s not in a high school and the characters aren\u2019t\u2026ok actually they are cute girls. This does not mean Sound of the Sky is not story driven, in fact the plot helps carry the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound of the Sky is set in a post-apocalyptic world that has been partially rebuilt. It follows the soldiers of the 1121st platoon in the border town of Seize (Says). Despite being soldiers in a war, a country town like Seize doesn\u2019t see a whole lot of violent action. The story is more focused on the characters and their relationships to their world and each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is gorgeous: thematic without being pretentious, unrushed without being vacuous and passionate without being melodramatic. The series is deceptively deep with themes ranging from duty to desire, religion, war, hope, despair and love. The most important is finding a place in the world, something almost all the characters struggle with. In this anime, the world has already ended.\\n\\n\r\nBut due to greatly different attitudes, the characters react to this and other problems in vastly different ways. Some characters choose to resign themselves to the whims of fate and others face it head on. Their world does not want them, or even worse, wants them to fill a role they are very reluctant to do. The characters struggle to find meaning to a meaningless world, and watching them defy nihilism in such a position is marvelous. Although the plot shines, the true beauty of this story is less the plot and more the interactions of different attitudes and worldviews.\\n\\n\r\nThe story really picks up in the last few episodes building up to an incredible climax. The ending is both extremely tragic and filled with hope. Sound of the Sky is a little reminiscent of something like Haibane Renmei in the regard that it doesn\u2019t necessarily answer all the questions about the world, but still satisfies. There are a few details intentionally left open, but if anything this adds to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinally I want to offer my praise for this anime actually having a conclusion, something growing increasingly scarce. It is not unambiguously happy but the ending was by far my favorite part of the piece.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to sugarcoat it, Sound of the Sky doesn\u2019t exactly have all the budget in the world. But I don\u2019t mean to say that it\u2019s an ugly anime, quite the contrary: it\u2019s quite striking. Seize and the Time-Trumpeting Fort may not always be rendered in stunning detail, but they always look charming and attractive.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem is the character designs. I\u2019m not quite sure what A-1 was thinking when they decided to make them so reminiscent of moe anime, but it was a poor decision to say the least. Most of the anime may be \u201cslice of life\u201d but it hardly could be described simply as \u201ccute girls doing cute things.\u201d The magical story and characters are really quite undercut by this flaw.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs might be expected of an anime called \u201cSound of the Sky,\u201d the soundtrack is excellent. It contributes greatly to the mood and is punctuated by liberal use of silence that effectively adds to the focus. A recurring motif in the anime is the song Amazing Grace, one of the most beautiful songs ever written. In Sound of the Sky, it represents connection between people and is the focal point of some of the most emotional moments in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe phrase \u201cI love them, but I don\u2019t like them\u201d is pretty common among parents and marriages with a short future, but I can\u2019t imagine that it is especially popular for describing fictional characters. But when describing my feelings about the characters of Sound of the Sky, I think this phrase is quite appropriate. I really don\u2019t agree with many of the characters, their attitudes or their decisions, but I still found them some of the most compelling characters I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nKanata may look like your typical overly optimistic slice of life protagonist from the outside, and to be honest she does have a pretty chirpy personality. However there is a lot more depth to her than is first apparent. As the story kicks into high gear in the later part of the anime, we see that she is quite capable of acting serious and even rather assertive and aggressive, but not in a way that contrasts her established character.\\n\\n\r\nBut the one who really steals the show is Rio. In anime \u201ctragic\u201d is usually a synonym for \u201cedgy.\u201d The tragic hero of anime is more often a Dark Flame Master than an Oedipus. Rio is a tragic character with a backstory that doesn\u2019t strike at all of the ridiculous, and she has a believable reaction. She has to cope world that refuses to give her what she wants, and rather than sprouting superpowers to change that paradigm, she is forced to deal with it. And she deals with it like an adult, I may not agree with her decisions, but they strike me very much as the sort of decisions an actual human being might make. It\u2019s really a sad reflection on anime when that is such an incredible thing.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on about the other characters but I think I\u2019ve made my point: Sound of the Sky has some of the most compelling characters I have ever seen, and while it had a short run time, it fleshed them out beautifully with depth and realism.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound of the Sky does not appeal to everyone, and it doesn\u2019t try to. There is a little action, but it is overshadowed by slice of life and drama. If you\u2019re more the pre-teen melodrama fan then this may be a bit too subtle, and if you only like cute girls doing cute things then you may be put off by the somber tone. It isn\u2019t easy to pin down what kind of person would like Sound of the Sky because I can\u2019t make easy generalizations like \u201cif you liked X you will like this\u201d because there isn\u2019t really a parallel. It\u2019s a true hidden gem that I personally enjoyed and appreciated immensely, but I can\u2019t deny that there are aspects that would turn some people off.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nSound of the Sky is one of my favorite animes ever. It is beautiful, powerful and emotional in all the best ways. This anime hits hard and is something I have no reservations calling truly unique.\\n\\n\r\nPS: There are two specials that fit very well into the series, watch them at the same time.",

            "content": "An inclusion of naturalistic elements to an otherwise stale gimmick of \u201ccute girls in serious circumstances\u201d in an anime has been met with a mixed reception among both casual and serious anime fans. This being circumstances that involve a setting, or lore to be specific, that would not have needed to have any \u201cmoe\u201d components to make it even more or less meaningful. But we all know why this is the case: they want to appeal to what is popular, as it was popular considering this was made in 2010, and to cash in that would\u2019ve otherwise been ignored without it. Unfortunately, that cash grabis less than fruitful from how seemingly transparent these elements give off in these shows, and nowhere near is this evident than in Sora No Woto.\\n\\n\r\nTo get the gist of what Sora no Woto wants to show us with its extravagant array of colorful characters and artistic merit is how the setting is put into perspective. When you read the back story of the show\u2019s lore, you get the sense that the writer really had a unique vision when constructing it to facilitate the story. Making the setting and the story compelling, however, are separate issues; you have to have a story with telling while also making the world an imaginative wonderland. In Sora no Woto, it manages to set a nice tone to the setting with an elaborate background story, but in regards to its story, there is absolutely nothing to make that setting meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a slice-of-life anime, first and foremost. No story can really be found in one, for the most part. Because of this, there is a perplexing motive to be understood from a writer\u2019s perspective. Why tell an interesting lore, if your \u201cstory\u201d doesn\u2019t take advantage of that \u201clore\u201d? By this counter-intuitive realization, it makes Sora no Woto seem like a lifeless barren landscape that holds no meaningful qualities. These lack of qualities come to show how so much is out in the vast openness of the show\u2019s world, but the enclosed space where the main characters occupy is nonexistent.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is the space nonexistent? The characters that inhabit it are what make it that way. The only exception that doesn\u2019t make these cast of characters completely terrible is Kanata Sorami because of her charming presence. Other than her, there was hardly any reason for me to take these girls\u2019 own personal struggles with any strong conviction of sincerity. This problem can be surfaced by how so little the writers give any of these girls true distinctive, or unique, identities that made me think of them more than just Girl #1 , #2, or #3. Not to mention that the tropes that we see in countless cute girl ensemble anime aren\u2019t at the least bit engrossing by how little they try to make it at least entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of entertainment value, it would help to find the value of Sora no Woto more revealing if you, say, have insomnia to help guide you through this. Monotony is prevalent in most scenes that would otherwise feel as if they were not needed to be there to begin with. I can appreciate atmospheric inclusions in some scenes, but there is almost hardly any substance to any of the pointless scenes where the girls go off to some abandoned area at random. This comes out as negative due to how dull the writing comes off as, not to mention how I previously mentioned how the characters are mostly devoid of any life to their generic tropes.\\n\\n\r\nYou would think, judging from the poster and screenshots, that this is made by Kyoto Animation considering how it looks very similar to K-ON. But it is in fact drawn by the original character designer of K-ON, along with Kokoro Connect and Lucky Star, Yukiko Horiguchi. Rightfully so, the style of artistry to her characters always feels very expressive in any of the shows she is involved in. However, with that said, there is a slight aesthetic disconnect to her character designs and the general art of the environments. Everything in the world is this slight gritty wasteland, while you see these cute girls doing the typical cute girl schtick that severely distracts the main pull of the ambiance. Despite this big crux, both are independently done very well in giving some bit of ingenuity to the art.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as anime music shows go, there aren\u2019t as much in the way of musical endeavors go in Sora no Woto besides girls playing bugle horns every once in a while. But what music is there, it is quite soothing and fits the atmosphere well considering it gives a passable experience through all the dreary, monotonous scenes that take place.\\n\\n\r\nA fair bit of wasted potential can be made into a case with regards to Sora no Woto. It is one thing if you try to put forth a strong lore within a show, but with a genre like Slice-of-life, you need to at least give an effort to show more of it than just plainly explain it through monologue after monologue. Even without monologues, there is never a sense of an accomplishment because of how dry the pacing comes across. While not at all a \u201cbad\u201d anime by any means, there are at least a few elements, such as the art/animation and musical arrangements. Best advice is to not watch this laying down in bed; otherwise your eyes will start to flutter until you start collapsing out of sheer apathy.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: C-\\n",

            "content": "Sora no Woto strongly adheres to a personal saying of mine: \"You never know what you're going to get with short animes\". I've watched some truly brilliant shows that were only 11-12 episodes long...and I've also watched some that weren't so good. Sora no Woto was one of those that I wasn't sure about, partially because it could almost be considered an OVA, a collaborative effort of several different studios that had never before been produced in manga, graphic novel, nor any other medium that I was familiar with. However, I found in the end that this show requires some patience before it's true colorsreally begin to show. And they were truly some beautiful colors.\\n\\n\r\nBreakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory (4/10): I should begin by explaining that the story isn't the strong point of this show. The reason for this is how long it takes for the story to develop into anything with real plot substance.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning of the show is done well enough. We see the main character, and are quickly charmed by her kindness and innocence, and see that she has  become a soldier, and is headed to her first deployment. The problem is, we aren't given very much exposition to explain the world she lives in, why her country is at war, or what her family or her home are like.\\n\\n\r\nAs other characters are introduced, we begin to understand the dynamic that they share. As I learned more about the characters, I thought that perhaps this show would be more \"character-driven\" rather than \"plot-driven\". However, this wasn't really the case either, as the characters don't seem to go through much change early on. They simply have small \"adventure\" each episode, that doesn't require much prior knowledge of the show, and leaves the characters more or less the same as when the episode started.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, seeing as the main cast is composed of soldiers, I thought that they would do more...well, soldier things. All the soldiers where the protagonist ends up are women like her, but they don't really have a whole lot of militaristic duties. They rarely go on patrols or even fire their weapons, for that matter. Ultimately, not much is done with the soldier aspect until the very end, and the rest of the time, these women could be an ordinary group of people who just happen to live in the same outpost. This is why I had a problem with the episodic nature of the show, because it rarely felt like anything of consequence was happening, despite the fact that I was watching a group of soldiers.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose there's nothing technically \"wrong\" with having an \"episodic\" feel to a show, where there isn't much overall plot to connect the episodes. However, it's certainly not what I prefer. I personally like to see a strong plot that connects the episodes together, or even having the way the characters interact with one another to create drama and tension. I just didn't feel either of these things with Sora no Woto, which is why I rated the plot so low.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the show doesn't stay this way the entire time. Toward the end of the show, there is a very nice span of two or three episodes where some very big events occur, and I was genuinely excited by what happened. I only wish that more of the show had been so plot driven, and had shown the storytelling prowess that the final episodes did.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10) - This show was really quite beautiful to watch. No details were skimmed over, even in the background details. Mile after mile of gorgeous countryside was carefully painted into each frame, making it worthwhile to watch the background nearly as much as the characters. There were some pieces that were animated by CGI, which I didn't find as pleasant as the hand-drawn details, but I suppose machines an be very hard to do by hand. This is probably the show's strongest point, which makes me sad in some ways, since art has noticeably less to do with what makes a show good than many of its other aspects.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)- Music is a large part of what drives this show, as the tune from \"Amazing Grace\" often fills the sky. I really enjoyed hearing this piece as it was played on the trumpet, and even in a full orchestration later on. The soundtrack overall was quite good, and I found it interesting that Amazing Grace was so integral to the story. Sora no Woto does mean \"Sound of the Sky\", which very well may refer to that familiar tune that so many people love.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5/10)- As I mentioned before, there isn't much background given of the protagonist early on. And frankly, we never really learn much about her at all. The main problem I had with the characters was that we learn more about a \"supporting\" character than the main character. All we know about the protagonist is that she wants to learn to play the trumpet, and that's why she joined the army. We learn more about the background of basically every character than the protagonist, who remains a charming and very lovable, but ultimately very shallow character.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps what really made her seem shallow was her apparent lack of any sort of character flaw. She is completely selfless, thinking of others before herself, works hard, is completely loyal to her fellow soldiers, and never says anything unkind to anyone. This is all wonderful, but we never see what lies inside her heart. Is she only nice to cover up something tragic that happened to her? Is her loyalty due to the fact that she felt she betrayed someone in the past? The show never really attempts to answer these questions.\\n\\n\r\nThe show gives plenty of development to a supporting character that I mentioned previously, which makes it seems as though she should have been the protagonist instead. The cast is ultimately very likable, but their development is rather unbalanced, and we will ultimately learn things about them at the last second so that we can understand something. The creators caught themselves a few times, and had to have a character suddenly say \"Oh, by the way, there's this really important thing about this other character's past that we forgot to mention until now, so here it is.\"\\n\\n\r\nNot a bad cast, just one that was mishandled.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10)- I had to force my way through one or two episodes where nothing really happened in the overall plot. Charming and fun only works for so long before someone like me will get curious about the plot, and this show seemed to forget about the plot until nearly the end. If it weren't for the mismanaged characters and lack of plot, this show could have been a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nRemember how I said that it shows some truly beautiful colors at the end? Well, it does, but not until I had to sit through ten episodes of basically nothing. The end of the show was wonderful, emotionally moving, and brought a very satisfying conclusion to everything. It just wasn't enough to make up for early problems that hurt the overall enjoyment value.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)- Ultimately, this show is worth watching, but only with realistic expectations. It's a lot of fun to watch at first, gets boring in the middle, but does end on a high note. Just don't go into this one expecting anything mind-blowing.",

            "content": "I was recommended this show by a friend who has traveled much further down the moe rabbit hole than I have, so I went in with two basic assumptions: this isn't a show about war, and it's not about life in a post-apocalyptic world. While I think these were safe assumptions, I ended up being very wrong.\r\nThis is a show about cute girls doing cute things. It's also a show about those same girls reliving war trauma and debating whether they should torture war captives in the remains of a world still being destroyed by humanity. That uneasy coexistence is part of the beauty ofSo Ra No Wo To, allowing it to go beyond being just another genre show. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the initial appeal of this show came from the idea of 'playing' with war, sort of the same way Ro-Kyu-Bu! 'plays' with basketball - taking a very 'masculine' and serious activity and making it cute. But sort of like Ro-Kyu-Bu!, the cuteness provides an entry point to a pretty substantial (if very different) story. There's still a lot of 'fluff' here - not filler, but enough touching character interactions and cute for the sake of cute that if you're not patient or into it to begin with you'll probably be drifting away from the series (and off to sleep) before you're too far in. But there is a point at which the brutal conflict and dying world intrude upon the precious way of life these characters have built - this isn't where the show 'gets good', but rather, you realize that all the sweetness of the initial episodes is in fact a fragile and embattled alternative to the ugliness of war, where those who have experienced and committed horrors can recover in a world that was denied to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe more general messages of 'peace' and 'common humanity' can feel heavy-handed at times, especially towards the end, sort of like a beautiful melody played a bit too loudly if not off-key. The main character suffers from a bit of the same, her spirited naivete sometimes tending towards typical moe blob problems, but overall the series creates characters that are charming while also being complicated in ways you don't often see in these sorts of shows.\\n\\n\r\nGreat art, incredibly catchy ED - this show far exceeded expectations, and I'd highly recommend it as a wonderful piece that's tended to get overlooked.",

            "content": "Sora no Woto is a beautiful and triumphant tale of humanity, morality, war, and peace. One of the best animes to come out in recent years, and possibly of all time. It\u2019s certainly one of the best I have ever seen. \r\nSora no Woto, or Sound of the Sky in English, is a 2010 war anime. War is this title\u2019s main theme, but a viewer will find many other genres in this amazing title, including themes of yuri, GAR, moe, humor, psychological drama and horror, mecha, religion, mild fanservice and much more. Sora no Woto brings so much to the table, and what it bringsis definitley worth seeing. \\n\\n\r\nSome may compare the art-style and character designs to that of K-ON! Well, I must admit: Kanata Sorami, the main character of Sora no Woto, does look an awful lot like Yui Hirasawa, the main character from K-ON! Because of this \u201cmoe\u201d style, the characters in Sora no Woto are often kawaii and cute, even to the point of sometimes being \u201cderpy.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThe show also deals with many controversial issues, such as the moral implications of an army using female child soldiers, the perils of underage drinking, and the absence of morality in war. Underneath many of Sora no Woto's seemingly innocent and light-hearted scenes lie some of mankind's darkest impulses. Sora no Woto is a great title in the fact that it can be at once both funny and horrifying. \\n\\n\r\nSora no Woto is a sleeper hit of true creativity and deep story-telling in an industry that is, for better or worse, saturated with light-hearted \u201cmoe\u201d titles. Unfortunately, the fans prefer the latter. I'm all for silly, non-sensical moe stuff from time to time, but serious works of art like Sora no Woto are needed to break up the monotony and add some variety to things. I feel a little offended that this stupendous title isn\u2019t more well-known or discussed in anime circles. But I guess that would just be a popularity contest. Yet if Sora no Woto was more popular, that would be great because more people would be aware of this great show, and be able to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nOnly then can they realize that these moments are the future\u2026\\n\\n",

            "content": "So Ra No Wo To is an original anime brought to us by A-1 Pictures. Yes, the studio behind Kuroshitsuji, Uchuu Kyoudai, Sword Art Online & Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin is back. Or, more accurately, I'm looking at one of their works again. Thus far, my experience with them as a studio has varied a lot. With Uchuu Kyoudai being at the high end and Sword Art Online on the low, because it's shit. This particular series is from 2010 and was relatively early in terms of their productions. It was written by Yoshino Hiroyuki, speaking of people I have mixed experiences with. Yeah, thisbloke also wrote Shuumatsu no Izetta, which was a great series and Dance in the Vampire Bund, which will always be remembered as utter rubbish. So, this one is a gamble. I'd give it about 50-50 odds.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nIn the far distant future, humanity seems to be running out of habitable land (now we know how all those species we've fucked over to build cities feel) and a lot of old technology has been lost. It's in this future that the country of Helvetia and the new Roman Empire are on the brink of war. We follow a young garrison on the border of No Man's land as they mostly faff about.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real criticism I have about the narrative is that the build up to the climax could have been handled better. It's largely relegated to the last few episodes with small bit beforehand that give very small hints and we're talking very basic like Rio's identity being obvious by the time she plays her role or the threat of war being omnipresent throughout.\\n\\n\r\nI do really like the way the series mixes a kind of standard slice of life style with the whole war scenario (Sort of like how he melded cutesy yuri romance with a war scenario in Izetta). It allows it to have that sense of fun and enjoyment while also leaving room for more serious, dramatic stuff and it never feels dissonant. The world building is really interesting and executed in a fully organic way. We don't just know the broad stroke details, we know very trivial everyday things like how life in Kanata's little village differs from life in the city of Seize (I know, not a subtle city name) because of geographical variations within the same nation. Which is a fascinating detail. The series has a good sense of humour as well. Filicia's way of confirming whether or not their visitor speaks their language is hilarious but it also makes sense. The whole episode where they all get pissed, save one, is really funny. There are good dramatic scenes too. No\u00ebl & Filicia both have some real tragedy to their back stories. Rio & Kureha have some as well but Kureha's plays less of a role and Rio's is kept a bit vague because they don't want to show the actual details and spoil the climax. Then we have the epic Amazing Grace scene. Those are words I never thought I'd string together, but it's a part of the climax and it's a superb scene. It's also interesting the way Helvetia and the Roman Empire have similar legends, but different takes on them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI quite like the cast in this series. They have enough complexity to carry the more dramatic scenes as well as enough quirkiness to make the humour strong. Which is something Gintama couldn't manage with over fourteen times the number of episodes. This is only a fourteen episode series and that's counting the two special episodes. I also appreciate the way the series connects the characters through most of the main cast having formative meetings with a certain person of note. He fleshes out their back stories enough to give them a sense of completion while also building up their dynamics with one another. Those dynamics are very nice too.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is well done. It moves smoothly and just generally does a good job at holding any given tone. I love some of the mechanical designs, especially the old tank that No\u00ebl spends a good portion of the series working on. I appreciate that the girls are given proper uniforms instead of going full GI Joe solely for the sake of having variety. But, in all fairness, GI Joe has a bunch of similar looking characters while this has characters with distinctive appearances.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nOur major characters are voiced by Yuuki Aoi, Kanemoto Hisako, Kobayashi Yuu, Endou Aya & Kitamura Eri. They're all absolutely fantastic. The side characters have good acting as well with the talents of Fukuen Misato, Yasokawa Mayuno, Ishizuka Unshou (don't be surprised if he asks whether you're a boy or girl) and others. Oshima Michiru's sound track is fantastic. Even the Amazing Grace motif and I'm saying that as someone who doesn't generally like that song.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a fair amount. This is one of those series where all the girls seem interested in one another. It's especially true at the point where they talk about their dreams. I don't want to spoil anything too specific since that episode takes place after the climax, but putting it in vague terms, one girl wants to be a bride. And I'm fairly certain she wants to marry the other girl she's been writing to, based on their dynamic and interactions. Another girl wants to stay with yet another female character forever and her expression along with the flush on her face when she says it indicates that she's thinking of tribadism and cunning linguistics. Plus the two of them are incredibly homo-erotic throughout.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nHow the hell did Yoshino write this, then write something as bad as Dance in the Vampire Bund directly after? Because this is a fantastic anime. Virtually everything about it works and works really well whereas that's practically the opposite. Is Yoshino actually twin brothers who take turns turning in what they've been working on with one being a complete knob and the other skilled? Does he lose all writing ability when exposed to indigo kryptonite? Is the studio working with both him and his goatee sporting counterpart from an evil opposite universe? Is it just\u00a0 that he was doing his best to adapt a really shit manga? Whatever the case, I'll give this series a 9/10. Next week, Fortune Quest: Yo ni mo Shiawase na Boukensha-tachi.",

            "content": "Cobbled streets, glass-faced shops, wooden chimneys, and wood-aged frames. Coupled with a tower vista and an annual festival, it's the ideal destination for a charming trip down Europe's Old World. Like time froze to pressure this place's quaint character. It's quite the reverse, though. This is as far as the technology has advanced... scratch that, regressed. This land is one of the few places on Earth that is still arable. Still habitable. Nothing but wasteland lays beyond, and it spreads, festers, an eternal reminder of past wars, even in present peace. The weapons nowadays aren't sticks and stones, mind you, but compared to today's standards,it's certainly antiquated and... somewhat anachronistic? Early to mid-19th century arms, spider tanks, walking armor, and trumpets.\\n\\n\r\nOriginally featured on the opening debut of \u201cAnime no Chikara,\u201d or the \u201cPower of Anime,\u201d a TV block dedicated to the creation of original Japanese animated series, Sound of the Sky was scripted by Hiroyuki Yoshino and directed by Mamoru Kanbe. Produced by A-1 Pictures, who has done other works such as Anohana, Working!!, Blue Exorcist, and Sword Art Online, we follow the daily dealings of the 4 female members of the 1121st Platoon of the Helvetian Army. Initially appearing as stock anime stereotypes, each main cast member is fleshed out, the backstories behind their behaviors fleshed out, one episode at the time. With each episode, a common denominator between them is discovered. Their lives have been defined by war. One is an orphan. Another is a valuable political asset. Still another is haunted by the horrors she unwittingly endured. Last is one haunted by the horrors she unwittingly committed. And then, we have the Platoon's newest recruit, Konata Sorami, an optimistic adolescent who volunteered for free bugle lessons. In the absence of functional radios, bugles have that advantage of being loud and distinct enough to offer some semblance of communication and coordination amidst whatever shit is raining from the sky or zipping past the ground, though that's hardly the reason she signed up for the task. Nor is it simply a matter of wanting lessons just because.\\n\\n\r\nSound of the Sky has a fantastic world setting. It's not very often a show incorporate the presence of different cultures interacting with each other, and more often than not, these cultures are usually organized into their own separate national entities and seldom have different speech. It's something else that this show is able to incorporate cultural identities both without and within state boundaries, pluralistic societies, in other words, and enrich it with it's own meticulously crafted folklore, religions, and customs, like something out of a Miyazaki film. I was particularly impressed with the use of different accents when the reality of different languages came up. Combined with the various festivals illustrated and mentioned throughout this show's going, it adds this sense of authenticity as well as immersion and scale. And yet they have commonalities between them, suggesting shared histories as well as demonstrating cultural biases, accentuated by geographic barriers, past fighting, and inflammatory propaganda. Many share similar mythologies on certain phenomenon, like the one presented in Episode 1. Many share similar values, a love for their homes and a disdain for unnecessary bloodshed. Many share similar sentiments toward one particular tune.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d by John Newton and William Cowper, and rearranged by Michiru Oshima, is the most defining piece played throughout the show, by the characters themselves as well as by the OST. Despite its roots as a religious hymn, there's a reason it has transcended to become the most universally recognized and lauded song throughout space and time. It's a captivating melody, the brass a capella of the trumpet, followed by the string cantata of the orchestra, to be sure, but what makes it inspiring is its message, a message that characterizes Sound of the Sky as a whole. That while there's still beauty in this world... that there's still hope. Hope despite the blasted landscapes. Hope despite the battered limbs. Hope despite the scarred psyches.  The show wouldn't be the same without it. Still beautiful to listen to is the OP, \u201cHikari no Senritsu\u201d or \u201cMelody of Light\u201d by Yuki Kajiura's Kalafina, whose lyrics, when sung by the combined passion of melody and harmony, reinforce this prevalent theme, to the point where the OP's climax, feels like a call to prayer. The flute gives way to classic guitar, cymbals, and xylophone that complement the voices, soon transitioning, transcending to chords of electric guitar and clangs of drum set that contribute a radiating sense of power. The visuals, depicting portrayals of the girls doing sedentary farming and closed-eyed reflection, courtesy of Kanbe, who also had a major hand in designing Elfen Lied's OP \u201cLilium,\u201d are inspired from the works of the Austrian symbolist painter, Gustav Klimt. ED, \u201cGirls be Ambitious\u201d by Haruka Tomatsu is, more or less, your uppity J-Pop single, reflecting, from the sounds to the looks, the show's slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the show has its issues with that aspect. On the one hand, it's a war fallout narrative. On the other, it's a slice of life. It's not as though these two different genres are mutually exclusive from each other.  After all, many a war's consist of mainly of small part's adrenaline and large part's tedium. Soldiers have lulls of at least informal leave out of their trenches or, if that isn't possible, in them. At times, it's a serious evaluation of war's toll on both places and people, both on the battlefield and beyond it. Depending on the tides of war, non-combatants can escape nearly unaffected. At others, it's cute girls doing cute things with military garb. It's like something out of K-On, and it doesn't help that the character facial models are indistinguishable from the other. The expressions these textures allow can come off to be emotive. They can also come off as distracting. If you're going to handle a subject as heavy as war's consequences, it must be handled with gravity. That isn't to say the show doesn't take itself lightly at times. For instance, Episode 7 deals with PTSD. Episode 8 deals with a juvenile-to-borderline fetish involving pee. In addition, it's often layered with a lot of subtlety. I love subtlety. But sometimes, I think it's too subtle for its own good, to the point I feel like I'm grasping straws. \\n\\n\r\nIn spite of its efforts come off as mature, it plays what is effectively its moe factor way too much to come off many a time as anything but. Though to what details that it does take itself seriously in, the staff behind this show can take some pride.\\n\\n\r\nI give Sound of the Sky a 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "When I was young and ignorant, I often cried a lot. Give me this, give me that, I didn't care - I wanted it now. My parent's go-to strategy? Hum.......\"Amazing grace, how sweet, the sound, that saved, the wretch, like me....\" Instantly, I would sleep. There's something magical, or, for a lack of a better word, penetrating about that song. It strikes right through your heart, uplifting your spirit and calming your soul. Sora no Woto evolves and becomes something truly wonderful with a powerful, underlying theme.\r\nThe story is wonderful; it starts off slice-of-lifey and really slow and painful, especially for the people who wanta grandiose story and perfect mood/tone. However, stick through the first half a dozen episodes, and you slowly fall in love with the characters. Throughout the beginning, there is an undertone of dread and mixed optimism, a bittersweet tang in the back of your mouth so to speak. The little hints and clues slowly build a bigger picture that encompasses the main story, eventually interfering with their perfect lives. I don't want to spoil anything because trust me, it gets pretty intense and riveting. I become to sympathise with the characters, their plight, their endless struggle against an unkind and unloving world. And throughout it all, there was the ominous, foreboding military. The overall theme is magnificent - it portrays a common struggle humanity constantly is at war with: aggression and ultimately, love.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is dazzling and spectacular. There's this cheery sort colors that blend with the moods of the characters. During the happy parts, the colors appeared lush and bright. The depressing or gloomy or grim moods brought storms, dark clouds, and other drab colors. There were vast mountain vistas and grand scenes of nature and of a quaint town. The setting depicted 18th century Europe accurately, with a technological quirk here and there. Everything was drawn to exact detail; the cobblestone streets, the distant snow on the mountains, the old vehicles - I almost felt like I was there.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the fact that Amazing Grace is one of my favorite songs, the sound continually surprised me. The trumpet sound was clean and pristine, reflecting the beautiful sceneries. The panoramic views and sound melded together perfectly. The OP was a foreshadowing of an important event; the ED was happy and go-lucky, as if to say, \"Phew, it's over.\" I listened to both, and ended up loving both. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were your typical cast of a slice-of-life - the tsundere, the carefree one, the authoritative one. In the general slice-of-life, there isn't a character arc; however, here there were major changes in personalities and attitudes. Dark secrets were revealed, and pasts were uncovered beneath once impenetrable outer masks. The characters themselves were standard only for the first couple episodes; once they dug deep, truths were uncovered that changed their perceptions about each other for a long time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed it thoroughly, much more than I originally thought. I loved the story progression and epic conclusion and little things both big and small. Though it may seem too happy-go-lucky for the first episodes, the dark nature and underlying tone eventually force their way to the surface, and prepare for a bumpy ride. Through music, a simple song can calm all.",

            "content": "Sora no Woto could be described as slice of life meets post-apocalyptic. This sounds like a bit of an unlikely combination, which I suppose it is. How about putting it like this: it's a show about how a bunch of relatively normal people live their everyday lives while having to deal with a world that's been ravaged by war, and how they cope with past losses and manage to find something to smile about in the present.\r\nThe first two episodes were a little shaky for me, but once they got the stuff like Kureha's Obligatory Tsundere Moment out of the way, each episode just gotbetter than the last. The slice of life tradition of finding something extraordinary in the everyday is made especially poignant by the post-apocalyptic backdrop. You watch all these little revelations and miniature adventures and you laugh and smile and then remember that this is a world where dolphins no longer exist, where nobody knows how to work a radio, where there are not enough children left in town to fill the old school building.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Sora no Woto does not spare the viewer from the harsh realities of its universe. Yes, most of the episodes are lighthearted, but the show never shies away from mentioning the darker facts, including plenty of dead parents, the completely desolate no-man's land, and some particularly chilling war flashbacks. And again, it's the dark that makes the light glow all the brighter.\\n\\n\r\nOne final general thing I think is worth mentioning is that I love the storytelling style. This anime never assumes the viewer is stupid when revealing plot points. It's all a matter of giving just enough hints that it's obvious, but never wasting time by saying, \"Yes, here's what actually happened.\" This applied in particular to episode 10, which has in my opinion been the best episode so far (like I said, they get better, though 7 and 10 are definitely peaks), where the plot reveals were simply a matter of confirming previous hints, and instead the impact of the episode was devoted to character interactions and development.\\n\\n\r\nMAL has given me categories to assign numbers to but I'm not huge on number ratings so I'll just write a quick sentence or two about each:\\n\\n\r\nStory: mostly slice-of-life episodic, but with a gradually building backstory that's currently coming to its climax. The episodic plots are quite enjoyable as well, if you're into the slice-of-life stuff.\\n\\n\r\nArt: people always say the characters look like K-On!. Fair enough. Don't expect the anime to be like K-On! however. Background art is beautiful in that tragic way post-apocalyptic scenery is.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I'm sure everyone and their mother has said this, but the music is great. The ending theme can cause some major emotional dissonance for the more serious episodes, however.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: as much as I've grown to love them I have to admit they're a bit cookie-cutter. There's plenty of development and backstory reveals throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: hopefully from the review it was obvious that I'm loving this. Your mileage may vary, but I'm really feeling the emotional connection here.",

            "content": "Firstly, just to clarify, I am a casual anime watcher. I have up to this point watched only about four anime and don't necessarily care about deep storyline and characters, basically all I care about is enjoying it. And while I understand that somebody like me shouldn't really review shows, considering I don't have much to compare them to, I believe I can still tell, whether I've had a good time watching a show or not. And that's exactly what this is about. If you came for spiritual ascendancy or mindblowingly deep processes, this anime probably isn't going to be too enjoyable to you.\r\nHaving thatclarified, we can move on.\\n\r\nSo, the show. Basically what it's about is the coexistence of Kanata (protagonist), No\u00ebl (shy girl), Rio (cool leader), Kureha (tsundere) and Filicia (platoon captain). I'll soon go into the detailed explanation of the characters, but let me firstly cllarify where the story's taking place. In a very special version of post-apocalyptic Earth (mix of Japanese and European cultures) have nations formed again, and Kanata belongs to Helvetia, where she joins the army (to learn how to play the bugle) and is assigned to the 1121st platoon to protect the town of Seize. There she meets the other four girls in her squad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSome might complain the characters are one-dimensional and unoriginal, I've however enjoyed them as you can't find extremes in reality. Also while all of the major characters are women - which could be taken controversially, mainly as the story revolves around the military and army - I like the decision, as men in main roles are usually just kind of boring and bland, maybe too complex, and the decision of using girls just makes it feel more like a happy time without any big conflicts and slow paced sections.\\n\\n\r\n-Kanata - Incredibly energetic, moe AF and the kind of childish character that we all like and find in every second anime show. While the trait is overused a lot, I still didn't feel like she was just a bland, unoriginal character in there to provide \"cuteness\" and feeling of energy into the show. She is shown to have a decently well made history and I kind of like how she just joins the army for to me an extremely minor reason - learn to play the bugle. It nicely empathizes her character in a way.\\n\\n\r\n-No\u00ebl - A rather more serious character, basically the opposite of Kanata - although first shown as sleeping, she isn't a lazy character (as also seen in every second show), but rather a technically educated individual with shy traits. She spends a lot of time repairing the Takemikazuchi - an ancient disassembled tank their platoon was assigned. To me she was one of the most sympathetic characters with also a well made background on how she used her knowledge.\\n\\n\r\n-Kureha - a tsundere-type, often complains that No\u00ebl and Kanata don't take their work seriously and don't act like soldiers. To me probably one of the weaker characters, as I don't remember her background ever being mentioned and she just isn't too fun, on the other side, she's more believable then No\u00ebl or Kanata.\\n\\n\r\n-Rio  - Described as the cool girl hanging out with FIlicia, she is a character most of the others look up to. Teaches Kanata how to play the bugle and keeps the team together, fights for them if necessary.\\n\\n\r\n-Filicia - A rather passive character, doesn't do much, but she leads the platoon and is very often through camera angles shown to quickly change expression from a troubled one to happy and polite when speaking to Kanata or Kureha.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fairly nicely made, just like the soundtrack, I actually kind of like the combination of European/Japanese culture or at least the European culture as percieved by the japanese.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest point to me as mentioned before made the enjoyment of the show.\\n\r\nI absolutely loved how set back it was, just the five of them enjoying their time with their extremely outstretched personalities. Kanata being just moe and energetic all the time, No\u00ebl a bit antisocial, frank and repeatedly showing how much knowledge she has. Kureha getting mad for No\u00ebl and Kanata being laid back, them not following the army protocol like addressing them by their ranks etc. Rio had her own business to attend to, yet she found herself some time to be an example to the others and Filicia dissimulating her thoughts and problems.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end [a minor spoiler alert]\\n\r\nThe roman soldier spoke german, and as I can speak german pretty decently myself (not native speaker though) I could pretty much understand what the roman soldier said, even though her accent was way too exaggerated, but had difficulties understanding Yumina due to her heavy japanese accent. Still find it funny though.",

            "content": "Everybody has that one show that really REALLY gets them interested in the wider world of whatever medium that show is linked to. Before this one in particular, anime was something that just existed to me, all anime was just edgier cartoons when I was growing up. I watched series like Dragon Ball and Yu Yu Hakusho thinking they were everything anime was. I was a dumb kid and all that mattered to me was the spectacle, but on whim, the series in question brought me to understand a lot more about myself then I thought I did.\r\nAs a young man at the time, Iwas pretty hard to impress and mostly went into anything not expecting much of value. I was not one for subtlety and quietness or even anything requiring much thought. However, almost immediately, the atmosphere of it all grabbed me by the balls. I like war stories, always have, that was the main draw to it.\\n\\n\r\nEverything about it I couldn't help but love, even if the cute girls doin shit aspect was a concern of mine. Ultimately, it led me to appreciate the quietness in storytelling, as well as change my views completely on how I feel about art in the grand scheme of things. As cliche as it sounds, it literally did change my life. I definitely would not have the same mindset and values without it. Sound of the Sky was the groundwork on how I would grow as an individual, and the things I would come to appreciate about life in general.\\n\\n\r\nBut all this praise comes from a feeling of respect for it. I'm not afraid to view it at face value, it is a cute girls do things series, and to be honest, it's probably not for most people who are looking for something with more.... to find I suppose. Not that there isn't anything of substance, its just not the most fast paced show, and it probably won't have anything of substance for most people like it did for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe point is that if this is the kind of thing your looking for, I would recommend it. If not however, there might be something else for you in it, and if not that? Then you could skip it if you want.",

            "content": "After watching this anime, I really can't help as to wonder as to what is the main theme of this thing; is it the female cahracters struggling to find a way to ease their boredom co'z they're assigned in some outpost which is too far away from any action  or is it the bugle call \"AMAZING GRACE?\" So, how do I rate this anime? Here's how:\r\nStory: Fair 6.\r\n Ok, so the genre of this anime are the following: Military, Shonen, Sci-fi, Musical, Action (appred only in the last 2 episodes) and Comedy (just a little bit). However amongst the genre only the musical partis most prevelent pertaining to Kanata's bugel calls, everything else are trivial and a mediocre  of \"Make love not war\" kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Poor poor 3.\\n\r\nQuestion: what the heck was the artist thinking when he or she got inspiration to don the Helvetia soldiers (feamle charcters inculded) in a Nazi style uniform, which by the way inculdes the utility vehicles and the guns that they use except the tanks, also the Roman soldiers were donned with a wrong kind of uniform, in reality, during WW2 the Italian (Roman) army donned an Olive Gray uniform and not the typical WW2 Soviet Style uniform, frankly everythings that were drawn were composed bits and pieces of something during WW2 that the artist of this anime seem to based it from ..  \\n\\n\r\nSound: Dreadful 2.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're talking about the opening theme, I hate it.\\n\r\nIf you're talking about the various bugel calls inculding the \"Amazing Grace,\" I say it's a bit of a Sacrilege (pataining to the \"Amazing Grace\") to even make it part of the anime. The said bugel call is reserve only to a solidier, fireman or any member of the law enforcement unit who died in the line of duty. There is a diffrent bugel call which is used to call for a truce, and I'm surprise that the author of this anime doesn't know it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not unusual for a female soildier to be regulated for guard duty or any non-combat duty. So, if the setting is in some European country then all charcters should sport european names, particulary in German, unfortunatly most of the charcters still have Japanese names like: Kanata Sorami, Rio Kazumiya, Kureha Suminoya and Noel Kannagi. On the other hand, the supporting character Aisha Aldola is not a typical roman name, The character's name is more like a combination of French with a touch of Spanish, also she should be speaking Italian or latin instead of German.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: Fair 6\\n\\n\r\nAs in fair enough to be watch by all ages.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTrivia: During WW2 the Soviet Red Army utilizes women for sniper duties.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Amazing Grace! (how sweet the sound),\r\n   That saved a wretch like me!\r\nI once was lost, but now am found,\r\n   Was blind, but now I see...\"\r\nJohn Newton and William Cowper (Olney Hymns - 1779).\r\nThe problem with first impressions is that all too often they are wrong, and this is one of the main reasons why a number of great shows don't get the recognition they deserve. Unfortunately, every season more anime are added to that list.\r\nSora no Woto (Sounds of the Skies), is one example of this mindset at work.\r\nThe series is the first production of a new initiative known as Animeno Chikara (The Power of Anime), which is essentially a collaboration between TV Tokyo's anime department and Aniplex that was established in 2009 . Part of the mandate for this project is to create and produce original anime which are not based on any previously published material (so manga, novel and game adaptations are out of the window). One of the advantages of this is that the writers have far fewer restrictions placed on them from the outset, and it seems as though this freedom has been put to good use here.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a young girl, Sorami Kanata, who, having heard a trumpet rendition of \"Amazing Grace\" played by a mysterious female soldier, has resolved to become a bugler. She is assigned to the 1121st Platoon, who are stationed at the Time Keeping Bastion in the town of Seize, and is taken under the wing of Master Sergeant Rio Kazumiya.\\n\\n\r\nNow, one would be forgiven for initially thinking that this series is nothing more than K-On! in the army, especially given that the character design is very similar between the two anime (I thought like that too, at first). However, the differences between the two shows are palpable from the very first moments of Sora no Woto. The plot, which is more on the episodic side for the most part, is far more reminiscent of Haibane Renmei, and although there are a few points that deserved more focus, the story is actually very well crafted. The pacing is extremely good throughout the series, and the seemingly slow progression promotes a feeling of relaxation rather than boredom in a manner very similar to Aria.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that really captures the viewer though, is the bittersweet yet hopeful undertone running through the series, and nowhere is this more prominent than in the characters. While each of them are somewhat stereotypical, the show develops in such a way that the story becomes inclusive of them, rather than having one true lead while the other \"leads\" are nothing more than glorified support. The upshot of this is that, come the end of the series, the viewer is left with a sense of catharsis that very few shows manage to achieve, especially ones that, at first glance, fit the \"moe\" archetype.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the supposed problems with Sora no Woto is the fact that the characters are designed with moe in mind, however the show is surprising in that, while the characters are reminiscent of certain other shows, this is where much of the similarity ends. In all honesty I found the character design somewhat off-putting at first, however this perception was dispelled very quickly as, although the characters are very clearly \"moe\" in their design, the fact is that this allows for a great deal of expression as well - something that is put to good use throughout the series. What is most surprising though, is the distinct lack of visual hooks associated with this sort of character design, in particular things like fan service. Instead, the series uses the characters in a manner that is far removed from the norm, and the effect of this is that, come the end of the series, one really begins to wonder why everyone made such a fuss over K-On!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, the series is very good, especially with character and vehicle movements. There is a fluid, almost naturalistic, flow to the animation which is present even during the scenes in which very little happens. The biggest pluses though, are the backgrounds and settings. Unlike most \"moe\" anime, the attention to detail in this area is truly good, with much of the scenery being evocative of old European towns, villages and countryside. As well as the visual style of the settings, the show also includes a number of European references (Helvetia is Switzerland for example, the Romans speak German, etc), all of which add to the series, and allow the viewer to become more absorbed in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe acting is pretty good throughout the anime, and many of seiyuu really show their talent with their respective characters. Granted there are a few moments where Sora no Woto slips into \"moe speaking mode\", however these become fewer as the series progresses. The real star of the show though, is the music, in particular the lone trumpet playing \"Amazing Grace\".\\n\\n\r\nNow, one thing that should be clarified here is just how important that one hymn is to this show. Hearing it is what spurs Kanata into becoming a bugler, but it's also something that links a number of disparate threads throughout the series. The hymn is about salvation and redemption, and ultimately that's what this series is all about. To be honest though, whenever I heard it, all of that didn't matter. The image of the lone bugler playing that song is one of the most evocative to appear in anime for a long, long time, and is made more powerful because this show is effectively about the effects of war, not just on the common people or the military support staff, but also on those who fight.\\n\\n\r\nIn effect, this is what makes the characters in Sora no Woto so very different to what one would expect. While there is a degree of stereotype to them, the show is careful not to let these personality traits take over, and as the series progresses the characters are allowed to not simply grow, but to evolve, something which although limited at times, is laudable as this type of development is rare in anime.\\n\\n\r\nSora no Woto is, by any measure, as much a character piece as Haibane Renmei, Kino no Tabi, or any other show of that ilk. While those other shows may have far more character development, this series is no slouch, indeed some of the characterisations are extremely powerful, especially Illya Arkadia, a character who doesn't appear too often and has very few lines, but whose presence is almost tangible throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be clear by now that I enjoyed this series immensely, something which I still find somewhat surprising given that I initially avoided it because I expected something extremely \"light and fluffy\" like K-On! To say that Sora no Woto has far more substance than the series it looks like is an understatement, and while the difference may not sit well with die hard K-On! fans, it should be noted that the aim of this show isn't simply to entertain, but to tell a story. The subject matter is open to interpretation, but the inclusion of possibly the most recognisable hymn in the world speaks volumes about how the series should be perceived.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Sora no Woto does have some \"light and fluffy\" elements to it, but ultimately it's a tale of salvation, redemption and hope, and it's because of this that the series stands apart from many of it's visual counterparts.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes the resemblance is only skin deep.",

            "content": "\"Someone was saying the world is ending. But I like this world.\"\r\nWhen So Ra No Wo To was first announced on the winter season roster, I wasn't planning on watching it. Despite reading the plot synopsis, I did not think it was a 'moeblob in the army' kind of story. That only came later when many, many people decided to put labels on it. Still, I wasn't inclined to watch the series. That is, until I saw the beautiful concept artwork by Kishida Mel. It was amazing and it made me want to see the series in spite of the much talked about art shifttowards moe.  (By the way, if anyone knows where I can find more of this art, feel free to tell me as I only have the two widely distributed images.)\\n\\n\r\nI will say it once at the beginning of this review: this is not a moe series. It has moe character designs, it has some familiar character archetypes, but it is not a moe series. There is no pandering sexual material nor is there any outright moe or fanservice outside of episode 8 (if you consider that fanservice). There is a difference between a character like Kanata, who is inexperienced and idealistic because of her youth, and someone like Yui, who is a helpless mess of idiotball. I know that it's easy to be cynical and look down upon anybody who isn't a realistic superman with mature character flaws considering the current state of commercial anime, but if you can't recognize the difference between these two characters, you will probably never be able to enjoy this series.\\n\\n\r\nI was already caught when I watched the first episode. This was the single best premiere of the new season. On the other two hyped up series of the season:  Durarara!!'s first episode was only told from the point of view of one character and would need the added perspectives of episode 2 onward to develop it into the great series it is. Dance in the Vampire Bund, on the other hand, went the Haruhi route of having the first episode have little to do with the story arc of the series, instead vying to prove the premise of the existence of it's title species.\\n\\n\r\nSora no Woto, on the other hand, set up everything in the series from episode 1. Whether you loved or hated the show, very few question the sheer potential and number of possibilities that could spring from the series, especially considering it was anime original material. It set up the characters Rio and Kanata: one, a talented but cold and mature veteran, and the other, a bright and optismistic newcomer. It sets up the wonderous setting: the village of Seize, a quiet town that has become a corner of the habitable earth, and the world itself. And what a world it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe settting of Sora no Woto is a character in and of itself, and much of the intrigue of the first few episodes is trying to discover just what happened to the people that live here. Being a slice of life series, the series portrays the extraordinary in the mundane. Something terrible has happened to this world. There is no life left in the oceans. Entire species' have been wiped out, and humans aren't doing too well themselves. French and English objects are common place, and Japanese is a forgotten language. Technology that we would marvel as futuristic is considered ancient. In the first episode, we see something deep in a river that could not be explained by anything present in our world. Everything we find normal are leftovers of an era gone by.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, the characters themselves are so fantastically ordinary. Despite the possibility and potential for this show to jump off into the land of fantasy or science fiction in the very next episode, there is a realism that permeates this series. This is no dark, dystopic vision, despite all the characters referencing a near apocalypse in the recent past. There is no police state, nor is there a heavy presence of the military. In fact, there are only five members of the military in the entire town. Two of them are women, three of them of are kids, all of them care little for war and all that comes with it. And watching the members of this village go through their daily lives, be it a glass-blower, a shopkeeper, a pair of orphans and their young guardian, or an elderly woman living in solitude in the mountains, you get the feeling that this is what it would be like. This is how people try to move on. Despite the fact that there are ongoing peace talks, there is no talk of peace in Seize, nor is talk of war. This place is so far away from civilization, you wonder why the military even have an outpost here. Then you realize that just a few miles from this town where war \"could never happen,\" there is barren, empty place known as No Man's Land. And something terrible happened there.\\n\\n\r\nWhen watching this series, you really get the impression that the writers and producers have done an immense amount of research. There is a strange mix of culture and history in this world, with art and architectural references abound. The story takes place in a small European town, and the architecture, landscape, artifacts, even the plantlife are portrayed correctly. There were no corners cut when they were creating the atmosphere of this series. While the animation is ordinary, it is the vivid and detailed artwork that make this series memorable. From the aging suburban buildings, to the fresh and maintained farmlands, to the lifeless desert with \"modern\" skyscrapers peeking out of the sand, to the untamed woods, the beautiful snowfields, and the distant mountains covered with deteriorating ruins of the futuristic technology of the old days. Everything is coloured and detailed wonderfully, and sprinkled with the anthropologic evidence of the time of war. This place was once important. Now it is not.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has great sound, period. Being a series where music is a big part of the plot, it is to be expected. The sound is crisp and clean, voice acting is top notch and stays in character, and the original musical composition is much more akin to \"traditional\" European classical music as opposed to your standard, synthetically orchestrated background music. A French vocal piece, the orchestra work at the end of episode 10, the music over the end credits of the final episode, and the numerous trumpet solos and renditions of \"Amazing Grace\" are some of the highlights. The opening sequence is visually stunning, with a very aged, mythological feel, and a retelling of a not-so-much-a-fairy-tale story you will hear in the first episode. The ending is a catchy song with visuals that once again serve to remind us that this series is not about moe caricatures. It is about a group of people that share bonds, experience hardships, laugh with and criticize each other. Friendship is a very important theme in this series.\\n\\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\r\n(For the remainder of this review, I will be discussing the plot, characters, and themes of the series, and there will be MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS after the break, including events from the finale episode. So, for all of you that haven't yet watched the series, I really encourage you to watch it now. If you still don't plan on it, I encourage you to read the rest of the review.)\\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n\r\nWhen I started this series, I had to admit that the characters were the weakest part of this story. The supporting and minor characters were all very well done and helped to create a rich environment, but the main characters weren't so fortunate. They were all likable, but you couldn't really deny that they were cliche, sprung from the regular anime archetypes and lacking the depth that I'd really want to see in this show.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Sora no Woto managed to subvert the standard cliches that befall this type of series. The characterization is archetypical -- that is undeniable. But the depth and development that these characters get is not. I attribute a lot of this success to the way the series structured its episodes. Like another currently airing series, Durarara!!, this show has character centric episodes. Episode 1 and 8 are Kanata, 2 and 9 are Kureha, 3 and 10 are Rio, 4 and 11 are Noel, 7 is Filicia, 5 is about the youngsters of our group developing a bond that will stick forever, 6 is about the town of Seize and its secrets, and 12 is about the very world itself. Now while the plot progresses from episode to episode, if you were to watch, say, episode 4 followed by episode 11, you would see all the pieces of Noel's character come together. The question she poses to Kanata in episode 4 regarding the tank and what evil could come of it now makes sense because she is looking to make up for the atrocities she made possible in the past.\\n\\n\r\nMore examples. Look at episode 2 and then 9. Kureha's speech about being self-sufficient, as well as that small flashback of her being powerfully embraced by Rio in 2 are given their background in 9. She needs to be independent because she is an orphan and grew up having to do everything herself, and lectures a little brat about it. She looks up to Filicia and Rio as her mother and father, respectively. Look at episode 3 and 10, where we see a young Rio looking up to Iliya, and how she avoids the townsfolk and tries to deal with thing herself. Now take episode 10, where her relationship and responsibilities as Iliya's sister are revealed, as well as the fact that she has been running away from them all her life. Episode 3 is titled \"Rio Runs.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe only character that doesn't really fall into this pattern is Kanata herself. But I think we can all see by now that Kanata is a little special. While Kureha constantly derides her, she also becomes her best friend. While Rio smirks at her naivety, she also wishes she were a bit like her. Noel is so out of it that she already considers Kanata someone to look up to, or at least sleep on. And Filicia of course, with her maturity veiled behind a decieving but honest smile, already knew all of this. Kanata is a fool by there standards. She hasn't gone through much hardship. She lived on farm, happily with both of her parents. She is a kid and she knows it. She wasn't forced to grow up quickly like the other four girls of this series. She is average is just about every way. And that is precisely why she changes her companions so much.\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason why this series succeeds is the sheer attention to detail that it bestows upon the characters and plot. In episode 7, when Filicia runs out of the room, Noel stops Rio to go after her herself, telling Rio that she is the only one that understands Filicia's trauma. Compare this to her later mental breakdown in episode 11. During Filicia's flashback to the war, we see the reflection of a giant, unholy wing in the mirrors of a high rise building. At the end of episode 7, when the girls are sending spirits down the river, Noel sends no one because their numbers are too many to count. (Wow, a lot of these happened in episode 7.) Episode 10 featured the story of a woman living alone, waiting for the man she loved to return to her. In any other series, this would have either been a filler stretched for the length of an episode, or shoehorned into a regular episode clumsily. But in Sora no Woto, it is brilliantly used as a foil for Rio's own feelings, and both stories are poetically resolved by the end of the twenty minute episode. I must applaud the director and the writers for the skillful execution of stories like these.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't just the characters. While you could say that the plot of this series was pretty simple in the present, the scope and amount of thought that went into detailing this world is immense. This series developed a beautiful mythology of its world, with concepts such as the angels, the fossil in the river, the ghosts in the abandoned school, the Takemikazuchi, the old era tanks and technology, the security system with Japanese characters out in the woods, No Man's Land, the Invisible Reaper, the political discourse going on in the capital, events of the war, and historical figures such as Princess Iliya, Desert Claus, the Demon of Vingt, and the Witch of Helvetia. Where did the fossil's head go? Were angels supernatural or extraterrestrial? Why is Japanese a forgotten language? With all this technology, why did the military use trumpets to communicate? Was it because of an A.I. virus or something else? The amount of history and cultural depth is awe-inspiring, and the open-endedness blurs the lines between science, fantasy, and reality. When combined with the beautiful visuals and emotion-filled music, it makes for a religious experience.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a lot of mysteries in this series, especially regarding the setting and what happened in the past. Those were the main reasons I couldn't wait to watch a new episode every week. This show didn't answer any of them. And by the end of the last episode, I didn't care.\\n\\n\r\n\"You have suffered enough.\"\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Sora no Woto is a story of redemption and the constant hum of Amazing Grace hammers that home. It is the story of a group of people who appear cute and harmless on the outside, but are quickly shown to be haunted by a past they can not escape. Much like the world they live in. And by the end of this series, they all come full circle. At the end of episode 11, I thought there was simply too much to be resolved. But sure enough, all of the threads that were left dangling throughout the course of the series were woven together into a beautiful fabric. And that was the real miracle of this series, not Kanata's trumpet-playing at the end.\\n\\n\r\nNoel wanted to be forgiven for the lives she took as the Witch of Helvetia, and she is, even moreso by a solidier of the nation she massacred. Kureha played the \"bad guy\" military realist all her life because she was an only child, despite having her entire family. Her mom was cheerfully aloof while dealing with her own problems in secret, her dad was the only girl she looked up to but she was long gone now, and her two sisters were both airheads, one having a reason for it and the other just being that way. And at the end, she breaks down, finally admitting that she doesn't want to be alone anymore. And she is embraced by her family, who were always standing with her the entire time. Filicia wants to put an end to war once and for all so that she is the last person that has to watch all her friends die before their very eyes, and she takes the first step in ensuring that future.  Rio avoided following in her sister's footsteps all her life, but in the end, she does what she must, having been inspired by Kanata and the rest of her new sisters. And the reward is far beyond anything she ever imagined. Kanata's goal of learning how to play the trumpet quickly becomes synonomous with saving the very world itself. And she does.\\n\\n\r\n\"Even if no one else forgives you, I will.\"\\n\\n\r\nAisha says these words to Noel in the finale. But after watching the whole series and taking a step back to soak it all in, I believe these words are referring to the world itself. The people of this world have experienced a very terrible thing: a war of unimaginable proportion, so widescale that nearly everything they held dear is now gone. The people of Seize try to move on with their lives, but they can't. The soldiers don't wish to fight, yet they still do. The reality is that no one has moved on. The peace talks are deteriorating. War is on the horizon despite how quiet the world has become. Because the people of this world have not forgiven themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of Sora no Woto was not a miracle. As Kanata has stated time and time again throughout the series: She is just a girl who wants to play the trumpet, to communicate people's thoughts through music. She is just the messenger. And as she plays her trumpet atop the Takemikazuchi, to the armies of both Helvetia and and the Holy Roman Empire, she is doing just that. All throughout the series, she is both complimented and condoned for her innocence. And yet in the end, it is because of her pure heart that she realizes the message first: she loves this world. As does everyone else, but they have forgotten. By tragedy, loss, heartbreak, and the false idea that they could move on without forgiving themselves, they have forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nA big reason why I love this show is because it reminds me of two series that I hold very dear: Haibane Renmei and The 08th M.S. Team. Both are series with heavy slice of life elements, yet manage to explore philosophical and war themes. After seeing the first episode, I knew that this series would start off as a happy-go-lucky slice of life but would eventually tread deep into darker territory. The opening sequence and the foreshadowing of the girls reliving the myth of the Fire Maidens made it even more likely. By around episode 4, I learned that this series was done by the director of Elfen Lied, at which point I had no doubt there would be a tragic ending.  I thought this series would have the world reunite against the revived angel, where war would return with numerous losses. Eventually, the five girls would have to make a tremendous sacrifice and end up becoming the very Maidens they looked up to. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Sora no Woto gave me an ending I never knew I wanted. It was humanity itself that was its own worst enemy. It fought a war, but at what cost? It was humanity that felt the guilt of the old ages, and it was humanity that was unable to find redemption. When Yumina began to retell the legend of Fire Maidens, it was an emotional experience. The moment I saw Aisha as the angel, I realized for the first time what this show was tring to accomplish. I knew it wasn't going to come back to the angel fossil or any of the other questions they raised, because they weren't important anymore. The girls do indeed make their own Odyssey-like epic and become like the Maidens of the legend but not like I thought they would. They weren't burned at the stake like the Maidens either -- humanity has become much more forgiving.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, Sora no Woto is the story of a girl who makes the world remember what they had all along: forgiveness. Whose message was it? I can't answer that question. Nevertheless, it was a sound in the sky, and it was heard by five girls who, after finding peace in their own redemption, take it upon themselves to share that message with the rest of the world. But maybe that's a miracle all by itself.",

            "content": "Five different girls in military and their lives. Interesting? Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t. This anime is a true example of what happens, if you try to do too much at once on the weak and uninspiring basis. \r\nSora no woto, aka \u2018Sound of the Sky\u2019 is a mixed culture setting war zone folktale involving a young girl who only came to military to play nice trumpet. If you just read the synopsis, it seems like a very unique and refreshing idea for slice of life genre anime. Sadly, it is not, because the major problem that this anime falls down is from the concept from thestart. When you think of slice of life genre, the most important thing is always consistency on everything. Theme, settings, plot, relevance, comedy, all these thing has to be in balanced and united by one main flow of atmosphere. Sora no woto ultimately fails to do that.\\n\\n\r\nThink about the setting of this anime first. There is a war and a town. Only soldiers there in that huge fat town are 5 females, three of them is not even capable of using the guns right. Trumpet is being used for the military communication, and yet they have extremely advanced tank we\u2019ve never seen in any animes. Mixed culture of Europe and Japan looks just awkward as it is. There are all sorts of mysteries arising, yet none of them is properly solved or introduced. Yes, this anime doesn\u2019t make sense of anything. My understanding of 'making sense' is completely different from Gurren Lagann pierce through the time adventure with galaxy sized robot, it's more about the relationship between its circumstance. Sora no woto always involves the paradoxical elements at the same times, and tries to tell two completely irrelevant lines of the story. I\u2019m just utterly surprised that this anime actually ended with this horribly introduced setting and backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no real plot we can call; it just portrays the life of 5 girls in military. It\u2019s basically a war zone, so it partially success on telling this story of blood and massacre that those disasters create (*Or not, perhaps. I'm just making this up). Some episode actually does make us to become a bit emotional. It was pretty nice. The problem is, it still doesn\u2019t make \u2018sense\u2019. The whole this creation of story looks like giant piece of junk art, chucked in random elements together in one; even Homer Simpson can make that kind of stinkers. I\u2019m seriously concerning about the ability of script writers for this anime. Conversations are very unintelligent and none of them is memorable. I mean, what the hack is all of those flat, cheap, overused and retarded jokes? I mean, they just don\u2019t work for me. From my theory, this happened due to indecisive nature of the staffs who\u2019s trying to make anime deep and emotional but funny and cheap at the same time. Anime clich\u00e9s with fanservices and terror of war just don\u2019t match; they are basically trying to something that is facing the complete opposite directions. It will never work. Those writers tried to do two things at once; they wanted war drama which will make some of emotional scenes that will cry people in a river, but at the same time, they wanted moe appeals, for financial issues. Well, if they had ability, they really could've used those services in 'appropriate' moment, then I will at least say 'oh well, they wrapped up war and moe nicely'. It doesn't. Some episodes were totally tainted by irrelevant use of moe fanservices, and these taints ruins the whole flow of the mood.\\n\\n\r\nNot just that; maybe the idea of war itself is actually the reason that Sora no Woto breaks apart. I\u2019m not saying war is such a bad theme or whatever. It is just overused way too much. *War is bad thing! I\u2019ll protect this village from that bad thing!*\u2026 seriously, everyone knows that. War is bad, and should be prevented whatsoever; and this anime tries to tell us about \u2018THAT\u2019. For 12 episodes long series, only thing it said is this one philosophical and complex phrase; \u2018WAR IS BAD\u2019, but nothing else excluding the pee joke. Shallow\u2026 way too much shallow\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nEpisode is very, very inconsistent. Some episodes are alright, trying to raise our hopes a bit more. Later, it crushes by terribly executed episodes that are absolutely pointless to put. When some scenes are well concerned, other parts are just utterly boring. It is sad that there are only a few \u2018truly\u2019 good scenes, but almost about 15 minutes per episode is just futile. With this shallow plot and setting, it can only do stretching itself out to fill the bottle of 25 minutes. Those filled materials are the main cause of this boredom, and occurred due to simplistic storyline. If they\u2019ve made some solid basis at the start, this never happened.\\n\\n\r\nThing I can praise on this anime is BG art. It was one of the most gorgeous looking scenes I\u2019ve seen in a while. It is breath-taking, and all those buildings, trees, lakes, cliffs, bridges form a perfect harmony, contrast what I\u2019ve seen in its story. I was utterly surprised about all the animation quality from this anime. CG tank (although it doesn\u2019t make sense) looks great and very well animated. OP animation had some beautiful and abstract art works. On the other hand, it might be just me, but I hate that character design so much. That\u2019s one of the major reasons why I hated K-On. This part of me is pretty much biased, so I will not count this part on the rating; amazing BG art covers all.\\n\\n\r\nSound is another astonishing thing; I just love classics and violins. A lot of them sounds greatly, although most of time, they are used in inappropriate time. OP is not bad; serious and calming although it was not that candy for me, but ED was seriously mismatching the theme of war. It was funny seeing this difference between opening, ending songs, since that\u2019s what they exactly did for the plot of the anime. OP = War drama!! ED = MOE MOE!!\\n\\n\r\nSadly, characters in this anime are the most stereotypical, and uninteresting ones I\u2019ve ever seen. I felt like being tortured watching all those crappy clich\u00e9 treatments. Starting with Katana, she joined military only to learn how to play trumpet. She is really bad at it, but in certain episode, she just miraculously learns how to play it perfectly, for some superficial reason. \u2018LOL SHII IZU SUCH A GENIUUSSU!!\u2019. Hell no, that\u2019s brainless on the side of production staffs. She is enthusiastic, cute and na\u00efve; so typical. There is nothing special or interesting thing about this character at all. \\n\\n\r\nNext, we have Kureha, tsundere. Actually, one of those annoying ones. She acts all over the place spreading her faggotry like \u2018Katana we are fuckin soldiers, it\u2019s a SERIOUS BUSINESS, don\u2019t play like weabooooz.\u2019 Yet, she can\u2019t even hold her gun tight. This is just another clich\u00e9d character, and we can expect nothing new from her. Same goes to silent moe Noel-chan and typical mother type glassed girl whose existence makes no sense. Only character I can say \u2018not that bad\u2019 is Rio; the only person there who in fact make sense being a soldier. She is cool and gets annoyed a lot for the \u2018proper\u2019 reason, such as Katana being empty-headed. She still has major bullshit things that make everything senseless, but better than all the other lowly characters. Ultimately, the character lacks some large amount of depth overall. Their reaction is so predictable due to the oversimplified personality. They are all clich\u00e9d and uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy watching this? Try to throw yourself into the trash-bin and swim; you will find it more enjoyable than this shit. It was more of pain; everything absolutely makes no sense, and is more of quasi-experiment without a single noticeable moments. I\u2019m just terribly disappointed how this gorgeous art and my favourite classical music background OST got wasted for this terrible series.\\n\\n\r\nSora no woto had a potential. So, I just blame production staffs and industrial crisis. Hurr durr.",

            "content": "Sora no Woto is a show that tries to do a lot at once. It isn't just a moeblobs show, and it's not just about fighting. It looks like a regular World War II setting at first, but as you continue to watch you learn it's actually a future setting, where life is scarce, systems of writing and music have been forgotten, and the resulting setting is a mashup of many, many cultures, probably at this point, indistinguishable from one another to the characters. \r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story lacks a forward direction. However, for that reason, as you begin to understand why things are going on,it makes it a much more enjoyable experience. As I mentioned above, if you're looking for a straight-out war show, look elsewhere. If you want to watch \"cute girls doing cute things in cute ways\", you may like Sora no Woto, though in recent episodes (6, 7) the story overall has taken a darker shade, as some of the truths around the 1121st platoon come to surface. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe animation of the characters themselves was a little unsavory in the very first episode. However, it has become smoother (or maybe I've just gotten used to it)... but the real beauty in this show is in the backgrounds. The setting itself is based off the city of Cuenca, Spain, a city built in a mountainous range, with a variety of steep cliffs and water. This is well represented in the show, where most of the backgrounds make you stop and watch them instead of the characters, if you happen to notice that kind of thing. That being said, make sure you watch this show in at least 720p. ;D\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThere's a wide variety of sounds in Sora no Woto, but the most noteworthy is the music. Not the background music - the music that comes from bugles, which is a focal point early on in the series. When the main character, Kanata, first begins to play the bugle, there's not much that can express the sounds that come out of that instrument. Myself being a trumpet player, I couldn't help but laugh the second I heard it, and once again laugh when Kanata suddenly vastly improves with one small piece of advice. In addition, the OP theme, by Kalafina (known for their work in the Kara no Kyoukai series) seems a little flavorless at first, but as the series progresses, it more closely resembles the overall feeling of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEverybody seems to think Sora no Woto takes the characters from K-On! and puts them in a different setting. Honestly, that's just wrong. While they do look similar, the characters in Sora no Woto have much, MUCH more depth to them than the K-On! cast. Each character shows many sides, straying away from static personalities, though to be fair, it does employ anime archetypes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nFrom beginning to end, each episode so far has been enjoyable, to where when it ends, I wonder, \"It's already over?\" This show keeps you guessing what's going to happen next, and why some of the small subtleties are how they are. At the very least, the animation staff did a decent bit of research, and they are putting forth an effort to keep things consistent across each episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI know, mathematically that's not the average of the scores. So far, though, this has been among the best shows this season, and with the production of bonus episodes, a manga, and a visual novel, odds are it's going to maintain the same high standard of quality throughout.",

            "content": "Well let's just clear some things up now. THIS IS NOT FREAKIN' K-ON IN THE FREAKIN MILITARY. All right, now that that's over with let's start with the review of The Sound of the Skies, aka So Ra No Wo To. (This will be a quick one since I wrote one before but it got deleted when my computer got the blue screen.)\r\nOkay so the story and the characters, even if they're pretty cliche, are actually quite good in their own right. The pacing is pretty good, characters are well developed and believable enough to not be Mary Sues. The voices also fit each andevery character very well.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound is amazing in their own right. The artstyle of the characters are very similar to K-ON's, but the backgrounds and backdrops are radically different. It's jaw-dropping. (Okay, not for me, but it's still very different.) It even gives 5 Centimeters per Second a rival.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is different than K-ON's, too. Rather the songs are moreso comparible to the Team ICO video game series. (There's ICO, Shadow of the Colossus, and The Last Guardian.) Basically, it has very well composed songs for the orchestra to play and it sometimes focuses on a single particular instrument throughout the anime. (It would be the trumpet in this show). So really, it's always a crowning music of awesome.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this anime a lot. It was well rounded and gave enough awesome moments to make up for the less than creative story and characters. Therefore, I give this rating a \"Kick-Ass\" for it's awesomeness.\\n\\n\r\nSo, you might still think that this relates to K-ON, (you know just like Skip Beat or White Album), and you are completely wrong. Only the artstyle and sharing of the music genre are the only things that are similar about it. The character animations are basically the same, but there's enough contrasts in The Sound of the Skies that make it immensly better anyways.\\n\\n\r\nI'll concede that both of the animes use music as a part of their themes. But K-ON's is more like \"Using music to save our club\" than The Sound of the Skies \"Using music to understand more about ourselves and the world\". So if anybody still tells you that the both of the animes are the same, then please don't believe them and let them know that they're jerkasses that only watch the first ten minutes of a show and make judgement upon them.\\n\\n\r\nAlso if you're wondering what the soundtrack's going to sound like then here (By the way, it's not from The Sound of the Skies but from ICO. This is just to get you prepared for what it's going to be similar to.): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DipbshLI8PA\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I hate my life",

            "content": "As always, there is a rare gem every season that pops up and surprises me.  It has been compared to as a K-On in the military but to me, I feel it would be more to suitable to describe it as Aria in the military though I digress.\r\nSora no Woto, is a deceptive little thing about what it really wants to be with the plot.  Young Sorami Kanata, a bugler and a private of the Helvetian army, arrives as the new meat of the 1121st, an all female tank crew/squadron.  Suffice to say, a slice of life romp ensues.  Albeit, itis one with slightly dark undertones here and there.  You'd almost forget about them until the masterstroke at the end arrives, heralding the end of the almost idyllic life of the Maidens of the Time-Telling Fortress.  But the end, comes almost too fast, yet still feeling it could have been resolved earlier.  Its a quick succession of events towards the end but it still manages to follow through to a satisfying conclusion.  Not perfect, but still very good.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it is outstanding.  The bright backgrounds and lighting really help make the setting feel alive.  All of Sora no Woto is beautifully animated, whether from the Takemicaduchi and myriad tanks in 3D to the expressive characters.  It helps that the quality doesn't suffer at any point either.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to go with this art, is also an outstanding sound department.  The background music really does this series justice, coming in just at the right time.  Supporting the scenes actively without being overbearing.  That is not to say the voice acting or the effects were poor.  They were indeed fitting but the props really have to go out background music.  That is not to say, actual music is not played.  As a signaller of the tank crew, our little heroine doles out a piece that has touched many hearts, hers included, before the story even started.  Another touching piece would be the French, I believe, insert song.  But now I'm just listing things.  Even so, I am still wishing to hear them outside of the anime in all their glory.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are as I've already mentioned, very expressive.  I really don't know what to say here.  I was just along for the ride as everyone told their own stories and talked more about themselves.  At the main characters did.  Though, special mention goes some of the minor characters as, Colonel Hopkins, or Major Krauss despite their limited appearances.  Heck, everyone is accounted for, even if they only say few lines.  Which is nice attention to detail.\\n\\n\r\nI love Sora no Woto, it cannot be said enough.  Simply because the world is so fascinating and colourful despite the actual backstory.  Most if not all the minor details I would have picked at are well done.  Though there are occasional slip ups, but that's because there so much detail.  The atmosphere traps me further in enjoyment the farther it goes but better still, there is a moral here if you looked for it.  Not that I'm one for such things but as always, I'd rather have you, the reader, find out for yourself.  This is something I recommend strongly as a must watch of the season.\\n",

            "content": "SPOILER-FREE\u2122\r\nThere are very few anime with as bad a case of mistaken identity as Sound of the Sky, also known as Sora no Woto or, if you\u2019re kind of a jerk, So Ra No Wo To. Honestly most people will take one look at the art and character designs and think one thing: K-ON\r\nAnd this is really a shame because other than a couple of similarities in character design, Sound of the Sky shines on its own with no relation under the surface to our favorite (or least favorite) slice of life. This issue has led to Sound of the Sky\u2019s problem, a nice wayto phrase it is to say it\u2019s a hidden gem, a less polite term would be \u201csold like cold cakes.\u201d Some skipped it thinking it would be moe SoL comedy #284, others were disappointed that it wasn\u2019t just that, the bottom line is it was not and still is not especially popular.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a tragedy that preconceptions blinded many people to the merits of Sound of the Sky. However, I wager most people who seriously watch it will be surprised. Sound of the Sky is truly special, there is no anime quite like it.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt isn\u2019t easy to pin one of our familiar anime genres to Sound of the Sky. I suppose the term \u201cslice of life\u201d wouldn\u2019t be entirely inaccurate, but it\u2019s not in a high school and the characters aren\u2019t\u2026ok actually they are cute girls. This does not mean Sound of the Sky is not story driven, in fact the plot helps carry the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound of the Sky is set in a post-apocalyptic world that has been partially rebuilt. It follows the soldiers of the 1121st platoon in the border town of Seize (Says). Despite being soldiers in a war, a country town like Seize doesn\u2019t see a whole lot of violent action. The story is more focused on the characters and their relationships to their world and each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is gorgeous: thematic without being pretentious, unrushed without being vacuous and passionate without being melodramatic. The series is deceptively deep with themes ranging from duty to desire, religion, war, hope, despair and love. The most important is finding a place in the world, something almost all the characters struggle with. In this anime, the world has already ended.\\n\\n\r\nBut due to greatly different attitudes, the characters react to this and other problems in vastly different ways. Some characters choose to resign themselves to the whims of fate and others face it head on. Their world does not want them, or even worse, wants them to fill a role they are very reluctant to do. The characters struggle to find meaning to a meaningless world, and watching them defy nihilism in such a position is marvelous. Although the plot shines, the true beauty of this story is less the plot and more the interactions of different attitudes and worldviews.\\n\\n\r\nThe story really picks up in the last few episodes building up to an incredible climax. The ending is both extremely tragic and filled with hope. Sound of the Sky is a little reminiscent of something like Haibane Renmei in the regard that it doesn\u2019t necessarily answer all the questions about the world, but still satisfies. There are a few details intentionally left open, but if anything this adds to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinally I want to offer my praise for this anime actually having a conclusion, something growing increasingly scarce. It is not unambiguously happy but the ending was by far my favorite part of the piece.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to sugarcoat it, Sound of the Sky doesn\u2019t exactly have all the budget in the world. But I don\u2019t mean to say that it\u2019s an ugly anime, quite the contrary: it\u2019s quite striking. Seize and the Time-Trumpeting Fort may not always be rendered in stunning detail, but they always look charming and attractive.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem is the character designs. I\u2019m not quite sure what A-1 was thinking when they decided to make them so reminiscent of moe anime, but it was a poor decision to say the least. Most of the anime may be \u201cslice of life\u201d but it hardly could be described simply as \u201ccute girls doing cute things.\u201d The magical story and characters are really quite undercut by this flaw.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs might be expected of an anime called \u201cSound of the Sky,\u201d the soundtrack is excellent. It contributes greatly to the mood and is punctuated by liberal use of silence that effectively adds to the focus. A recurring motif in the anime is the song Amazing Grace, one of the most beautiful songs ever written. In Sound of the Sky, it represents connection between people and is the focal point of some of the most emotional moments in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe phrase \u201cI love them, but I don\u2019t like them\u201d is pretty common among parents and marriages with a short future, but I can\u2019t imagine that it is especially popular for describing fictional characters. But when describing my feelings about the characters of Sound of the Sky, I think this phrase is quite appropriate. I really don\u2019t agree with many of the characters, their attitudes or their decisions, but I still found them some of the most compelling characters I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nKanata may look like your typical overly optimistic slice of life protagonist from the outside, and to be honest she does have a pretty chirpy personality. However there is a lot more depth to her than is first apparent. As the story kicks into high gear in the later part of the anime, we see that she is quite capable of acting serious and even rather assertive and aggressive, but not in a way that contrasts her established character.\\n\\n\r\nBut the one who really steals the show is Rio. In anime \u201ctragic\u201d is usually a synonym for \u201cedgy.\u201d The tragic hero of anime is more often a Dark Flame Master than an Oedipus. Rio is a tragic character with a backstory that doesn\u2019t strike at all of the ridiculous, and she has a believable reaction. She has to cope world that refuses to give her what she wants, and rather than sprouting superpowers to change that paradigm, she is forced to deal with it. And she deals with it like an adult, I may not agree with her decisions, but they strike me very much as the sort of decisions an actual human being might make. It\u2019s really a sad reflection on anime when that is such an incredible thing.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on about the other characters but I think I\u2019ve made my point: Sound of the Sky has some of the most compelling characters I have ever seen, and while it had a short run time, it fleshed them out beautifully with depth and realism.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound of the Sky does not appeal to everyone, and it doesn\u2019t try to. There is a little action, but it is overshadowed by slice of life and drama. If you\u2019re more the pre-teen melodrama fan then this may be a bit too subtle, and if you only like cute girls doing cute things then you may be put off by the somber tone. It isn\u2019t easy to pin down what kind of person would like Sound of the Sky because I can\u2019t make easy generalizations like \u201cif you liked X you will like this\u201d because there isn\u2019t really a parallel. It\u2019s a true hidden gem that I personally enjoyed and appreciated immensely, but I can\u2019t deny that there are aspects that would turn some people off.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nSound of the Sky is one of my favorite animes ever. It is beautiful, powerful and emotional in all the best ways. This anime hits hard and is something I have no reservations calling truly unique.\\n\\n\r\nPS: There are two specials that fit very well into the series, watch them at the same time.",

            "content": "An inclusion of naturalistic elements to an otherwise stale gimmick of \u201ccute girls in serious circumstances\u201d in an anime has been met with a mixed reception among both casual and serious anime fans. This being circumstances that involve a setting, or lore to be specific, that would not have needed to have any \u201cmoe\u201d components to make it even more or less meaningful. But we all know why this is the case: they want to appeal to what is popular, as it was popular considering this was made in 2010, and to cash in that would\u2019ve otherwise been ignored without it. Unfortunately, that cash grabis less than fruitful from how seemingly transparent these elements give off in these shows, and nowhere near is this evident than in Sora No Woto.\\n\\n\r\nTo get the gist of what Sora no Woto wants to show us with its extravagant array of colorful characters and artistic merit is how the setting is put into perspective. When you read the back story of the show\u2019s lore, you get the sense that the writer really had a unique vision when constructing it to facilitate the story. Making the setting and the story compelling, however, are separate issues; you have to have a story with telling while also making the world an imaginative wonderland. In Sora no Woto, it manages to set a nice tone to the setting with an elaborate background story, but in regards to its story, there is absolutely nothing to make that setting meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a slice-of-life anime, first and foremost. No story can really be found in one, for the most part. Because of this, there is a perplexing motive to be understood from a writer\u2019s perspective. Why tell an interesting lore, if your \u201cstory\u201d doesn\u2019t take advantage of that \u201clore\u201d? By this counter-intuitive realization, it makes Sora no Woto seem like a lifeless barren landscape that holds no meaningful qualities. These lack of qualities come to show how so much is out in the vast openness of the show\u2019s world, but the enclosed space where the main characters occupy is nonexistent.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is the space nonexistent? The characters that inhabit it are what make it that way. The only exception that doesn\u2019t make these cast of characters completely terrible is Kanata Sorami because of her charming presence. Other than her, there was hardly any reason for me to take these girls\u2019 own personal struggles with any strong conviction of sincerity. This problem can be surfaced by how so little the writers give any of these girls true distinctive, or unique, identities that made me think of them more than just Girl #1 , #2, or #3. Not to mention that the tropes that we see in countless cute girl ensemble anime aren\u2019t at the least bit engrossing by how little they try to make it at least entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of entertainment value, it would help to find the value of Sora no Woto more revealing if you, say, have insomnia to help guide you through this. Monotony is prevalent in most scenes that would otherwise feel as if they were not needed to be there to begin with. I can appreciate atmospheric inclusions in some scenes, but there is almost hardly any substance to any of the pointless scenes where the girls go off to some abandoned area at random. This comes out as negative due to how dull the writing comes off as, not to mention how I previously mentioned how the characters are mostly devoid of any life to their generic tropes.\\n\\n\r\nYou would think, judging from the poster and screenshots, that this is made by Kyoto Animation considering how it looks very similar to K-ON. But it is in fact drawn by the original character designer of K-ON, along with Kokoro Connect and Lucky Star, Yukiko Horiguchi. Rightfully so, the style of artistry to her characters always feels very expressive in any of the shows she is involved in. However, with that said, there is a slight aesthetic disconnect to her character designs and the general art of the environments. Everything in the world is this slight gritty wasteland, while you see these cute girls doing the typical cute girl schtick that severely distracts the main pull of the ambiance. Despite this big crux, both are independently done very well in giving some bit of ingenuity to the art.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as anime music shows go, there aren\u2019t as much in the way of musical endeavors go in Sora no Woto besides girls playing bugle horns every once in a while. But what music is there, it is quite soothing and fits the atmosphere well considering it gives a passable experience through all the dreary, monotonous scenes that take place.\\n\\n\r\nA fair bit of wasted potential can be made into a case with regards to Sora no Woto. It is one thing if you try to put forth a strong lore within a show, but with a genre like Slice-of-life, you need to at least give an effort to show more of it than just plainly explain it through monologue after monologue. Even without monologues, there is never a sense of an accomplishment because of how dry the pacing comes across. While not at all a \u201cbad\u201d anime by any means, there are at least a few elements, such as the art/animation and musical arrangements. Best advice is to not watch this laying down in bed; otherwise your eyes will start to flutter until you start collapsing out of sheer apathy.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: C-\\n",

            "content": "Sora no Woto strongly adheres to a personal saying of mine: \"You never know what you're going to get with short animes\". I've watched some truly brilliant shows that were only 11-12 episodes long...and I've also watched some that weren't so good. Sora no Woto was one of those that I wasn't sure about, partially because it could almost be considered an OVA, a collaborative effort of several different studios that had never before been produced in manga, graphic novel, nor any other medium that I was familiar with. However, I found in the end that this show requires some patience before it's true colorsreally begin to show. And they were truly some beautiful colors.\\n\\n\r\nBreakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory (4/10): I should begin by explaining that the story isn't the strong point of this show. The reason for this is how long it takes for the story to develop into anything with real plot substance.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning of the show is done well enough. We see the main character, and are quickly charmed by her kindness and innocence, and see that she has  become a soldier, and is headed to her first deployment. The problem is, we aren't given very much exposition to explain the world she lives in, why her country is at war, or what her family or her home are like.\\n\\n\r\nAs other characters are introduced, we begin to understand the dynamic that they share. As I learned more about the characters, I thought that perhaps this show would be more \"character-driven\" rather than \"plot-driven\". However, this wasn't really the case either, as the characters don't seem to go through much change early on. They simply have small \"adventure\" each episode, that doesn't require much prior knowledge of the show, and leaves the characters more or less the same as when the episode started.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, seeing as the main cast is composed of soldiers, I thought that they would do more...well, soldier things. All the soldiers where the protagonist ends up are women like her, but they don't really have a whole lot of militaristic duties. They rarely go on patrols or even fire their weapons, for that matter. Ultimately, not much is done with the soldier aspect until the very end, and the rest of the time, these women could be an ordinary group of people who just happen to live in the same outpost. This is why I had a problem with the episodic nature of the show, because it rarely felt like anything of consequence was happening, despite the fact that I was watching a group of soldiers.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose there's nothing technically \"wrong\" with having an \"episodic\" feel to a show, where there isn't much overall plot to connect the episodes. However, it's certainly not what I prefer. I personally like to see a strong plot that connects the episodes together, or even having the way the characters interact with one another to create drama and tension. I just didn't feel either of these things with Sora no Woto, which is why I rated the plot so low.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the show doesn't stay this way the entire time. Toward the end of the show, there is a very nice span of two or three episodes where some very big events occur, and I was genuinely excited by what happened. I only wish that more of the show had been so plot driven, and had shown the storytelling prowess that the final episodes did.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10) - This show was really quite beautiful to watch. No details were skimmed over, even in the background details. Mile after mile of gorgeous countryside was carefully painted into each frame, making it worthwhile to watch the background nearly as much as the characters. There were some pieces that were animated by CGI, which I didn't find as pleasant as the hand-drawn details, but I suppose machines an be very hard to do by hand. This is probably the show's strongest point, which makes me sad in some ways, since art has noticeably less to do with what makes a show good than many of its other aspects.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)- Music is a large part of what drives this show, as the tune from \"Amazing Grace\" often fills the sky. I really enjoyed hearing this piece as it was played on the trumpet, and even in a full orchestration later on. The soundtrack overall was quite good, and I found it interesting that Amazing Grace was so integral to the story. Sora no Woto does mean \"Sound of the Sky\", which very well may refer to that familiar tune that so many people love.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5/10)- As I mentioned before, there isn't much background given of the protagonist early on. And frankly, we never really learn much about her at all. The main problem I had with the characters was that we learn more about a \"supporting\" character than the main character. All we know about the protagonist is that she wants to learn to play the trumpet, and that's why she joined the army. We learn more about the background of basically every character than the protagonist, who remains a charming and very lovable, but ultimately very shallow character.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps what really made her seem shallow was her apparent lack of any sort of character flaw. She is completely selfless, thinking of others before herself, works hard, is completely loyal to her fellow soldiers, and never says anything unkind to anyone. This is all wonderful, but we never see what lies inside her heart. Is she only nice to cover up something tragic that happened to her? Is her loyalty due to the fact that she felt she betrayed someone in the past? The show never really attempts to answer these questions.\\n\\n\r\nThe show gives plenty of development to a supporting character that I mentioned previously, which makes it seems as though she should have been the protagonist instead. The cast is ultimately very likable, but their development is rather unbalanced, and we will ultimately learn things about them at the last second so that we can understand something. The creators caught themselves a few times, and had to have a character suddenly say \"Oh, by the way, there's this really important thing about this other character's past that we forgot to mention until now, so here it is.\"\\n\\n\r\nNot a bad cast, just one that was mishandled.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10)- I had to force my way through one or two episodes where nothing really happened in the overall plot. Charming and fun only works for so long before someone like me will get curious about the plot, and this show seemed to forget about the plot until nearly the end. If it weren't for the mismanaged characters and lack of plot, this show could have been a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nRemember how I said that it shows some truly beautiful colors at the end? Well, it does, but not until I had to sit through ten episodes of basically nothing. The end of the show was wonderful, emotionally moving, and brought a very satisfying conclusion to everything. It just wasn't enough to make up for early problems that hurt the overall enjoyment value.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)- Ultimately, this show is worth watching, but only with realistic expectations. It's a lot of fun to watch at first, gets boring in the middle, but does end on a high note. Just don't go into this one expecting anything mind-blowing.",

            "content": "I was recommended this show by a friend who has traveled much further down the moe rabbit hole than I have, so I went in with two basic assumptions: this isn't a show about war, and it's not about life in a post-apocalyptic world. While I think these were safe assumptions, I ended up being very wrong.\r\nThis is a show about cute girls doing cute things. It's also a show about those same girls reliving war trauma and debating whether they should torture war captives in the remains of a world still being destroyed by humanity. That uneasy coexistence is part of the beauty ofSo Ra No Wo To, allowing it to go beyond being just another genre show. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the initial appeal of this show came from the idea of 'playing' with war, sort of the same way Ro-Kyu-Bu! 'plays' with basketball - taking a very 'masculine' and serious activity and making it cute. But sort of like Ro-Kyu-Bu!, the cuteness provides an entry point to a pretty substantial (if very different) story. There's still a lot of 'fluff' here - not filler, but enough touching character interactions and cute for the sake of cute that if you're not patient or into it to begin with you'll probably be drifting away from the series (and off to sleep) before you're too far in. But there is a point at which the brutal conflict and dying world intrude upon the precious way of life these characters have built - this isn't where the show 'gets good', but rather, you realize that all the sweetness of the initial episodes is in fact a fragile and embattled alternative to the ugliness of war, where those who have experienced and committed horrors can recover in a world that was denied to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe more general messages of 'peace' and 'common humanity' can feel heavy-handed at times, especially towards the end, sort of like a beautiful melody played a bit too loudly if not off-key. The main character suffers from a bit of the same, her spirited naivete sometimes tending towards typical moe blob problems, but overall the series creates characters that are charming while also being complicated in ways you don't often see in these sorts of shows.\\n\\n\r\nGreat art, incredibly catchy ED - this show far exceeded expectations, and I'd highly recommend it as a wonderful piece that's tended to get overlooked.",

            "content": "Sora no Woto is a beautiful and triumphant tale of humanity, morality, war, and peace. One of the best animes to come out in recent years, and possibly of all time. It\u2019s certainly one of the best I have ever seen. \r\nSora no Woto, or Sound of the Sky in English, is a 2010 war anime. War is this title\u2019s main theme, but a viewer will find many other genres in this amazing title, including themes of yuri, GAR, moe, humor, psychological drama and horror, mecha, religion, mild fanservice and much more. Sora no Woto brings so much to the table, and what it bringsis definitley worth seeing. \\n\\n\r\nSome may compare the art-style and character designs to that of K-ON! Well, I must admit: Kanata Sorami, the main character of Sora no Woto, does look an awful lot like Yui Hirasawa, the main character from K-ON! Because of this \u201cmoe\u201d style, the characters in Sora no Woto are often kawaii and cute, even to the point of sometimes being \u201cderpy.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThe show also deals with many controversial issues, such as the moral implications of an army using female child soldiers, the perils of underage drinking, and the absence of morality in war. Underneath many of Sora no Woto's seemingly innocent and light-hearted scenes lie some of mankind's darkest impulses. Sora no Woto is a great title in the fact that it can be at once both funny and horrifying. \\n\\n\r\nSora no Woto is a sleeper hit of true creativity and deep story-telling in an industry that is, for better or worse, saturated with light-hearted \u201cmoe\u201d titles. Unfortunately, the fans prefer the latter. I'm all for silly, non-sensical moe stuff from time to time, but serious works of art like Sora no Woto are needed to break up the monotony and add some variety to things. I feel a little offended that this stupendous title isn\u2019t more well-known or discussed in anime circles. But I guess that would just be a popularity contest. Yet if Sora no Woto was more popular, that would be great because more people would be aware of this great show, and be able to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nOnly then can they realize that these moments are the future\u2026\\n\\n",

            "content": "So Ra No Wo To is an original anime brought to us by A-1 Pictures. Yes, the studio behind Kuroshitsuji, Uchuu Kyoudai, Sword Art Online & Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin is back. Or, more accurately, I'm looking at one of their works again. Thus far, my experience with them as a studio has varied a lot. With Uchuu Kyoudai being at the high end and Sword Art Online on the low, because it's shit. This particular series is from 2010 and was relatively early in terms of their productions. It was written by Yoshino Hiroyuki, speaking of people I have mixed experiences with. Yeah, thisbloke also wrote Shuumatsu no Izetta, which was a great series and Dance in the Vampire Bund, which will always be remembered as utter rubbish. So, this one is a gamble. I'd give it about 50-50 odds.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nIn the far distant future, humanity seems to be running out of habitable land (now we know how all those species we've fucked over to build cities feel) and a lot of old technology has been lost. It's in this future that the country of Helvetia and the new Roman Empire are on the brink of war. We follow a young garrison on the border of No Man's land as they mostly faff about.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real criticism I have about the narrative is that the build up to the climax could have been handled better. It's largely relegated to the last few episodes with small bit beforehand that give very small hints and we're talking very basic like Rio's identity being obvious by the time she plays her role or the threat of war being omnipresent throughout.\\n\\n\r\nI do really like the way the series mixes a kind of standard slice of life style with the whole war scenario (Sort of like how he melded cutesy yuri romance with a war scenario in Izetta). It allows it to have that sense of fun and enjoyment while also leaving room for more serious, dramatic stuff and it never feels dissonant. The world building is really interesting and executed in a fully organic way. We don't just know the broad stroke details, we know very trivial everyday things like how life in Kanata's little village differs from life in the city of Seize (I know, not a subtle city name) because of geographical variations within the same nation. Which is a fascinating detail. The series has a good sense of humour as well. Filicia's way of confirming whether or not their visitor speaks their language is hilarious but it also makes sense. The whole episode where they all get pissed, save one, is really funny. There are good dramatic scenes too. No\u00ebl & Filicia both have some real tragedy to their back stories. Rio & Kureha have some as well but Kureha's plays less of a role and Rio's is kept a bit vague because they don't want to show the actual details and spoil the climax. Then we have the epic Amazing Grace scene. Those are words I never thought I'd string together, but it's a part of the climax and it's a superb scene. It's also interesting the way Helvetia and the Roman Empire have similar legends, but different takes on them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI quite like the cast in this series. They have enough complexity to carry the more dramatic scenes as well as enough quirkiness to make the humour strong. Which is something Gintama couldn't manage with over fourteen times the number of episodes. This is only a fourteen episode series and that's counting the two special episodes. I also appreciate the way the series connects the characters through most of the main cast having formative meetings with a certain person of note. He fleshes out their back stories enough to give them a sense of completion while also building up their dynamics with one another. Those dynamics are very nice too.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is well done. It moves smoothly and just generally does a good job at holding any given tone. I love some of the mechanical designs, especially the old tank that No\u00ebl spends a good portion of the series working on. I appreciate that the girls are given proper uniforms instead of going full GI Joe solely for the sake of having variety. But, in all fairness, GI Joe has a bunch of similar looking characters while this has characters with distinctive appearances.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nOur major characters are voiced by Yuuki Aoi, Kanemoto Hisako, Kobayashi Yuu, Endou Aya & Kitamura Eri. They're all absolutely fantastic. The side characters have good acting as well with the talents of Fukuen Misato, Yasokawa Mayuno, Ishizuka Unshou (don't be surprised if he asks whether you're a boy or girl) and others. Oshima Michiru's sound track is fantastic. Even the Amazing Grace motif and I'm saying that as someone who doesn't generally like that song.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a fair amount. This is one of those series where all the girls seem interested in one another. It's especially true at the point where they talk about their dreams. I don't want to spoil anything too specific since that episode takes place after the climax, but putting it in vague terms, one girl wants to be a bride. And I'm fairly certain she wants to marry the other girl she's been writing to, based on their dynamic and interactions. Another girl wants to stay with yet another female character forever and her expression along with the flush on her face when she says it indicates that she's thinking of tribadism and cunning linguistics. Plus the two of them are incredibly homo-erotic throughout.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nHow the hell did Yoshino write this, then write something as bad as Dance in the Vampire Bund directly after? Because this is a fantastic anime. Virtually everything about it works and works really well whereas that's practically the opposite. Is Yoshino actually twin brothers who take turns turning in what they've been working on with one being a complete knob and the other skilled? Does he lose all writing ability when exposed to indigo kryptonite? Is the studio working with both him and his goatee sporting counterpart from an evil opposite universe? Is it just\u00a0 that he was doing his best to adapt a really shit manga? Whatever the case, I'll give this series a 9/10. Next week, Fortune Quest: Yo ni mo Shiawase na Boukensha-tachi.",

            "content": "Cobbled streets, glass-faced shops, wooden chimneys, and wood-aged frames. Coupled with a tower vista and an annual festival, it's the ideal destination for a charming trip down Europe's Old World. Like time froze to pressure this place's quaint character. It's quite the reverse, though. This is as far as the technology has advanced... scratch that, regressed. This land is one of the few places on Earth that is still arable. Still habitable. Nothing but wasteland lays beyond, and it spreads, festers, an eternal reminder of past wars, even in present peace. The weapons nowadays aren't sticks and stones, mind you, but compared to today's standards,it's certainly antiquated and... somewhat anachronistic? Early to mid-19th century arms, spider tanks, walking armor, and trumpets.\\n\\n\r\nOriginally featured on the opening debut of \u201cAnime no Chikara,\u201d or the \u201cPower of Anime,\u201d a TV block dedicated to the creation of original Japanese animated series, Sound of the Sky was scripted by Hiroyuki Yoshino and directed by Mamoru Kanbe. Produced by A-1 Pictures, who has done other works such as Anohana, Working!!, Blue Exorcist, and Sword Art Online, we follow the daily dealings of the 4 female members of the 1121st Platoon of the Helvetian Army. Initially appearing as stock anime stereotypes, each main cast member is fleshed out, the backstories behind their behaviors fleshed out, one episode at the time. With each episode, a common denominator between them is discovered. Their lives have been defined by war. One is an orphan. Another is a valuable political asset. Still another is haunted by the horrors she unwittingly endured. Last is one haunted by the horrors she unwittingly committed. And then, we have the Platoon's newest recruit, Konata Sorami, an optimistic adolescent who volunteered for free bugle lessons. In the absence of functional radios, bugles have that advantage of being loud and distinct enough to offer some semblance of communication and coordination amidst whatever shit is raining from the sky or zipping past the ground, though that's hardly the reason she signed up for the task. Nor is it simply a matter of wanting lessons just because.\\n\\n\r\nSound of the Sky has a fantastic world setting. It's not very often a show incorporate the presence of different cultures interacting with each other, and more often than not, these cultures are usually organized into their own separate national entities and seldom have different speech. It's something else that this show is able to incorporate cultural identities both without and within state boundaries, pluralistic societies, in other words, and enrich it with it's own meticulously crafted folklore, religions, and customs, like something out of a Miyazaki film. I was particularly impressed with the use of different accents when the reality of different languages came up. Combined with the various festivals illustrated and mentioned throughout this show's going, it adds this sense of authenticity as well as immersion and scale. And yet they have commonalities between them, suggesting shared histories as well as demonstrating cultural biases, accentuated by geographic barriers, past fighting, and inflammatory propaganda. Many share similar mythologies on certain phenomenon, like the one presented in Episode 1. Many share similar values, a love for their homes and a disdain for unnecessary bloodshed. Many share similar sentiments toward one particular tune.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d by John Newton and William Cowper, and rearranged by Michiru Oshima, is the most defining piece played throughout the show, by the characters themselves as well as by the OST. Despite its roots as a religious hymn, there's a reason it has transcended to become the most universally recognized and lauded song throughout space and time. It's a captivating melody, the brass a capella of the trumpet, followed by the string cantata of the orchestra, to be sure, but what makes it inspiring is its message, a message that characterizes Sound of the Sky as a whole. That while there's still beauty in this world... that there's still hope. Hope despite the blasted landscapes. Hope despite the battered limbs. Hope despite the scarred psyches.  The show wouldn't be the same without it. Still beautiful to listen to is the OP, \u201cHikari no Senritsu\u201d or \u201cMelody of Light\u201d by Yuki Kajiura's Kalafina, whose lyrics, when sung by the combined passion of melody and harmony, reinforce this prevalent theme, to the point where the OP's climax, feels like a call to prayer. The flute gives way to classic guitar, cymbals, and xylophone that complement the voices, soon transitioning, transcending to chords of electric guitar and clangs of drum set that contribute a radiating sense of power. The visuals, depicting portrayals of the girls doing sedentary farming and closed-eyed reflection, courtesy of Kanbe, who also had a major hand in designing Elfen Lied's OP \u201cLilium,\u201d are inspired from the works of the Austrian symbolist painter, Gustav Klimt. ED, \u201cGirls be Ambitious\u201d by Haruka Tomatsu is, more or less, your uppity J-Pop single, reflecting, from the sounds to the looks, the show's slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the show has its issues with that aspect. On the one hand, it's a war fallout narrative. On the other, it's a slice of life. It's not as though these two different genres are mutually exclusive from each other.  After all, many a war's consist of mainly of small part's adrenaline and large part's tedium. Soldiers have lulls of at least informal leave out of their trenches or, if that isn't possible, in them. At times, it's a serious evaluation of war's toll on both places and people, both on the battlefield and beyond it. Depending on the tides of war, non-combatants can escape nearly unaffected. At others, it's cute girls doing cute things with military garb. It's like something out of K-On, and it doesn't help that the character facial models are indistinguishable from the other. The expressions these textures allow can come off to be emotive. They can also come off as distracting. If you're going to handle a subject as heavy as war's consequences, it must be handled with gravity. That isn't to say the show doesn't take itself lightly at times. For instance, Episode 7 deals with PTSD. Episode 8 deals with a juvenile-to-borderline fetish involving pee. In addition, it's often layered with a lot of subtlety. I love subtlety. But sometimes, I think it's too subtle for its own good, to the point I feel like I'm grasping straws. \\n\\n\r\nIn spite of its efforts come off as mature, it plays what is effectively its moe factor way too much to come off many a time as anything but. Though to what details that it does take itself seriously in, the staff behind this show can take some pride.\\n\\n\r\nI give Sound of the Sky a 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "When I was young and ignorant, I often cried a lot. Give me this, give me that, I didn't care - I wanted it now. My parent's go-to strategy? Hum.......\"Amazing grace, how sweet, the sound, that saved, the wretch, like me....\" Instantly, I would sleep. There's something magical, or, for a lack of a better word, penetrating about that song. It strikes right through your heart, uplifting your spirit and calming your soul. Sora no Woto evolves and becomes something truly wonderful with a powerful, underlying theme.\r\nThe story is wonderful; it starts off slice-of-lifey and really slow and painful, especially for the people who wanta grandiose story and perfect mood/tone. However, stick through the first half a dozen episodes, and you slowly fall in love with the characters. Throughout the beginning, there is an undertone of dread and mixed optimism, a bittersweet tang in the back of your mouth so to speak. The little hints and clues slowly build a bigger picture that encompasses the main story, eventually interfering with their perfect lives. I don't want to spoil anything because trust me, it gets pretty intense and riveting. I become to sympathise with the characters, their plight, their endless struggle against an unkind and unloving world. And throughout it all, there was the ominous, foreboding military. The overall theme is magnificent - it portrays a common struggle humanity constantly is at war with: aggression and ultimately, love.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is dazzling and spectacular. There's this cheery sort colors that blend with the moods of the characters. During the happy parts, the colors appeared lush and bright. The depressing or gloomy or grim moods brought storms, dark clouds, and other drab colors. There were vast mountain vistas and grand scenes of nature and of a quaint town. The setting depicted 18th century Europe accurately, with a technological quirk here and there. Everything was drawn to exact detail; the cobblestone streets, the distant snow on the mountains, the old vehicles - I almost felt like I was there.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the fact that Amazing Grace is one of my favorite songs, the sound continually surprised me. The trumpet sound was clean and pristine, reflecting the beautiful sceneries. The panoramic views and sound melded together perfectly. The OP was a foreshadowing of an important event; the ED was happy and go-lucky, as if to say, \"Phew, it's over.\" I listened to both, and ended up loving both. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were your typical cast of a slice-of-life - the tsundere, the carefree one, the authoritative one. In the general slice-of-life, there isn't a character arc; however, here there were major changes in personalities and attitudes. Dark secrets were revealed, and pasts were uncovered beneath once impenetrable outer masks. The characters themselves were standard only for the first couple episodes; once they dug deep, truths were uncovered that changed their perceptions about each other for a long time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed it thoroughly, much more than I originally thought. I loved the story progression and epic conclusion and little things both big and small. Though it may seem too happy-go-lucky for the first episodes, the dark nature and underlying tone eventually force their way to the surface, and prepare for a bumpy ride. Through music, a simple song can calm all.",

How about putting it like this: it's a show about how a bunch of relatively normal people live their everyday lives while having to deal with a world that's been ravaged by war, and how they cope with past losses and manage to find something to smile about in the present.\r\nThe first two episodes were a little shaky for me, but once they got the stuff like Kureha's Obligatory Tsundere Moment out of the way, each episode just gotbetter than the last. The slice of life tradition of finding something extraordinary in the everyday is made especially poignant by the post-apocalyptic backdrop. You watch all these little revelations and miniature adventures and you laugh and smile and then remember that this is a world where dolphins no longer exist, where nobody knows how to work a radio, where there are not enough children left in town to fill the old school building.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Sora no Woto does not spare the viewer from the harsh realities of its universe. Yes, most of the episodes are lighthearted, but the show never shies away from mentioning the darker facts, including plenty of dead parents, the completely desolate no-man's land, and some particularly chilling war flashbacks. And again, it's the dark that makes the light glow all the brighter.\\n\\n\r\nOne final general thing I think is worth mentioning is that I love the storytelling style. This anime never assumes the viewer is stupid when revealing plot points. It's all a matter of giving just enough hints that it's obvious, but never wasting time by saying, \"Yes, here's what actually happened.\" This applied in particular to episode 10, which has in my opinion been the best episode so far (like I said, they get better, though 7 and 10 are definitely peaks), where the plot reveals were simply a matter of confirming previous hints, and instead the impact of the episode was devoted to character interactions and development.\\n\\n\r\nMAL has given me categories to assign numbers to but I'm not huge on number ratings so I'll just write a quick sentence or two about each:\\n\\n\r\nStory: mostly slice-of-life episodic, but with a gradually building backstory that's currently coming to its climax. The episodic plots are quite enjoyable as well, if you're into the slice-of-life stuff.\\n\\n\r\nArt: people always say the characters look like K-On!. Fair enough. Don't expect the anime to be like K-On! however. Background art is beautiful in that tragic way post-apocalyptic scenery is.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I'm sure everyone and their mother has said this, but the music is great. The ending theme can cause some major emotional dissonance for the more serious episodes, however.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: as much as I've grown to love them I have to admit they're a bit cookie-cutter. There's plenty of development and backstory reveals throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: hopefully from the review it was obvious that I'm loving this. Your mileage may vary, but I'm really feeling the emotional connection here.",

But it is perfect in its imperfections. There is nothing I would change, not because there are no defects, but because I fear I may ruin the special intersection of accidents that makes this wondrous.\r\nSomeelements of the story are cliche, but the characters and world are strong enough that it earns its cliches, its moments of corn and cheesy smiles. Speaking of the world, the central town of Seize is one of my favorite places in television, a fragment of beauty cast adrift in a desertifying world. It's a gorgeous post-apocalypse.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis may not be for everyone, but if you like cute girls, good music, and finding what hope you can in a hopeless world, Sora no Woto may be for you.",

            "content": "Firstly, just to clarify, I am a casual anime watcher. I have up to this point watched only about four anime and don't necessarily care about deep storyline and characters, basically all I care about is enjoying it. And while I understand that somebody like me shouldn't really review shows, considering I don't have much to compare them to, I believe I can still tell, whether I've had a good time watching a show or not. And that's exactly what this is about. If you came for spiritual ascendancy or mindblowingly deep processes, this anime probably isn't going to be too enjoyable to you.\r\nHaving thatclarified, we can move on.\\n\r\nSo, the show. Basically what it's about is the coexistence of Kanata (protagonist), No\u00ebl (shy girl), Rio (cool leader), Kureha (tsundere) and Filicia (platoon captain). I'll soon go into the detailed explanation of the characters, but let me firstly cllarify where the story's taking place. In a very special version of post-apocalyptic Earth (mix of Japanese and European cultures) have nations formed again, and Kanata belongs to Helvetia, where she joins the army (to learn how to play the bugle) and is assigned to the 1121st platoon to protect the town of Seize. There she meets the other four girls in her squad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSome might complain the characters are one-dimensional and unoriginal, I've however enjoyed them as you can't find extremes in reality. Also while all of the major characters are women - which could be taken controversially, mainly as the story revolves around the military and army - I like the decision, as men in main roles are usually just kind of boring and bland, maybe too complex, and the decision of using girls just makes it feel more like a happy time without any big conflicts and slow paced sections.\\n\\n\r\n-Kanata - Incredibly energetic, moe AF and the kind of childish character that we all like and find in every second anime show. While the trait is overused a lot, I still didn't feel like she was just a bland, unoriginal character in there to provide \"cuteness\" and feeling of energy into the show. She is shown to have a decently well made history and I kind of like how she just joins the army for to me an extremely minor reason - learn to play the bugle. It nicely empathizes her character in a way.\\n\\n\r\n-No\u00ebl - A rather more serious character, basically the opposite of Kanata - although first shown as sleeping, she isn't a lazy character (as also seen in every second show), but rather a technically educated individual with shy traits. She spends a lot of time repairing the Takemikazuchi - an ancient disassembled tank their platoon was assigned. To me she was one of the most sympathetic characters with also a well made background on how she used her knowledge.\\n\\n\r\n-Kureha - a tsundere-type, often complains that No\u00ebl and Kanata don't take their work seriously and don't act like soldiers. To me probably one of the weaker characters, as I don't remember her background ever being mentioned and she just isn't too fun, on the other side, she's more believable then No\u00ebl or Kanata.\\n\\n\r\n-Rio  - Described as the cool girl hanging out with FIlicia, she is a character most of the others look up to. Teaches Kanata how to play the bugle and keeps the team together, fights for them if necessary.\\n\\n\r\n-Filicia - A rather passive character, doesn't do much, but she leads the platoon and is very often through camera angles shown to quickly change expression from a troubled one to happy and polite when speaking to Kanata or Kureha.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fairly nicely made, just like the soundtrack, I actually kind of like the combination of European/Japanese culture or at least the European culture as percieved by the japanese.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest point to me as mentioned before made the enjoyment of the show.\\n\r\nI absolutely loved how set back it was, just the five of them enjoying their time with their extremely outstretched personalities. Kanata being just moe and energetic all the time, No\u00ebl a bit antisocial, frank and repeatedly showing how much knowledge she has. Kureha getting mad for No\u00ebl and Kanata being laid back, them not following the army protocol like addressing them by their ranks etc. Rio had her own business to attend to, yet she found herself some time to be an example to the others and Filicia dissimulating her thoughts and problems.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end [a minor spoiler alert]\\n\r\nThe roman soldier spoke german, and as I can speak german pretty decently myself (not native speaker though) I could pretty much understand what the roman soldier said, even though her accent was way too exaggerated, but had difficulties understanding Yumina due to her heavy japanese accent. Still find it funny though.",

            "content": "Everybody has that one show that really REALLY gets them interested in the wider world of whatever medium that show is linked to. Before this one in particular, anime was something that just existed to me, all anime was just edgier cartoons when I was growing up. I watched series like Dragon Ball and Yu Yu Hakusho thinking they were everything anime was. I was a dumb kid and all that mattered to me was the spectacle, but on whim, the series in question brought me to understand a lot more about myself then I thought I did.\r\nAs a young man at the time, Iwas pretty hard to impress and mostly went into anything not expecting much of value. I was not one for subtlety and quietness or even anything requiring much thought. However, almost immediately, the atmosphere of it all grabbed me by the balls. I like war stories, always have, that was the main draw to it.\\n\\n\r\nEverything about it I couldn't help but love, even if the cute girls doin shit aspect was a concern of mine. Ultimately, it led me to appreciate the quietness in storytelling, as well as change my views completely on how I feel about art in the grand scheme of things. As cliche as it sounds, it literally did change my life. I definitely would not have the same mindset and values without it. Sound of the Sky was the groundwork on how I would grow as an individual, and the things I would come to appreciate about life in general.\\n\\n\r\nBut all this praise comes from a feeling of respect for it. I'm not afraid to view it at face value, it is a cute girls do things series, and to be honest, it's probably not for most people who are looking for something with more.... to find I suppose. Not that there isn't anything of substance, its just not the most fast paced show, and it probably won't have anything of substance for most people like it did for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe point is that if this is the kind of thing your looking for, I would recommend it. If not however, there might be something else for you in it, and if not that? Then you could skip it if you want.",

            "content": "After watching this anime, I really can't help as to wonder as to what is the main theme of this thing; is it the female cahracters struggling to find a way to ease their boredom co'z they're assigned in some outpost which is too far away from any action  or is it the bugle call \"AMAZING GRACE?\" So, how do I rate this anime? Here's how:\r\nStory: Fair 6.\r\n Ok, so the genre of this anime are the following: Military, Shonen, Sci-fi, Musical, Action (appred only in the last 2 episodes) and Comedy (just a little bit). However amongst the genre only the musical partis most prevelent pertaining to Kanata's bugel calls, everything else are trivial and a mediocre  of \"Make love not war\" kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Poor poor 3.\\n\r\nQuestion: what the heck was the artist thinking when he or she got inspiration to don the Helvetia soldiers (feamle charcters inculded) in a Nazi style uniform, which by the way inculdes the utility vehicles and the guns that they use except the tanks, also the Roman soldiers were donned with a wrong kind of uniform, in reality, during WW2 the Italian (Roman) army donned an Olive Gray uniform and not the typical WW2 Soviet Style uniform, frankly everythings that were drawn were composed bits and pieces of something during WW2 that the artist of this anime seem to based it from ..  \\n\\n\r\nSound: Dreadful 2.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're talking about the opening theme, I hate it.\\n\r\nIf you're talking about the various bugel calls inculding the \"Amazing Grace,\" I say it's a bit of a Sacrilege (pataining to the \"Amazing Grace\") to even make it part of the anime. The said bugel call is reserve only to a solidier, fireman or any member of the law enforcement unit who died in the line of duty. There is a diffrent bugel call which is used to call for a truce, and I'm surprise that the author of this anime doesn't know it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not unusual for a female soildier to be regulated for guard duty or any non-combat duty. So, if the setting is in some European country then all charcters should sport european names, particulary in German, unfortunatly most of the charcters still have Japanese names like: Kanata Sorami, Rio Kazumiya, Kureha Suminoya and Noel Kannagi. On the other hand, the supporting character Aisha Aldola is not a typical roman name, The character's name is more like a combination of French with a touch of Spanish, also she should be speaking Italian or latin instead of German.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: Fair 6\\n\\n\r\nAs in fair enough to be watch by all ages.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTrivia: During WW2 the Soviet Red Army utilizes women for sniper duties.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll start off by saying I am not a fan of CGDCT anime. I didn't like K-ON, I hated GochiUsa. I had all but given up on the genre. Then I watched Sora no Woto, and it blew my ass away. This anime just does so many things right.\r\nThe Setting - A girl decides to join the army in order to learn the trumpet and is sent to a garrison in a small town on the outskirts of their country. There's more to their world than meets the eye, but you should see it for yourself. It's full of subtle world building which I neverexpected from this kind of show.\\n\\n\r\nThe Scenery - This show's scenery is absolutely beautiful. Another thing that I love about this show is that a lot of its scenes take place at unusual times or in unusual weather. That is, rather than 99% of the show taking place during sunny afternoons, a lot of the scenes happen during the evening, night, or rainy days. I'd say it rained for about half of the show's episodes actually. It's very refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Atmosphere - Possibly the best atmosphere I've ever seen in any anime. There's a slightly melancholic tone that carries throughout the whole show. I was in love with it right from the start of episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters - Very good characters for a CGDCT show. When you're first introduced to them, you may think they're stereotypical. When I first saw them I went \"Here's the kuudere. There's the tsundere.\" However, thankfully, those traits are subdued and you quickly see that there's far more to them than that. The characters actually somewhat feel like real people. What I loved the most about them, is that every single one in the main cast has real flaws. Not those typical CGDCT flaws like 'oh, she often sleeps past important events' or 'oh she's a little airheaded' that are only there to make the characters more cute. No, they have actual, proper flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music - The music is just straight up fantastic. It does its job as well as it possibly could. It, at times, has an air of mystery, and at times an air of hopefulness, and it's always a joy to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nThe Specials - Make sure you watch them. They're on par with the rest of the series and should definitely not be skipped. The first one is episode 7.5  and should be watched after episode 7, while the second should be watch after finishing the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe Flaws - 1. Kind of a nitpick here, but while the animation is generally good, it can get wonky at times. Especially when the focus is on zoomed out characters. When the animation needs to be good though, it is. 2. I found the conversations and the way the characters speak in one specific episode a tad over-dramatic. Could be just me though, as some others find the episode in question to be great and count it as one of their favorites. 3. While I found the characters to be good, the best I had seen in any CGDCT show, they're still not *great* and could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nThe Conclusion - I loved this show. I think this is the epitome of the CGDCT genre. Even if, like me, you don't usually like these kinds of shows, you should definitely give this one a try. And if you are a fan of CGDCT, you could find this show a nice breath of fresh air. This is, however, a slice of life. So if you're looking for constant action or whatever, you obviously won't find it here. But if you're looking for a laid back show with a great setting and atmosphere, you'd be doing yourself an injustice skipping this.",

            "content": "It was really hard for me to tell what to expect from this show as I started to watch. It was also hard to come into the show WITHOUT having K-ON in the back of my mind as I looked at the art style of the characters (and I apologize in advance as I\u2019m probably going to be doing comparisons to that show, but mainly to show that this is not K-ON).  The synopsis on this site is quite vague, and with this being part of the Anime no Chikara project, there's no knowledge of the full story as there was no prior mangathat it was based on (though a simple search can find you the details you need at this point). Yet despite all these, I took the plunge into the series and came out satisfied overall.  \\n\\n\r\nBasically we have a moe slice of life show applied on a military skin with a musical influence with the brass being the focus (mainly trumpet, but also bugle).  The Yui-look-a-like Kanata comes in with a similar musical knack about her, though not of natural musical skill, but instead regarding her uncanny perfect pitch in how she can identify notes in just about everything around her. With regards to the level of moe, it's nowhere near as extreme as something like K-ON is, but is rather a more natural fit to the setting and the characters in comparison.  There aren\u2019t any moments where it goes into chibi-mode with silly music and colorful bubbly backgrounds.  It maintains the same art style with your standard portrayal of the emotional palate.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the setting, most of the story takes place in the town and the fortress.  From the first episode onward, they do a good job portraying the livelihood and the colorful traditions of the townsfolk.  They do give tastes of the post-war world when they show various crumbling structures, ruins, the vast barrens of Nomansland, and through character flashbacks.  The various themes that this show has provide an interesting angle.  There\u2019s a bit of a supernatural theme as we get tastes of ghosts, spirits, and legends of angels and demons and whatnot.  There\u2019s even a bit of mafia-like action, surprisingly.  As for the military aspect, and in particular with events towards the end of the show, we get to see a much more serious side of things with the drama between Rome and Helvetia as well as with the characters themselves.  When you step back and take a look at all these parts, it is quite a strange mixture of elements.  Some aspects of this concoction work while others, not quite so much.\\n\\n\r\nThe core to this anime I feel ultimately revolves around the relationships between the characters.  Between the townspeople, the church (if you want to call it that), and the military, they do a good job to show the varying interactions they have, such as some townspeople\u2019s dealings with the military, the role of the military in the town, and the hardships of post-war orphans and their caretakers to name some examples.  Most importantly is the relationship that the five girls share with each other and how their personalities sometimes clash but ultimately mesh together.\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 7:  I\u2019d have to say the backdrop of the story is quite interesting and that the ultimate direction, though it takes long to develop into anything, is decent.  My main complaint was that it seemed to take a long time for stuff to happen, with a lot of episodes spent on character development and slice of life moments.  The main plot elements only showed their face in the last few eps.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 8:  Sure it\u2019s hard not to associate the character art-style with K-ON, but they are drawn well, animations are fluid, and the backgrounds and settings are well done, such as the landscape, the rolling clouds in the skies, the rain, and the snowfall.  Oh, and the Takemicaduchi is pretty sweet.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 10:  The seiyuus fit the roles well with regards to the personalities of the characters, but where it shines is the soundtrack.  The music goes great with the mood and setting, and the OP and ED I think both show what the show is about with the ED showing the lighter side and the OP showing the more deep side (thumbs up for Kalafina).  The use of French in some of the background songs and the style of music really gave me the feeling of the small remote town of Seize.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 7:  I think that the characters were developed decently and they gave enough time showing the background information on each one of the major players, though not so much with Kureha.  The mains may have fit certain standard archetypes, such as clumsy, tsundere, and so forth, but I think their personalities are interesting enough, especially Rio, maybe Felicia a little, and Noel as well.  They did well in showing the bond that the girls share with each other as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 7:  Like I said, main downside for me was the pace, but it wasn\u2019t like it was difficult to sit through or anything.  There were some fairly emotional moments and such, but then again I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m easily moved in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 8 (7.8):  It surpassed my initial expectations which weren\u2019t that high to begin with and was a decent watch.  Not bad by any means, but not superb either.  I think your view will really depend on how you approach it.  It touched on several things, but I don\u2019t think it was trying to really excel at anything in particular.  I think it\u2019s a story of friendship, hope, and humanity, with the military aspect simply being part of the setting.\\n\\n\r\n(I\u2019m curious to see how the next Anime no Chikara project will turn out, as that looks to be a bit more interesting and deeper in terms of the story.)",

            "content": "It isn't often that I watch an anime with mixed or average reception as I don't want to gamble wasting time on a dull series. However, it is only then that I find shows as woefully underrated as So Ra No Wo To. As others have pointed out, I think perception of this show has suffered due to unfair associations with K-ON!, as if K-ON! single-handedly invented both the moe art-style and the slice of life genre. But, I digress.\r\nStory: 7\r\nSo Ra No Wo To plays out in pretty typical episodic fashion until the final few episodes. Those looking for an epic military drama shouldlook elsewhere as this show is more akin to a light deconstruction of the \"cute girls do cute things\" genre that has become prevalent in the past decade.\\n\r\nThe greatness of the story comes from the incredibly interesting setting that the writers and art directors have crafted. The world is multi-faceted with plenty of attention to detail. I find it fascinating that the world is so well designed that almost any gripe can be explained away with logic. Why would the military accept such young girls? Because the military will take any able body. Why would these girls all end up at the same outpost? Because they are in a low risk area that borders a no-mans-land and are therefore seen as non-essential. Why would Kanata join the military just to learn how to play the trumpet? Because it is the only feasible means of musical education in a world ravaged by war.\\n\r\nThe writers also do a great job of sprinkling in plot details along the way that are subtle and don't feel hamfisted in the slice-of-life episode format.\\n\r\nOne complaint I do have is that some supernatural elements introduced at the beginning and reiterated near the end of the series go unexplained, though I'm sure it would have been difficult to explain them given the show's format.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art in this show is held to a very high standard and is some of the best I've seen from shows produced by A-1. The backgrounds are breathtaking at times. The old cobbled streets of the town, Seize, the dilapidated warehouse in Clocktower Fortress, and the lush mountains with scattered ruins of a bygone age really give the viewer an excellent grasp of the setting and its unique past. I felt at home in Seize by the end of the series and that really shows a great deal of care was put into the art.\\n\r\nThe animation is of a similar high quality and those who write it off as \"another moe blob show\" should really pull the stick out of their arse. The characters are visually well designed and distinct and their mannerisms represent their personalities splendidly.\\n\r\nCG is used to animate the mech-like battle tanks and this works just fine for the majority of the show since there is only a single tank. However, towards the end when there are many tanks on screen, the CG can be visually jarring. Really though, I've seen far worse.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nAs is typical, the Japanese dub was superb. Rio's gruff voice was an excellent contrast to Kanata's peppy, adorable voice. Each seiy\u016b filled their respective trope with each character and made them each as lovable as they were adorable.\\n\r\nWith at least a general focal point of the show being music, the soundtrack should be held to a rather high standard. Once again, Michiru \u014cshima shows why she is one of the greatest anime composers in the world. The soundtrack beautifully understates the setting with soaring orchestral moments, contemplative mandolin, and a track sung in French that stirs just the right emotions when it needs to. Being a citizen of the United States, I am easily bored to tears listening to Amazing Grace, but \u014cshima's arrangement for So Ra No Wo To actually brought me to (non-boredom) tears because it worked so well within the context of the show. Somewhere between her work on ICO and the original Fullmetal Alchemist, this soundtrack captures the essence of the show perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nBeing a slice of life show at its core, So Ra No Wo To relies on its characters rather than a succinctly presented story. Though the members of the 1121st Platoon do tend to fit neatly into the mold of slice of life tropes, they also offer unique and varied backstories that help define their personalities. In a world of near constant warfare, some of these characters have had incredibly traumatic pasts and it is interesting to see in what ways they have grown to overcome the bleak realities they've faced. I also love how each character is revealed to have a specific reason for being in the military and at Clocktower Fortress. The citizens of Seize are also great characters that show how life has been for those outside of the wide-reaching military.\\n\r\nKanata is the perfect character to offset the more depressing aspects of the other characters and the setting with her unending hopefulness. This leads to some charming dialogue as she interacts with the members of the 1121st.\\n\r\nThe special episodes from the OVA are a must watch as they help round out the characters and likewise the show as a whole.\\n\r\nWhile many of the characters had wonderful scenes dedicated to exploring their past, I was surprised at how little was actually displayed about Kanata's past. Aside from a recurring flashback, it is unclear where and how she grew up. I also would have enjoyed seeing more of No\u00ebl's backstory, though what was shown was enough to understand her actions in the show. The \"villain\" who appears towards the end was very one-dimensional and was used more as a plot device than a character, but it works just fine within the context of the final episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show much more than I thought I would. Through a mix of low expectations and high reward, So Ra No Wo To really surprised me and offered a wonderful experience in a short 14 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThe definition of a hidden gem.",

            "content": "Style - I didn't like the character design at all. Too much moeblob for me. The animation was pretty good though, so 2 out of 3. \r\nCharacter - The characters are childish. Kanata is your given naive pacifist moeblob. Actually all of the main characters in the story are pacifists. Why do I hate pacifists again? Oh yeah, appeasement led to Hitler taking over Europe and WW2. Despite all the time they spend together, very little information is revealed about the characters' pasts. We only find out right at the end that Noel was once a killing machine and one of the characters is aprincess or something like that. So not a whole lot of character development goes on, in comparison to world building. Also, everyone treats Kanata like a child, and there was sudden angst from the more mature characters nearer the end. Also, they committed treason by hiding an enemy soldier and not reporting it. So 0 out of 4. \\n\\n\r\nStory - The world building in this anime is pretty good. However, the girls barely do any military training at all. You would expect them to have some practice down at the range once a week at least. Nope. They never have target practice or physical training. That's fine when you're just going around and playing music to cheer up the troops, but they're supposed to be guarding an outpost for god's sake. The only things they seem to do were search and rescue missions and planting crops. Then it suddenly got serious nearer the end with the threat of actual war but no worries! Kanata playing her trumpet stopped the enemy army of thousands of tanks right in their tracks (or legs)! Oh and, Rio suddenly appears at the exact moment that the armies were going to re-attack and announces a peace treaty. Frankly speaking, the anime was boring and random for pretty much all the episodes up till the last few episodes, where it suddenly got serious - seriously preachy, that is. 0 out of 3. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 2 out of 10 for moeblobs, treasonous appeasement pacifists and initially random and boring then suddenly serious and preachy story.",

            "content": "Sora No Woto was one of those series where pairing up against a full length anime would be unfair.\r\nLet's start with the plot:\r\nIt all begins when teenage soldier Sorami Kanata joins her latest company to learn to play the trumpet and ends up with a small group of teenage girls on the outskirts of some mythical country after WWIII and on the brink of another major war (at least that's what I presume). From there, there's no other plot development besides this myth about these \"fire maidens\" and how this group of five girls protect the city just like these maidens did in legend.\r\nNow theactual review:\\n\r\nIn my opinion, for the series's genre, it was a well composed anime with no details left out. Kanata's interactions with her fellow soldiers and superiors display the thin set emotions of those on the brink of war. It a sense it's almost like a rendition of a Vietnam vet's recollection of the war. Everyone has some war related history that dramatically effects the way they think and operate, plus they really tug at your heart strings. The way plot twists were set up were also timely and didn't leave that \"really did that just happen\" taste.\\n\r\nHowever there are always things to pick on and I can certainly dissect this one. For starters (this really isn't a serious point but w.e.) this plot description could haveve totally been an ecchi. Second, all the war action only appeared at the end of the series, which would have been nice to see through out the whole thing. Lastly, this series seemed like it could have easily been a legitimate full length series, but hey, beggars can't be choosers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10, it fit neatly into its genre description, but wasn't ground breaking (mostly because it was a slice of life). Personally I would recommend this to those out there who are bored and just want to kill time while waiting for a different anime to add a new episode or something.",

The story is about the protagonist entering the military to learn how to play the trumpet and her interactions with her platoon-mates and the townspeople. I didn't really find the story overly interesting, it was ok with a few cry-able moments, but pretty average for me. So a 7/10.\r\nThe art was good. I felt that the animation was nicely done with quite a lot of details being put into the art. Hence, I'm rating it as a 9/10\r\nNow for thebest thing about the anime: The sound, more specifically, the music. The opening was great, kinda sounded like an folks-tale type of song. But my favorite was Amazing Grace. Wonderfully and beautifully played by the protagonists on the trumpet, a music which I will remember for years to come. A perfect 10/10 for sound(music)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, they are pretty well done. Favorite character is Kanata due to her non-stop enthusiasm. So an 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy the anime especially for some parts. An 8/10 for enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, average story, great art, exceptional music, good characters and enjoyment. Final rating is an 8/10",

            "content": "Sound resounds. And three years later it resounded its way to me.\r\nMy experience in anime is limited, but some previous engagements made me acquire some resistance to moe types, not as in repulsion, but as in \"I can take degrees of moe without worrying much about it\".\r\nBut anyway, when I had found out about this anime a few weeks ago (simply by noticing a *chan reaction image which featured the characters laughing in the ED), I expected something like: \"The little cheery bugler brings hope and cheer to her fellow fighting soldiers on the bitter battlefield\". That's kind of what I was looking for whenI noticed it, some sort of feely sweet story about hope and just to remain cheery even when the world is at war. And that's relatively close to what I got. Relatively.\\n\\n\r\nA humorous text has been written to describe this anime, and it brings attention to the mash of cultures and nationalities there are in a single space which I have read many people call \"moeblob\". And that is kind of true, but as with other fiction works, what is not explained does not necessarily mean there is controversy or that there is a plot hole, and I personally find extremely fun and amusing to, after each episode, sit and start imagining ways to explain what was not explained in the episode. The many questions brought up by So Ra No Wo To can have some sort of underground connection and coherency between them, if you have the imagination to look for it. Even if you do not find it fun to do so, the approach of \"the characters themselves do not know exactly how things went, and to have this notion of unknown if part of the experience\" is also valid. And world parallelism is also valid, but not as fun.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I started watching my first impression was that the facial animation was kind of crude, might even call it \"weird\". But it quickly gets better. \\n\r\nAs said by many other reviews, the background and scenarios are astounding, and that they are indeed, although personally I didn't pay much attention to them. But I'm not really the kind of guy who likes to go sightseeing anyway...\\n\r\nMany things about this anime I found out by reading reviews and archived discussions about it, such as Spanish/Chinese traditions, geographical and historical speculations, and other stuff, so I recommend looking for them straight away. During the OP, there are many scenes clearly mimicking some paintings, even if you don't know them. There is also a short scene in which all the girls are seen from the back, laying on fours; and unaware viewers (such as myself) would immediately assume that's some sort of fan service, but upon some research, even that scene was mimicking a famous (?) painting.\\n\\n\r\nAs with the characters, they all appear some sort of stereotype first, the motherly figure, the tsundere \"serious business\" kid, the sleepy mr. fixit genius, the tough sergeant, and the air-headed overly cheery and naive Kanata. As the series progresses and hints are slowly (very slowly) dropped, you get to know better how did each character has grown to become the figure they are. I'll give this one, almost all of them have some sort of PTSD (war veteran survivor, war orphan, etc.). Except for Kanata, she remains like that for the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nThe songs are indeed amazing, and while everyone will highlight \"amazing grace\", which regardless of its beauty alone plays a MAJOR role on the story, I myself have been charmed by \"Servante du Feu\" and by that other instrumental song which plays on the final credits. The OP shows the air of mysticism behind the legend that sorrounds the story, and the ED reinforces the \"be cheery, because why would you not be?\".\\n\\n\r\nIn overall? a very very good piece of work. Outstanding if you can get the message and the world-building right.\\n\r\nIt presents itself in many contrasts, the grim bitter world in the army on a post apocalyptic setting, with a cheery girl that goes through it all only with her hope, her bugle, and her friends. It is sweet and cute without being forced, it is emotional without trying to milk your eyes, it is exciting without explosions everywhere, a must see that will resound in your memory.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the part with spoilers:\\n\r\nMany people say it's ridiculous that Kanata suddenly learns to play the bugle after one single advice from a single guy. Sometimes all you need is a single \"eureka\" realization, a single advice about something, something that shows you what you were doing wrong to achieve something. Happened to me more than once.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I've noticed people failed to see, is that the \"episodic\" appeal for the first half of the series which they say has only the appeal of \"being episodic\", has in fact great importance in the overall plot. It was Kanata being together with the 1121st platoon that brought many changes to them. Kanata made Rio change her overall attitude, which culminates on her taking her position as princess or something; Kanata helps N\u00f6el fix the Takemikazuchi targeting system, which is used to save Kureha and Klaus, which is also used to save-the-day-from-war in the end; Kanata strengthened the relations between the populace and the fort, which resulted in the people standing against the 9th mobile; and most importantly, she tightened the relations of her fellow members even more, and because of this they are able to accomplish all they do.",

            "content": "Sora no Wato is a series which attempts to merge two distinct story telling styles into one coherent story, but does it work? With the setting of a post-apocalyptic Earth that is still enduring a multitude of wars between the remaining nations, the focus is on a young teen girl, Sorami Kanata, who has enlisted in the army to pursue her goal of learning to play the bugle. It's through Kanata's eyes and her experiences as a new army recruit that we learn the stories of the women in the 1121st platoon and the greater story of a world that seems to be drawing toa close in its twilight.\\n\\n\r\nIt's when we meet Kanata and her new battalion sisters that we quickly realize that these characters evoke a sense of deja vu. We've seen each of these girls before: Kanata, the young, naive, clumsy and endlessly optimistic heroine, Rio the tough beautiful big sister, Felicia the caring and somewhat lax captain. Rounding out the battalion are Kureha, physically the smallest girl of the group who strives eagerly to fulfill her role as a soldier, and No\u00ebl, the emotionally-reserved and technical genius of the group.\\n\\n\r\nIf it feels as if you've seen these characters before, it's because you have, and you've probably seen them in many previous shows. From their visual design to their personality traits, there's little to separate them from the common character archetypes that seem to be so prevalent in modern series. It feels a bit jarring throughout the series to see characters that wouldn't be out of place in a high school classroom interact in war torn world set in the distant future. The fact that they're soldiers modelled after late 19th and 20th century military makes it feel even more out-of-place.\\n\\n\r\nThe core story does make up, to a large extent, the hurdle of buying into these seemingly misplaced characters. Through 12 episodes, the efforts at world building largely succeed. The setting of this new Earth feels believable with some really great touches of detail in the design of the environments and supporting characters. As the story advances, we're given small glimpses of  the catastrophic events which shaped the world, and it definitely motivates you to want to learn more.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the quality of the show is top notch, along with its animation. The background art is a standout with its sweeping vistas of the countryside and battlefields. The architectural designs of the buildings and the main town are particularly well done, capturing a period feel that is convincing in its details. Although we don't get to see as much of it as we'd want, the design of the military hardware was obviously done with a lot of thought and consideration.\\n\\n\r\nTouching on that last point, the military aspect of the story is something I would've loved to have seen more in this series, but it disappointingly takes a back seat. As the episodes build up and teases towards the climax, when it finally plays out, it concludes all too soon. The focus is clearly on the girls and how these characters, who seem to have been transplanted from another dimension, manage to survive and find their way in a world that is crumbling around them.\\n\\n\r\nIt mostly works because we want to buy into these characters who are undeniably appealing and easy to connect with. We do learn more about their stories, although there's nothing particularly surprising or unexpected as their curtains are drawn back bit by bit. In that sense, Sora no Wato does feel very much like two different shows that have been forcibly merged together. I would've liked the characters to have been designed with less of a focus on accessibility. There were too many times where they felt alien against a backdrop that was full of potential.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the sometimes immersion-breaking aspects of the characters, Sora no Wato is still a very entertaining series. Although the viewer's hand is held often throughout the story, the characters are still quite appealing and with the effort and care put into the world building, the show succeeds as a whole.",

            "content": "So Ra No Wo To is not your run-of-the-mill Slice of Life themed anime, inspiring more than just a \"cute girls doing cute things\" feel. However, like many SOL anime with such an adorable cast of characters, it is tempting to watch in one sitting...\r\nIt took me a while to get around to watching this anime because I didn't know what to anticipate. The art style excited me, but over time the title collected dust on my Plan to Watch list, and it wasn't until I started watching more military themed anime that I gathered the motivation to watch it. Nearly 6 years after itaired, I watched what I consider to be one of the most sentimental anime I've seen, all thanks to the more brilliant parts of the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime stand out is its epic soundtrack. It doesn't just sound good, it makes you feel something. It will lift your spirits one moment, and cause you to get misty-eyed the next. Music is easily So Ra No Wo To's most applaudable element.\\n\\n\r\nMy initial and final reactions to the art were the same: Moe! This is an undeniably positive point for many watchers out there, including myself. The landscapes and nature were beautiful in such a way that, at times, you may feel like you've set foot in So Ra No Wo To's world of music and strife. The style isn't unique, but it is again and again likable and heartwarming.\\n\\n\r\nSignificant character growth occurs in So Ra No Wo To, though several more episodes would have given the anime more depth. Even after you've watched it all, it still feels as though some things were missing. That being said, some of the best scenes in the anime happened because of the way that the characters grew not only individually, but together as members of the same platoon.\\n\\n\r\nOne word that continues to come to mind when I reflect on So Ra No Wo To is 'unexpected'. I did not expect it to be something I would enjoy as much as I ultimately had. My favorite moment came as a complete surprise, and was one of the best scenes I've ever seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nI find So Ra No Wo To to be a timeless anime. It can be compared to other anime for its looks, but few anime succeed to kindle such powerful feelings in their viewers.",

Eventhough this anime is about a platoon during a time of near war it never goes into that overly dramatic hectic story like many does. It keeps it peacefull apporoach through alot of it while telling the story of each main character after time and never rushes them. Also the art for me was very pleasent to look at while the music is beautifully used to created this what i would call peacefull place. The story is as original i feel as it can be though the main characterkeeps the typical naive airhead as many anime has these days it still manage to overcome that in a great way. I have rewatched this anime more than once so i mean it very much when i say that its fun and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nIf your one who hates slowgoing anime with little action in the way of explosions and fights this is not one for you. But if your one who likes a nice relaxing feel to it while the story goes forth then its deffinetly worth watching. \\n",

The bond between these characters is cute and complex. Each of them hold dark pasts that effect them allot.\r\nThe head of the command is Filicia, who seems to be a strong, wise leader, anda little pervy as well x-). Although she seems light hearted, her past effects her greatly.\\n\\n\r\nNoel is a very smart and interesting character, and one of my favorites in this series. Often falling asleep and rarely saying much. \\n\\n\r\nWhat seems to be the second in command of this fleet is Rio, an understandable, kind but also terror person. \\n\\n\r\nCompared to the all the characters Kureha doesn't seem to have any background, and I tout she would have an interesting one. She seems jealous of Kanata, but this aspect of her seems to be forgotten as the series go on, not resolved, but forgotten (...well I thought so anyway).\\n\r\nSort of amusing the way she takes the whole army fleet seriously, as she seems to be the only character in the group that does, which I like.\\n\\n\r\nLast is the out sweet cute main character: Kanata. As I said before she's very cute, and has a natural gift of music. Where ever she came from, her home seemed to be detached from the rest of the world. \\n\\n\r\nThe other minor characters in this series, including the main ones, seem to have a powerful bond and are all easy to like and admire.\\n\\n\r\nCertainly a strong factor in this series.\\n\\n\r\n*Art*\\n\r\nThe city is beautiful, and I'll love to visit it if it ever existed. A sort of remote Italien look, with its tanned red, old buildings. With the impressive art, you'll never admire such a city. \\n\r\nThe characters also seem to move freely and look believable, compared to other anime's. \\n\\n\r\n*Story*\\n\r\nSadly, a slow, ineffective plot. That doesn't seem to get the 'wow' factor, although you can see it tried. \\n\r\nHowever, the music Kanata makes at the end does send a shivers down your spine in a good way.\u00a0\\n\r\nIt also seemed very far fetched, the machines and the unexpected and fast pace ending climax seem to come out of no where!?! and strangely enough it runs away again before you sort of notice they've happend. If you get what I mean:-)\\n\\n\r\nI say some people may like the plot, but I didn't really. I personally thought it was weak, and didn't seem to climax when it obviously tried.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall*\\n\r\nA good anime with its characters and Art work, but sadly the most important factor: the story, seem to be weak.\\n\r\nHowever the other two factors bring my view up to a 6/10\\n\\n\r\nBut give it a go for fun!:-)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've heard this series takes a lot of criticism because the plot shows up in only for the last two episodes, and also because it builds this beautiful, post-apocalyptic world that it never explores. So many people write it off as \"bad\" because the show doesn't go down the same well-worn path you would expect a futuristic military story to follow.\r\nBut I think that the creators of this anime specifically tried to avoid that Star Wars-esque story arch because they wanted to tell a more realistic tale. Not everyone is going to be Shinji or Luke Skywalker and save the universe with his inner strength.\r\nHowdo people (young women, in this case) cope in a land torn apart by war? How does it affect their everyday lives? What do they think of what happened in the past (very well done in Sora no Woto with the angel myths/flame guardian legend)? Do they find solace in the church, in music like Rio, or in each other, like Felicia? The situation of humanity in this world is so messed up; how have people adjusted? How can someone who's seen such terrible things, like Felicia has, find happiness? How do you deal with the devastation that follows after every giant mecha/war anime series ends?\\n\\n\r\nWell it turns out that even when the hero's out saving the world, the rest of us still have to do laundry and find a way to smile. And that's what the series is about.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that and subtle fanservice. I love me some implied lesbian rape.",

            "content": "If somebody ask me Why i watched this anime then i will say because of the slice of life genre. Slice of life is one of my favorite genre so whenever i found one i watch it. I was searching for a good anime to watch and i found one. So Ra No Wo To or Sound of the sky is really a beautiful name and the same can be said for the anime. It was really good. It exceeded my expectations. \r\nStory and Art: 8\r\nWhen i watched  the trailer of this anime i was quite disappointed with the art but after completing theseries i can say that art was really good. It was quite different from other anime which i have already completed. It was really good. Story of the anime was also good. One of the genre of anime is military but it was not same anime as others like Youjo senki or Gate. This anime made me smile and in some scenes i laughed too. So i was not disappointed with the story. The story was well paced. Well it is a slice of anime so it was deemed to be good in its story. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9\\n\r\nI gave the highest rating to music of this anime. Music was also one of the genre of So Ra No Wo To and it was really good. They main focus was on the musical instrument was trumpet. Even in war trumpet was used to give signals to the army. I was really surprised when i saw that they use trumpet in war. It was really a good idea of using trumpet in war. There was a song which Kanata played in the 12th episode to stop the armies of the both side. well that was not the first time when that song was played but that song played an important role in 12th episode to stop the war. The main character Sorami Kanata wanted to learn to play trumpet and that's why she joined the army because she can learn to play trumpet in army for free. I can say that music was the best thing about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nAbout characters they were all really good. All the characters were equally focused and that's the thing i liked about this anime. In first few episodes they showed the growing relation of Sorami Kanata with the other members of the 1121 platoon. Each character had their own tragic past except Sorami Kanata. Her past was not really shown. Only thing they shown about her past is that she had met the princess Iliya and because of her she started playing trumpet. I was really blown away when i got to know about the past of Kannagi Noel. I was really surprised. Even i never thought that she was the ........... . Sorry but i cannot tell you about her past. You need to watch it yourself. And i hope you watch this anime. Only thing i can say about the characters that they were well introduced and each of the character got sufficient time in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nIf somebody were to ask me that i enjoyed this anime or not then i will say without any doubt that i enjoyed this anime. The most funny thing i like about this anime is the main character Sorami Kanata. Well i after watching the trailer of the anime i kind of got the hint of that how funny she will be in the anime and i was right. She was most funny. \\n\r\nThis is my second review and i am really sorry for my bad English. I hope this review will be useful to you all. I highly recommend this anime to you all. Please watch it if you want some anime with slice of life, music and some great comedy. I hope you enjoy it.",

            "content": "What is the Earth like three centuries after an attempted alien invasion? One answer is Soro no Woto.\r\nBackground:  About three centuries before the show opens Earth had a high technological civilization, including partial negation of gravity. Earth was attacked by giant winged aliens. Either the aliens were driven off at great cost to the planet, or the war so devastated the planet that the aliens decided it was no longer worth conquering. In any event they are no longer around, save for a skeleton beneath a river, and much of the Earth is now a wasteland. \r\nPresent Day: Humans have reformed civilization but mostlyat an early 20th century level. These new nations which rose from the ruins of the world tend to fight over what remnants of arable land and resources that still exist. Kanata, our main character, comes from a poor rural family. She joins the army and is assigned to the Unit which is comprised of our characters for the story, the 1121st Tank Platoon. Their assignment is to watch for any enemy activity from their remote post overlooking a wasteland at their far-flung end of the border. Its a good place to go to hide, to forget or to just get away from everything. All the Unit members Kanata meets have different issues/demons they are avoiding from their past (one of the more severe is PTSD from watching her friends burn to death in a tank). Kanata\u2019s arrival is like a catalyst dropped into a beaker of solution: her bright, accepting personality touch each comrade in turn, and each in turn is then able to take a new view of their past and be uniquely redeemed from the largest regret in their own life. \\n\\n\r\nI find quite a lot happening in this anime, much of it growing in the background and then suddenly popping into the foreground of the story. One of my favorite aspects is that the girls are operating an illegal still and selling brandy on the black market because their Army pay is never on time! There are hints at this through several episodes and then it is brought to the forefront and becomes the focus for the plot of one episode. \\n\\n\r\nWhat do I like about this show? There's the characters, growing tensions with the neighboring kingdom, depictions of daily soldier life and training, issues with the mafia, challenges with getting an ancient high technology tank back into operating condition, and all backed up by good music and displayed on gorgeous scenery. This is also one of the rare anime that gets a soldier's life right.\\n\\n\r\nI initially thought the script writer was talking about forgiveness for his chief theme, but he wasn't: he is talking about redemption, something more precious than forgiveness; and so Amazing Grace is the perfect recurring theme. \\n\\n\r\nThere is quite a lot to this show, and I encourage everyone to give it a try.\\n",

            "content": "I have to say that I really wanted to enjoy this anime, and I dd for about the first six episodes, but after that I began to lose interest. I have a few little complaints here and there but overall the show was quite good. What killed it in the end for me are two things; the first being that it became extremely boring as nothing ever really happened, and the second being that it seemed as if the anime wasn't really going anywhere.\r\nStory (6/10)\r\nThis was my biggest issue with the anime, as I said, the story didn't really seem to be going anywhere. Ihad watched about 9 episodes before deciding to drop the anime. I was hoping that by 3/4s of the anime, the story would be in full swing, but nothing really ever happened. Through the show it seemed like a couple minor events would occur, but they would never seem to play a role on the reset of the show. I also was expecting a music anime, with the main character getting progressively better at the trumpet. However, the music could have been removed with minimal impact on the show. The music aspect was more of a minor backdrop to hold things together. My last issue on the story is that it takes place in the future, but the only indication of that is the tank which is very cyberpunk. The timeline just didn't make much sense. Ho could ALL modern technology be completely lost in a large war? How can there be these massive tanks with hologram screens, but no communications, they need trumpet players to send messages to each other? Again, the show could have just as easily been set during WW2 and very little would have changed, except for the fact that the time would make sense, then.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nI'm going to keep this short and say that  the art is definitely good, but nothing more. I liked the way the characters and environment were drawn, but they weren't really anything special.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nI was really hoping for a good soundtrack here, but was really disappointing. There is really only one song through the whole anime, amazing grace. Other than that, the ambient music and sound effects were just...decent, nothing special. I really wanted to hear more interesting music coming from the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(6/10)\\n\r\nI enjoyed the main character. She was cheerful and energetic, but that is hardly anything new to an anime character. On top of that, she had absolutely no character development. At no point did she change or realize something aside from when she magically realized how to play trumpet well by watching glass being made...somehow. All of the other characters are rather flat as well. However, with their backstories, there was HUGE missed opportunity. The best example is when you learn one of the girls has PTSD from the war, but that is only relevant in that episode; after the episode, it is never mentioned again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(6/10)\\n\r\nTo keep this short I'll just say that the show started really strong for about five episodes, then slows down really hard by episode seven, then I lost interest by episode nine. The best way to some it up is by saying so little actually happens that it becomes a very boring show rather quickly.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, I wasn't a very big fan of Sora No Woto. I found the story and a lot of events to be really confusing, and the anime is really slow. It just wasn't my kind of anime, I suppose. I o recommend this anime to anyone who wants a simple story with little thinking, it is a very casual watch. It s nice and peaceful so it's a good one to relax to. With that said, if you are expecting a great story with engaging characters, I would refer you elsewhere.",

            "content": "Sora no Woto tells a charming and unique tale of five girls in the military. It takes slice-of-life and sets it in the middle of a post-apocalyptic war and the result is a truly well written and touching story.\r\nA first impression of this anime would be \u201cK-On + Military\u201d. It\u2019s not hard to assume this; the art style is very similar to K-On, and the cast is composed of five girls with traits that seem very similar to the five girls from K-On. \r\nStory: 9\r\nAs a slice of life, most of the episodes have rather slow and simple plots. Some of them are light-hearted andenjoyable, but still develop the characters brilliant and are relaxing to watch.  Others, especially the ones that develop the characters\u2019 back story, have a much darker tone. Each episode also takes care into establishing the world that the story is set, as well as the town\u2019s culture.  Near the end things take a far more serious tone, focusing on the war between Helvetia and Rome.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe beautiful background art illustrates the charming town of Seize perfectly. The scenes are extremely detailed, and help to capture the calming mood of the series. Other times, the background shifts tone and instead portrays the horrors of war. The art style of the characters is similar to K-On, which I don\u2019t really have a problem with. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe hymn, Amazing Grace, plays an important part in the story of Sora no Woto. Also important are the various bugle tunes played throughout the story. The background music is equally good, mostly composed of calming pieces to illustrate the mood of the series. A standout is \"Servente du Feu\" a sojng sung in French that is absolutely brilliant. The opening, Hikari no Senritsu by Kalafina, is beautiful as well. However, the ending is rather generic J-Pop, and doesn\u2019t fit the series very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters seem to be cookie cutter moe stereotypes at first, but they actually have great, developed personalities. While the characters still \u201cfit\u201d into their stereotypes, they also have many other aspects to their personalities that are explored very well. The side characters are also well developed, and every character has their own unique charm.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is mostly very calming and has a very relaxing effect with the simple but enjoyable plots and great art and music. The times when it becomes more serious are also enjoyable as well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nCharming plot, well developed characters, beautiful music, and a unique and detailed setting. What\u2019s not to like?\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review, and I have something to say first.  First no anime is bad, it is just whether you enjoy it or not and second sometimes you have to look at things in other's perspective.  Also excuse my bad English.  \r\nIn my opinion, a great anime doesn't necessarily mean an anime is beautiful.  Here, So Ra No Wo To (Sound of the Sky) really presented itself as a beautiful piece of work, despite the fact the story is kind of rushed and the series should be longer and all the other stuff people criticize this piece about.To judge an anime, you should not judge it in your perspective, but rather look at the anime's perspective.  I'll explain what this means later.  \\n\\n\r\nAt first it is the name of this Anime which caught me in the eye, and all I have to say that all the aspects of So Ra No Wo To supported the name.  \\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the story gives you a feeling of a place of loneliness, it is set in place bordering No Man's Land which involves around the daily lives of those 5 girls in the army.  The phrase \"the world is ending\" is a recurring motif in the story, but despite the fact No Man's Land is expanding and possible ending of the world, the 5 girls proved it wrong.  The world can be ending, but the happiness they shared and their friendship will last forever.  Before I said you have to look at the anime's perspective, here's what i meant: it is true the story is kind of rushed and should've make it longer.  But if you look at the anime's perspective, it is 12 episodes, you can't fit everything in.  You have to rush somethings.  Even though it is not perfect, but it still done a good job from the limitations.  \\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing much I want to talk about art, it is good and it fits the story and setting well.  \\n\\n\r\nWell the sound is amazing after all the story is evolve around sound.  And in my opinion, the sound really made this piece of work lively.  After the series, I truly changed my opinion of sound.  Even though war is dark and cruel, with sound, music it can bring peace.  The idea seems naive, but sometimes we have to be naive to understand each other.  This piece of work had created another world in me filled with beautiful sound.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are moe, too cute to be in military and war, unrealistic.  This is anime after all, though its unrealistic, the designs changed the mood of anime.  Despite the fact they are in place where pay cannot be reached on time, their laugh, actions and encounter made the story seems to set in a totally different place.  \\n\\n\r\nAs I said, different people have different field of interest.  Even if you dont enjoy this anime, doesn't necessarily mean the anime is bad.  You shouldn't ruin other people's expectations and let them to decide whether it is good or not.  This anime brought me great enjoyment, because not often there are anime with a peaceful, slice of life background that have great music and artwork.  When watching, I enjoyed the comedy and their peace which deeply planted within my heart.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is great, it brings hope, and peace to people watching it.  Possibly it can also change your world perspective and understand the joy brought by sound.",

It's just that it's a normal thing here in my country. Even adults watch Dragon Ball Z here. In any case that means that I have watched plenty of it, plus all the other media I consume. My point is, it is rare to see something so well executed. Especially the last episode (out of the special 13th episode) where it all coalesced into a beautifully told story. I have watched a few musical animes, but thisfor me seems to be the best to tell how music can break barriers down.\\n\\n\r\nThere are no idols here, no lolis, just 5 women in a small town. That might sound boring on paper, but so does music.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a gem of an anime, has the same feel as Mushishi and to an extent - the same pace. The action is there to remove monotony and is peppered in enjoyable doses. It is of course, not perfect. Pacing could have been just a tad faster but still. It knows it will get twelve episodes and it never overreaches. I just hope they make a sequel about the old world. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously though, listen to the story at the festival in the first episode. It will make everything in the twelfth episode so much more intense.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a gem and should be watched at least once in your life. :)",

            "content": "So Ra No Wo To stood out to be one of my favorite anime. In spite of being short, it was up to the point with its story and message.\r\n  The setting of So Ra No Wo To, although vague, is rather diverse and fleshed out. It does not tell you much on what happened to the world, or how things became the way that it is, but it does a good job at giving you hints and nods on those factors in a very efficient manner. This pretty much adds to the theme of the series as a whole, and leavesfor a lot to be explored, in a good way. \\n\\n\r\n The characters, much like the setting, are very fleshed out as well. Not much is known about them, but from the few times their pasts get mentioned, it's enough to make them interesting and/or sympathetic. Their diverse personalities also adds to that, as well as make them more likeable as the series goes on. Just like the setting, it also ties in perfectly to the theme that this series is portraying. \\n\\n\r\n Speaking of the theme, the story does a perfect job at portraying it through the dramedy contained in the series. It knows when to transition from lighthearted and quirky, to dreary and somber, and vice-versa without tampering with the setting and characters. With that in place, it makes the theme of the series that much stronger, especially towards the end. \\n\\n\r\n The animation is also outstanding to look at, making it feel like you are actually there. The same thing goes for the soundtrack, which is gorgeous to listen to. Relying a lot on acoustic and orchestral music, it goes perfectly with the setting and tone that the series is portraying. Along with the great sound design, they succeed at immersing you into the setting with flying colors.\\n\\n\r\n  Overall, this series is definitely worth watching. Interesting setting, great characters, great story, great production value, and especially the theme makes this series a masterpiece in my opinion. I highly recommend you watch it.",

            "content": "My first impression: it's like a better _K-On_, set in a _Ghibli_-esque army. This turns out to be fairly accurate as far as it goes, but as I kept watching the next 2 episodes of _Sora no Woto_, I was struck even more by all the borrowings from other series. The already mentioned _K-On!_ bits, but then there's Sasaki from _Azumanga Daioh_, opening art copying _Elfen Lied_, the character No\u00ebl being the old Rei/Yuki ripoff, Kureha is just annoyingly tsundere (or is she instead a nod to a Class S subgenre character like one from _Marimite_? Couldn't watch it, so dunno.) And I was flabbergastedthat in a post-apocalyptic nuclear war devastated medieval setting, the animators *still* managed to work in a ghost hunt in the school at night story! I await with interest and horror the cultural festival episode, the hot springs episode, the beach episode... ...And the onsen episode of _Sora no Woto_ was episode 5. I was only joking, animators, I didn't actually expect you to do it! It becomes better than it has any right to be for a good chunk of the series. And in particular, the backgrounds remained beautiful to the end. But unfortunately, the ending episode demonstrates why you can't cross _K-On!_ with _Now and Then, Here and There_ unless you are really good - it just comes off as a little bit silly.\\n",
