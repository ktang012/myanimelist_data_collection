            "content": "I have to admit to being won over by Kobato before ever seeing the first frame of film.  One look at the artwork for this series and Kobato's beautiful clothing and settings and I knew this was going to be something for me.  Thankfully I was also rewarded with an enjoyable and heartwarming story.  While Kobato doesn\u2019t exactly break any new ground, it\u2019s a light hearted series that should make anyone smile, with just a touch of drama to keep it interesting.\r\nKobato herself begins as a bit of a mystery, tasked with a mission of healing the hearts of others in orderfor her to be granted her own wish.  Despite being a hopeless idiot and incurably moe, Kobato does the best she can helping others.  She is guided and protected by Ioryogi, an important figure from the spirit world who appears to Kobato in the form of a stuffed animal.  The reasons for her mission, her origins, and the reason for Ioryogi's appearance are explained as the story unfolds. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the plot is going to be fairly predictable to anyone who's seen many series like this and the early episodes are a bit formulaic.  However this does change as the plot thickens over the last half of the series.  I found the pacing to be good and I never felt that it lingered or stalled for too long in any place for me to get bored with it.  Maybe the only exception would be the first half dozen episodes, with their similar and episodic plotlines.  I was never blown away with any of it despite Kobato's overwhelming cuteness, but the ending story arc is both heartwarming and heat wrenching.  But I did like the ending overall and felt it wrapped up the series nicely and tied up all the loose ends.\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason to watch Kobato is for the titular character.  She is overbearingly adorable in every way.  Her character design is extremely appealing and she has possibly the best wardrobe I have yet seen in anime.  Kobato could be the poster girl for moe; she\u2019s earnest, innocent, naive, lacking any common sense, and impossibly stupid.  On the surface one would probably think she lacked substance as well.  While you could definitely say this early on, due to the length of the series and the time spent growing and developing her character she eventually becomes a great all around protagonist, instead of just a moe figurehead.\\n\\n\r\nKobato's main foil would be her guardian Ioryogi.  A quick tempered spirit stuck in the form of a stuffed animal, he is constantly berating Kobato for her stupidity and chastising her for not staying on task.  However despite his gruff nature it\u2019s obvious that he really loves and cares about her too.  The relationship between them is the source of a lot of the shows humor, and I found the pair to be quite a delight to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe other most important character to the story would be the introverted and standoffish Fugimoto.  I am not really a big fan of Fugimoto's type and always feel this is an overused clich\u00e9, particularly in shoujo and romance anime.  I don\u2019t think I will ever understand why girls find this kind of guy to be appealing.  Why would you want to break down the guys emotional barriers and deal with all his baggage when there are plenty of other guys who are actually nice to you?  Someday I hope to understand this mindset.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast is handled well and for the most part quite interesting.  Sayaka is the most important, as the head of the preschool that Fugimoto and Kobato work.  The great majority of the story takes place at the school and revolves around their efforts to save it from villainous loan sharks.  Sayaka is given some back story and development but most of the remaining cast remains mostly static.  They push the story in the right direction when needed and then fade from view.  This is a good thing since it allows the show to focus on those who deserve the screen time.\\n\\n\r\nI am not particularly a huge fan of CLAMP artwork and designs.  While their drawings are undoubtedly brilliant and beautiful (particularly when drawing children), I never liked the skinny and malnourished looking characters.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn\u2019t the case in Kobato and the production studio opted for a more normal look.  While everyone is still a bit too thin, they don\u2019t look like they are starving to death.  What really won me over and why I think this is perhaps the most visually appealing work yet was Kobato and her beautiful clothing.  Also, being a CLAMP product you can expect are to see plenty of references and cameos by familiar characters from their other works.  It is nice that at least for the important ones, they don\u2019t seem to reuse the same old models with different names.  This may or may not be a bonus to some fans, but for me it was refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe series music, the OP theme and the in between songs are cute and very fitting of the series nature.  In addition the acting is solid all around.  Kobato's seiyuu is suitably adorable sounding and brings out her personality.  Though it does become a bit grating and overly cute at times, it is a minor annoyance and it probably wouldn\u2019t work as well with a more mature sounding voice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I found Kobato to be a rewarding and wonderful viewing experience.  If you like cute and adorable things, CLAMP, light hearted and touching stories with a hint of romance; then Kobato should be high on your list.  If you really dislike moe or need action to be entertained than this is something you should stay away from.  While it may not go down as an all-time classic, Kobato will leave you with a smile.\\n",

            "content": "Amazing- that's the one word I would use to describe Kobato.\r\nI'm rather picky with my ratings, but for the first time in a good while, I decided on a ten.\r\nStory-9 The plot of Kobato. starts out simple enough- a girl assigned the task of healing peoples' wounded hearts. The first half of the series covers the bases of the overall objective- cases of Kobato doing her work. Even these earlier episodes I though were awesome, but as the series enters its second half, Kobato.'s plot thickens and the series develops into a masterpiece.\r\nIn the first half, we see glimpses of the dark realities of lifebeneath the bright, cheerful character of Kobato- and from the very start, Kobato. deals with very real life details; a misunderstanding with a friend, a tragedy with a lover, family problems... \\n\r\nIn the second half, however, is revealed a whole new facet of Kobato. The show cuts deeper than a story about a girl with the objective of fulfilling her dream. Debts. Love. Death. Tragedy. Farewells. We see all of these events changing and forming a much more mature Hanato Kobato\\n\\n\r\nArt-10 I loved the art- I loved it! The details are intricate, the colors and effects wonderfully done. I don't think I could have asked more of the creators (especially considering this is based off a CLAMP work) except actually letting viewers distinguish the ages of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nSound-10 The soundtrack for Kobato. was one of the best I've ever heard. My favorite soundtrack up until the point I saw Kobato. was the True Tears Soundtrack, but Kobato. really gave True Tears a run for its money. The sounds vary- cheerful, light, heavy, peaceful... Both soundtracks are masterpieces that fulfill their purpose, supporting and improving the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10 Character. Yes, I'm someone who doesn't enjoy a book, movie... or anything with shallow characters. At a glimpse, people may think Kobato, is just another \"moe\", empty-headed character,  but as the series progresses, all the characters- Fujimoto and Kobato noticeably- grow and mature as they learn important life lessons through their trials. The storyline doesn't go \"easy\" on them: the lessons they learn are tough, yes, but also shape and define the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10 I both laughed and cried while watching Kobato. It really is a series with contrasting qualities; it brings laughter and tears. It shows the darkness in our society, but also the hope, dreams, and goodness in it. There are trials, but also miracles and second chances. This simple, 24-episode story has all this- and what's even better is that it has a healing quality, one that warms the heart.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall-10 Overall, I give Kobato. a ten. I would give an eleven if I could. Kobato. is something viewers of all ages can watch- I would recommend to anyone, anyday. You could watch it with the whole family, your siblings, friends... it's not something you have to filter or think through. \\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is to give it a try- and let the show do the rest.",

            "content": "Some\u00adwhere around about epis\u00adode 12 it hit me. No, not that the show had sud\u00addenly become watch\u00adable, that wasn\u2019t to hap\u00adpen for sev\u00aderal more epis\u00adodes. No, what hit me was a per\u00adfect way to express what it was I didn\u2019t like about this show. I had some vague review thoughts in my head (sub\u00adcon\u00adsciously review\u00ading the show as you watch it; the curse of being a critic) but most of them revolved around bitch\u00ading about how stu\u00adpid Kobato her\u00adself was and how the show relied on cute\u00adness as its main appeal, some\u00adthing I\u2019ve just never really liked. But then it hit me. I read ona blog somewhere that the way the person got through a series they didn\u2019t like was because they spent their time also play\u00ading Poke\u00admon. So I finally got around to play\u00ading Poke\u00admon Plat\u00adinum after the first few episodes of Kobato (why yes, I am a game behind every\u00adone else) because I real\u00adised I would prob\u00adably smash my laptop if I had to sit through another \u2018Kobato Gan\u00adbar\u00adrebleargh~\u2019 without some\u00adthing else to occupy my mind. Now nor\u00admally this shouldn\u2019t work unless I was watch\u00ading the dub. Mul\u00adti\u00adtask\u00ading while watch\u00ading subs is next to impossible. How\u00adever it did work because I actu\u00adally under\u00adstood pretty much everything that was being said.\\n\\n\r\nLet me explain. I have never once made an attempt at learn\u00ading Japan\u00adese. I know about as much as any wee\u00adaboo who watches subbed anime would know. Watch\u00ading Kobato wasn\u2019t a sud\u00adden grand real\u00adisa\u00adtion that I was now flu\u00adent in Japan\u00adese. It was the sim\u00adpli\u00adcity of the lan\u00adguage the char\u00adac\u00adters used. They all had just a few stock lines they would throw out in most situ\u00adations which meant that after watch\u00ading a few epis\u00adodes pay\u00ading atten\u00adtion to the subs you knew pretty much everything that they could say. This effects the anime in far more ways than you might real\u00adise. Of course you get the pain\u00adfully dull and repet\u00adit\u00adive dia\u00adlogue. Of course there\u2019s the way every scene and every epis\u00adode feels the exact bloody same with no inspir\u00ada\u00adtion, ingenu\u00adity or ima\u00adgin\u00ada\u00adtion, bar Kobato\u2019s ward\u00adrobe. But along\u00adside that you also have the actual ten\u00adsion in the series solved using the same unin\u00adspired meth\u00adods in every epis\u00adode. Kobato throws out a few stock phrases, Ioryogi mut\u00adters some\u00adthing in the back\u00adground and all is right with the world once again. It lim\u00adits the dir\u00adec\u00adtion any epis\u00adode can take.\\n\\n\r\nBut yes, it does get bet\u00adter. It may take until around epis\u00adode 17 before I actu\u00adally went through an epis\u00adode without hav\u00ading beaten 3\u20134 poke\u00admon train\u00aders while it was play\u00ading, but it cer\u00adtainly did improve. Vastly improved. By epis\u00adode 20 I had shut that Game Boy for good and was actu\u00adally watch\u00ading this show for real. The show took a much more dra\u00admatic and mel\u00adan\u00adcholic tone that suited the style of storytelling far more. After watch\u00ading the pre\u00advi\u00adous 16 epis\u00adodes of failed com\u00adedy (bar Ioryogi dodging cork bul\u00adlets at the fest\u00adival. That was quite funny) and bland stor\u00adies that were sup\u00adposed to be heart\u00adwarm\u00ading, the effect this change to a plot-driven story had on the over\u00adall qual\u00adity of the show was phe\u00adnom\u00adenal. \\n\\n\r\nLet me talk about the MAL stats for a second on this series. There\u2019s a very high per\u00adcent\u00adage drop rate to com\u00adpleted rate, around 20% of the people who watched it, dropped it. And yet the anime is rated 8.07 at the time of writing, a very respect\u00adable score indeed. MAL doesn\u2019t count the scores once you\u2019ve seen bey\u00adond a cer\u00adtain num\u00adber of epis\u00adodes so those who actu\u00adally sat through the entire thing were clearly rewar\u00added for their efforts. It also shows the usual reac\u00adtion of people to rate some\u00adthing highly because the later epis\u00adodes were bet\u00adter, much like After Story. It\u2019s some\u00adthing that bugs me a lot because I hate hav\u00ading to sit through sev\u00aderal poor epis\u00adodes just because \u2018it gets bet\u00adter I swear!\u2019. I don\u2019t doubt it does. It\u2019s just those earlier epis\u00adodes are a right pain to sit through. Because Kobato is, for the most part, a poor anime. It just hap\u00adpens to end on a very high note. Plus you can\u2019t skip those earlier epis\u00adodes the same way you the\u00ador\u00adet\u00adic\u00adally can for After Story. Without those earlier epis\u00adodes the end\u00ading ones don\u2019t work.\\n\\n\r\nIt did turn me into a romantic sap though. Good old Clamp did it again. They made me believe that, through any\u00adthing, love will pre\u00advail. No mat\u00adter what hap\u00adpens to you, what you go through, what form you\u2019re in, love will get through all that. It did the very same thing Chob\u00adits did. It made me believe in the Power of Love. I came into this anime look\u00ading for some\u00adthing to rep\u00adlic\u00adate the feel\u00ading Chob\u00adits gave me and, in the end, I guess it did exactly that.",

            "content": "What are you doing with your life?  What are you working for?  What will you accomplish during your time?  How could that time be better served improving that of another?\r\nAll of these are questions you'll probably be asking yourself while watching \"Kobato.\"\r\n\"Kobato\" is one of those rarities that soothes the soul.  It's hard not to find yourself smiling often, since there are many heartwarming moments throughout.  The show regularly brought tears to the eye--not of sadness, but happiness.  It's definitely something to consider checking out if you like happier anime, or need something to cheer you up.\r\nThe entire pointof the series can be summarized with one word: empathy.  It shows the heartwarming inspiration and greatness of what happens when someone abandons their own interests for the sake of helping others.  When someone becomes selfless, the avenue is opened up for miraculous outcomes and beautiful changes in peoples' lives.\\n\\n\r\nA pessimistic philosopher once said that there is no such thing as a truly selfless action, basing their argument on the premise that we're only doing it because seeing someone in need bothers us--because we ourselves would feel better and be at peace if they were happier.  But what about people for whom this sense of relief is only a side effect?  What about the people who truly don't care about themselves, and are willing to go above and beyond to lend a hand when someone needs it?  \"Kobato\" shows how great your life can be when you realize that following your own dreams isn't the only source of fulfillment.\\n\\n\r\nI was a little nervous at first becaue of how moe Kobato herself was, but I quickly learned just how great of a character she is.  Her mission is to heal peoples' hearts so her wish can be granted, but it becomes obvious early on that she is far too concerned with the well-being of others to worry about filling the jar for herself.  (Ioryogi constantly observes this and stresses over how she may not complete her task in time to have her wish granted.)  She'll spend days--or longer--working towards an end, even with the knowledge that it won't get her any closer to her goal.  She's great with kids and loves to help out at the local preschool, even though this too doesn't directly get her any closer to her goal.  She loses sleep worrying about the problems of those around her:  She relentlessly seeks solutions, no matter how poorly she may be treated or how ingrateful the person may be.  She just wants everyone to be happy.\\n\\n\r\nKobato teaches us to take pleasure in little things as she carries out every task happily and with a smile--even ones we may not necessarily want to do.  It's a combination of these things that leads to the creation of what is perhaps the best wife/mother material to ever grace the world of fiction.\\n\\n\r\nIf we had more characters (or better yet, people) like Kobato, the world would be a better place.  It's disheartening that mindless fan service dolls are more popular than characters that are actually GOOD from shows with actual substance.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has more characterization and character development in a single episode than many anime contain over the span of their entire runtime.  It's touching to see the characters change after their encounters with Kobato.  The show deals with very real issues people go through and examines the power one person stepping outside of themselves can have, making all the difference in changing a life.  Even the most stone-hearted aren't safe from her outgoing and caring nature: no wound can't be healed with the proper care.\\n\\n\r\n\"Kobato\" has a pretty good idea of when it's time to stop with the comedic content when things are getting serious, which is really important in a dramedy.  Once misplaced line can completely butcher the mood of a scene; \"Kobato\" knows what's appropriate and when, but is quick to throw in a crack once the storm has passed and the happy status quo has been restored, helping complete a smooth transition and elevating the viewer's spirits.\\n\\n\r\n...I guess I gotta talk about art 'n' sound 'n' stuff, too.  Character design is great; there are some pretty unique ones, the most unique and appealing being Kobato.  Hair movement seems to have been given a particular attention, particularly in the case of it bouncing up and down and someone runs or as the wind blows through it--again, the most attention was given to Kobato.  There is some pretty great imagery, like petals, or leaves falling from trees, or snow, and the surrounding greenary is always a pleasure.  Warmer, brighter, and more vibrant colors are what dominate the visible spectrum, complementing the overall tone of the series.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting quality is excellent, with Hana Kanazawa completely bringing the show to life with her peppy, happy, excited Kobato.  Hearing her sing was an extra special treat.  The soundtrack contains some beautiful pieces--particularly those played during more dramatic or emotionally riveting scenes, although there are a number of more upbeat ones for the laid back/comedic scenes.\\n\\n\r\n\"Kobato\" made me put my hands together and clap like an idiot because it made me so happy.  The show renewed my faith in humanity; it gave me hope that there may still be good people out there with actual morals who care about their fellow man.  It's wholesome, pure, innocent, and clean--all endangered, unappreciated, underrated qualities in this day and age.  It made me take a step back and reexamine how I was living, and radically altered my outlook on life in general.\\n\\n\r\nSo...  How might \"Kobato\" touch YOU?",

            "content": "Kobato is a girl of currently unknown origins whose job is to \"heal\" the hearts of the world around her. Every time she heals a heart, a candy-like gem called Confetto will appear in a glass bottle in which she carries around. When this glass bottle finally fills up, she will get her wish granted. Thus, the story of Kobato follows her attempts to find people to heal.\r\nStory\r\nOh boy... Where do I even begin. The whole storyline has been put out so slowly I've lost interest. Even as a major fan of slice of life and non-related episodic anime (in which my favourites include HidamariSketch and Aria, as well as being a fan of Sketchbook and GA), this doesn't draw me in in any way possible.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: 6 episodes after I originally wrote this, I'd say it jsut got worse. they made a highly pointless time skip, in which we end upa few months later, with NO advancement to the storyline, and she just goes on continuing to collect Confetto.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nFor some plus points, I've always been a fan of the animation Madhouse does, and this is no exception.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nMusic is decent, except when Kobato sings. It's too darn fake-sounding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nBoy oh boy number 2...\\n\\n\r\nThe anime appears to have 3 main characters. Starting with Fujimoto, the guy appears to be an absolute jerk, but \"becomes nicer\" after meeting up with Kobato. Appears to have some issues that he helps Kobato find an owner for a stray cat after telling his college classmates he doesn't want to help them isn't very convincing. Secondly, Kobato's character is highly annoying. Her naivety is beyond that of even a child, or maybe the word should be stupidity? Or bimbotic? Either way, this is the first time I did not like a Kana Hanazawa character. The third main in Ioryogi is possibly the most likeable of the trio. That said, the bossy, fire breathing stuff animal is no Mokona or Keroberos, and pretty much insults the great \"stuff animals\" that we have seen by CLAMP thus far.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWhile fire breathing, klutzy antics can be enjoyable once in a while, seeing every episode REALLY gets old, and poor characters and a lack of the heart warming feeling from a slice of life anime really kills off the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime has gone is a very poor direction. If I was new to the slice of life genre, watching this will make me want to permanantly avoid it. I had such high hopes for Kobato. Poor CLAMP production, poor Madhouse production. Disappointing.",

Kobato is so lovable as well as many other characters.\r\nKobato, as you know, is by CLAMP, so there are lots of similarities overall, as well as some characters. The artwork  is amazing with the nice colors and the touch that makes certain characters lovely or not. The songs played in the background  as well as songs that Kobato herself sings were all perfect for the anime.\r\nThe story itself had times where it dragged on imo, but in the last few episodes, they were wrapped up so perfectly, and the final episode is one that I'dconsider the best ending I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching Kobato for lulz as well as just experiencing the adorableness. It's an anime I'd highly recommend to pretty much anyone.",

            "content": "NOTE: the first paragraph is for those who are looking for motivation to watch this series, if not skip to the next.     \r\n If you're tired or bored watching same anime storyline over and over again and looking for something different, then I'm sure watching Kobato would not impress even a single cell in your brain, well at first. It's storyline is a typical shoujo, as you might be expecting, with a witty, innocent, naive etc. main character ,that you might have seen a thousand times already, living her life sharing/showing her naivety/innocence to others day by day. But even thoughyou feel like ditching this series after reading this, I would like you to sit tight and relax for a bit, for me giving a 9 overall score isn't a mistake.\\n\\n\r\nKobato is a lighthearted series that has a nice blend of drama, comedy, a bit of fantasy, a bit of slice of life, and a happy romantic ending.\\n\\n\r\nHanato Kobato, the childish, naive and sweet main character, is on a mission to fulfill her wish, to go somewhere and in order to accomplish it she need to fill a flask with each person she heals.  She resides in a park with a spirit named Ioryogi with a body of small blue stuffed dog. Ioryogi acts as a strict proctor to Kobato and he often shouts at her or bathes her with fire when she makes mistakes. Uninteresting? maybe, maybe not.\\n\\n\r\nWell the story started to slowly revolve upon her arrival at a Nursery after following Fujimoto. The first episodes were mostly episodic, her meeting with different people and eventually healing their problems and filling up her flask in the process. At this moment we might have give up all our hopes and ditch this series(like me) but as it goes the stories goes deeper and deeper as more and more mysteries were revealed and slowly the characters develop. This is where the story gets interesting and eventually captivating you to the series.\\n\\n\r\nIts pacing is what made this series beautiful. It carried the series from being a mediocre to unforgettable. Even though the storyline carries some inevitable cons such as \"non-sense'' and \"idiotic\" scenes it manages to bring out even a tiny droplet of meaningful things from it and adding it up to the grand climax later on.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was the greatest asset of the series. I'm not a fan of CLAMP art and I dislike their skinny character design and I'm so glad they did a very good job here. Kobato is one of the few characters that I've seen with a change of outfit, and very cute. The characters' faces and hair are very beautiful, specially for Kobato and the kids. The background art was also marvelous and it perfectly blends with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know whether to praise the STs or not, I'm really confused b/c the STs blended extraordinarily in each scene, adding depth to the emotion, to the point that I can't  remember any melody at all. The OP was astounding. It has a bright and slightly playful melody w/c brings up the character of Kobato.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the cast are design rip-offs from previous CLAMP animes (such as Chobits) and some did have a cameo appearance. The main characters were shrouded in some sort of mystery, specially Kobato. Most of those were revealed in perfect timing but others were just left there hanging in the clouds, such as the Spirits and this \"war\" they had w/ the \"heaven\". Yet characters are not without flaws. I'll particularly discuss Fujimoto. For me his developments as a character are shown poorly, or rather was not developed enough, he hardly shown any development and it made him look like a \"developed\" character from the beginning, which is not a very nice asset of a character. Well all I wanted to say is that he has a slow gradual development and a spike on the end, maybe some may like it or maybe most, but I don't.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning I was bought out  by its high rating( I usually pick my anime to watch this way) but then I find it boring in the first 10 min. of the first episode and decided to ditch it(that's how picky I am) but for the sake of my \"wasted\" HDD space I decided to rerun it and I'm very glad that I did.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end of the day I find myself crying on the 23rd episode and had a bittersweet smile at the 24th. I'm not someone to cry on any drama so it really surprised me how I was so frustrated to Fujimoto, he was a jerk. LOL.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways the series was unforgettable. I really enjoyed watching it and its truly worthwhile. Kobato reminded me that somewhere, maybe, on this world there is this one idiot person that follows you around, annoys you. You might end up hurting that person but still that person will always be by your side, no matter what and someday you'll realize how important it is ...to have an idiot person beside you...\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, this will be my first review and I don't know whether my style of writing would fit for a review. They always told that my writing was dreamy and I have no hope writing bookish statements. So if you find my review so disturbing or something, please send me a message, it would really help me. And for grammatical errors, sorry I was refraining from using a lot of metaphors.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm not someone who can't live without shoujo.  In fact, I usually hate everything of the genre with a passion.  Kobato. seemed like a happy exception to the rule, but after a few episodes, it became apparent that old habits die hard for me (or rather \"shoujo sucks\" is still upheld).\r\n==[Pros]==\r\n- Visuals.  Like most CLAMP works, Kobato. has great character designs and is an artistic triumph.  I usually hate chibi, but the chibi here is well-placed, albeit done a bit frequently.\r\n- Kobato.  She is a great character, reminiscent of Yotsuba in her curiosity and innocence.  Her easily earned smileand ability to talk straightforwardly are traits that give off a childlike feel and ultimately make for an intriguing main character and an equally interesting plot.\\n\\n\r\n- All of the mysteries.  Why exactly is Kobato here?  What is she?  Does she even change clothes?  Great questions... if left unanswered.\\n\\n\\n\r\n==[Cons]==\\n\\n\r\n- The mysteries look like they're going to be solved.  Ioryogi meets figures from his past and Kobato is mentioned more than once in his speech.  I don't want the show to focus on the mysteries surrounding Kobato.  All I want to see is an innocent girl interacting with the world around her.  Is that too much to ask?\\n\\n\r\n- Non-episodic nature.  The early episodes are slice-of-life and run smoothly, but when Kobato gets hired, the show gets bogged down.  Add to this an overall story, and the original slice-of-life qualities that I found impressive in Kobato. have all but vanished.\\n\\n\r\n- Focus becomes Kobato's airhead qualities instead of her innocence and naivety.  I want to see the world through Kobato's eyes.  I don't want to see Kobato's eyes flat on the floor.\\n\\n\r\n- Ioryogi is (as of ep. 6) in the show for comic relief and as a gateway into Kobato's background.  Both of these purposes aren't exactly beneficial: fire breathing and sudden outbursts become old by episode two and learning Kobato's background answers questions that don't need to be answered.\\n\\n\r\n- Fujimoto sucks.  I hate him.  Nothing about his character is even remotely appealing.\\n\\n\\n\r\n==[Conclusion]==\\n\r\nGreat start for a shoujo, but ends up shifting direction from an interesting story about an innocent girl to a boring story about a bumbling fool and her mascot's uninteresting past.",

            "content": "Kobato is a show I really struggled to find raw enjoyment in.  It may be part in fact that I am normally a fan of silly lighthearted romance comedies and the occasional shonen anime.  Suffice to say that this would be one reason to avoid this show.  If you're looking for something flashy that will grab your attention immediately, this show is worth removing from your \"Plan to Watch\" list.\r\nHowever ultimately I did decide to watch this show to completion since I am open to trying new things.\r\nThe story is fairly down to earth, once you look past the obvious fact thatKobato and Ioryogi are obviously not normal beings. The show starts very slowly, playing itself out episodically as Kobato interacts with other people on different days of the seasons to heal them of their misfortunes and collect \"candy\" in the process. That by itself is fairly repetitive, and little is done to really explain in detail who exactly the main characters are. Aside from the occasional gag where Kobato's clumsiness gets the better of her (and Ioryogi's temper), it's hard to find anything that really stands out in this show, as plot and character development happens very slowly. I probably sympathize with Ioryogi's complaints about 'Dobato' in general not getting stuff done efficiently.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is at least pretty good.  Characters and special effects have been drawn with pretty good detail, so the show at least won't make you want to tear your eyes out. The music isn't very special, aside from Kobato's song, and the first ED for this show is painfully uninteresting with an unremarkable song and a redundant animation of Kobato's candy bottle slowly rotating.\\n\\n\r\nThe story does try to pick itself up towards the end, explaining some of Fujimoto and Sayaka's background and how it relates to Yomogi nursery, and even closer towards the end there is some attempt to try to explain why Kobato is significant to this in the first place. The show becomes a bit of a confusing mess when there is some indirect attempts to hint around the backgrounds of the characters from other worlds and there is a good number of poorly explained ends.\\n\\n\r\nIs this show what people would classify as of the shoujo genre? Maybe that genre is not meant for me.  I'd like someone to tell me otherwise if there are perhaps better shows like this one. It's not like I find this show is outright horrible.  While there are some humorous and tender moments, there really just isn't enough that happens over the course of 24 episodes. It's just a very slow show in general with a fairly uncomplicated plot that has few twists to really spark interest.  Overall I really wouldn't recommend wasting ~12 hours on this show.  I don't find this show good enough in anything to counterbalance how slow this show is. The characters aren't developed well enough for the most part, the story isn't really wholly amazing, and there isn't really much implementation of anything that will grab your attention like action scenes.",

            "content": "Every single person you've meet in your life hasn't felt perfect in every single moment of his/her life. It's nothing but normal to feel pain in certain situations. But there are people who suffer a little more than others. \r\nIn this anime, a mysterious girl appears with a mission. She has to heal hearts which are in pain, in other words, wounded hearts. If she completes her mission, her wish will come true. The story has very happy and very sad moments. It succeeds in making you smile without being stupid and succeeds in making you sad without being pathetic and boring. I would saythat the story is pretty good, it had potential and used it. There is background story for almost everything that happens, and behind almost every character. The final form was done well. It may be deeper than it seems. Only thing I don't like is that there are few 'holes' in it. I mean, some thing aren't explained very well in the end, so:\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nWhile trying to complete her mission, she meets many people with interesting stories. All those persons have completed, interesting, touching and pretty realistic stories. I liked that you can laugh and cry with those characters. Also, I must mention that the characters develop through the story. You can notice how they learn more about themselves, experience all sorts of feelings and realize them. I would say they get more 'mature' in self-knowledge with the pass of time.\\n\r\nKobato is kind and nice girl. In the beginning it seems that she helps other people only because of her selfish wishes, but later we see that she really likes to help others, which makes her a great person. Fujimoto at first seems like self-centered and cold person, but he really isn't like that. We can watch him getting softer and softer as the time passes. And Ioryogi is a lot more than a stuffed animal.\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe drawing looks simply beautiful. The thing I liked the most were eyes (and the whole face). The characters look pretty realistic. Also, their body parts are proportional, which is good. The clothes were fantastically drawn, and I liked that they aren't wearing the same clothes all the time. Their moves are done pretty good too. Animation was correct, no mistakes, and was especially good in some episodes.\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe music was done well. The songs were different one from each other. They were perfectly suitable for the 'mood' of the moments. Here, we had both sad and happy sounds. The voice acting was pretty fine, without special mistakes. I would like more emotions in few moments, but that's only my personal impression. Voices fit good in characters. I loved second ending. \\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has many parts different in mood. In one moment it makes you laugh, in second it makes you worry, in third you cry. It gets both happy and sad, dramatic, and in few moments romantic. It surely will make you enjoy. The only thing I didn't like is that there were few funny scenes based on the same situation, so:\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis show is a good choice if you want to watch something relaxing, but not without a story. Also, it can easily change your mood, so, if you want to get in the story, it's a good idea to watch this. This is an anime you don't just watch, you feel it.\\n\\n\r\nQuote for the end:\\n\r\n\"Is there anyone who needs healing here?!\"\\n\\n",

I had NEVER cried before while watching an anime, and I did watch some pretty sad/deep ones.\r\nWhen I saw the DVD cover, I was a bit hesitant. I couldn't help but think that it would be another one of those pointless happy-go-lucky friendship-is-the-best animes. But. The opening started playing and by the end of the first episode my eyes were glued to the computer screen. I \r\nI literally fell in love with Kobato's guardian/mascot/stuffed animal Ioriyogi!

Kobato is such a sweetie and Fujimoto is kinda stubborn and likes to lash out at people  but that adds to his moe-ness !!!!(*is a masochist*)\\n\\n\r\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this series to anyone who is sad and wants something to cheer them up, or just wants a good cry. I also recommend it to people who have pretty much watched every good anime known to otaku and can't find an anime without ninja turds and anything to do with souls being taken.

            "content": "I actually enjoyed this anime so much.  I originally started watching it because I was after a time passer but Kobato turned out to be so much more. The whole anime was such a mood lifter and can be best described as soft and fluffy. \r\nThe story follows a girl, Kobato, who has been sent to Earth to heal people's hearts. She has 4 seasons of the weather to fill up a jar with the 'konpeito', what the bottled heart fragments are referred to. Her guide is Iorogi, a being taking the form of a stuffed animal. Kobato falls in love with a nurseryshe begins to work at and the story follows from there.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10 - I admit that the last few episodes aren't what I expected. It turned out to be one of those 'fate' animes. Up until the last episode the story was perfect. There were occasional fillers but they were funny and cute so I didn't mind. The anime was well paced, never did I think,  'did I miss something?'. Even though the ending wasn't perfect,  it had its own charms because it showed what happened to everyone as time passed and I couldn't spot any holes in the plot. It ran really smoothly. Though,  I didn't like that they kept us guessing Kobato's past until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & music 8/10 - The art was beautiful. I didn't like how the hair was done for some characters but the art was so crisp and pretty. The change of clothing was also something which I liked, especially Kobato's. \\n\r\nThe music was soft and refreshing. I truly did enjoy the songs which were used, even though they were repetitive. The OP and ED suited the anime very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10 - The characters were so deep. That's what I loved. Everyone had a back story, even if it wasn't explained very well. Their personalities were done very well. Kobato was truly the most gorgeous character and it was very hard not to love her. All the other characters were likeable too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 8/10, I really enjoyed this anime and look forward to re watching it sometime in the future.",

            "content": "After finishing watching Kobato only today, I was compelled to write my first review ever for this wonderful anime, Kobato.\r\nWhere to start? \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI definitely thought the story was well thought out. Some could argue that there were a lot of \"fillers\", but I disagree. The episodes that seemingly contributed no development to the plot let the watcher get a better feel on each of the characters' background stories and personalities, especially Kobato and Fujimoto's. Kobato's background story, not so much, but definitely her personality.\r\nThe last 7 or so episodes really started picking up the pace and started climbing towards the climax. Again, the storywas well-thought out. I am definitely the type of anime-watcher who would ditch a series after watching the first few episodes if I wasn't interested, and in fact, I did put Kobato on hold after the first 10 episodes, but I'm so glad that I decided to watch again a few days ago. I would've never thought that this anime could develop so much and bring so much meaning to life (dramatic, I know!) in a mere 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMany agree that the art in Kobato is just refreshing, modern, and amazing--and so do I! Unlike some anime, the \"profile\" shots of the characters were never distorted and they always looked great. You could definitely tell the animators weren't being lazy! The art is beautiful, beautiful, so beautiful. One quirky thing I just noticed (and liked!) about the art was Kobato's way of dressing. I've watched and read most of Clamp's work, and it seemed like they took bits of Cardcaptor Sakura (with the costumes) and Tsubasa Chronicles (her body-shape and long dresses) and combined those styles into Kobato's dresses full of simple colors and great design that show that Kobato is unique, cute, beautiful, innocent... the list goes on.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI admit, I don't pay much attention to the soundtrack of an anime unless it's for fighting scenes, the climax, or the music's just really loud. Kobato's songs are beautiful and so fitting for this cute but emotional anime. As for the soundtrack, it definitely fit the anime and the mood of it with a simple piano background at times or the tinkling of bells. The seiyuus (voice actors) did a good job with their characters. The characters' voices were realistic and true to the character. Kobato's voice took a little while to get used to since it was so high-pitched and I could HEAR the smile in her voice. Scary, I know. But it was great :) I loved loryogi's voice the most.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in the \"Story\" section of my review, there were some \"fillers\" but they helped with the characterization of Kobato, Mrs. Sayaka, and Fujimoto mostly. Kobato's background is pretty hazy and vague most of the 26 episodes, but near the end you find out so much information, but it's not overwhelming. You just need to be patient. As for Mrs. Sayaka and Fujimoto, their backgrounds are pretty well explained throughout the series in every other episode or so, so there is no suspenseful wait for the details on those two. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I didn't like about the characterization in Kobato. is loryogi's background and his friends (Ginsei, etc). I just felt that CLAMP didn't do enough to describe their pasts in detail, only dropping some vague information here and there. I was pretty confused about their backgrounds throughout the anime and I was dying to know more about them, almost as much as I wanted to know about Kobato's past and who she really is. Spoilers aren't allowed in reviews, but all I can say is that I feel pretty disappointed about loryogi and the lack of information on him.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI had to be patient with this anime. I'm the type with a very short attention span who never likes to commit to anything, pretty much. But I did come back to this anime after a one month break and I enjoyed it IMMENSELY. The first 15 episodes or so are cute and sweet, but as I recall, didn't really contribute to the plot that much. \\n\\n\r\nThe beginning episodes talked about the history of Yomogi Nursery and Mrs. Sayaka, Fujimoto, and some other minor characters and how Kobato settled into Earth. I soon lost interest after watching for a bit. But I'm very glad I finished watching Kobato to the end. After the first half of the series, \"action\" started picking up and I was hooked to the very end, where I got all emotional and sniffled a bit. I enjoyed Kobato so so much, I just wish that the beginning half had more to offer, especially about loryogi and his friends.\\n\\n\r\nLike in most of CLAMP's work, they \"recycled\" their characters. Some characters from their other works like Tsubasa Chronicles and Cardcaptor Sakura appeared in Kobato, though they had very minor roles. That was enjoyable XD\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI was definitely tempted to make the overall a \"10\" but I knew that the anime did have a minor cons. I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who likes Cardcaptor Sakura-type anime, but you need to be prepared for less action, but more kawaii-ness :) Also, anyone who is stressed and just needs a break to watch a cute, fun-filled (not the Lucky Star-type, though!), and emotional anime whose main key points are making other people happy and enjoying it. This anime is definitely centered around happiness and made me very happy too. After reading all the comments each episode got on the internet, everyone felt happy too. CLAMP really captured my heart with this anime. I'll definitely consider reading the manga. :D\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: A thorough and intense story. Watching it with concentration gives you the essence of how excellently the story unfolds. The small things in life are depicted wonderfully in these 24 episodes. Emotions have been handled with great care to give the appropriate impact in each episode. [10/10] \r\nArt: The Original Art by Mangaka CLAMP are always beautifully drawn. (They are the best illustrators among Mangaka really -only my personal opinion ofcourse.)  The Art in the series too is excellent. Kobato's innocence, Sayaka Sensei's kindness, Kiyokazu's attitude, all show up nicely from the way they have been drawn. Loryogi-san is comical. The background landscapeis not much so that focus is kept more on the characters- again a benifit in terms of the impact that the characters and their behavior can have on the viewer. [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nSound: Music by Takeshi Hama is melodious. An Ancient Story is my personal favourite. Ashita Kuru Hi (sung by Kobato in the series at 2-3 occasions) is another melody which slowly begins to resonate after a few episodes. Hotaru no Mori is another beautiful tune with bells. Most music pieces are played on Violins, Viola, Cello, Piano. The music again adds to the atomosphere creation in each episode. [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Kobato's innocence is 100% believable. There are also some times in episodes when one suddenly realises that though she is all bubbly all the time, there is a hint of sadness somewhere behind that smile. Sayaka Sensei's kindness is too much but still that character is very much believable. Kiyokazu is shown to have a bit of attitude but he's a really caring person inside. Doumoto is simply a guy any girl would love to fall in love. Loryogi-san is really comical. But he too cares for Kobato throughout the series and indirectly guides her to good things. [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you like watching Slice of life genre anime then Kobato is THE anime to watch. Day to day experiences that Kobato has have varied emotions. And in many ways Kobato herself heals many peoples troubled hearts unknowingly. [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It was an overwhemling experience for me to see a story that was so perfectly woven to express emotions felt by a person in everyday life. Emotions though unfolded one by one have a rather intense impact on the viewer many a times. (especially episode 13- you just have to watch it to understand how subtly you get attached to Kobato's innocence and how she feels about things) The art of the manga as well as the series was a visual treat (as is always the case for me when i read any CLAMP manga). Music is very melodious and aptly builds up the atmosphere in each episode. Comical situations in the story are well positioned. What more can i say just go ahead and start watching and you'll know what magic CLAMP stories cast on you :)",

            "content": "Ah Kobato...\r\nIf you look at my anime list, you will notice that Im very picky when it comes to rating. And seldomly do I ever give away a full 10 points. The only anime so far on my list that has gotten a full 10 points is Clannad. I praised it holy and as a milestone in my anime watching career.\r\nAnd now! The time has come to gift a new wonderfull anime 10 points, and oh shall we prais its presence next to Clannad at the top of my ranking.\r\nThis anime... I rated it as a 10 - Masterpiece because if there is one wordid choose to describe it, it would be: Beatiful.\\n\\n\r\nIts perfectly balanced story wise and very enjoyable to watch. The characters are all lovable and unique. Everything about this anime, from the story to the music is just plain beatiful.\\n\r\nOne thing I realy love is the art. A big plus point is the way the faces are drawn, they are somewhat unique and new, but very nice to look at. You will probaly fall in love with this style after the first episode. And Kobato's dresses are also very adorable to look at.\\n\r\nThe story is very flat and easy to follow, alltho this anime will surley make you heart soft and bring forward a couple tears, its overall enjoyment is outstanding. You laugh, you cry, and then you cry again because it makes you so happy. Clannad had thies elements, but compared to Clannad, Kobato is easier to watch and lighter hearted.\\n\\n\r\nNow there is something I want to share with all of you. I am a big fan of Chobits, a former anime also made by Clamp. And when you watch this anime and you are familiar with Chobits, you will notice some things that will realy give you a pleasent supprise content wise. Im going to list thies little easter eggs here because they realy made my heart go \"awww isnt this awsome\".\\n\\n\r\n- The resedent that Kaboto stays at, is the exact same one from chobits, the twin sisters are the Chobit sisters (chi and her sister) and the resedent owner is the wife of the creater of the chobit series, who is also the mother to them.\\n\\n\r\n- The bakery that Kaboto works at every once in a while is named \"Tirol\" and the shop owner and his assistant are the same ones out of Chobits.\\n\\n\r\nI think there was 1 or 2 more but I cant think of them atm. But basicly thies characters out of the Chobits anime are in Kaboto's world in a Human state, basicly like everything should have been. At least thats my impression and gave this anime an extra flavor that I truly loved.\\n\\n\r\nIts hard to put all the emotions and beaty of this anime in to words, im not even going to try very hard because I dont want to screw anything up and leave a odd impression.\\n\\n\r\nSo to all you comedy, drama, romance genre fans out there! Kobato is defently a MUST WATCH anime. And when you watch it, I hope you love it as much as I do. It defently earned thos 10 points.",

I actually see it very well , but the climax hasn't been reached cause even the manga is on-going, but the plot is definitely there. But , if you are expecting an I-didn't-expect-that-to-happen-omg plot , Kobato ain't the thing for you , especially not if you were expecting something groundshaking [ this ain't no death note or stuff like that] It's boundaries remain at a shojo-slice of life-magic anime  ,but I am sure that since CLAMP did it , the story will definitely have some unexpected turns. I trully believe that.So story deserves 9 on my point.\\n\\n\r\nArt : Art is flawless and i doubt anyone would disagree.If anyone should disagree on the beautiful art provided by CLAMP and MADHouse , then i will only say to them : you don't like cute...then why are you even watching this  ? cause it says clearly shojo-magic etc  The art is very cute , beautiful and to top it off good . What has MADHouse on the list surely will be good art.Art gets 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I like the OST . I've been humming 'Magic Number' for weeks now.Maaya Sakamoto pwns.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Cute characters , not flat at all. Kobato is absolute cuteness , Yoryogi absolute funnieness.......Fujimoto , the bishie of the series...doubt any girl has to complain about him , since i will say this : he IS developing as a character and personality nicely , just like Kobato .So gets a 9.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The anime makes you feel all sweet inside .Gives you a nice , friendly ,entertaining feeling.The kind of feeling that makes you wanna say ' I want to see more' . At least , that's how it is for me .I believe the series to be one of the best this year for me.Until now , I have obviously enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nThat is why I say it again : if you are looking for something groundshaking, OMFG-ish and stuff like that.If you hate pink and sweet stuff...don't watch this .In fact , if you are not a shojo-fantasy-CLAMP fan, don't watch it. Do not misunderstand,Kobato isn't mushy , it's just....cotton candy sweet .",

I don't read mangoes, so I wouldn't know, but that didn't stop me from shedding a shit ton of tears.\r\nThe easiest way to know if you will like this show is to watch the first few episodes and ask yourself this: Do you think Kobato is the most adorable thing ever to exist? If you answered yes, like I did, you will absolutely love this show. If you by someweird reason find her abnormally annoying and a cringe-producing machine, then don't even bother watching!\\n\\n\r\nKobato takes the themes of a low IQ deredere and the meaning of happiness and fucks your feelings with tons of moe and melodrama. Do not take Kobato's bubbly exterior lightly, for this show knows how to conduct the feels train as well as Vino can. You may think that Kobato's cheer is too overwhelming to bear, but this actually gives her emotions a lot of contrast, for when she's sad, you'll be crying alongside her as well.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- KOBATO IS SO CUTE!!\\n\r\n- Isn't just a one character show. The other characters have a lot of personality and even have great backstories!\\n\r\n- Great exploration of its themes, like the impact of heartbreak and how important happiness is in one's life.\\n\r\n- Beautiful art and animation.\\n\r\n- Beautiful OST.\\n\r\n- Incredibly heart touching ending. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- I shall quote part of the synopsis on MAL: \"However, she is not allowed to fall in love with anyone whose heart she heals.\" Is this explored or even mentioned at all in the show? Nah not really.\\n\r\n- Kobato isn't going to be loved by everyone. Some people find her annoying.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nThe everyday adventures of Dobato and her angry as fuck stuffed animal. Their goal is to collect confetti, which they earn by healing the hearts of the broken hearted. Pretty simple premise, with slapstick humor and a lot of melancholy. That's how I would describe the show if I was forced to do it as simply as possible.\\n\\n\r\nBut Kobato is way more than that. Kobato is a perfect example of \"It's all about the journey, not the destination.\" When I think of Kobato's adventure, it really makes me think that her journey is the destination itself. It's a story full of discovery, sadness, heartbreak, but eventually, happiness! Optimism doesn't even begin to describe the overall story of Kobato. Sure, there is a lot of incredibly depressing moments, but really, do you think the bubbly Kobato will be depressed for long?\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Kobato's story isn't anything particularly special or groundbreaking, but it did what it was trying to do masterfully. Whether it be through Kobato's silly antics or the crushing heartbreak that some scenes will cause, Kobato definitely executes it's emotions well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI've always been a fan of chibi deformations during comedic scenes. Shows like Aria the Animation, Full Metal Alchemist, Your Lie in April, and many others do it a lot. Out of all the chibi deformations, Kobato's is definitely my favorite (tied with Alphonse actually), for the reason that her facial expressions are SO ADORABLE! \\n\\n\r\nIt isn't just the comedy aspects that Kobato's art excels in. There are a lot of absolutely serene and beautiful moments, both art and animation wise, which really added on to the either cheery or heart wrenching moods of these scenes. Kobato really knows how to support its story with the art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nKobato's song is a recipe for disaster just waiting to come in at the right time to drink your salty tears. At least, that's what it did for me. The OST of this show is incredible, whether it be the uplifting and catchy tunes of comedic scenes, or the nostalgic and heart crushing melodies of the melodramatic scenes. Just like the art, the music supports the moods of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOh, you want me to cover voice acting? HanaKana master race. Moving on...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nHanaKana master race again. Moving on...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAight, so Kobato! Again, she's a make or break character! If you love her lack of intelligence and adorable attitude, I can almost 100% guarantee you that you will like this show. ALMOST. If you think she's obnoxious, then I can also almost 100% guarantee you that you will hate this show. After all, just like HanaKana is in the anime industry, Kobato is everywhere in this show. She is the show itself! She is the comedy, she is the drama, she is the moe, she is everything!\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, they are surprisingly well developed and fleshed out, considering how much of the spotlight Kobato hogs. Ioryogi is the awesome other half of the Dobato Ioryogi comedy duo, as he is the slapstick wielder (except instead of a slapstick, he's a fire bender!!!!). Fujimoto-kun gives off an extremely douche bag vibe at the beginning, but he redeemed himself as a character TREMENDOUSLY throughout the series many times. He's got a lot of character (although he doesn't show it) and he's basically a tsuntsun. He gets a lot of development and has a great backstory as well. \\n\\n\r\nEven the most minor of side characters get a lot of love! Hell, even the main cast of Tsubasa Chronicles helps push the story along!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAt first I laughed my ass off. Then, I was absolutely in love with Kobato's moe. Then, I was crying so much that I could stack a Tear of the Goddess in one spell cast. Btw, thumbs up if you get that reference. It means you probably need to go outside.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nOverall, this show is an absolute blast. Again, it's a hit or miss series, and Kobato is the one shooting. If she hits you, prepare a box tissues, for you'll need them whenever you start crying or start doing some other unmentionable things IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN!!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Please HanaKana, have ma babies. \\n",

            "content": "Cardcaptor Sakura, even when I didn't know back then, was the first touch I had with CLAMP. After being somehow disappointed by Chobits, I decided to start Kobato. Here's my review of this anime that will warm you heart. \r\nStory : 9/10 \r\nThe story of Kobato is pretty simple. We don't know much at first, but it seems that Kobato has to heal broken hearts to realize her wish. Broken hearts, as we and Kobato understand, can be hard to understand and especially to heal. The first 5-6 episodes are completely devoted to this understanding of how the 'konpeito' works. I will tell more aboutthe story on the characters review. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was my biggest fear, as what really turned me off on Chobits was the art, which didn't please me. Kobato was a complete opposite. Characters are overly cute, of course, so you should be aware of that. Hair that almost touches the ground, clothes that are almost surreal, Kobato can't really be considered as a normal japanese girl, but that's because she is not. The art is really, really good and the scenery is amazing. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice of Kobato is really, really nice. She has this kind of way to sing that really warms you up. However, she only sings one song in the entire anime, which is a bit disappointing. The song is really cute, really well written and representative of the anime. Overall, you can't really say that the sound was bad on Kobato, it was just non-diversified. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the good part comes. For the first 5-6 episodes, you might be disappointed and think that this is what the entire anime will be : an episodical anime following the type of Natsume Yuujinchu or even Jigoku Shoujo, where the main character pretty much stays the same all over the anime. However, when Kobato reaches to her kindergarten school, all of this goes away. The character development is amazing. Kobato really grows and learns and it's so nice to see her understand, to feel her joy and sadness, to watch her realize how much this world has to offer. She really is an amazing character and in her own way she also changes everyone she meets. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm having goosebumps as I'm typing this review. Kobato really touched me and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a really soft anime, but well written and really, really full of surprises. The ending of the anime will not disappoint you, that I can assure. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nKobato is the second anime to deserve a 10 from my part. This anime was pure gold. I learned to love Kobato and her naivety, but also wanted to protect her and see her understand the world she lived in, and she did. It was such a joy to see her grow so much and to watch her heal people, live and laugh, to see her change the people she met and to see them slowly starting to love her, to miss her. You can't skip Kobato, because it really is worth it.",

            "content": "Kobato in theory has one of my favourite premises in anime and that is showing people that are suffering and the main character trying to help them . I absolutely love this concept because i always wished for that to happen to me or the people i care about.\r\nSo with that being said why didn't i rate this higher? well let's begin\r\nKobato is a show with not that many flaws to be honest but at the same time i never felt that it reached it's full potential and the reason i feel this way is because for a show about a higher being helping peoplemost problems that the characters had where not that serious with the exception of Fujimoto's and the writer's backstory \\n\r\n(Also the kindergarten arc was good as well)\\n\\n\r\nSo in my opinion the main story while predictable was not bad at all but it got sidetracked by the not so interesting side character's problems (For example one episode is two girls not talking to each other due to a misunderstanding and that's pretty much it)\\n\\n\r\nAnother critism i have for the story is the crossovers with other anime . Episodes 12 , 17 and 20 especially offered nothing to the main story and they could have been left out entirely . I understand Ioryogi and Kohaku because they where important to the plot but everything and everybody else was not needed in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that everything else was pretty good! The animation was so nice that i almost gave it a 7 , the soundtrack was decent , the humour was funny and i really liked the voice actors\\n\\n\r\nFlaws aside i think Kobato is worth a watch when you find the time or you finish other anime that personally interest you\\n\\n\r\n6/10 = Fair \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading i hope that my review helped you in your decision , cheers :)",

            "content": "I have to admit to being won over by Kobato before ever seeing the first frame of film.  One look at the artwork for this series and Kobato's beautiful clothing and settings and I knew this was going to be something for me.  Thankfully I was also rewarded with an enjoyable and heartwarming story.  While Kobato doesn\u2019t exactly break any new ground, it\u2019s a light hearted series that should make anyone smile, with just a touch of drama to keep it interesting.\r\nKobato herself begins as a bit of a mystery, tasked with a mission of healing the hearts of others in orderfor her to be granted her own wish.  Despite being a hopeless idiot and incurably moe, Kobato does the best she can helping others.  She is guided and protected by Ioryogi, an important figure from the spirit world who appears to Kobato in the form of a stuffed animal.  The reasons for her mission, her origins, and the reason for Ioryogi's appearance are explained as the story unfolds. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the plot is going to be fairly predictable to anyone who's seen many series like this and the early episodes are a bit formulaic.  However this does change as the plot thickens over the last half of the series.  I found the pacing to be good and I never felt that it lingered or stalled for too long in any place for me to get bored with it.  Maybe the only exception would be the first half dozen episodes, with their similar and episodic plotlines.  I was never blown away with any of it despite Kobato's overwhelming cuteness, but the ending story arc is both heartwarming and heat wrenching.  But I did like the ending overall and felt it wrapped up the series nicely and tied up all the loose ends.\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason to watch Kobato is for the titular character.  She is overbearingly adorable in every way.  Her character design is extremely appealing and she has possibly the best wardrobe I have yet seen in anime.  Kobato could be the poster girl for moe; she\u2019s earnest, innocent, naive, lacking any common sense, and impossibly stupid.  On the surface one would probably think she lacked substance as well.  While you could definitely say this early on, due to the length of the series and the time spent growing and developing her character she eventually becomes a great all around protagonist, instead of just a moe figurehead.\\n\\n\r\nKobato's main foil would be her guardian Ioryogi.  A quick tempered spirit stuck in the form of a stuffed animal, he is constantly berating Kobato for her stupidity and chastising her for not staying on task.  However despite his gruff nature it\u2019s obvious that he really loves and cares about her too.  The relationship between them is the source of a lot of the shows humor, and I found the pair to be quite a delight to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe other most important character to the story would be the introverted and standoffish Fugimoto.  I am not really a big fan of Fugimoto's type and always feel this is an overused clich\u00e9, particularly in shoujo and romance anime.  I don\u2019t think I will ever understand why girls find this kind of guy to be appealing.  Why would you want to break down the guys emotional barriers and deal with all his baggage when there are plenty of other guys who are actually nice to you?  Someday I hope to understand this mindset.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast is handled well and for the most part quite interesting.  Sayaka is the most important, as the head of the preschool that Fugimoto and Kobato work.  The great majority of the story takes place at the school and revolves around their efforts to save it from villainous loan sharks.  Sayaka is given some back story and development but most of the remaining cast remains mostly static.  They push the story in the right direction when needed and then fade from view.  This is a good thing since it allows the show to focus on those who deserve the screen time.\\n\\n\r\nI am not particularly a huge fan of CLAMP artwork and designs.  While their drawings are undoubtedly brilliant and beautiful (particularly when drawing children), I never liked the skinny and malnourished looking characters.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn\u2019t the case in Kobato and the production studio opted for a more normal look.  While everyone is still a bit too thin, they don\u2019t look like they are starving to death.  What really won me over and why I think this is perhaps the most visually appealing work yet was Kobato and her beautiful clothing.  Also, being a CLAMP product you can expect are to see plenty of references and cameos by familiar characters from their other works.  It is nice that at least for the important ones, they don\u2019t seem to reuse the same old models with different names.  This may or may not be a bonus to some fans, but for me it was refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe series music, the OP theme and the in between songs are cute and very fitting of the series nature.  In addition the acting is solid all around.  Kobato's seiyuu is suitably adorable sounding and brings out her personality.  Though it does become a bit grating and overly cute at times, it is a minor annoyance and it probably wouldn\u2019t work as well with a more mature sounding voice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I found Kobato to be a rewarding and wonderful viewing experience.  If you like cute and adorable things, CLAMP, light hearted and touching stories with a hint of romance; then Kobato should be high on your list.  If you really dislike moe or need action to be entertained than this is something you should stay away from.  While it may not go down as an all-time classic, Kobato will leave you with a smile.\\n",

            "content": "Amazing- that's the one word I would use to describe Kobato.\r\nI'm rather picky with my ratings, but for the first time in a good while, I decided on a ten.\r\nStory-9 The plot of Kobato. starts out simple enough- a girl assigned the task of healing peoples' wounded hearts. The first half of the series covers the bases of the overall objective- cases of Kobato doing her work. Even these earlier episodes I though were awesome, but as the series enters its second half, Kobato.'s plot thickens and the series develops into a masterpiece.\r\nIn the first half, we see glimpses of the dark realities of lifebeneath the bright, cheerful character of Kobato- and from the very start, Kobato. deals with very real life details; a misunderstanding with a friend, a tragedy with a lover, family problems... \\n\r\nIn the second half, however, is revealed a whole new facet of Kobato. The show cuts deeper than a story about a girl with the objective of fulfilling her dream. Debts. Love. Death. Tragedy. Farewells. We see all of these events changing and forming a much more mature Hanato Kobato\\n\\n\r\nArt-10 I loved the art- I loved it! The details are intricate, the colors and effects wonderfully done. I don't think I could have asked more of the creators (especially considering this is based off a CLAMP work) except actually letting viewers distinguish the ages of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nSound-10 The soundtrack for Kobato. was one of the best I've ever heard. My favorite soundtrack up until the point I saw Kobato. was the True Tears Soundtrack, but Kobato. really gave True Tears a run for its money. The sounds vary- cheerful, light, heavy, peaceful... Both soundtracks are masterpieces that fulfill their purpose, supporting and improving the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10 Character. Yes, I'm someone who doesn't enjoy a book, movie... or anything with shallow characters. At a glimpse, people may think Kobato, is just another \"moe\", empty-headed character,  but as the series progresses, all the characters- Fujimoto and Kobato noticeably- grow and mature as they learn important life lessons through their trials. The storyline doesn't go \"easy\" on them: the lessons they learn are tough, yes, but also shape and define the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10 I both laughed and cried while watching Kobato. It really is a series with contrasting qualities; it brings laughter and tears. It shows the darkness in our society, but also the hope, dreams, and goodness in it. There are trials, but also miracles and second chances. This simple, 24-episode story has all this- and what's even better is that it has a healing quality, one that warms the heart.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall-10 Overall, I give Kobato. a ten. I would give an eleven if I could. Kobato. is something viewers of all ages can watch- I would recommend to anyone, anyday. You could watch it with the whole family, your siblings, friends... it's not something you have to filter or think through. \\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is to give it a try- and let the show do the rest.",

No, not that the show had sud\u00addenly become watch\u00adable, that wasn\u2019t to hap\u00adpen for sev\u00aderal more epis\u00adodes. No, what hit me was a per\u00adfect way to express what it was I didn\u2019t like about this show. I had some vague review thoughts in my head (sub\u00adcon\u00adsciously review\u00ading the show as you watch it; the curse of being a critic) but most of them revolved around bitch\u00ading about how stu\u00adpid Kobato her\u00adself was and how the show relied on cute\u00adness as its main appeal, some\u00adthing I\u2019ve just never really liked. But then it hit me. I read ona blog somewhere that the way the person got through a series they didn\u2019t like was because they spent their time also play\u00ading Poke\u00admon. So I finally got around to play\u00ading Poke\u00admon Plat\u00adinum after the first few episodes of Kobato (why yes, I am a game behind every\u00adone else) because I real\u00adised I would prob\u00adably smash my laptop if I had to sit through another \u2018Kobato Gan\u00adbar\u00adrebleargh~\u2019 without some\u00adthing else to occupy my mind. Now nor\u00admally this shouldn\u2019t work unless I was watch\u00ading the dub. Mul\u00adti\u00adtask\u00ading while watch\u00ading subs is next to impossible. How\u00adever it did work because I actu\u00adally under\u00adstood pretty much everything that was being said.\\n\\n\r\nLet me explain. I have never once made an attempt at learn\u00ading Japan\u00adese. I know about as much as any wee\u00adaboo who watches subbed anime would know. Watch\u00ading Kobato wasn\u2019t a sud\u00adden grand real\u00adisa\u00adtion that I was now flu\u00adent in Japan\u00adese. It was the sim\u00adpli\u00adcity of the lan\u00adguage the char\u00adac\u00adters used. They all had just a few stock lines they would throw out in most situ\u00adations which meant that after watch\u00ading a few epis\u00adodes pay\u00ading atten\u00adtion to the subs you knew pretty much everything that they could say. This effects the anime in far more ways than you might real\u00adise. Of course you get the pain\u00adfully dull and repet\u00adit\u00adive dia\u00adlogue. Of course there\u2019s the way every scene and every epis\u00adode feels the exact bloody same with no inspir\u00ada\u00adtion, ingenu\u00adity or ima\u00adgin\u00ada\u00adtion, bar Kobato\u2019s ward\u00adrobe. But along\u00adside that you also have the actual ten\u00adsion in the series solved using the same unin\u00adspired meth\u00adods in every epis\u00adode. Kobato throws out a few stock phrases, Ioryogi mut\u00adters some\u00adthing in the back\u00adground and all is right with the world once again. It lim\u00adits the dir\u00adec\u00adtion any epis\u00adode can take.\\n\\n\r\nBut yes, it does get bet\u00adter. It may take until around epis\u00adode 17 before I actu\u00adally went through an epis\u00adode without hav\u00ading beaten 3\u20134 poke\u00admon train\u00aders while it was play\u00ading, but it cer\u00adtainly did improve. Vastly improved. By epis\u00adode 20 I had shut that Game Boy for good and was actu\u00adally watch\u00ading this show for real. The show took a much more dra\u00admatic and mel\u00adan\u00adcholic tone that suited the style of storytelling far more. After watch\u00ading the pre\u00advi\u00adous 16 epis\u00adodes of failed com\u00adedy (bar Ioryogi dodging cork bul\u00adlets at the fest\u00adival. That was quite funny) and bland stor\u00adies that were sup\u00adposed to be heart\u00adwarm\u00ading, the effect this change to a plot-driven story had on the over\u00adall qual\u00adity of the show was phe\u00adnom\u00adenal. \\n\\n\r\nLet me talk about the MAL stats for a second on this series. There\u2019s a very high per\u00adcent\u00adage drop rate to com\u00adpleted rate, around 20% of the people who watched it, dropped it. And yet the anime is rated 8.07 at the time of writing, a very respect\u00adable score indeed. MAL doesn\u2019t count the scores once you\u2019ve seen bey\u00adond a cer\u00adtain num\u00adber of epis\u00adodes so those who actu\u00adally sat through the entire thing were clearly rewar\u00added for their efforts. It also shows the usual reac\u00adtion of people to rate some\u00adthing highly because the later epis\u00adodes were bet\u00adter, much like After Story. It\u2019s some\u00adthing that bugs me a lot because I hate hav\u00ading to sit through sev\u00aderal poor epis\u00adodes just because \u2018it gets bet\u00adter I swear!\u2019. I don\u2019t doubt it does. It\u2019s just those earlier epis\u00adodes are a right pain to sit through. Because Kobato is, for the most part, a poor anime. It just hap\u00adpens to end on a very high note. Plus you can\u2019t skip those earlier epis\u00adodes the same way you the\u00ador\u00adet\u00adic\u00adally can for After Story. Without those earlier epis\u00adodes the end\u00ading ones don\u2019t work.\\n\\n\r\nIt did turn me into a romantic sap though. Good old Clamp did it again. They made me believe that, through any\u00adthing, love will pre\u00advail. No mat\u00adter what hap\u00adpens to you, what you go through, what form you\u2019re in, love will get through all that. It did the very same thing Chob\u00adits did. It made me believe in the Power of Love. I came into this anime look\u00ading for some\u00adthing to rep\u00adlic\u00adate the feel\u00ading Chob\u00adits gave me and, in the end, I guess it did exactly that.",

            "content": "What are you doing with your life?  What are you working for?  What will you accomplish during your time?  How could that time be better served improving that of another?\r\nAll of these are questions you'll probably be asking yourself while watching \"Kobato.\"\r\n\"Kobato\" is one of those rarities that soothes the soul.  It's hard not to find yourself smiling often, since there are many heartwarming moments throughout.  The show regularly brought tears to the eye--not of sadness, but happiness.  It's definitely something to consider checking out if you like happier anime, or need something to cheer you up.\r\nThe entire pointof the series can be summarized with one word: empathy.  It shows the heartwarming inspiration and greatness of what happens when someone abandons their own interests for the sake of helping others.  When someone becomes selfless, the avenue is opened up for miraculous outcomes and beautiful changes in peoples' lives.\\n\\n\r\nA pessimistic philosopher once said that there is no such thing as a truly selfless action, basing their argument on the premise that we're only doing it because seeing someone in need bothers us--because we ourselves would feel better and be at peace if they were happier.  But what about people for whom this sense of relief is only a side effect?  What about the people who truly don't care about themselves, and are willing to go above and beyond to lend a hand when someone needs it?  \"Kobato\" shows how great your life can be when you realize that following your own dreams isn't the only source of fulfillment.\\n\\n\r\nI was a little nervous at first becaue of how moe Kobato herself was, but I quickly learned just how great of a character she is.  Her mission is to heal peoples' hearts so her wish can be granted, but it becomes obvious early on that she is far too concerned with the well-being of others to worry about filling the jar for herself.  (Ioryogi constantly observes this and stresses over how she may not complete her task in time to have her wish granted.)  She'll spend days--or longer--working towards an end, even with the knowledge that it won't get her any closer to her goal.  She's great with kids and loves to help out at the local preschool, even though this too doesn't directly get her any closer to her goal.  She loses sleep worrying about the problems of those around her:  She relentlessly seeks solutions, no matter how poorly she may be treated or how ingrateful the person may be.  She just wants everyone to be happy.\\n\\n\r\nKobato teaches us to take pleasure in little things as she carries out every task happily and with a smile--even ones we may not necessarily want to do.  It's a combination of these things that leads to the creation of what is perhaps the best wife/mother material to ever grace the world of fiction.\\n\\n\r\nIf we had more characters (or better yet, people) like Kobato, the world would be a better place.  It's disheartening that mindless fan service dolls are more popular than characters that are actually GOOD from shows with actual substance.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has more characterization and character development in a single episode than many anime contain over the span of their entire runtime.  It's touching to see the characters change after their encounters with Kobato.  The show deals with very real issues people go through and examines the power one person stepping outside of themselves can have, making all the difference in changing a life.  Even the most stone-hearted aren't safe from her outgoing and caring nature: no wound can't be healed with the proper care.\\n\\n\r\n\"Kobato\" has a pretty good idea of when it's time to stop with the comedic content when things are getting serious, which is really important in a dramedy.  Once misplaced line can completely butcher the mood of a scene; \"Kobato\" knows what's appropriate and when, but is quick to throw in a crack once the storm has passed and the happy status quo has been restored, helping complete a smooth transition and elevating the viewer's spirits.\\n\\n\r\n...I guess I gotta talk about art 'n' sound 'n' stuff, too.  Character design is great; there are some pretty unique ones, the most unique and appealing being Kobato.  Hair movement seems to have been given a particular attention, particularly in the case of it bouncing up and down and someone runs or as the wind blows through it--again, the most attention was given to Kobato.  There is some pretty great imagery, like petals, or leaves falling from trees, or snow, and the surrounding greenary is always a pleasure.  Warmer, brighter, and more vibrant colors are what dominate the visible spectrum, complementing the overall tone of the series.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting quality is excellent, with Hana Kanazawa completely bringing the show to life with her peppy, happy, excited Kobato.  Hearing her sing was an extra special treat.  The soundtrack contains some beautiful pieces--particularly those played during more dramatic or emotionally riveting scenes, although there are a number of more upbeat ones for the laid back/comedic scenes.\\n\\n\r\n\"Kobato\" made me put my hands together and clap like an idiot because it made me so happy.  The show renewed my faith in humanity; it gave me hope that there may still be good people out there with actual morals who care about their fellow man.  It's wholesome, pure, innocent, and clean--all endangered, unappreciated, underrated qualities in this day and age.  It made me take a step back and reexamine how I was living, and radically altered my outlook on life in general.\\n\\n\r\nSo...  How might \"Kobato\" touch YOU?",

Every time she heals a heart, a candy-like gem called Confetto will appear in a glass bottle in which she carries around. When this glass bottle finally fills up, she will get her wish granted. Thus, the story of Kobato follows her attempts to find people to heal.\r\nStory\r\nOh boy... Where do I even begin. The whole storyline has been put out so slowly I've lost interest. Even as a major fan of slice of life and non-related episodic anime (in which my favourites include HidamariSketch and Aria, as well as being a fan of Sketchbook and GA), this doesn't draw me in in any way possible.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: 6 episodes after I originally wrote this, I'd say it jsut got worse. they made a highly pointless time skip, in which we end upa few months later, with NO advancement to the storyline, and she just goes on continuing to collect Confetto.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nFor some plus points, I've always been a fan of the animation Madhouse does, and this is no exception.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nMusic is decent, except when Kobato sings. It's too darn fake-sounding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nBoy oh boy number 2...\\n\\n\r\nThe anime appears to have 3 main characters. Starting with Fujimoto, the guy appears to be an absolute jerk, but \"becomes nicer\" after meeting up with Kobato. Appears to have some issues that he helps Kobato find an owner for a stray cat after telling his college classmates he doesn't want to help them isn't very convincing. Secondly, Kobato's character is highly annoying. Her naivety is beyond that of even a child, or maybe the word should be stupidity? Or bimbotic? Either way, this is the first time I did not like a Kana Hanazawa character. The third main in Ioryogi is possibly the most likeable of the trio. That said, the bossy, fire breathing stuff animal is no Mokona or Keroberos, and pretty much insults the great \"stuff animals\" that we have seen by CLAMP thus far.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWhile fire breathing, klutzy antics can be enjoyable once in a while, seeing every episode REALLY gets old, and poor characters and a lack of the heart warming feeling from a slice of life anime really kills off the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime has gone is a very poor direction. If I was new to the slice of life genre, watching this will make me want to permanantly avoid it. I had such high hopes for Kobato. Poor CLAMP production, poor Madhouse production. Disappointing.",

The artwork  is amazing with the nice colors and the touch that makes certain characters lovely or not. The songs played in the background  as well as songs that Kobato herself sings were all perfect for the anime.\r\nThe story itself had times where it dragged on imo, but in the last few episodes, they were wrapped up so perfectly, and the final episode is one that I'dconsider the best ending I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching Kobato for lulz as well as just experiencing the adorableness.

            "content": "NOTE: the first paragraph is for those who are looking for motivation to watch this series, if not skip to the next.     \r\n If you're tired or bored watching same anime storyline over and over again and looking for something different, then I'm sure watching Kobato would not impress even a single cell in your brain, well at first. It's storyline is a typical shoujo, as you might be expecting, with a witty, innocent, naive etc. main character ,that you might have seen a thousand times already, living her life sharing/showing her naivety/innocence to others day by day. But even thoughyou feel like ditching this series after reading this, I would like you to sit tight and relax for a bit, for me giving a 9 overall score isn't a mistake.\\n\\n\r\nKobato is a lighthearted series that has a nice blend of drama, comedy, a bit of fantasy, a bit of slice of life, and a happy romantic ending.\\n\\n\r\nHanato Kobato, the childish, naive and sweet main character, is on a mission to fulfill her wish, to go somewhere and in order to accomplish it she need to fill a flask with each person she heals.  She resides in a park with a spirit named Ioryogi with a body of small blue stuffed dog. Ioryogi acts as a strict proctor to Kobato and he often shouts at her or bathes her with fire when she makes mistakes. Uninteresting? maybe, maybe not.\\n\\n\r\nWell the story started to slowly revolve upon her arrival at a Nursery after following Fujimoto. The first episodes were mostly episodic, her meeting with different people and eventually healing their problems and filling up her flask in the process. At this moment we might have give up all our hopes and ditch this series(like me) but as it goes the stories goes deeper and deeper as more and more mysteries were revealed and slowly the characters develop. This is where the story gets interesting and eventually captivating you to the series.\\n\\n\r\nIts pacing is what made this series beautiful. It carried the series from being a mediocre to unforgettable. Even though the storyline carries some inevitable cons such as \"non-sense'' and \"idiotic\" scenes it manages to bring out even a tiny droplet of meaningful things from it and adding it up to the grand climax later on.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was the greatest asset of the series. I'm not a fan of CLAMP art and I dislike their skinny character design and I'm so glad they did a very good job here. Kobato is one of the few characters that I've seen with a change of outfit, and very cute. The characters' faces and hair are very beautiful, specially for Kobato and the kids. The background art was also marvelous and it perfectly blends with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know whether to praise the STs or not, I'm really confused b/c the STs blended extraordinarily in each scene, adding depth to the emotion, to the point that I can't  remember any melody at all. The OP was astounding. It has a bright and slightly playful melody w/c brings up the character of Kobato.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the cast are design rip-offs from previous CLAMP animes (such as Chobits) and some did have a cameo appearance. The main characters were shrouded in some sort of mystery, specially Kobato. Most of those were revealed in perfect timing but others were just left there hanging in the clouds, such as the Spirits and this \"war\" they had w/ the \"heaven\". Yet characters are not without flaws. I'll particularly discuss Fujimoto. For me his developments as a character are shown poorly, or rather was not developed enough, he hardly shown any development and it made him look like a \"developed\" character from the beginning, which is not a very nice asset of a character. Well all I wanted to say is that he has a slow gradual development and a spike on the end, maybe some may like it or maybe most, but I don't.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning I was bought out  by its high rating( I usually pick my anime to watch this way) but then I find it boring in the first 10 min. of the first episode and decided to ditch it(that's how picky I am) but for the sake of my \"wasted\" HDD space I decided to rerun it and I'm very glad that I did.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end of the day I find myself crying on the 23rd episode and had a bittersweet smile at the 24th. I'm not someone to cry on any drama so it really surprised me how I was so frustrated to Fujimoto, he was a jerk. LOL.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways the series was unforgettable. I really enjoyed watching it and its truly worthwhile. Kobato reminded me that somewhere, maybe, on this world there is this one idiot person that follows you around, annoys you. You might end up hurting that person but still that person will always be by your side, no matter what and someday you'll realize how important it is ...to have an idiot person beside you...\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, this will be my first review and I don't know whether my style of writing would fit for a review. They always told that my writing was dreamy and I have no hope writing bookish statements. So if you find my review so disturbing or something, please send me a message, it would really help me. And for grammatical errors, sorry I was refraining from using a lot of metaphors.\\n\\n\\n",

Kobato. seemed like a happy exception to the rule, but after a few episodes, it became apparent that old habits die hard for me (or rather \"shoujo sucks\" is still upheld).\r\n==[Pros]==\r\n- Visuals.  Like most CLAMP works, Kobato. has great character designs and is an artistic triumph.  I usually hate chibi, but the chibi here is well-placed, albeit done a bit frequently.\r\n- Kobato.  She is a great character, reminiscent of Yotsuba in her curiosity and innocence.  Her easily earned smileand ability to talk straightforwardly are traits that give off a childlike feel and ultimately make for an intriguing main character and an equally interesting plot.\\n\\n\r\n- All of the mysteries.

Ioryogi meets figures from his past and Kobato is mentioned more than once in his speech.  I don't want the show to focus on the mysteries surrounding Kobato.  All I want to see is an innocent girl interacting with the world around her.  Is that too much to ask?\\n\\n\r\n- Non-episodic nature.  The early episodes are slice-of-life and run smoothly, but when Kobato gets hired, the show gets bogged down.  Add to this an overall story, and the original slice-of-life qualities that I found impressive in Kobato. have all but vanished.\\n\\n\r\n- Focus becomes Kobato's airhead qualities instead of her innocence and naivety.  I want to see the world through Kobato's eyes.  I don't want to see Kobato's eyes flat on the floor.\\n\\n\r\n- Ioryogi is (as of ep. 6) in the show for comic relief and as a gateway into Kobato's background.  Both of these purposes aren't exactly beneficial: fire breathing and sudden outbursts become old by episode two and learning Kobato's background answers questions that don't need to be answered.\\n\\n\r\n- Fujimoto sucks.  I hate him.  Nothing about his character is even remotely appealing.\\n\\n\\n\r\n==[Conclusion]==\\n\r\nGreat start for a shoujo, but ends up shifting direction from an interesting story about an innocent girl to a boring story about a bumbling fool and her mascot's uninteresting past.",

            "content": "Kobato is a show I really struggled to find raw enjoyment in.  It may be part in fact that I am normally a fan of silly lighthearted romance comedies and the occasional shonen anime.  Suffice to say that this would be one reason to avoid this show.  If you're looking for something flashy that will grab your attention immediately, this show is worth removing from your \"Plan to Watch\" list.\r\nHowever ultimately I did decide to watch this show to completion since I am open to trying new things.\r\nThe story is fairly down to earth, once you look past the obvious fact thatKobato and Ioryogi are obviously not normal beings. The show starts very slowly, playing itself out episodically as Kobato interacts with other people on different days of the seasons to heal them of their misfortunes and collect \"candy\" in the process. That by itself is fairly repetitive, and little is done to really explain in detail who exactly the main characters are. Aside from the occasional gag where Kobato's clumsiness gets the better of her (and Ioryogi's temper), it's hard to find anything that really stands out in this show, as plot and character development happens very slowly. I probably sympathize with Ioryogi's complaints about 'Dobato' in general not getting stuff done efficiently.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is at least pretty good.  Characters and special effects have been drawn with pretty good detail, so the show at least won't make you want to tear your eyes out. The music isn't very special, aside from Kobato's song, and the first ED for this show is painfully uninteresting with an unremarkable song and a redundant animation of Kobato's candy bottle slowly rotating.\\n\\n\r\nThe story does try to pick itself up towards the end, explaining some of Fujimoto and Sayaka's background and how it relates to Yomogi nursery, and even closer towards the end there is some attempt to try to explain why Kobato is significant to this in the first place. The show becomes a bit of a confusing mess when there is some indirect attempts to hint around the backgrounds of the characters from other worlds and there is a good number of poorly explained ends.\\n\\n\r\nIs this show what people would classify as of the shoujo genre? Maybe that genre is not meant for me.  I'd like someone to tell me otherwise if there are perhaps better shows like this one. It's not like I find this show is outright horrible.  While there are some humorous and tender moments, there really just isn't enough that happens over the course of 24 episodes. It's just a very slow show in general with a fairly uncomplicated plot that has few twists to really spark interest.  Overall I really wouldn't recommend wasting ~12 hours on this show.  I don't find this show good enough in anything to counterbalance how slow this show is. The characters aren't developed well enough for the most part, the story isn't really wholly amazing, and there isn't really much implementation of anything that will grab your attention like action scenes.",

            "content": "Every single person you've meet in your life hasn't felt perfect in every single moment of his/her life. It's nothing but normal to feel pain in certain situations. But there are people who suffer a little more than others. \r\nIn this anime, a mysterious girl appears with a mission. She has to heal hearts which are in pain, in other words, wounded hearts. If she completes her mission, her wish will come true. The story has very happy and very sad moments. It succeeds in making you smile without being stupid and succeeds in making you sad without being pathetic and boring. I would saythat the story is pretty good, it had potential and used it. There is background story for almost everything that happens, and behind almost every character. The final form was done well. It may be deeper than it seems. Only thing I don't like is that there are few 'holes' in it. I mean, some thing aren't explained very well in the end, so:\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nWhile trying to complete her mission, she meets many people with interesting stories. All those persons have completed, interesting, touching and pretty realistic stories. I liked that you can laugh and cry with those characters. Also, I must mention that the characters develop through the story. You can notice how they learn more about themselves, experience all sorts of feelings and realize them. I would say they get more 'mature' in self-knowledge with the pass of time.\\n\r\nKobato is kind and nice girl. In the beginning it seems that she helps other people only because of her selfish wishes, but later we see that she really likes to help others, which makes her a great person. Fujimoto at first seems like self-centered and cold person, but he really isn't like that. We can watch him getting softer and softer as the time passes. And Ioryogi is a lot more than a stuffed animal.\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe drawing looks simply beautiful. The thing I liked the most were eyes (and the whole face). The characters look pretty realistic. Also, their body parts are proportional, which is good. The clothes were fantastically drawn, and I liked that they aren't wearing the same clothes all the time. Their moves are done pretty good too. Animation was correct, no mistakes, and was especially good in some episodes.\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe music was done well. The songs were different one from each other. They were perfectly suitable for the 'mood' of the moments. Here, we had both sad and happy sounds. The voice acting was pretty fine, without special mistakes. I would like more emotions in few moments, but that's only my personal impression. Voices fit good in characters. I loved second ending. \\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has many parts different in mood. In one moment it makes you laugh, in second it makes you worry, in third you cry. It gets both happy and sad, dramatic, and in few moments romantic. It surely will make you enjoy. The only thing I didn't like is that there were few funny scenes based on the same situation, so:\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis show is a good choice if you want to watch something relaxing, but not without a story. Also, it can easily change your mood, so, if you want to get in the story, it's a good idea to watch this. This is an anime you don't just watch, you feel it.\\n\\n\r\nQuote for the end:\\n\r\n\"Is there anyone who needs healing here?!\"\\n\\n",

            "content": "Before I watched Kobato, I had yet to find an anime that made me emotional. I had NEVER cried before while watching an anime, and I did watch some pretty sad/deep ones.\r\nWhen I saw the DVD cover, I was a bit hesitant. I couldn't help but think that it would be another one of those pointless happy-go-lucky friendship-is-the-best animes. But. The opening started playing and by the end of the first episode my eyes were glued to the computer screen. I \r\nI literally fell in love with Kobato's guardian/mascot/stuffed animal Ioriyogi! The art was amazing and I adored Kobato's cute, frilly outfits (why don't Ihave clothes like that sobsob).\\n\\n\r\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was of an outstanding quality and I just realized I never really thought about the quality of it because it was THAT EPIC!\\n\\n\r\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\\n\\n\r\nI was watching the last episode at 2 a.m (wow! early, much?) and I let me tell you, my pyjamas were SOAKED and I cried for about half an hour! I woke up my whole family! The episode was so sad but at the same time so happy... Kobato is such a sweetie and Fujimoto is kinda stubborn and likes to lash out at people  but that adds to his moe-ness !!!!(*is a masochist*)\\n\\n\r\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this series to anyone who is sad and wants something to cheer them up, or just wants a good cry. I also recommend it to people who have pretty much watched every good anime known to otaku and can't find an anime without ninja turds and anything to do with souls being taken. Actually, scratch that. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend Kobato to EVERYONE!\\n\\n\r\nAkira-ne \u2606\\n",

            "content": "I actually enjoyed this anime so much.  I originally started watching it because I was after a time passer but Kobato turned out to be so much more. The whole anime was such a mood lifter and can be best described as soft and fluffy. \r\nThe story follows a girl, Kobato, who has been sent to Earth to heal people's hearts. She has 4 seasons of the weather to fill up a jar with the 'konpeito', what the bottled heart fragments are referred to. Her guide is Iorogi, a being taking the form of a stuffed animal. Kobato falls in love with a nurseryshe begins to work at and the story follows from there.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10 - I admit that the last few episodes aren't what I expected. It turned out to be one of those 'fate' animes. Up until the last episode the story was perfect. There were occasional fillers but they were funny and cute so I didn't mind. The anime was well paced, never did I think,  'did I miss something?'. Even though the ending wasn't perfect,  it had its own charms because it showed what happened to everyone as time passed and I couldn't spot any holes in the plot. It ran really smoothly. Though,  I didn't like that they kept us guessing Kobato's past until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & music 8/10 - The art was beautiful. I didn't like how the hair was done for some characters but the art was so crisp and pretty. The change of clothing was also something which I liked, especially Kobato's. \\n\r\nThe music was soft and refreshing. I truly did enjoy the songs which were used, even though they were repetitive. The OP and ED suited the anime very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10 - The characters were so deep. That's what I loved. Everyone had a back story, even if it wasn't explained very well. Their personalities were done very well. Kobato was truly the most gorgeous character and it was very hard not to love her. All the other characters were likeable too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 8/10, I really enjoyed this anime and look forward to re watching it sometime in the future.",

            "content": "After finishing watching Kobato only today, I was compelled to write my first review ever for this wonderful anime, Kobato.\r\nWhere to start? \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI definitely thought the story was well thought out. Some could argue that there were a lot of \"fillers\", but I disagree. The episodes that seemingly contributed no development to the plot let the watcher get a better feel on each of the characters' background stories and personalities, especially Kobato and Fujimoto's. Kobato's background story, not so much, but definitely her personality.\r\nThe last 7 or so episodes really started picking up the pace and started climbing towards the climax. Again, the storywas well-thought out. I am definitely the type of anime-watcher who would ditch a series after watching the first few episodes if I wasn't interested, and in fact, I did put Kobato on hold after the first 10 episodes, but I'm so glad that I decided to watch again a few days ago. I would've never thought that this anime could develop so much and bring so much meaning to life (dramatic, I know!) in a mere 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMany agree that the art in Kobato is just refreshing, modern, and amazing--and so do I! Unlike some anime, the \"profile\" shots of the characters were never distorted and they always looked great. You could definitely tell the animators weren't being lazy! The art is beautiful, beautiful, so beautiful. One quirky thing I just noticed (and liked!) about the art was Kobato's way of dressing. I've watched and read most of Clamp's work, and it seemed like they took bits of Cardcaptor Sakura (with the costumes) and Tsubasa Chronicles (her body-shape and long dresses) and combined those styles into Kobato's dresses full of simple colors and great design that show that Kobato is unique, cute, beautiful, innocent... the list goes on.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI admit, I don't pay much attention to the soundtrack of an anime unless it's for fighting scenes, the climax, or the music's just really loud. Kobato's songs are beautiful and so fitting for this cute but emotional anime. As for the soundtrack, it definitely fit the anime and the mood of it with a simple piano background at times or the tinkling of bells. The seiyuus (voice actors) did a good job with their characters. The characters' voices were realistic and true to the character. Kobato's voice took a little while to get used to since it was so high-pitched and I could HEAR the smile in her voice. Scary, I know. But it was great :) I loved loryogi's voice the most.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in the \"Story\" section of my review, there were some \"fillers\" but they helped with the characterization of Kobato, Mrs. Sayaka, and Fujimoto mostly. Kobato's background is pretty hazy and vague most of the 26 episodes, but near the end you find out so much information, but it's not overwhelming. You just need to be patient. As for Mrs. Sayaka and Fujimoto, their backgrounds are pretty well explained throughout the series in every other episode or so, so there is no suspenseful wait for the details on those two. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I didn't like about the characterization in Kobato. is loryogi's background and his friends (Ginsei, etc). I just felt that CLAMP didn't do enough to describe their pasts in detail, only dropping some vague information here and there. I was pretty confused about their backgrounds throughout the anime and I was dying to know more about them, almost as much as I wanted to know about Kobato's past and who she really is. Spoilers aren't allowed in reviews, but all I can say is that I feel pretty disappointed about loryogi and the lack of information on him.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI had to be patient with this anime. I'm the type with a very short attention span who never likes to commit to anything, pretty much. But I did come back to this anime after a one month break and I enjoyed it IMMENSELY. The first 15 episodes or so are cute and sweet, but as I recall, didn't really contribute to the plot that much. \\n\\n\r\nThe beginning episodes talked about the history of Yomogi Nursery and Mrs. Sayaka, Fujimoto, and some other minor characters and how Kobato settled into Earth. I soon lost interest after watching for a bit. But I'm very glad I finished watching Kobato to the end. After the first half of the series, \"action\" started picking up and I was hooked to the very end, where I got all emotional and sniffled a bit. I enjoyed Kobato so so much, I just wish that the beginning half had more to offer, especially about loryogi and his friends.\\n\\n\r\nLike in most of CLAMP's work, they \"recycled\" their characters. Some characters from their other works like Tsubasa Chronicles and Cardcaptor Sakura appeared in Kobato, though they had very minor roles. That was enjoyable XD\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI was definitely tempted to make the overall a \"10\" but I knew that the anime did have a minor cons. I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who likes Cardcaptor Sakura-type anime, but you need to be prepared for less action, but more kawaii-ness :) Also, anyone who is stressed and just needs a break to watch a cute, fun-filled (not the Lucky Star-type, though!), and emotional anime whose main key points are making other people happy and enjoying it. This anime is definitely centered around happiness and made me very happy too. After reading all the comments each episode got on the internet, everyone felt happy too. CLAMP really captured my heart with this anime. I'll definitely consider reading the manga. :D\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: A thorough and intense story. Watching it with concentration gives you the essence of how excellently the story unfolds. The small things in life are depicted wonderfully in these 24 episodes. Emotions have been handled with great care to give the appropriate impact in each episode. [10/10] \r\nArt: The Original Art by Mangaka CLAMP are always beautifully drawn. (They are the best illustrators among Mangaka really -only my personal opinion ofcourse.)  The Art in the series too is excellent. Kobato's innocence, Sayaka Sensei's kindness, Kiyokazu's attitude, all show up nicely from the way they have been drawn. Loryogi-san is comical. The background landscapeis not much so that focus is kept more on the characters- again a benifit in terms of the impact that the characters and their behavior can have on the viewer. [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nSound: Music by Takeshi Hama is melodious. An Ancient Story is my personal favourite. Ashita Kuru Hi (sung by Kobato in the series at 2-3 occasions) is another melody which slowly begins to resonate after a few episodes. Hotaru no Mori is another beautiful tune with bells. Most music pieces are played on Violins, Viola, Cello, Piano. The music again adds to the atomosphere creation in each episode. [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Kobato's innocence is 100% believable. There are also some times in episodes when one suddenly realises that though she is all bubbly all the time, there is a hint of sadness somewhere behind that smile. Sayaka Sensei's kindness is too much but still that character is very much believable. Kiyokazu is shown to have a bit of attitude but he's a really caring person inside. Doumoto is simply a guy any girl would love to fall in love. Loryogi-san is really comical. But he too cares for Kobato throughout the series and indirectly guides her to good things. [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you like watching Slice of life genre anime then Kobato is THE anime to watch. Day to day experiences that Kobato has have varied emotions. And in many ways Kobato herself heals many peoples troubled hearts unknowingly. [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It was an overwhemling experience for me to see a story that was so perfectly woven to express emotions felt by a person in everyday life. Emotions though unfolded one by one have a rather intense impact on the viewer many a times. (especially episode 13- you just have to watch it to understand how subtly you get attached to Kobato's innocence and how she feels about things) The art of the manga as well as the series was a visual treat (as is always the case for me when i read any CLAMP manga). Music is very melodious and aptly builds up the atmosphere in each episode. Comical situations in the story are well positioned. What more can i say just go ahead and start watching and you'll know what magic CLAMP stories cast on you :)",

            "content": "Ah Kobato...\r\nIf you look at my anime list, you will notice that Im very picky when it comes to rating. And seldomly do I ever give away a full 10 points. The only anime so far on my list that has gotten a full 10 points is Clannad. I praised it holy and as a milestone in my anime watching career.\r\nAnd now! The time has come to gift a new wonderfull anime 10 points, and oh shall we prais its presence next to Clannad at the top of my ranking.\r\nThis anime... I rated it as a 10 - Masterpiece because if there is one wordid choose to describe it, it would be: Beatiful.\\n\\n\r\nIts perfectly balanced story wise and very enjoyable to watch. The characters are all lovable and unique. Everything about this anime, from the story to the music is just plain beatiful.\\n\r\nOne thing I realy love is the art. A big plus point is the way the faces are drawn, they are somewhat unique and new, but very nice to look at. You will probaly fall in love with this style after the first episode. And Kobato's dresses are also very adorable to look at.\\n\r\nThe story is very flat and easy to follow, alltho this anime will surley make you heart soft and bring forward a couple tears, its overall enjoyment is outstanding. You laugh, you cry, and then you cry again because it makes you so happy. Clannad had thies elements, but compared to Clannad, Kobato is easier to watch and lighter hearted.\\n\\n\r\nNow there is something I want to share with all of you. I am a big fan of Chobits, a former anime also made by Clamp. And when you watch this anime and you are familiar with Chobits, you will notice some things that will realy give you a pleasent supprise content wise. Im going to list thies little easter eggs here because they realy made my heart go \"awww isnt this awsome\".\\n\\n\r\n- The resedent that Kaboto stays at, is the exact same one from chobits, the twin sisters are the Chobit sisters (chi and her sister) and the resedent owner is the wife of the creater of the chobit series, who is also the mother to them.\\n\\n\r\n- The bakery that Kaboto works at every once in a while is named \"Tirol\" and the shop owner and his assistant are the same ones out of Chobits.\\n\\n\r\nI think there was 1 or 2 more but I cant think of them atm. But basicly thies characters out of the Chobits anime are in Kaboto's world in a Human state, basicly like everything should have been. At least thats my impression and gave this anime an extra flavor that I truly loved.\\n\\n\r\nIts hard to put all the emotions and beaty of this anime in to words, im not even going to try very hard because I dont want to screw anything up and leave a odd impression.\\n\\n\r\nSo to all you comedy, drama, romance genre fans out there! Kobato is defently a MUST WATCH anime. And when you watch it, I hope you love it as much as I do. It defently earned thos 10 points.",

            "content": "Let me start with saying this :\r\nI doubt a REVIEW is written when the anime doesn't even have 8 episodes released, but that's what i saw here, and it kinda pissed me off.I'm not denying anyone's opinion , but they should at least be kept AFTER the anime ended ,but since we are almost halfway through , i shall make a small review myself [ must note that the review might/might not change after the anime ended]\r\nStory: Everyone is crying on how there is no plot. I actually see it very well , but the climax hasn't been reached cause even the manga is on-going, but the plot is definitely there. But , if you are expecting an I-didn't-expect-that-to-happen-omg plot , Kobato ain't the thing for you , especially not if you were expecting something groundshaking [ this ain't no death note or stuff like that] It's boundaries remain at a shojo-slice of life-magic anime  ,but I am sure that since CLAMP did it , the story will definitely have some unexpected turns. I trully believe that.So story deserves 9 on my point.\\n\\n\r\nArt : Art is flawless and i doubt anyone would disagree.If anyone should disagree on the beautiful art provided by CLAMP and MADHouse , then i will only say to them : you don't like cute...then why are you even watching this  ? cause it says clearly shojo-magic etc  The art is very cute , beautiful and to top it off good . What has MADHouse on the list surely will be good art.Art gets 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I like the OST . I've been humming 'Magic Number' for weeks now.Maaya Sakamoto pwns.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Cute characters , not flat at all. Kobato is absolute cuteness , Yoryogi absolute funnieness.......Fujimoto , the bishie of the series...doubt any girl has to complain about him , since i will say this : he IS developing as a character and personality nicely , just like Kobato .So gets a 9.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The anime makes you feel all sweet inside .Gives you a nice , friendly ,entertaining feeling.The kind of feeling that makes you wanna say ' I want to see more' . At least , that's how it is for me .I believe the series to be one of the best this year for me.Until now , I have obviously enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nThat is why I say it again : if you are looking for something groundshaking, OMFG-ish and stuff like that.If you hate pink and sweet stuff...don't watch this .In fact , if you are not a shojo-fantasy-CLAMP fan, don't watch it. Do not misunderstand,Kobato isn't mushy , it's just....cotton candy sweet .",

            "content": "Kobato! Ganbarimasu!\r\nKobato. The show that I watched for some comedic relief, only to end up crying like an absolute bitch. It's also one of the few adaptations that I've heard has surpassed its mango form. I don't read mangoes, so I wouldn't know, but that didn't stop me from shedding a shit ton of tears.\r\nThe easiest way to know if you will like this show is to watch the first few episodes and ask yourself this: Do you think Kobato is the most adorable thing ever to exist? If you answered yes, like I did, you will absolutely love this show. If you by someweird reason find her abnormally annoying and a cringe-producing machine, then don't even bother watching!\\n\\n\r\nKobato takes the themes of a low IQ deredere and the meaning of happiness and fucks your feelings with tons of moe and melodrama. Do not take Kobato's bubbly exterior lightly, for this show knows how to conduct the feels train as well as Vino can. You may think that Kobato's cheer is too overwhelming to bear, but this actually gives her emotions a lot of contrast, for when she's sad, you'll be crying alongside her as well.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- KOBATO IS SO CUTE!!\\n\r\n- Isn't just a one character show. The other characters have a lot of personality and even have great backstories!\\n\r\n- Great exploration of its themes, like the impact of heartbreak and how important happiness is in one's life.\\n\r\n- Beautiful art and animation.\\n\r\n- Beautiful OST.\\n\r\n- Incredibly heart touching ending. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- I shall quote part of the synopsis on MAL: \"However, she is not allowed to fall in love with anyone whose heart she heals.\" Is this explored or even mentioned at all in the show? Nah not really.\\n\r\n- Kobato isn't going to be loved by everyone. Some people find her annoying.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nThe everyday adventures of Dobato and her angry as fuck stuffed animal. Their goal is to collect confetti, which they earn by healing the hearts of the broken hearted. Pretty simple premise, with slapstick humor and a lot of melancholy. That's how I would describe the show if I was forced to do it as simply as possible.\\n\\n\r\nBut Kobato is way more than that. Kobato is a perfect example of \"It's all about the journey, not the destination.\" When I think of Kobato's adventure, it really makes me think that her journey is the destination itself. It's a story full of discovery, sadness, heartbreak, but eventually, happiness! Optimism doesn't even begin to describe the overall story of Kobato. Sure, there is a lot of incredibly depressing moments, but really, do you think the bubbly Kobato will be depressed for long?\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Kobato's story isn't anything particularly special or groundbreaking, but it did what it was trying to do masterfully. Whether it be through Kobato's silly antics or the crushing heartbreak that some scenes will cause, Kobato definitely executes it's emotions well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI've always been a fan of chibi deformations during comedic scenes. Shows like Aria the Animation, Full Metal Alchemist, Your Lie in April, and many others do it a lot. Out of all the chibi deformations, Kobato's is definitely my favorite (tied with Alphonse actually), for the reason that her facial expressions are SO ADORABLE! \\n\\n\r\nIt isn't just the comedy aspects that Kobato's art excels in. There are a lot of absolutely serene and beautiful moments, both art and animation wise, which really added on to the either cheery or heart wrenching moods of these scenes. Kobato really knows how to support its story with the art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nKobato's song is a recipe for disaster just waiting to come in at the right time to drink your salty tears. At least, that's what it did for me. The OST of this show is incredible, whether it be the uplifting and catchy tunes of comedic scenes, or the nostalgic and heart crushing melodies of the melodramatic scenes. Just like the art, the music supports the moods of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOh, you want me to cover voice acting? HanaKana master race. Moving on...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nHanaKana master race again. Moving on...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAight, so Kobato! Again, she's a make or break character! If you love her lack of intelligence and adorable attitude, I can almost 100% guarantee you that you will like this show. ALMOST. If you think she's obnoxious, then I can also almost 100% guarantee you that you will hate this show. After all, just like HanaKana is in the anime industry, Kobato is everywhere in this show. She is the show itself! She is the comedy, she is the drama, she is the moe, she is everything!\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, they are surprisingly well developed and fleshed out, considering how much of the spotlight Kobato hogs. Ioryogi is the awesome other half of the Dobato Ioryogi comedy duo, as he is the slapstick wielder (except instead of a slapstick, he's a fire bender!!!!). Fujimoto-kun gives off an extremely douche bag vibe at the beginning, but he redeemed himself as a character TREMENDOUSLY throughout the series many times. He's got a lot of character (although he doesn't show it) and he's basically a tsuntsun. He gets a lot of development and has a great backstory as well. \\n\\n\r\nEven the most minor of side characters get a lot of love! Hell, even the main cast of Tsubasa Chronicles helps push the story along!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAt first I laughed my ass off. Then, I was absolutely in love with Kobato's moe. Then, I was crying so much that I could stack a Tear of the Goddess in one spell cast. Btw, thumbs up if you get that reference. It means you probably need to go outside.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nOverall, this show is an absolute blast. Again, it's a hit or miss series, and Kobato is the one shooting. If she hits you, prepare a box tissues, for you'll need them whenever you start crying or start doing some other unmentionable things IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN!!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Please HanaKana, have ma babies. \\n",

            "content": "Cardcaptor Sakura, even when I didn't know back then, was the first touch I had with CLAMP. After being somehow disappointed by Chobits, I decided to start Kobato. Here's my review of this anime that will warm you heart. \r\nStory : 9/10 \r\nThe story of Kobato is pretty simple. We don't know much at first, but it seems that Kobato has to heal broken hearts to realize her wish. Broken hearts, as we and Kobato understand, can be hard to understand and especially to heal. The first 5-6 episodes are completely devoted to this understanding of how the 'konpeito' works. I will tell more aboutthe story on the characters review. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was my biggest fear, as what really turned me off on Chobits was the art, which didn't please me. Kobato was a complete opposite. Characters are overly cute, of course, so you should be aware of that. Hair that almost touches the ground, clothes that are almost surreal, Kobato can't really be considered as a normal japanese girl, but that's because she is not. The art is really, really good and the scenery is amazing. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice of Kobato is really, really nice. She has this kind of way to sing that really warms you up. However, she only sings one song in the entire anime, which is a bit disappointing. The song is really cute, really well written and representative of the anime. Overall, you can't really say that the sound was bad on Kobato, it was just non-diversified. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the good part comes. For the first 5-6 episodes, you might be disappointed and think that this is what the entire anime will be : an episodical anime following the type of Natsume Yuujinchu or even Jigoku Shoujo, where the main character pretty much stays the same all over the anime. However, when Kobato reaches to her kindergarten school, all of this goes away. The character development is amazing. Kobato really grows and learns and it's so nice to see her understand, to feel her joy and sadness, to watch her realize how much this world has to offer. She really is an amazing character and in her own way she also changes everyone she meets. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm having goosebumps as I'm typing this review. Kobato really touched me and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a really soft anime, but well written and really, really full of surprises. The ending of the anime will not disappoint you, that I can assure. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nKobato is the second anime to deserve a 10 from my part. This anime was pure gold. I learned to love Kobato and her naivety, but also wanted to protect her and see her understand the world she lived in, and she did. It was such a joy to see her grow so much and to watch her heal people, live and laugh, to see her change the people she met and to see them slowly starting to love her, to miss her. You can't skip Kobato, because it really is worth it.",

I absolutely love this concept because i always wished for that to happen to me or the people i care about.\r\nSo with that being said why didn't i rate this higher? well let's begin\r\nKobato is a show with not that many flaws to be honest but at the same time i never felt that it reached it's full potential and the reason i feel this way is because for a show about a higher being helping peoplemost problems that the characters had where not that serious with the exception of Fujimoto's and the writer's backstory \\n\r\n(Also the kindergarten arc was good as well)\\n\\n\r\nSo in my opinion the main story while predictable was not bad at all but it got sidetracked by the not so interesting side character's problems (For example one episode is two girls not talking to each other due to a misunderstanding and that's pretty much it)\\n\\n\r\nAnother critism i have for the story is the crossovers with other anime . Episodes 12 , 17 and 20 especially offered nothing to the main story and they could have been left out entirely . I understand Ioryogi and Kohaku because they where important to the plot but everything and everybody else was not needed in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that everything else was pretty good! The animation was so nice that i almost gave it a 7 , the soundtrack was decent , the humour was funny and i really liked the voice actors\\n\\n\r\nFlaws aside i think Kobato is worth a watch when you find the time or you finish other anime that personally interest you\\n\\n\r\n6/10 = Fair \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading i hope that my review helped you in your decision , cheers :)",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying my eyes are still wet from watching the last episode.\r\nThe thing that primarily caught my attention with this anime was the art. Not going to lie. I was searching up new anime's to watch, and I was taken in by the art style, so I read the short synopsis and gave it a shot. Not that the art is anything completely over the top amazing, I just fairly enjoyed it. The character design i thought was very nice, and same with the settings. \r\nI honestly fell in love with almost every single one of these  characters. They allhave something going for them that makes you just want to love them forever. Everyone has their own flaw, but I completely bypassed anything negative with these characters and just fell in love with everything else. And the negative just made me empathize. Great, great, great, great character developement. \\n\\n\r\nI found the story to be that of a nice tale. In some points of the anime, I began to get annoyed at the subplots with secondary characters you never really care about in the first place, but that did not effect the overall enjoyment of Kobato. It has twists and turns throughout the series, and it's rare, but I really couldn't predict the ending for Kobato. An whatever I did predict was semi-wrong. Or completely. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave this anime an eight, because only my favorite anime's ever get 9's, and I haven't issued a 10 as of yet. This is close to being a favorite, trust me, I would say at least 8.5, not just a solid 8.  \\n\\n\r\nGoing into watching this anime, I didn't hear a single thing about it from anyone, so I was taking a chance. Usually I rely on other peoples judgement to help shape my own path, but this time I decided to go out on the limb and try something completely different. I was a little skeptical of Kobato's worth, even though it's rated roughly around an 8.12, but I was pleasently surprised. If you want a good heart warming anime, I suggest you give this one a try because it was one for the record books ;D",

I expected some regular girl just trying to fulfill something, and a happy ending. \r\nStory: 10 out of 10\r\nI love the story, it had a good slowness going with it. Yes, CLAMP usuals was going along with this, but had some twists that you might not expect. This anime brought me to tears at time but it always end up **** [not telling ;)]\r\nArt: 9 out of 10\r\nThe art was nice~ Very Cute! I sure you will love the chibis. And if your a fan of CLAMP's work then ya ithink you should watch this. But one thing that i didn't really like was how they mande the eyes. it's not sparkly but that's just me xD\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10 out of 10\\n\r\nYou have to watch it to find out xD i don't want to spoil anything\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is great.

Because i thought it was going to be one of those overly cheesy,kinda funny, not very interesting type of story. But i have to say the plot of the story really surprised me.\r\n   The story line was creative and the show to me was very funny. Even the romantic moments in the show were very cute and easy to relate to. \r\n   I thought that the characters were very well done. In this anime itis very easy to Fall in love with the characters, epically Kobato the main character. \\n\\n\r\n  Honestly i wish that the anime was longer. The reason I  liked this anime so much was mostly because of the plot. The plot was definitely different from other animes i have watched and trust me i have watched a LOT of anime, and it's hard these days to find an anime that's somewhat different. Some animes are predictable and somewhat cheesy in a lot of ways but not this one.\\n\\n\r\n  The art was good i think. Not the best i have seen but not the worst either. \\n\\n\r\n  So overall it's definitely one worth to watch. And once you do you get sucked in in till you have watched the entire series.\\n",

Passion is a more than suitable word for describing what is seen in the series Kobato. This series is laudable for its characters integrity and the continuous appeal of the story, marked with a great overall enjoyment.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The development of the many individual characters are outstanding along with the relationships that are shared among all of them. Even the supporting characters are connected to the main story in a magnificent manner. The many complex relationships that were developing were done in a way as suchthe audience could relate or reflect back upon moments and bring any emotion out, where the emotions can be played with by the writers and be more critically effective towards feeling like the audience is alongside the characters. This is also due to the effects of the wonderful music that fit perfectly with the seen and emotion that was present. The joyous music during the happiest of times along with the soothing and somber sounds during crestfallen times leading to the magical expression of emotion and showing the true passion of this series.\u00a0\\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 This series is representative of an art. The colors are magnificent; for instance, Kobato's apparel and expressions are gorgeous. The use of the strong color red does not overpower, yet instead gives strength to all the other colors of the spectrum. Along with all the characters, the scenery is equally astounding in the quality and scrupulosity. Along side the art, the story line is just as detailed and stunning in quality. The story is brilliant in its ability to stay specific to the overarching theme yet be so detailed that any tangent can be connected to the theme and become important for other events in both the past and future. This entire piece is a masterful work that is artistic in writing and imagery where all the details become individually important and equally as enjoyable.\u00a0\\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Whether being the details of a house or the relationship between two characters, each piece is reliant upon every other aspect, and together, they create a single, spectacular, and unifying piece that is molded into this series. With each part playing its role to perfection and creating harmony, the sense of passion and desire that is within the heart of this series makes it a formidably enjoyable show for those who like anime of daily life, romance, cute characters, and emotional fluctuation.\u00a0A full sense of passion.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, I have given this a masterpiece rating:\\n\r\n10\u2606's for all the outstanding features.\u00a0",

            "content": "Kobato\r\nRated: 9/10\r\nKobato was a series that I had really actually planned to pick up way back in autumn when it was released but decided against it. Although it was CLAMP, who's series I normally love, I had my doubts about Kobato because the storyline sounded so silly. However, I managed to finish it by marathoning the episodes, mostly because it was so sweet and had such a nice plot going for it, supported by loveable characters.\r\nKobato revolves around a character named Kobato who has to fill a jar with the \"candy\" that comes from curing scarred hearts. If she manages this, then she will haveone wish fufilled. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nKobato is the regular \"incredibly cheerful, bubbly\" shoujo main character that we've all seen a hundred times and yet there is something about her that manages to keep her from crossing the thin line leading to annoyance. In my experience, I genuinely found her very charming and I wanted her to succeed in her mission. Ioryogi quickly became probably my favorite character in the series, the general mean tempered guardian who really does care about Kobato deep down. Fujimoto was a little more difficult since it seemed like he remained with a constant scowl for 80% of the series but once again, there is a charm he has that prevents him from crossing into the realm of annoying.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 8/10\\n\r\nAlthough it sounds pretty silly, the light-hearted comedy/semi-drama storyline does work, and the way it leads up to the finale is rather well done. The conclusion is satisfying and although it really isn't all the mysterious, it still isn't something that your going to groan over.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 8/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the classic CLAMP and for the most part, the animation was pretty well done with attractive backgrounds and nice colors.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the opening and the two endings this series had, and the background music was, for the most part, doing what it was supposed to be doing by enhancing the scenes emotion. The voice actors did well in their roles as well, especially the voices of Kobato and Ioryogi.",

            "content": "For as long as I've heard of Kobato, I had always wanted to watch/read it. I have been on and off with the manga and still haven't finished it. I've recently finished the anime and basically, it's another work of CLAMP.\r\nCLAMP is a great shoujo group with famous works like Card Captor Sakura, xxxHolic, Wish etc. It's a group of women who make cute stories and handsome male characters for girls to read and look at. Because all the stories are made by the same group, they have this privilege of incorporating older stories into their newer ones, eg. Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles. Kobato does thistoo with Chobits and Wish incorporated into the anime/manga. There are also references to other anime. I think that this incorporation really made Kobato fun for me. I was soo excited whenever I saw Kohaku as I love her character soo much.\\n\\n\r\nANYWAYS. The story was quite interesting, just only in the last 3 episodes. It's a slow paced anime and does not rush through the story at all. Each episode is a new day of what silly/helpful things Kobato will do. It's similar to TRC how each episode is a story in itself that doesn't really continue with the actually plot. You move through Kobato's day to day life with the same ongoing jokes. I personally did not find it very entertaining. I skipped about 3-4 episodes because I didn't want to know what Kobato was doing. I wanted to know why the things were the way they were and how it would turn out. I believe there was one episode which particularly touched me, episode 17 I think. You could probably watch episode one then skip all the way to about 19-21 without missing a lot. For me, it was boring, but then again, I prefer fast paced anime.\\n\\n\r\nBesides, the slow paced middleness, the ending really did touch me. I will admit to crying at the end and maybe in episode 17. Where CLAMP really tried, all the feels did come through. Being a made by girls, made for girls thing, they really do know how to bring out the tears. The ending was well done and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters. You see quite a few recurring characters from other CLAMP works which made me really happy. The main character is your typical dumb klutz who everyone hates. I hated her character so much. It was so typical, like CLAMP didn't even bother trying to bring out an original character. I didn't feel that there was a lot of character development. Each episode was basically Kobato trying to awkwardly help someone out with Ioryogi and/or Kiyokazu yelling at her with Chitose and/or Sayaka being supportive of her really clueless actions. You do see some character development towards the end of the series but I don't feel it was really justified.\\n\\n\r\nCLAMP's artwork is generally incredibly beautiful. As I said before, CLAMP knows what girls want. The designs are typical designs with the scarily lanky and tall characters but they are still sooo pleasing to the eye. I just love the character designs. I've always loved CLAMP art. I was a bit disappointed with the lack of dresses Kobato wore. There were only about four? One for each season I think. I was really looking forward to new dresses because Kobato is just soo cute and it perfect to play around with dresses. The manga art is even more beautiful with such detail. I know you do get to see it in the last ED (I'm not sure if there's more than one) and I couldn't take my eyes off of it.\\n\\n\r\nSound, I'm never really too sure on sound. Nothing stood out to me though. None of the OPs/EDs, no really fitting BGM or anything. I'd just say average.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I could've spent my time better but as a CLAMP fan, I would've regret not watching Kobato. I'm not saying that it's bad, just shoujo isn't my genre anymore. It's a kind of typical shoujo with the sweet bits of fantasy that CLAMP does so well. Nothing really happens but when it does, it really hits home. I would say if you like shoujo, you would like this anime. For those who don't like this anime, stay away from it. It will most likely be a waste of your time. With those who want to watch it but aren't a fan of shoujo, you are very welcome to skip episodes. Like I said, the only real important bits are at the very start where everything is introduced and the end where the feels are. If you already know the premise, you could pretty much just skip to the end coz nothing happens. A few background info is given in around episode 7 (not sure at all) so watch out for those. They can make the ending make a bit more sense, though not all of it is clearly explained. Some things were still left unanswered. Kobato is a good shoujo, but nothing much else. That's really all there it :)",

It was so heartwarming and cute, you didn\u2019t want to stop watching. Kobato had a tear-jerker side imbedded into it, just like a jewel on a ring, making the piece even more beautiful. CLAMP did a wonderful job constructing this masterpiece, taking a semi-generic idea and keepingit fresh and out of the box. The character's personalities made this story worthwhile, along with the breath taking art. Kobato inched its way into my heart, forgive me if I'm being too biased, making its mark on my top 10. The story has laughter that will keep you smiling and sadness that will wet your eyes, so grab a few tissues. Most of all Kobato's relationships and bonds made the anime come together, in friendship and in love. \\n\\n\r\nAs all animes stand, there is always room for improvement, yet I feel that Kobato was excellent exactly the way it is.",

            "content": "Kobato. is another anime put out by CLAMP. Take that as you will, but if you are a CLAMP fan I think you can find something to love here.\r\nStory: Kobato. is a slice of life at heart, and while there is an overarching storyline lurking in the background it doesn't get too much of the spotlight until the final episodes. As such, most of the episodes are about the daily life of the titular character, Kobato. I found the stand alone stories in each episode enjoyable enough. Once the main plot picks up, things get even better.\r\nArt: The art of Kobato. is colorful and bright.The art directors did a nice job with this one. If you like your anime dark and gritty looking, then you will most likely hate the artwork on display here. Also, CLAMP. And all that the name comes with. You most likely already know if you like their art direction or not.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Both the OP and the ED are very mellow sounding, which fits with the mostly mellow feel of the anime itself. The \"theme\" song that Kobato sings is pleasant, if not sung a few too many times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Oh man, these characters. There are occasionally those anime where you really get attached to the characters, and really feel for them in a way that not many anime can emulate. This was one of those anime for me. The development is rather good, especially for Kobato. The supporting characters and other leads all developed well enough by the end that I cared about each of them. Of course there are some character stereotypes present as is the case with most anime (clumsy girl, mysterious man with a tragic past, etc.) but that doesn't stop them from growing into their own and being a joy when on screen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: For me at least, this wasn't the type of anime I could marathon. Most of the series is mellow, slice-of-life fare. It's something to watch when you just want to sit back and relax, without having to think too hard.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Kobato. is a great anime for slice-of-life fans, but other types of viewers might like it too. I'd say anyone who likes good laughs that don't revolve around ecchi, light drama fans, moe fans, and possibly shoujo fans, will enjoy Kobato. the most. And of course, CLAMP fans. However, if you aren't a CLAMP fan, this anime probably won't be winning you over, so move along.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. CLAMP fans you won't be disappointed, there's a cameo like usual!",

            "content": "This Anime is extremely well done, I began watching this when it first came out and I've followed it ever since. I have been a huge fan of CLAMP's work and this Anime is no exception. Sure the plot can be slow but each episode is done real well and it always brings me joy to watch the next episode. Its one of those relaxing series, that does not have many cliffhanger moments like Bleach or One Piece. I like having these kind of Anime's in my life. If I were to compare Kobato to another Anime i would say fruits basket. It has thesame pacing and just the overall feel to it is the same. except...Kobato is not a reverse harem.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the whole thing weekly I have grown to really love this series. It had many happy, sad and just fun moments. The last three episodes of the series really made this show for me. It was really deep and revealing. Though, I did not expect the series to be wrapped up. Since the Manga is not finished, I really thought that they were gonna leave it and maybe it will get a second season in the future. Other than that I was really satisfied with the way they wrapped up the series. I will probably end up re-watching the series in the future.\\n\\n\r\nSome memorable episodes were:\\n\r\n5 Firefly Promise\\n\r\n9 Memories of Summer\\n\r\n13 The Angel and the Protected Person\\n\r\n16 and 17 Mysterious Life-form\\n\r\nAnd Lastly 20 \u2013 24 Travelers, Spring's Footsteps, The Day of Goodbye, Kobato's Wish and The Day To Come Tomorrow. \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note I loved how on episodes 17, Watanuki (from xxxholic) made a appearance and on episode 20 when Syaoran, Kurogane and Fai made a appearance. It was very cool to see characters from Tsubasa and Holic again!\\n\\n\r\nIoryugi (dont know if i spelled it right) is my favorite character he is so funny how he just yells at kobato. He has the same voice actor as Kurogane from Tsubasa. I also love Kobato she is incredibly cute and so dense that its hilarious. During the series I grew to like Fujimoto, his character improved a lot near the end of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening \u201cMagic Number\u201d is one of my favorite openings. I obsessed over the single when it came out and I still do now! Maaya Sakamoto is just amazing!\\n\\n\r\nIf you know me I rarely give an Anime a bad rating. I can never give clamp a bad review too. I recommend this series to those who like kids, there a whole lot of story involving small children and to those who need a relaxing show to watch. Its a good show to watch while waiting for releases of One Piece, Bleach and any other Anime. You will really enjoy it! Those who like epic Anime and stuff may not like this because of the overall feel but it's nice to have a show like this one every once in a while!",

            "content": "To put it simply, Kobato is a beautiful and endearing anime recommended for all ages. This anime contains sweet characters with  laid back but meaningful episodes. Everything flows together in this anime. There are no fillers so every episode is used wisely.\r\nThe audience that would enjoy this the most are those who like fantasy with a slight touch of romance to the plot. This story also values other relationships as well like friendship.\r\nWhat I like most about this anime is that it answers the main question/s with an delightful ending especially for the romantic softies, warm characters and beautiful color scheme.\r\nStory: I would givea 10/10 but I'm in love with the anime so I might be biased,lol. So critically I would give it an 8. It can be a lil too slow paced for some. There isn't any action, it's light on the comedy and it's more slice of life feel to it than adventure even though Kobato journey is an adventure it's own right it's a humble one.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I would give 10/10. The artwork fit the storyline and characters very well. The color scheme was warm and joyful, like main character Kobato and the story. The backgrounds were nice, nice details of the eyes (two tone eyes and white freckles). The artwork also had great sun beam (that's hard to describe but when you see the detail it's awesome). They had 3/D effects sneaked in there and that was excellent as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I would give an 8/10. I wasn't too hot on the music but it was nice not something I would want to buy though. There were no annoying voices! Yay!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I would give 7/10. I give it a 7/10 because I would have like to known more about the twins and their mother relationship with their father if he existed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 I enjoyed this anime very much. I especially enjoyed Kobato's singing. That's what suckers you into the anime is the first song. I was really looked forward to more singing than what happened but I still enjoyed the anime regardless. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 If you can handle stories more about friendship than action this is anime for you. I would definitely rewatch this. I would recommend this anime to someone who like romance and stories about friendship more than any other genre it could be categorized as.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for any grammatical and/or spelling errors I didn't catch.",

The story had its ups and downs first few episodes had me rolling and i really enjoyed them, then somewhere through the middle it got a little repetitive and somewhat old. Dont get me wrong it was still good but the ending is what made this very good. nice ending to an overall nice anime it really made the middle episodes worth it.\r\nArt 10\r\nIm sure you have read other reviews onthis and im not the biggest art guy but kobato's Art was Fantastic. i would feel bad not giving this section a 10, it was just beautiful to look at and i would say alot of people will watch this just to see the Art.\\n\\n\r\nsound 9\\n\\n\r\nthe music was nice it really fit the mood great, the OP and ED were nice as well as the song Kobato sings along with fujimoto playing the piano/organ. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8\\n\\n\r\nKobato was lovely in fact my new crush and iroyogi was a great comedy relief that kept the pass going and made this anime. fujimoto was ok nothing special but he does shine brightly in the last 3 episodes. I just absolutely feel in love with Kobato, if i could i would out here in anything and the same goes for the Plushie haha. If you substituted those two with any other type of character this would be horrible.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8\\n\\n\r\nIt really made feel good after watching this, the only reason it isnt higher is due to the middle it was average, and the reason its this high is because the ending if you watch you will understand as well as the character that made this.\\n\\n\r\noverall 8\\n\\n\r\njust a re telling of the above statements, it really was good it was original, the characters were nice and the art and sound were out of this world.",

            "content": "I give this sweet little anime a 90/100\r\nI'm going to confess this: 2009 was NOT my best year, nor was it my favorite. Not because of anime (admittedly for me, 2009 was a pretty awesome anime year for me), but because of a lot of crap going on in my life. Whenever I feel down or just want to relax and take my mind off of things after a rough school day, I just sit down and watch my favorite anime, or just the ones that really make you feel good and feel all warm and fuzzy inside. And lately there's been a boom inwarm, good-hearted and pleasant anime in recent years thanks to Junichi Sato and the team behind the anime for Kozue Amano's manga, Aria. But the anime I'm reviewing isn't a Sato anime. It's a CLAMP title, and it's none other than Kobato!\\n\\n\r\nKobato is the story of a sweet and kind-hearted girl named Kobato Hanato who, with her abusive and ribald-natured stuffed canine companion Ioryogi (whose real name is Iorogi but she calls him the former because she can't say his name right), travels to earth in order to fulfill a mission which requires her to heal people's injured hearts and put those healed feelings into a little glass bottle (with a dove at the top! Cute!). Why? Because Kobato wants to go to a certain place, and to get there she has to completely fill the bottle with healed hearts within a year (in the anime at least). Simple enough, right?\\n\\n\r\nIt's actually not as simple as you think. This show may start off rather off-beat and a little cliche and bland at first, but as the series gets further to the end, it really shines and reveals itself to be something more. I often go by the philosophy that simplicity often shines better than extravagance, from simple stories to simple animation and anything in between. Kobato is the perfect example of this. It's story is simple enough and easy to either understand or get bored by. But oh lord the second half the show is what really makes it stand out like no other. I refuse to go into GREAT detail as to why, but I will say this: it focuses solely on its characters and by not forgetting what it wants to be.\\n\\n\r\nPlus I kept smiling throughout every episode, not just because of how good it is, but because of one thing: Kobato herself. She may start off as a bit airheaded and somewhat childish (how old is she? 15? 18? She acts more childish than I do! And I'm autistic!), but the series really develops her character and does a great job at having her grow and mature throughout the show. Especially at the end (WHICH I WILL NOT TELL YOU ABOUT! Go watch the show to see my point!) where everything falls into place. Ioryogi the abusive fire-breathing toy pup was fun to watch too, even if I didn't exactly like his abusive behavior toward Kobato at times. The other characters, even the minor ones, are just as awesome too.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is nice and simple and sweet, ranging from little piano tunes to full melancholic violin pieces. It fits the show too. What bothers me is that I've often heard people say that this show has a rather low budget because of Madhouse (YES, Madhouse produced this anime, as they did with a million other CLAMP anime out there) being too busy on other shows. I don't think this is true. I think Kobato has great animation. To me, an anime with a low budget is an anime with badly drawn backgrounds, people with weirdly drawn bodies, body parts that just look out of place, and other stuff that just doesn't look right. Kobato has absolutely NONE of that. I actually think it has very nice animation, especially with the backgrounds (especially with scenes with flowers too. Very beautiful!).\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show does have some flaws, they're relatively small so I won't point them out. In short, Kobato is a very simple, charming, nice, and pleasant little anime that gives you a nice, warm, welcoming hug and pulls you into Kobato's adorable mindset while showing you her perspective of the world. If you're looking for something nice and sweet to drag you away from the bombastic heaps of mecha, harem, and ecchi anime that are consuming the anime industry right now, Kobato is the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on a side note, this anime got licensed by Sentai Filmworks. I'm so happy!",

At first, we know next to nothing about Kobato which prompts you to watch more. In the beginning of the anime, the theme is light-hearted and a bit of comedy (I know I laughed a lot just in the first episode). But near the bottom half of the anime, the plot develops more.\r\n And in the last episode, I cried :) This was an anime I really enjoyed watching not only forit's art; but also the story, characters, and plot.",

In the first half of the narrative it shows her day-to-day struggles to achieve her goal of 'healing broken hearts' which seems to be the point of her quest. As the narrative moves toward the second half, character motivations and developments become more noteworthy as the sweetheart protagonist Kobato realizes her motivation shifting with her heart. As she begins to take a newfound romantic interest in Fujimoto, the male lead opposite her throughout theseries run. But a deal is a deal and this comes home to roost in the final string of episodes with a massive emotional roller-coaster which really pulls your heartstrings on a headlong ride through a mix of despair and joy.",

            "content": "Overall: 7,5\r\n\"Drama-romance\" is my favorite anime genre, but while this anime has those tags it turns out that it didn't really meet my expectations. First the drama is pretty light and mostly it's about the side characters. Second there aren't even a lot of romance between the main characters except in the last few episodes. In reality it's closer to slice of life comedy with drama and romance as subplot.\r\nWhat I liked about this anime is the cuteness of Kobato (she's really damn cute!) and the beautiful song she sing. Some scenes were also pretty funny. While the plot is predictabe it's not bad butit didn't have a lot element of surprise. Also I wonder why they didn't tag this as \"shoujo\". I keep watching this to the last episode because of it's premise but the ending part isn't as sad as I expected (It's even pretty cliched).\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing this anime I read a few chapters of the manga and it has several part (like the full story of Ioryogi-san and the war) that's more important to the story and the anime should've adapted it rather than showing the not so interesting side character's problems.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really recommended it if you're looking for an emotional rollercoaster with a lot of \"feels\", but if you're looking for a fun shoujo anime with a little bit of drama and romance then this might be what you're looking for.",

            "content": "KOBATO ANIME REVIEW\r\nWARNING: SPOILER ALERT\r\nOVERALL: 7.8\r\nPLOT: 7/10\r\nI'm just searching for a good anime and I don't really remember how I've come up to this anime. Maybe I've search for magical that time? Or maybe a tragic one? I've donwloaded it and honestly, it stays on my laptop for about 3-4 months, I guess. The first time I've saw Kobato which is the protagonist of the story. I kinda remembered Sakura. The plot is good. It consists of how a human heart feel and act accordingly. Well, since the story revolves around a girl who's mission is to collect a human's emotion through healing, it willcertainly tackle on different aspects of life. How a human can be hurt sometimes, how it come to love a person, how human heart is so fragile and vulnerable to pain. For me, it is not your typical anime which you can sit on one watching. It is too gentle and pure and soft. There are times I get bored watching it, most of that time is on the first part of the series since it is slightly episodic. And it's just that the series is too kindhearted you would want to savor the episodes. I also find it fun and enjoying to watch since the series showed other side characters from different anime. The parallel worlds they've been in and you will be like, \"Woah. That's her from that anime.\" It gets exciting as the series goes deeper. It's a great anime. Though the ending might be slightly predictable, still the weigh of it did not decrease the impact once you've watch the real deal. So it's a good series for me. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist \"Kobato\", though she is clumsy and kind of idiot. Maybe your typical kind of anime girl. The one who can't cook. The one who can't do things right. The one who often make you involved in things you don't want to get involved at. She is also very kind, very caring, very innocent. She's too good to be true. Maybe she's 1 out of 100 person? 1000 person? If this is real life. But I think, neither Kobato and the other characters on this series, eventhough they get their heart healed, is the one the anime really focuses on. It's the guy in glasses and Iorogi. For me, the series actually focuses on how to heal that two hearts. And they've successfully showed it. There are no such great development on Kobato's character, but there is a big difference in  the guy in glasses and Iorogi. She healed their heart, fully.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND AND ANIMATION: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe songs of this anime is cool. It has a sweet melody. A jolly one. And also a heartwarming one. The voices of the actor are fine. The best voice for me is Iorogi, where he beg for Kobato's life. Though, the animation is not that great, it is good. Some character would be lacking of emotions or expressing their feeling due to the animation, but the main characters was already detailed. Maybe because they are the main characters. But all in all, the voices of the actor rightfully connects with the animation and faces of the characters in the series. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy the series. Maybe the last 7-10 episodes? The first part is episodic. Just like Sakura when she is collecting cards, if you know what I mean. But instead of cards, it is a healed hearts. Well, none of that matters. It is collecting, period. So what is the story when collecting something in a series, of course it will revolve in too many peope. A different one. So it's just like a prologue of the story. That the story will start once the protagonists encounter that certain difficulty. It is a good anime, I have no doubt about that. The episodic part, I think, is shown to make us think and understand the characters truly. Thus, I really did enjoy that last part of this one. Where the secrets are revealed. Well, I think it's common to like the climax of the story. \\n\\n\r\nENDING: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nIt will be fake to say that the ending is a great one. Yes, it is good. But I don't think it is great. \\n\r\nIt's predictable, yes. But that is what we are waiting for, isn't it?  That moment that we know is gonna happen. That expectation we set on every anime or love story series we are watching. Common it maybe, that is what our hearts feel. And that is what excites us. So for me, the ending is acceptable. Though I will be needing more. I need to know more about this series. It keeps me hanging with regards to Iorogi. Maybe this will be discuss in another anime?  Maybe not? It leaves a loophole or an idea that there is more. The dimensions they are talking about. The fight between them. Maybe it's unavoidable, because Kobato is just a human, and there's no valid reason for them to enter that one.",

Since it's written in the summary, I will not write it. I will give it 8/10.\r\nArt:\r\nThe art is good. Perfect for the show. I will give it 7/10.\r\nSound:\r\nThe sound is charming, with perfect soundtracks in the perfect moments. The song Kobato sings is very relaxing(for me) which just adds up the charm of the show.

Not to mention the first review I wrote was also one of CLAMP's work, Tsubasa Chronicle. CLAMP is just amazing. Slow paced, but then suddenly twist and turns and feels right in your face. \\n\r\nKobato will be a feels train in the final episodes, be mentally ready (altho that won't help, you'll cry anyways) but, you are warned.

Need second season? No! its completely end!\r\nListed as Fall season anime 2009 at Oct 6, 2009 to Mar 23, 2010 with 24 episodes adopted from CLAMP original story, Kobato. Producers: Madhouse Studios, NHK, NHK-BS2\r\nKobato is a sweet and perky girl, but also extremely naive about the world around her. She has a \"mission\", which is to fill a mysterious bottle of hers with the suffering from people's hearts so her wish to goa certain place that she desires to go can be granted. However, she must not fall in love with a particular boy she works with and whose heart she must heal.\\n\\n\r\nSource : MAL\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8.75/10\\n\\n\r\nI fell in love with Kobato. Her brown eyes browny hair, long wavery hair style even sometime its not shown how it supposed to be, then her stylish and cute clothes. It shown what\u2019s CLAMP even it only Kobato.\\n\\n\r\nSome other honorable mention for the art :\\n\\n\r\n-The childrens. Like Kobato, they are kawaii \\n\\n\r\n-Effects. Such as magical effects. The first is when Kobato got her konpeito. Then the most epic is the snow effects when she sing to Fujimoto.\\n\\n\r\n-Backgrounds. They do it detailed. I like the most is when Kobato sang for the Ginkgo tree, it is really wonderfull and browny! It makes me fell in love with the beautiful of Ginkgo Biloba :\u2019)\\n\\n\r\nEdited from 8 to 8.75\\n\\n\r\nStory :\\n\\n\r\n9.2/10\\n\\n\r\nCant make it higher, sorry. Kinda slacking of when Kobato stops healing people, it made me bored to watch. It even cross to my mind to drop it. Luckily I am waiting and holding on to watch it until the ends. My sister really love this series so it is because of her also, thank you sis. :*\\n\\n\r\nKobato efforts for reaching her dream, that\u2019s the main reason I into this anime. So when she stops her effort makes me disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nIt have a happy ending though. Of course it should be happy ending! But creating a love scene before it ending, it is just like CLAMP! And it do makes it EPIC. Some other why you call it EPIC story line :\\n\\n\r\n- The truth about Kobato as a dead person and wish to loop the time for the person she love.\\n\\n\r\n- The truth aout Ioryogi as a heaven being and there to help Kobato.\\n\\n\r\n- Then the problem for other characters who then healed by Kobato. It is the way how people have a problem in their live.\\n\\n\r\nMorale Values :\\n\\n\r\n- Don\u2019t give up! I will do my best!\\n\\n\r\n- Don\u2019t be na\u00efve for helping people. Try your best to help them, and don\u2019t afraid if you make them disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n- Manage your time\\n\\n\r\n- Practice makes perfect\\n\\n\r\n- Don\u2019t be ignorance\\n\\n\r\n- Care about each other, respect each other.\\n\\n\r\n- Have problems? Communicate it\\n\\n\r\n- Don\u2019t be selfish, try to understand public interest than your self interest.\\n\\n\r\n- Friends may not last forever, cherish them and treat them nicely.\\n\\n\r\n- Treat plants and animals nicely, they are living creature created by God.\\n\\n\r\n- Believe your self, then you believe others.\\n\\n\r\n- Cherish all of thing that you have currently nicely with gratefull. Maybe you can have it in the after life.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the life reincarnation thing is not included because it\u2019s irrational.\\n\\n\r\nThere are still some more I mean many morale value if you think more. You can see how epic the story is.\\n\\n\r\nEdited from 8.5 to 9.2 :D\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 8.5\\n\\n\r\nEvery character have their own personalities and problems that I have mentioned before at the art. They described nicely. The voice actor also. Not forget to mention the cross over characters. I think it\u2019s a waste space of episode, but maybe you think it oppositely. Well, its CLAMP after all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening song by Maaya Sakamoto, \u201cMagic Number\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAs CLAMP usually do, they invited Maaya Sakamoto, to have her to sing the opening is perfect, the music is really showing what Kobato is.\\n\\n\r\nThe Ending songs:\\n\\n\r\n#01: Jellyfish's Confession (by Megumi Nakajima (eps 1-19) just one word, meaningfull.\\n\r\n#02: Watashi ni Dekiru Koto ( by Megumi Nakajima (eps 20-23) not really care of it. Sorry.\\n\\n\r\nKobato voiced by Hanazawa Kana. Also the reason why I watch this series. Her voice is cute and beautiful. Match to Kobato characteristic. A bit bored of her character song, \u201cAshita Kuru Hi- Yuki no furu machi\u201d but it do have a really beautiful voice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall rate : 8.8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor a slice of life genre it reach that high rank. Congrats CLAMP for making such epic story, congrats and congrats for Kobato the moe and cute and determined girl for reaching her dream.",

            "content": "Having Just watched the final episode a few minutes ago, my memories of this show are pretty fresh to say the least. \r\nA SHORT SYNOPSIS\r\n\"A young girl named kobato makes a deal in order to get her wish granted (nothing is specified about this wish) its just to be taken somewhere she wants to go. In order to have her wish granted she has one year on earth in which she must fill a small bottle with candy obtained by healing peoples hearts\"\r\nTHE REVIEW\r\n I don't really have very many bad things to say about this anime theres nothing strikingly bad about it. Only afterwatching lots and lots of different shows one tends to tire of seeing the stereotypical moe-dunce falling for the strong silent insensitive idiot over and over again. Along with all of this you have a textbook smart-ass sidekick (in the form of a stuffed animal). \\n\r\n          I remember really liking the first few episodes, especially those centred around yomogi nursery, though the concept of collecting \"candy\" in a bottle in order to do something is really just another way of saying \"bwahaha I've thought of a brilliant plot device to make this show episodic\". One soon gets sick of watching kobato collect candy by healing peoples hearts. Luckily though (and in my opinion this shows saving grace) the second half of the show isn't quite so episodic, the story is built upon and moves forward nicely infact if i was reviewing only the second half i would have given the show a solid 8 - 8.5. A word of warning don't expect to be told what kobatos wish is any time soon since thats kept from the viewers till the very end. Afte reading the synopsis if the idea appeals to you go ahead and watch this show. Another attraction has definitely got to be the numerous appearances of other CLAMP characters in the shows second half. A few weeks back I remember getting to see Watanuki again not to mention mokuna XD. That about wraps it up, chop chop.\\n\\n\r\nHave fun watching \\n\r\nCYA!",

            "content": "I don't think I've ever cried more than twice during an anime series, but I broke the record for this one. Kobato is one of those gorgeous stories, with both sweet moments and ridiculously sad moments, which just makes you go through a roller coaster of emotions throughout the whole anime.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nI must admit, at the beginning I was a little skeptical. As soon as I saw a cute girl with a talking soft toy and a magical flask, I immediately thought this would be a Cardcaptor-Sakura-alike anime (not that I have anything against Cardcaptor Sakura, I just thought this show would have a lotof shoujou-magical-girl type elements to it). But boy was I wrong! Yes the first half of the anime focuses on how Kobato, the heroine of this anime, heals people's souls in order to fill the magical flask and fulfil her wish. But even the way that Kobato acts to heal people is not in a magical way, instead she helped them by talking to them, singing to them and by helping them as a complete human being (so things that even you and me could do!). In fact, it's best that you not think about this anime in terms of magic, I completely forgot that there was magic involved until I heard the stuffed toy talk lol. The story is more about how Kobato finds her place in the human world, and how she understands other people's hearts and minds by living in this world, which, at the beginning, is for the purpose of filling the magical flask. But, as you get into the series, the more characters she helps, the more entwined they become with her own life, and eventually she becomes part of the community of people, living with them and striving to protect the people she loves. She ends up working at a local nursery, where she learns about all the different characters in the nursery and how she can help them out, purely because she cares about them with her own heart. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe main heroine here, Kobato, is absolutely adorable! She reminds me a lot of Tohru in Fruits Basket (which you should also check out if you like this anime!) because she genuinely cares about other people and because she always seems to say the right things at the right time to make you feel better. It's hard not to love Kobato; even though she is a little bit of an airhead, she really makes this anime very sweet and light-hearted, and the way she helps someone just makes you feel warm and fuzzy on the inside (even though the person being helped isn't you lol).\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the stuffed toy dog that she carries around everywhere called Ioryogi, who is somewhat like her guardian, but is completely the opposite of Kobato. He is hot tempered and gets annoyed very easily, and he always seems to be frustrated by Kobato at the beginning. But, like almost everyone else, he warms up to her as the show goes on, and I really like how you get to see him worrying about Kobato and not just himself.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Kobato ends up helping a lot of people along the way, I think the two main people who she forms a connection with are Sayako sensei and Fujimoto. Sayako sensei is the gorgeous lady who runs the nursery, but who struggles with debt problems, and struggles to keep the nursery going. Fujimoto is a law student who spends more time helping the nursery and juggling part-time jobs rather than studying so that he can keep the nursery alive along with Sayako sensei. I think these characters add much more emotional drama to the anime, because behind the happy faces (well, Fujimoto's face isn't as happy, but nevertheless) that they show their little nursery kids, they hide much deeper and darker secrets that prevent them from being truly happy. But, as Kobato discovers, there's more to them than just a desire to keep the nursery going, and we eventually dig back into their past to draw them out and solve the problems wrapped up in those secrets. I particularly loved the (extremely) slow and gradual impact she makes on Fujimoto, because he is the biggest mystery from the first episode all the way till the last episode, I honestly didn't think he would budge at all from his harsh and self-contained attitude!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music in Kobato is very heartwarming, particularly the song that Kobato sings right at the beginning (which she sings again at some points throughout the series and towards the end). It's just soft and beautiful, and it suits the anime very well!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is definitely worth a 10/10, the characters look beautiful! I especially love Kobako, because she has lovely long hair and because she is put in four different outfits for the four different seasons (so you can place the anime in the different seasons). The children in the nursery are also really cute, and overall, the art just makes the anime even more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nWithout giving you any spoilers, I just wanted to say that, towards the end, I realised that I just didn't want to lose Kobato, it makes you want to cry in those last few moments of episode 23 and 24! The story may have been a little simple, but I just loved the life and relationships that Kobato made for herself in the time she was given the magical flask, because towards the end it becomes more about her love for others rather than about the magical flask. It's something that I'm really glad of taking out of this anime, and very applicable to life in general.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something sweet and heartwarming to watch while you sip on some milk with biscuits (makes the anime even more sweeter, trust me!), Kobato is definitely a good choice!\\n",

            "content": "8   Story\r\nWhere do you wish to live if you\u2019re given a chance? Watch Kobato and it might give you an idea. This is a story about a na\u00efve girl named Kobato who came to earth to fulfill her wish, which is to go to a certain place. She has no memory of where did she came from. The only thing she remembers is her name and her mission why she go to Earth. In order to fulfill that wish, she has to find a mysterious bottle called \u201cflask\u201d and fill it with scarred hearts. \r\nKobato is only given one full season to fillthe \u201cflask\u201d. She has to heal that scarred heart and upon healing there is a candy-like thing that will come out to that person she healed. During the story, we can see how Kobato regain her humanity. She learns how to feel, to be hurt and to love. She gains a lot of friends because of her pure heart. Even the reluctant Fujiwara become close to her. This closeness bothers her, for she is new to that feeling. She also remembers something her teacher told her. That she should not fall inlove with any person she cure the heart of. \\n\r\nThere is also the noticeable crossover of Tsubasa Chronicles characters as part of their search for Sakura and other Clamp made Chobits, Xxxholic, and Wish characters but not the same person. \\n\r\nIt shows different kind of love. It shows love for family, love for a friend, love for a lover and love for nature. An anime that will let you appreciate things that we often take for granted. Even with touch of magic it do relate in our society. The conflicts are \u201cearthly familiar\u201d that may happen to anyone.\\n\\n\r\n8   Animation\\n\\n\r\nThe graphics is awesome. You\u2019ll enjoy watching it since it has characters that are typical bishoujo and bishounen that are pleasant to eyes. It is neat and clear. It mostly used light and pastel colors that depict the mood of the entire show.\\n\\n\r\n8.5   Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe background music suits the entire anime series since its relaxing although not as striking as other opening and ending songs. One of the highlight is Kobato\u2019s singing on some episode that heals some of scarred heart of characters.\\n\\n\r\n9   Characters\\n\\n\r\nSince it\u2019s a crossover of other characters from Clamp they are remembered whether they only made some cameo roles. The main character Kobato doesn\u2019t have the strong personality that you\u2019ll remember easily. She is the character that would let you think of the quotation \u201ckill them with kindness\u201d. You\u2019ll also notice that her teacher, Ioryogi, may not be showy but really take care of her student Kobato. It also mentioned that the reason why he join Kobato was because it was is punishment for attempting to start a war with Heaven. He got a fondness for Kobato that we is even willing to sacrifice regaining back his true form for her happiness.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is a typical shoujo with a touch of magic and a slice of life that usually happen on reality. This is suited for young girls and young ladies who don\u2019t want too much action and bloody scenes. \\n\r\nBut because of this touch of magic, it makes some impossible things happen which saves the day. Although at first you\u2019ll notice that it seems to be per episode series that usually ends with Kobato solving the day it do has a main story line and conflict that at first seems to be unnoticeable but arises at the middle of the series. This is one of series that seems ordinary at the start but will get you addicted as you watch. It also gives a satisfying ending that don\u2019t give the feeling like \u201cthis should how they end it! or \u201cwhy it end up like that?\u201d",

She signed a contract, so she has to heal peoples hearts and fill a bottle with \"confetti\". Ioroygi is a stuffed animal that accompanies her throughout the time limit of four seasons ( a year ) he changes during that time.

After fouryears, they meet again.\\n\\n\r\nArt - I loved the art in this anime, especially the different outfits Kobato wore in the 4 seasons. The art was outstanding, it fit every moment of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - I loved loved loved the song Kobato sang, it gives me a warm feeling and calms me down. One of the best soundtracks ever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - From the first episode you might think that Kobato is just a clumsy, and honest girl. But as you watch the anime, you can see the changes in Kobato even though shes still the same person as she was in the first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I really enjoyed this anime, and watched it for the third time already, this anime made me cry and laugh and left an impact on my life. I couldn't stop thinking about it after I finished it. It has no need for a 2nd season because the ending was perfect. A 2nd season would only ruin the anime. I loved this anime, it is one of my favorites. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - I give this anime a 10 overall. Trust me i would give it a 20 if I could!

            "content": "Kobato is a young girl with enigmatic origins who, in order to fulfull her wish, must heal the broken hearts of people. With the company of the stuffed animal Ioryogi she deals with the troubled and after healing their hearts, a bottle she has is filled with... candy?\r\n===STORY===\r\nThe premise \"in order fulfil her wish, Kobato must heal the broken hearts of people\" hints to an episodic series with traces of actual plot unraveling once a while. This is true for the first half of the series, focusing on Kobato walking around town finding people to heal. Filled with (very) lighthearted comedy and fair drama, thisis a good introduction to the series, but I have to recognize that its episodic nature kept me away for a while (I'm not very much of a fan of episodic series), and it was somewhat difficult to me to keep watching these repetitive and predictable episodes. \\n\\n\r\nBut then we have the second half of the series where the unraveling of the plot and the drama take control. There is one point that distinguishes this half from the othe: Kobato's bottle is being filled outside of the show. This leads to a much more obscure facet of the series and the cast, as comedy starts to dissapear and Kobato faces much more serious and dramatic events. This part of the series absorbed me.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the story is very slow in the first half, of course being episodic and all the story just doesn't move on at some point; but it's good in the last half, never losing my interest despite of some filler episodes that are basically CLAMP in Wonderland all over again.\\n\\n\r\n===ART===\\n\\n\r\nEven if character design is very CLAMP-esque (you know, lengthy limbs and pointy joints), it never loses shape. Backgrounds were colorful and animation was ok, nothing really out of the ordinary, well executed nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\n===SOUND===\\n\\n\r\nMusic is a key ingredient to Kobato. Many events revolve around songs, especially Ashita Kuru Hi (aka Kobato's song), which is a beautiful song of great significance to the plot. Background music is noticeable for going over a wide spectrum of feelings, strenghtening the catharsis in the second half of the series. Voice acting on the other hand is well done, even though the voices of Kobato and Ioryogi become somewhat annoying (too shrill? too exaggerated?).\\n\\n\r\n===CHARACTER===\\n\\n\r\nOf course the most developed character would be the title character, Kobato, the clumsy girl who is forced to experience a wide range of emotions due to her mission on Earth. However, as the hearts she heals give her lessons about life itself, her personality is constantly affected. This is true also for the other main characters, Ioryogi and Fujimoto, whose behavior may seem stoic at first, seemingly stereotypical characters, but being put to test afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the nature of the series there is an insight in most of the members of the cast (even unexpected ones) while heart-healing. However, this episodic nature makes most of the background characters fall into oblivion later in the series.\\n\\n\r\n===ENJOYMENT===\\n\\n\r\nAs you may know if you kept reading this review (and if you have, thank you), the first half of the series gave me hard times, but the other half made the series redeem itself.\\n\\n\r\n=========\\n\\n\r\nSo in short:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\n-Slow pacing\\n\r\n-Repetitive and predictable at first\\n\r\n+Good plot development later\\n\r\n+An actual good story\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\n-Nothing out of the ordinary\\n\r\n+Well executed\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\n-Annoying voice acting for Kobato and Ioryogi\\n\r\n+Fitting music for a wide range of feelings\\n\r\n+Plot significance\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\n-Background characters fall into oblivion\\n\r\n+Strong development of the main cast\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\n-First half is very hard to keep up with because of its episodic nature\\n\r\n+Captivating second half\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

I put a 7 becouse I see the story too simple. It is no dificult to understand whats going on. On episodes 22-24 the story became a little interesting: we know more about Kobato and her wish and it has a happy ending to all characteres.\r\nWell... I put an 8 in art. it isnt the grat thing but it isnt horrible. The art is ok. \r\nWell about sound I put a ubecouse for me it was too sweet all songs. The opening was good, bettere comaring of the two endings. The song that sings Kobato is good and the sweetest song of all. I dont like this kind of melodies.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall. In the most part of the series i got bored about the anime: every day Kobato go to Yomogi and do sosmething good. There were sorprises in the anime, but there are other CLMAP series that is better than Kobato: more action, more mystery etc.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like CLAMP series like card captor Sakura you will enjoy this anime, but if you like more series like X, xxxholic or tsubasa chronicle dont watch this",

(Mostly in the last episodes.)\r\nTragically, heartbreaking and affecting, but also mostly wonderful. I also think its an interesting ending somehow. So I had to hold my tears as good as I could. If you like heartfilling stories, so I thinkyou'll like Kobato. \\n\\n\r\nDon't drop this  one until the end,even when you're thinking about it while the beginning episodes, it was worth to watch it. \\n",

            "content": "Here comes Kobato, another heart-warming and brilliant work from CLAMP. I am definitely a huge fan of CLAMP\u2019s works. Some of my favorites are Magic Knight Rayearth, Cardcaptor Sakura, Chobits, Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle, and my most favorite of them all, Xxxholic.\r\nThe thing about CLAMP\u2019s works they always give you a heart-warming feeling from their stories. Like their previous works, Kobato will make you cry in a sense that it\u2019s not a heavy feeling but rather an overwhelming and very touching feeling. It\u2019s not overly dramatic and the drama is just perfect. It is something that any type and any age of viewers will really appreciatewhich is a very common quality of CLAMP\u2019s works. Another thing that I love about CLAMP is their episodic type of stories. It always gives you an excitement that comes from every chapter or episode. But what I love the most about CLAMP is that they always love making crossovers. Just like Sakura, Tsubasa, and Xxxholic, in this series there are lots of crossovers from the other series like Chobits, Wish, Xxxholic, and Tsubasa. But unlike Tsubasa and Xxxholic where the characters are just a looked-like, in Kobato the characters themselves from their series are the ones who cross over. It\u2019s really such a fun feeling whenever I see other characters from another series pops out in the scene.\\n\\n\r\nJust like a typical CLAMP protagonist where the character is usually very enigmatic yet very kind-hearted person. Kobato is energetic, sweet, passionate, clumsy and cute but extremely na\u00efve about almost everything. Though she has a tendency to become over dramatic with her words and everything that she does it only proves how pure and innocent she is. She\u2019s one of those characters who you would want to stay as pure and not get corrupted by the harsh reality of the world. Like they said, sometimes ignorance can really be such bliss. When I first saw Ioryogi, I thought that he is so damn cute but when he started talking I couldn\u2019t be so wrong because he is even cuter. It\u2019s just so hilarious that despite his very cute appearance, he is nasty and has a monstrous voice. Though he can be so strict and demanding with Kobato the truth is he genuinely cares a lot about her and just supports her on every decision she makes. Let\u2019s not forget the very handsome and the not so very sociable, Fujimoto. He has a very strong resemblance with Shaoran from Tsubasa but in a much matured way. Though Fujimoto is a lot cuter with his \u201cMegane\u201d look. His always mad attitude and not very honest character can be so cute at times. Despite that, he really do cares about the people around him especially Kobato.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is so great with gorgeous looking characters and breath-taking scenarios. One of the magnificent quality of CLAMP is their ability to create such gorgeous characters that I genuinely love looking at and the most amazing scenes where important scenarios are happening. Of course, the brilliant music and soundtracks, a typical from CLAMP animes. Their beautiful music always makes the animes extra perfect. In fact, I have a collection of almost all the soundtracks of my favorite CLAMP\u2019s works that has been adapted into an anime. I particularly love the soundtracks from Tsubasa.\\n\\n\r\nChobits, Tsubasa and Xxxholic are in the top 20 of my more than a hundred lists of favorite animes. This is going to be a great addition to my lists. \\n",

In the first I dont understand what does it mean, so i'll repeat the chapter again..hahaha:))\\n\\n\r\nSo if you love CARD CAPTOR SAKURA, I guess you will love this too:)",

            "content": "This is my first review and I'm going to do it on one of my favorites.\r\nKobato is about a girl who is on a mission to collect \"konpeito\" in order to have her wish granted. Her wish is to go somewhere that she wanted to go to. As the story progresses, she collects konpeito and works at a nursery.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story is an interesting comedic and romantic concept. It is not quite common to see a story about how a person was granted a lifespan of four seasons in order to achieve her goal. This was a captivating storyline.\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nThe artwork is similar to TsubasaResevoir Chronicles, which was nicely done. The art of Kobato's smile was a cute and beautiful smile that captivated my heart. The details on the background and plant forms are beautiful and nicely detailed. The illustrator and animator made perfect use of their artistic talent on this.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe music and background music fitted into every single episode. It matched with the mood and was perfect. Kobato's was perfect in the anime including Fujimoto's. The seiyu's did a good job on the acting and voice overs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime was nice. The characteristic of Kobato was of a caring mother was a good representation of her character. Fujimoto was somewhat of a tsundere character that may seem to piss of the audience. As the story progresses, his personality gradually becomes into a caring character. The inclusion of the crossover between Tsubasa Resevoir Chronicles was a plus.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThe story has an enjoyable theme. The romance in the anime may be slim, but the comedy seems to never end. The caring personality of Kobato seems to have grown on me and it was nice. Kobato just seems to make this anime worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nThe anime had a great impression on me. It was showing an enjoyable atmosphere and it lightens up my heart. The characters and sound was great. It's not exactly like the modern fighting and school life anime. It's a bit different and has a great plot. I hope others would enjoy this anime as much as I did.",

            "content": "The 'Kobato' anime was pretty awesome. Not so good as manga but cute in its own way you know. I really liked the ending. I can say that the whole atmosphere was so warm and childish that I just couldn't drop it even if sometimes I really wanted to. I liked the humor, I liked the art, I liked characters. I liked everything, yes. Now I reaaally miss the 'Kobato' series because I get used to watch it every friday =(\r\nNow about the story:\r\nThe main story was amazing. I like CLAMP stories because they are always so mysterious but at the same time very simple.Even if anime had many fillers it was good because sometimes it even annoys me to read and watch the same thing. I also liked how they interpretated the ending. It was quite good. And I liked that there was Happy End! >.< I really hate the stories that end badly =( It makes me feel sad. So again about the story... In short it was cute, interesting, and funny. \\n\r\nI give it 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was just OUTSTANDING(!!!) I love CLAMP's art design. Characters are all so tall %__% Kobato's art was very sweet :3 Her smile is so cute ^_^ Fujimoto was cool. I even liked his glasses! (actually I don't usually like anime-guys with the glasses but Fuji was pretty awesome ^^)\\n\\n\r\nI also liked the sound. Especially Kobato's song. I just have a very strange feeling when I hear it and I want to sing... Yeah, I'm strange >_>'\\n\\n\r\nThe personality of characters was very intersting to investigate you know. Especially Ioryogi's personality. He was full of mystery, kindness and at the same time some kind of brutality :D \\n\\n\r\nI reeeeeally enjoyed 'Kobato' series. It has a really great humor, art and story so I recommend it very hardly! \\n\r\nMy overall rating is 9/10. \\n\\n\\n",

But by the end of watching it, I really enjoyed it, and felt touched.\r\nThe beginning of the anime wasn't that great, because you don't fully understand the situation that Kobato is in, and her circumstances. Once you find out by the end of the anime, you'll truly love the anime and have a whole new viewpoint on Kobato's character and the anime. \r\nThe music was amazing as well. Again, it's one of those animes where everything is soo muchmore touching by the end of the anime, so that goes for the music as well.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime made me cry multiple times, something you don't expect from an average looking anime. I highly suggest you watch this. It's just as beautiful as Clannad, or what other animes that make you cry. If you don't like the beginning of it, just roll with it for all 24 episodes, trust me, you'll love it afterwards.\\n\\n",
