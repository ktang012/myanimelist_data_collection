            "content": "At first glance Space Brothers seems to be an anime about two brothers that just go space and do astronaut things, but oh ho, dear reader, it is so much more than that. It is a realistic journey delving into one of the most difficult professions ever conceived by man. Now that the series has concluded [for the time being], a proper review is in order. But first, we better shake hands.\r\nSTORY: \r\nSpace Brothers cleverly depicts the pursuits of Mutta and Hibito, converging their storylines at some times and following them separately at others. This structure is beneficial to the flow and progression, and earnstop marks from me. It also uses an intriguing method of linking the past to the present, showing the audience how the brothers' upbringing helps them with the challenges on the path toward fulfilling their dreams. \\n\\n\r\nThis leads me to the most notable aspect of Space Brothers \u2013 its insanely realistic plot. The amount of research that author Koyama Chuuya had to have done is mind-boggling. In fact, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) actually helped out on it, which is noticeable throughout. Plainly stated, you just can't make some of this stuff up! Which brings me to an important question potential viewers always ask: why is it so long?? It takes a lot of time and effort to become an astronaut, and it is quite clearly portrayed in this anime. To condense any of what is shown would be an insult to real astronauts. As a rare \"long seinen,\" I approve.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, it's difficult to NOT be impressed with immense detail that the mangaka put into the setting. For instance, whenever the main characters travel to the United States, American fans are simply blown away by the accuracy of the places illustrated, such as the John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida and the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Texas. Though I've never been to either of these locations, it almost feels like I've been on a virtual tour, just by watching an anime. \\n\\n\r\nThis leaves me with the literary brilliance of its themes. As is evident from the title, family plays an important role, and not just the Nanba family; though it is crucial to note that \"family\" is not limited by blood. Although this is a comedy [and it can be pretty funny at times], it is well balanced by its serious moments. Furthermore, this is an anime about going to space.. which is a very scary place where the consequences of failure are colossal. This anxiety gives the experience an even keener flavor. Of course it deals with moral issues and other difficulties in life as well. Sacrifice and the test of friendship is a prevalent theme as the journey to the top requires leaving many behind \u2013 not everyone can be a winner. The anime also tackles psychological and neurological hardships, in addition to exposing the stress put on the families of the astronauts. However, the theme that Space Brothers always comes back to is that hard work and guts [and a lot of luck] will always pay off, even if the immediate results appear unfavorable.\\n\\n\r\nART: \\n\r\nThough there isn't very much \"action\" in this anime, A-1 pictures does a great job in the animation department. Movements are fluid and expressions are believable, to say the least. In terms of art style, Space Brothers uses an interesting blend of intrinsic \"anime-ness\" along with the natural proportions and appearances of.. well.. real life. Something that caught my eye was the attention to heredity. Characters of the same family tended to look like each other and/or their parents, which is an uncommon trait in anime. It's a nice addition to the realism this seinen provides. Hair is also quite interesting. Each character's hair style/color stays within the bounds of reality while still remaining unique from other shows. Bonus points to Serika's hair for somehow making me smile every time she's on screen. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: \\n\r\nNow, I feel this is the weakest part of the show. Don't get me wrong, it's still good, just less so in comparison to its strengths. The music is used to enforce and empower the displayed emotions and elicit the intended feels from the viewer, but the anime reuses the same songs... over and over. I actually made it a game to see how many episodes it could go without playing the same \"feel this now\" song. I guess you get used to it after a while, but it is worth mentioning. The last third of the anime gets better at diversifying its music. The OPs and EDs are pretty good though, my favorite being ED5, \"BEYOND\" by Miho Fukuhara [yea, the same Fukuhara that did Brotherhood ED2].\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: \\n\r\nMy favorite part of this anime is the incredible characterization! Practically every character is memorable due to the depth in which each is described. Their motivations and actions logically follow the person that they've become. You can easily fall in love with any number of them, and palpably feel heartbroken if things don't go their way. Viewers with weaker hearts be wary, though I never cried myself, I acknowledge that much of the anime can bring you to tears. There are several instances in which a character's reactions and facial expressions deliver far more emotion than any amount of words could. This attribute alone makes Space Brothers stand out from other anime. Simply put, the entire cast is a rainbow of personality. I don't really want to go much further into detail.. that would ruin the magic!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: \\n\r\nThis is a great show, easily one of my favorites. Whenever I found myself in an anime rut, I just sat back and watched a couple episodes. Another thing that's worth noting is that the anime is very inspirational. Seeing Mutta go through so many tribulations gave me hope for my future, and that my efforts in the present will yield fruit down the road. Maybe that's just me though.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (TL;DR):\\n\r\nSpace Brothers is an excellently constructed anime that combines a heartwarming story with delightful comedy, using realistic characters to show the audience just how difficult it is to become an astronaut.\\n\\n\r\nOh yea, we can end that handshake now.\\n",

            "content": "\"An older brother must step ahead against his younger brother\" - Nanba Mutta.\r\nLately, i haven't found any good anime to watch.. then i meet Uchuu Kyoudai/Space Brother, at the first i was like oh just an average anime which have sci-fi and bla bla bla. since i didnt have any anime to watch, i thought i could try it for just one episode. and then seems like i had learned my lesson.\r\n\"Dont ever judge anime by its cover, genre, or anything else before you watched it\" - Me, after watching this.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSTORY\r\nThe story was simple, its about Nanba Mutta as the older brother who had promisedwith his younger brother, Nanba Hibito. to become an Astronaut together. But, then the life changes them. Now, Nanba Hibito is on training for becoming an astronaut and as for the older brother, he is just being fired from his company. And until then Mutta as the older brother have a motto that older brother must take a step ahead against his younger brother, luckily, there was an audition for becoming an astronaut. and so Mutta without hestitate sign for the audition.\\n\\n\r\nSimple? yeah... its kinda remembering me about Bakuman. and so, whats make this so special?\\n\r\nfirst of all, is the story itself. like bakuman does, the story was father kinda in slow paced. we're not just gonna see the Nanba Mutta struggle for being an astronaut, but we're gonna see too the flashback about him and her younger brother, boring? I dont think so, since all that flashback was really touching. You cant help to shed your tears (that was what i feel). Well, its not all about melancholic situation, Uchuu Kyodai have great jokes too. Usually when Nanba Mutta mumbling or speak with himself, he always comments on what he feel or what he see. It just feels so natural, you cant help to not to laugh when he does that.\\n\\n\r\nand not just that, the detail of the way they tells us about space, NASA, and the outer things was really perfect. when i watching this anime, i cant help myself to google some of the fact in this anime, like \"did you know that Moon's sand was so sharp as a shard of glass?\" and not just that, the details about space and NASA is really increasing our knowledge about it. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the character. what makes appeal me a lot was all of the character in space brother. i am not exaggerating. because in this anime, there isnt any bad guys with a weird reason to do something bad. they're just people like us, who do something for some reason, behind every act they made, they have a reason. I think thats the good point, since as far as i have seen, rarely any anime made this thing (act) so naturally. They're just doing by what they're believe.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what surprise me a lot was the each character have a scene to develop. either by flashback or by their experience. and its kinda lame to said that the story was so slow (because of the flashback), YES its slow but the slow itself because they want to the viewer knows \"what kind of character it is?\" and surely, to make us, being attracted by the character.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nThird, the art. i am not gonna said to much on this section. but, if you see it carefully, you will see why this anime was so appealing, like how many anime that have a male lead which have an afro hair? then, the draws for the character was well made, yet is so slice of life anime. Not excessive on the background coloring neither the character does. When usually some anime use so many gradient or shading in coloring to make more appealing but not in space brother, they make it simple but yet its charming. Its really the style of Sentai Filmworks\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe Last, Sound. honestly, when i heard the opening songs (especially the first OP, \"Feel so Moon\") i am really attached to it, not just attached it, i realize that the OP was really fit with the anime, its about outer space. not just the first OP, the other OP was really - really well made. Even i had to replay the OP, just for hear the song. The background song or BGM is also perfectly fit with every scenes that appears. Like when there was something amazing happen, \"Sora e No Michi\" songs plays and its really hyping up the atmosphere and makes the scenes twice more epic!\\n\\n\r\nNot just the OP and BGM, the seiyuu voice was really deserves an award. They really fits with each character that being voiced. especially when Nanba Mutta talking to himself or when he sighing about his life, its like they (the seiyuu) really put their feelings into it. Of course not just seiyuu for Nanba Mutta, but all the character.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nWhen everyone focus and talk about Shingeki no Kyojin or any anime that airing in that season, They forgot to bring this anime as topic to be discussed. Oh, poor you Space Brother. But well, honestly i am happy that not many people to know this anime. I can be a hipster! lol Anyway, this anime was still airing. until i write this review, the anime had just airing their 63 episodes but it has been on my top 5 anime,Yeah, so why i had to risk on my top anime place for this airing anime? as for me, its too early for judging anime if you havent watched the whole episodes, but who cares? this anime was awesome. and its enough reason for me to put this on my top anime.\\n\\n\r\nif you're looking for a motivational , then you might try this anime... and one message for me, CATCH YOUR DREAM!\\n\\n\r\n*Thanks for reading my review! If you found this review was not helpful or doesnt good enough,please message me. I really appreciate any feedbacks*",

            "content": "You are probably wondering why I gave this series a perfect 10 even though I've only seen 10 episodes so far...\r\nWell, simply put, everything about this anime feels very authentic. Real. There is no sense of false pretense. And above all, it gives off a very contagious sense of hope and optimism. A sense that your dreams ARE reachable, and that there is no such thing as bad luck; it's all about making your own luck. \r\nI'm sure everyone has had their share of disappointments and somewhere along the line, has felt bitter about the way their life turned out. I'm also sure that everyonehas had their share of dreams that had to be abandoned for one reason or another. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, don't let your cynicism taint your enjoyment of this hidden gem. As a matter of fact, let yourself be infected by the optimism of this show...\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the plot centers around two brothers, Mutta and Hibito, who have wanted to become astronauts since they were kids. However, Hibito, the younger of the two, was the one to actually make his dream come true, while Mutta leaves his dream behind to pursue a more reachable profession. After losing his long-time job and being blacklisted in that field, Mutta tries to pick himself back up by working small, part-time jobs. But with a huge amount of encouragement from his parents and especially Hibito, Mutta aims to become an astronaut again.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, the plot is basic and straightforward, but the entertainment lies in the characters and how they persist through the situations they're thrown in.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sake of not writing so much (lol), I'll just discuss the two brothers: Mutta and Hibito, although the entire cast is well-rounded and likable as well.\\n\\n\r\nTo start off, Mutta is a fantastic protagonist. He's highly sympathetic, hilarious in unexpected ways, completely honest, and so charismatic that you can't help but cheer him on. I honestly believe that his charisma largely comes from the way his voice actor, Hiroaki Hirata, performs the role with complete ease. It's so enjoyable and so natural that Mutta seems like a real person rather than some made-up character in some anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I enjoy most about Mutta's character is that he represents two sides: disappointment and hope. Many, many times during his journey to becoming an astronaut, Mutta loses faith in himself and says \"I give up, there's no way I can do this.\" (Something I'm sure everyone can relate to) However, like any other great protagonist, he holds an inner spark of hope that drives him to persist through the challenges that are thrown at him, in spite of what he says to himself. All in all, he is the reason why I believe this show is contagiously optimistic and hopeful. Mutta, despite being an adult who has experienced a fair amount of disappointment, still retains the optimistic enthusiasm of his younger self while taking steps in achieving his long-time dream.\\n\\n\r\nHis brother, Hibito, is equally great as a character. Although, he seems like a one-dimensional stereotype of the perfect younger brother, he gets his fair share of development that makes him much more. I personally think Hibito shines brightest as a character whenever he is interacting with his brother Mutta. There's a real sense of love and affection that is mutual on both ends. The frequent flashbacks of their childhood helps to illustrate this fact, as well as their present interactions. Also, as brothers, their natural rivalry with each other is what encourages them to do their best, rather than drive each other away. \\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship, which is at the center of this show, is one of the many refreshing things about this anime. Though their relationship is somewhat similar to that of Cain and Abel from the Bible, there is no hate involved. While Mutta is jealous of the success of his younger brother, he doesn't hate him for it. Instead, he's proud to have such a brother. If anything, as the older brother, he wishes that he wasn't so pitiful in comparison, in looks and in luck. \\n\\n\r\nThe humor is certainly another refreshing point of this anime. The opening sequence should quickly point out that the humor isn't mainstream, but at the same time, its charming because of how odd and unconventional it is at times. I also enjoy the fact that this anime likes to poke fun at everyday behavior.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and overall scene direction leaves me breathless. Its quality is reminescent of American films made in the 90's (at least to me...) so I often get fits of nostalgia while watching this anime lol. While I find the style appealing (especially the music), it does come across as cheesy so heads up!\\n\\n\r\nArt is highly debatable since it doesn't appeal to those who prefer more attractive designs. (Poor Mutta, he's probably the ugliest character in the show XD) However, in my opinion, the realistic character designs help ground this anime into a sense of reality, which helps me appreciate the real-life references that are thrown in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm obviously enjoying the heck out of this anime. Reason why I haven't watched any further is because, so far, there's only 17 episodes out and I need a back-up for whenever Hunter x Hunter goes on a break lol. (Although I feel like I'm going to cave in very soon...)\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I hope this review helped! \\n\\n\r\n(If not, constructive criticism is highly appreciated!)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Uchuu Kyoudai... well I have to day that this anime is one of those inspiring ones.\r\nI first started watching the first four episodes of this anime at AX (Anime Expo 2012) with no hopes for this anime but oh boy... I was proved wrong. Throughout my life I always watched shoujo, shounen, mecha, adventure etc. \r\nFrom the fact that I only considering watching those genres it came to my judgement when it I was watching Uchuu Kyoudai at AX.\r\nAs human beings, everybody\r\nDO NOT JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER! ~Lesson learned~ -.-\r\nUchuu Kyoudai (Space Brothers in English) was obviously not one of those animes thatwasn't involved with \"destruction of the world\" but it was about Mutta (protagonist) keeping his promise to his younger brother, Hibito, in becoming a astronaut like Hibito and go to Mars.\\n\\n\r\nStory/ Plot OVERALL: 10\\n\r\nThe story is really inspiring, and heart warming. The main protagonist, Mutta, is just a average man with talent that recognized in his profession as a car builder but later because of his boss insult to his younger brother, Hibito, Mutta now was living with his parents with no job. \\n\\n\r\nRealizing that he was jobless he sets out to find another job. Hearing from his parents what happen to Mutta, Hibito reached out to Mutta by suggesting that Mutta should keep his promise to his younger brother and enter the astronaut training program. With many fail attempts, Mutta finally take his brother's advice and sets out to the astronaut training program and this is when the story begins... \\n\\n\r\nCharacters OVERALL: 10\\n\r\nPerfect! There are various types of characters that you get to see in this anime.\\n\r\nA snotty genius, a quiet thinker, a bright positive leader, etc. Each character makes this anime quite fulfilling.\\n\\n\r\nEach character that Mutta meets has a big significance to the story and it gives that slight tingling feeling of curiosity whose going to achieve their goals. As Mutta met other characters in the story it gives him more motivation in passing the astronaut training program but as he meets more characters he, sometimes, doubts himself and ask himself \"Do I have what it takes to become a astronaut? Do I have the right to become an astronaut?\" as he goes along with the astronaut training program he becomes more determine and to realization that he wants this dream to become an reality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic/ Sound OVERALL: 10\\n\r\nIt is well done. The soundtracks plays a major role of the anime that gives the scenes the tension and passion that it needs! Well done!\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt OVERALL: 10\\n\r\nReasonable. I'm glad that this anime does not have any characters that has pink hair with green eyes or women with huge over-sized breasts. To be honest, I'm sick of it... get real.\\n\r\nI cannot explain what my thoughts are of this art. :)\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap this review:\\n\r\nI would like to say that so far (as the episodes will come) I am glad that my little sister dragged me to watch this anime at AX. It is very enjoyable and inspiring. I would highly recommend it to anyone.\\n\r\n It is a joy to watch!",

            "content": "This show is a hidden masterpiece. I have always managed to simply ignore it because of its length and seemingly mundane type setting. But during the summer vacation, I unearthed this anime from my long watching list. My reaction was 'Meh, why not?' When I watched the first episode I was completely mesmerized. \r\nYes, you will not find aliens and fantasy. You will not find some crazy sci-fi anime with lazer beams blasting out of gigantic humanoid robots. But you will find the passionate story of two brothers that aim to become astronauts/cosmonauts, one of realities most dangerous and strenuous professions. You will also findgreat comedy kicking at you for a few good laughs. (Comedy and sentimental moments are always at good timings without disturbing the flow of the show)\\n\\n\r\n10/10 Story\\n\r\nAs many people might have already said the story is about the life of siblings trying to go to space. It is a character based story so you will find that the anime follows mostly on the life of Nanba Mutta and his amusing and romantic encounters with others that have the same passion for space.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 Art\\n\r\nAlthough many may disagree, I wouldn't say this art was a down-side of the show. I thought the art style fit fairly well with its theme. However, I did notice that the art of a few characters were a bit unconventional. But art is largely personal preference, so don't let my tastes push you away.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 Sound\\n\r\nI never listen to classical music or orchestra, but I have always thought they fitted with anime the best. Almost all my favorite series or all-time masterpieces, like this one, have used classical music. This anime doesn't lose in sound to any of the masterpieces I have seen. Great music always follows the mood of great scenes.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 Character\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime were all amazing. Its very hard to express characters realistically in anime but this one has particularly done an outstanding job. The depth of major characters was just great. The background stories show the personal lives of all the main characters and how it entwines into their careers as astronauts or engineers. The mini-stories also added gravity to the the character's dedication. Everyone aiming to become an astronaut has a passion. But in order to fufill their ambitions, they will be tested, casting their values, skills and determiniation into the dangers of space.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 Enjoyment\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this anime with laughs, inspiration and good food.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 Overall\\n\r\nA hidden masterpiece.\\n",

            "content": "Nostalgia...\r\nAs older brother must always stay a few steps ahead of the younger one.\r\nThe younger now leads the older...\r\n----------------\r\nSTORY 9/10\r\n----------------\r\nUchuu Kyoudai (Space Brothers), originally a manga by Koyama Chuuya which won two manga awards as well as nominated for several more, revolves around the two Namba brothers Mutta (the older brother by 3 years born on a day of agony) and Hibito (the younger brother born on a day of glory) who both vow to become astronauts after encountering an UFO in their childhood. However, as time passed, the younger brother seemed to be the only one to achieve the goal as he becomes thefirst Japanese man to step foot on the moon, where as Mutta, the older brother, gets fired from his job and is black listed from his industry. After much reflection and some encouragement from Hibito, Mutta once again pursues his promise to Hibito and tries to pursue going to space. With some unexpected help from his parents and brother Mutta is accepted to a Japanese Astronaut training program by JAXX. The rest is up to Mutta, his luck, and his own will. Now it will be the younger brother leading the older.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I particularly like about the story thus far is the realism it takes, that the trials that Mutta encounters, can't be soley blamed on \"bad luck\" or being \"born on a bad date\" although the story makes that information available, it by no means takes the route of destiny, hence opening the anime to a much deeper discussion of personal attitude and ability. \\n\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nBrilliantly adapted into an anime produced by A-1 Pictures (Ano Hi Mita... , Ao no Exorcist, Kannagi, Gash Bell!, etc) and YTV (Cardcaptor Sakura, Detective Conan, etc) directed by veterans Watanabe Ayumu (Pretty much all the Doraemon's) and art director Kato Hiroshi (Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei!), the art takes a older look to it reminiscent of BECK. The character designs are rather untextured and less \"clean\" many of the modern series. \\n\\n\r\nThe older style of art, however, really brings out more nostalgic feelings. The only drawbacks, however, would be the art quality cannot match many newer series using similar art styles. \\n\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\r\n--------------\\n\r\nThe sound of the series again screams out nostalgic. Opening them \"Feel So Moon\" by Unicorn (a Japanese rock band formed in 1993) has a classical rock vibe that resounds with the older brother because Mutta was born in 1993. Again nostalgia. The ED theme \"This Wonderful World\" (\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u304d\u4e16\u754c Subarashiki Sekai) by Gira Mundo resonates more with the younger brother, being a more modern rock sounding track with a nice electronic beat. The two themes fit perfectly to sandwich the story of two brothers.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting featured veteran Hirata Hiroaki (Sanji from One Piece) as Mutta and newer voice Kenn (Jil from Druaga no Tou). The two voice actors compliment each other and their roles, as an older voice actor and a younger rising one. The voicing are done well and I can't say I have complaints as I don't have much to base my judgement on right now.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music, again nostalgic, features overtones by trumpets and retains a \"old school\" feel, if that makes any sense. However, I didn't quite particularly enjoy these sounds and so found them mediocre at best. Sorry to the music director. \\n\\n\r\n--------------------------\\n\r\nCHARACTER 8/10\\n\r\n--------------------------\\n\r\nThe characters introduced so far are few, featuring the brothers Mutta and Hibito, their parents, and several randoms (such as bosses can co-workers). However, only Mutta and his brother Hibito are really explored farther than just a few lines. \\n\\n\r\nMutta is in appearance far my ragged than his younger brother, with curly unruly hair and a unshaven face, he looks rather like a NEET than anything else. His character is portrayed as one who us more or less hopeless, rash and lacks boldness to \"step forward\" as he says himself. As the series hasn't progressed far enough, I'd have to say he didn't have enough depth yet and that potential in his development are huge.\\n\\n\r\nHibito is the younger brother who looks cleaner with a shorter hair cut, shaved face and cleaner brighter skin, looks like a professional or a ideal male protagonist in some Jousei drama. That being said, he contrasts his brother sharply and is has opportunities which his brother does not. He is portrayed as a hopeful, bold and caring young man almost everything the older brother \"should\" be. \\n\\n\r\nby now the 3rd episode, character developments are taking root primarily as we learn about Mutta. However I do hope to see the development of the younger brother aswell\\n\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 9/10\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this? Hell yes. Mainly because of how the story resounds with me, an underachieving older brother who is wasting away in university spending his nights writing anime reviews. Just kidding. \\n\\n\r\nBut jokes aside, I think the story is really well done and takes a very wholesome and realistic approach at the lives and circumstances of the two brothers. It hints at the ideas of destiny and fated good/bad luck. However, it merely mentions it so that viewer who see it that way can relate while it slowly shows reality of how the circumstances are products of individual choices and feelings, not of just \"luck\". Mutta was fired for head butting his boss, pretty real, not unlucky. Hibito became an astronaunt beause of his boldness and passion (as seen by his quick response as a child), real, not just luck.\\n\\n\r\nThe realism really proved to be refreshing after all of the unrealistic, having circumstances thrust upon and fixed animes I've been watching recently.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I liked is how I could feel the older brother's anguish as his pride was stepped on by having his younger brother surpass him and his parents shame him. He's not a wimp, rather, realistically like an adult man, he sheds a few tears in secret and doesn't say word about his pain. *resonating feelings\\n\\n\r\nMy only criticism would be that I feel like they didn't cover enough ground so far, that there are many other feelings that should be portrayed that are missed. And that they could have made Mutta's suffering even more relatable by delaying his tears.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nOVERALL 8/10\\n\r\n----------------------\\n\r\nOk so I know I've been pretty generous this whole review, but mainly because I think its a show worth watching and I want to encourage everyone to check it out. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story is sentimental and is adapted into a tangible form of nostalgia that makes you think. Utilizing the sounds and characters, Uchuu Kyodai really causes sympathies to run rampant and makes one reflect about their own usage of life so far.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd give it the 8/10 for its ability to convey a consistent atmosphere fitting of the series thus far and the brilliant choices of music, voice actors and animation styles to compliment the story and characters.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nExpect Updates After Each Episode, the plot section won't change very much but other sections might.\\n\\n\r\nCOMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS ARE ALWAYS WELCOME!\\n",

            "content": "With this review, I am hoping to attract attention to the highly underrated anime that is Space Brothers, or I should say, Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai. I can confidently rate this anime an easy 10/10. In the following paragraphs, I will go into detail and explain why. \r\nUch\u016b Ky\u014ddai is a Seinen, Slice of Life. That being said, it is almost suitable for all ages. In the beginning, the story itself is not so much original, but it is how the events play out with a wonderfully charming cast of characters, that makes this anime unique. I have a huge interest for astronomy, and I obviously loveanime and manga. So when I discovered Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai, it seemed too good to be true. It was my two main interests in one package, so I felt inclined to give it a try.  During the first episode I immediately liked it, and then only a couple of episodes later, I loved it. Now instead of talking about myself, I will go into the specifics of why I feel every anime and manga fan should give Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai a chance. Whether you have a strong, mild or even a zero interest in astronomy, this is a very enjoyable anime. There is no need to feel overwhelmed, as this anime does not attempt to drill astronomy facts into your brain. For the most part, this anime is very character driven, but I\u2019ll get to that in the next paragraph. I don\u2019t want to waste your time with a summary of the story plot as that can be easily seen above on the anime\u2019s page, so I\u2019ll just get straight to the analysis. I can guarantee that you will laugh while watching this anime. The main character, Nanba Mutta is hilarious. It\u2019s always a joy watching the new situations he finds himself in. In terms of comedy, the anime is written very cleverly. Better more is the fact that the show is very unpredictable. From what I thought would continue to be an easy going, funny series, at one particular point had me at the very edge of my seat in suspense. A bunch of very suspenseful episodes, out of nowhere, had just been thrown at me and I was in awe. And that is the beauty of Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai\u2019s storytelling. It successfully transcends from easy going comedy, to pure suspense, adding in some beautifully written touching scenes. I won\u2019t lie; Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai has made me shed a fair amount of man tears from time to time. Some of the scenes are so beautifully written, and I can\u2019t stress this point enough, as this is one of the story\u2019s biggest strengths. It becomes obvious I\u2019ve stumbled across an amazing series when I am presented with storytelling that makes me feel all kinds of different emotions. This is what I believe makes an anime, what I would consider a masterpiece. The simple fact that I know that Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai has what it takes to; make me smile, make me laugh, make me thrilled and make me cry. \\n\\n\r\nI will now move on to the characters. I absolutely love the main character, Nanba Mutta. In my opinion, he is the perfect main protagonist. He has quite a goofy appearance, which helps immensely in his ability to make you laugh. A very funny character, but also a very true character. I love when we hear his sarcastic or pessimistic thoughts because they are easily relatable, as he innocently reveals his many annoyances. Mutta also somehow knows the right thing to say to those around him, which helps him, and many of the side characters that he meets along his journey. When Mutta does this though, it doesn\u2019t feel forced but instead very natural. His voice actor, Hirata, Hiroaki, who has been in many different anime, fits the role perfectly and does an exceptional job. Mutta will certainly make you laugh many times, but most importantly, he\u2019ll make you fond of him within a heartbeat. Mutta\u2019s brother, Hibito, is more of a serious character. This suits the series well however, because when there are a bunch of episodes that mostly focus on him, the show itself shifts to a more serious nature. I find this to be clever because as an audience, we are more concerned with the events and struggles of what is happening, instead of relying on Hibito to say something funny. Both brothers are easy to love, though Mutta is more charming and entertaining as a whole. I won\u2019t go through the other characters in detail, as that would take up too much time; however I will say that there is very sufficient variety of characters and side characters to keep the show in order. Examples include; a very cute and innocent, but smart, love interest for Mutta. A very sincere, likable and hard working man. (Mutta\u2019s best friend.) A witty, confident and tough, but down to earth guy. (One of Mutta\u2019s colleagues.) And a couple of smartasses (I mean this in a positive way, as it adds great comedy to the series), who may seem annoying at first, but you easily, grow to love.  There are many more, but I\u2019ll leave that for you to discover after hopefully viewing this show. Something which is very well done in Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai is the depth that is explored in each character. There have been many times in which a character is introduced and due to the very detailed exploration of said character\u2019s past, a new feeling of care is now added to the audience. Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai is great with flashbacks because they aren\u2019t too long, they\u2019re informative, and most importantly, enjoyable. A great feature of Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai is the continuous flashbacks of Hibito and Mutta as children, which will then resume to the present and connect brilliantly to the story.  \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the quality of the art, Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai is quite impressive. I feel that A-1 Pictures have done a very nice job with the series, and the art is always beautifully presented. The art style of the series itself is very realistic, and I find this to be a nice breath of fresh air. Serika, one of the female main characters looks very life like, and this is a nice change as we all know that females in anime can very often look quite unnatural. One of the very few flaws of the series is the soundtrack. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think the soundtrack is great, and fits the mood of the series wonderfully. However, the problem I have is the limitation of the soundtrack. There are not very many themes at all; in fact, two of the most commonly played pieces of music can be heard in every episode. The soundtrack can become a little too repetitive and over played unfortunately. However, this is basically the only gripe I have with Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai. And this alone, is not nearly bad enough for me to feel obliged to deduct a point from the overall rating. \\n\\n\r\nI definitely feel like I could go on for much longer, though I don\u2019t want this review to seem too overwhelming in its length. Overall, I have made it obvious that I adore this series and will continue to watch until its finale. As of now, I have shown this anime to my sister, my cousin, and my best friend, all of whom find the series very enjoyable. Unfortunately not many of my friends are into anime and manga like I am. However, there\u2019s one thing that I will continue to do with anyone I meet in the future, with the same passion for anime and manga. I will certainly, without a moment\u2019s doubt or hesitation, recommend this gem that is Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai.   \\n",

            "content": "Space brothers is about two brothers' journey to space. Its a feel good comedy about reigniting your passions in life and chasing dreams you thought were impossible.\r\nNamba Hibito is cool, carefree and about to become the first Japanese person on the moon while his older brother Mutta is down on his luck, having been fired from his job designing automobiles. He gave up on his dreams years ago but a little nudge from his little brother starts him on the journey to realise his childhood dream of joining his brother in space.\r\nSo first off this is not a show about adventures in space. There isof course some space travel but it is more of a character driven comedy that showcases a lot of training as well as the grueling selection process on the road to becoming an astronaut. But even though that may sound boring it does manage to keep interesting plots happening most of the time, and its a pretty funny show so I think that makes up for it. It has a bit of a lull around the 25 episode mark but if you keep going it ramps up again, it is a very fun series and will make you (in the words of the opening song) feel so good.\\n\\n\r\nSo as I mentioned this is a character driven show. There are a lot of great characters. I particularly enjoyed the cringeingly awesome parents, and Lowry the American Weeaboo astronaut who is always misusing Japanese phrases but the whole cast is pretty colourful. Our hero Mutta is a loserish 30 something year old with hidden talents. He is the perfect hero for people in their thirties (or late twenties like me) who want to start dreaming again. It is a bit more mature that a lot of the anime out there but still has those awesome Japanese elements I love like a celebration of lofty dreams and the determination and resolve to realise them.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art I felt like this wasn't a focus for the creators. The individual pictures are a bit more on the realistic side and while they mostly look ok on their own the animation itself is often stilted and awkward. After a while I stopped noticing it most of the time but every now and then there would be some really awkward movement, for example there is a particular dance scene that looks borderline creepy. But for the most part you are just watching simple animation and it does the job.\\n\\n\r\nOne negative thing I will say for this show is that although the ending is good it kind of ends in an unsatisfying place. The last episode was exciting and resolved stuff and didn't feel rushed, but you will see when you get there (if you watch it) that it doesn't end where you want it to end. I do sort of hope they start the anime again because even though I liked the ending there were some things I wanted to see happen.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is incredibly feel good. It has some more real moments but overall its the kind of show that is always a bit warm and fuzzy. They are basically a bunch of lovable space nerds fulfilling their dreams, and triumphing thanks to determination and hard work. So yeah if you are turned off by things that are too happy, or where things work out too well for the cast you might find that annoying. Personally I found it suspended disbelief really well. However it did have the unfortunate side effect of making me wish I was an astronaut. So be warned.",

            "content": "~Woyouuuu~ (Burusu Lee style!)\r\nI just picked up this anime by chance when my friend told me that the manga it was adapted from was really good, and was even considered for the Manga Taisho award. And boy, am I glad I listened to him.\r\nWe all have dreamed of being into space at one point; I won't believe anyone who claim otherwise. When I was a kid, I was really interested in (what have been) the nine planets, and my ever-growing speculation of possible existence of life in each of these. It was one of my childhood goals to see the Earth from outer space, alongwith my dreams of finally discovering my superpowers or discovering my magic abilities. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, the harsh reality struck the most of us around the time we hit puberty. We give up on dreaming big, on claiming to have seemingly unachievable goals and sharing it with others. By then most of us dream of having a stable family, a 9 to 5 job or starting a business; with having a doctorate degree or owning a multi-national company being the best of our \"realistic\" goals.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, Uchuu Kyoudai starts in a quixotic fashion (spoiler alert): \"two boys inspired of becoming astronauts just because they have seen a rice-bowl UFO? C'mooon..\" Because of that, I had the impression that this show would continue to have an unrealistic atmosphere, which would kinda turn me off. Good thing I was wrong; the show was as realistic as it could be. \\n\\n\r\nMy suppressed dreams of donning the white suit and doing the moonwalk in the Earth's only natural satellite came back to me, as the show placed itself very well in order to sympathize yourself with the characters, especially with Nanba Mutta, the main protagonist: Mu-chan starts out as a guy with above-average skills paired with some bad luck, which most of us would use as an excuse for our failures. Right from the start, the story served a dish of bad luck for Mutta, but with the help of his brother, that event had been a blessing in disguise. The way it started out really helped the viewers sympathize with Mu-chan, which made it easier to relate to him as he goes into higher grounds.\\n\\n\r\nRight then, I realized that the UFO the two brothers saw at the beginning can make do as a metaphor of our childhood dreams which feel like they're impossible to reach. However, one of the two brothers have reached it. The challenge is up to us, the other bro, to stand up and fight for our dreams - or let them haunt us with regret.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot seems like a good brew for a feel-good anime, but what makes Uchuu Kyoudai stand out is its suave execution of blending the storyline with some well-delivered comedy, usually resulting from Mu-chan's unconventional way of thinking. Even when things get too serious, you suddenly forget the conflicts for a while because of these moments.\\n\\n\r\nThough it has not finished yet, I'm really impressed by this show so far. This realistic take on achieving your dreams and making the most out of every day gives us encouragement to achieve whatever you may want to, and not giving up when you're presented with obstacles and hindrances. Uchuu Kyoudai is an anime apart from others, as it is not really a slice-of-life anime, but at the same time, is as realistic and \"down to the ground\" as a somewhat sci-fi story could get (unless you count the rice bowl-UFO and Japanese-speaking Americans :P).",

The story is unique, the characters have a ~quirky~ (I hate that word) sense of humor, and the themes (losing your job, feeling inadequate, reinventing yourself, sibling rivalry, doing what you love even if it's hard) are quite relatable and relevant given the world's current state. Readers of the manga will be happy to know that they followed it almost word for word. I found that the choice of voice actors was weird and I'm not really happy about that, but it's my only major complaint. The soundtrack is greatand the art is simplistic but vibrant. Overall, I would definitely recommend this anime and I can't wait to see where it goes as the season progresses.",

            "content": "This will be the very first review I have submitted to MyAnimeList, so I apologize if is not in keeping with the style you are accustomed to.\r\nLet me begin by stating that if in order for you to enjoy an anime it must contain action, giant robots, aliens, moe, magical girls or similar fantastical events, this is probably not the series for you. What you will find here is a story of how with sufficient determination, your dreams are within reach. \r\nThe plot thus far has been simply wonderful, with optimism and inspiration radiating from it in vast quantities. One such example of this isthe fact that the series is set in 2026. This means that in 2012, Mutta and Hibito would have been the same age as the average viewer, which is a subtle way to say that if you are sufficiently determined, you could plausibly become an astronaut by the same time as Hibito. I must admit that many tears were shed over the course of the series up to this point. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the OPs and EDs have been highly enjoyable (although \"Feel So Moon\" was the best in my opinion) and the soundtrack is one of the best I have heard since Angel Beats. It is performed by a full orchestra and adds tremendously to the emotional impact of numerous scenes. I will have to acquire it at some point. \\n\\n\r\nThe series has such a classic feel to it and the realistic animation style works to focus one's attention on the plot rather than watching the cute lolis (not to slight lolis, of course). All of these factors combine to make this my absolute favorite anime of the last couple of years, if not one of my all-time favorites. It will air for about 45 episodes and I highly recommend it to anybody looking for something unique.",

            "content": "-Summary-\r\nStory: 10\r\nArt: 9\r\nSound: 8\r\nCharacter: 10\r\nEnjoyment: 10\r\nOverall: 10\r\n-Details-\r\nStory: 10\r\nGenres: Drama, Seinen, Slice of Life, Sci-fi, Space\r\nAs far as slice of life anime go, the pacing of Space Brothers is slightly slower than average.  It has a continuous narrative, mostly told from the point of view of one of the two main characters/brothers.  The story is slightly non-linear in that there are many juxtapositions of the main characters' past and present experiences.  You get to see the main characters when they are about 12 or so and see how those experiences shaped who they are at the present, in their late 20's-early 30's.One of the only things that stuck out to me as negative was that almost every episode opens with one or two minutes of recap, even when it didn't seem necessary.  There were also a couple of recap episodes along the way.\\n\r\nThe story itself is mostly about the process of becoming an astronaut and the setting is earth/NASA for most of the story.  A major appeal of this story is seeing the \"behind the scenes\" aspects of becoming an astronaut, which is something you don't always see in stories about NASA and space.  The story seems very realistic and is very character driven.  There are moments of comedy and drama sprinkled throughout the story; both the comedy and drama elements are well done and work well.  Overall the story is simple and straightforward, and you can easily sit back and enjoy watching the main character work towards becoming an astronaut.\\n\r\nAnother aspect of this show is that it is set slightly in the future--the main part of the story takes place in the 2020's.  Thus there is a bit of a sci-fi element involved in predicting what kind of technology we will have at the time.  Overall I think the predictions seem very reasonable and it's actually very cool seeing stuff that we might actually have in the near future.\\n\r\nThe anime was catching up to the manga at the time it ended.  Rather than coming up with some alternate ending, the anime basically just stopped at a point that seemed reasonable to stop.  So the ending doesn't really wrap things up like a true ending; it seems like another season could potentially be tagged right onto the end of it in the future.  The ending doesn't seem like a negative aspect per se but it will leave you wanting more and hoping for more adaptation of the manga in the future.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nStudio: A-1 Pictures\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good and clean, and the style of rendering the characters is realistic.  Every character looks unique and is easily identifiable (even by their hair, which the series itself pokes fun at).  The quality is fairly consistent throughout the whole series; there are one or two arcs where it gets a little better during more dramatic parts of the series.  Overall I would say the art does what it needs to do in order to tell the story effectively.  It's not super amazing but it's not bad either.  It gets the job done.  The openings and endings look good as well.\\n\r\nThere are times when CGI is used for things like airplanes and rockets.  The CGI is done quite well and I think it works well when used and doesn't hinder the effectiveness of any specific scenes.\\n\r\nI've never been to NASA but many fans say the backgrounds are rendered very well and very realistically.  If you've been to NASA then you might feel like you're there again while watching this show.  Things like the rockets and space-suits also look really good.  Overall there really isn't anything bad about the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are pretty good--for many fans the first opening theme stands out as a favorite.  They capture the mood of the series pretty well.  \\n\r\nThe voice acting was well done and posed no problems.  The voices all work well for the realistic setting.  There are moments of comedy and when those occur the voice actors do a good job of making it funny as well.  There were no stand out negative performances.  I think the voice actor of the main character did a particularly good job, which is important for this show since he gets a ton of screen time.  I can still remember what he sounds like in my head, and I personally really like his voice.\\n\r\nSounds effects are good.  Nothing ever stuck out to me as out of place.  They are good enough to aid in the immersion factor.\\n\r\nThe mood of the OST fits with the show well.  There is some good slice of life music.  The show itself is also quite inspirational at times and the music usually reinforces that feeling quite well.  \\n\r\nThe OST didn't really have any stand out tracks that I would feel compelled to go listen to for fun.  But it's not like there was any terrible music either.  One thing which is pretty noticeable is that many of the tracks repeat quite a bit--I think there's even one piece which appears in nearly every episode.  This is something you will very likely notice especially if you tend to binge watch shows.  It's not a bad track so this isn't necessarily a negative, but I would have liked more variety.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is meant to be very realistic and the characters end up feeling like real people so that is a big plus.  There is no narrator except for recap moments/episodes.  Characters in this show are all in their mid 20's or older.  No high schools students.\\n\r\nGiven the name of the series it's not surprising that the two main brothers get the most screen time, and of those two the main character, Mutta, gets by far the most screen time.  This story is really all about Mutta trying to grow and become an astronaut while he chases his brother Hibito who is already an astronaut.  Mutta is a very likable guy.  He starts out a little depressed because he was recently fired from his job, but things start to turn around for him as he begins the process of becoming an astronaut.  You gradually learn more about him--why he's qualified to become an astronaut, what his personality is like--and you see him grow in confidence quite a bit.  His character development is realistic and you get to see him in all sorts of life situations, like at parties, at home, etc, so you get to learn a lot about him, and personally I got really attached to him and he is one of my favorites characters from anime.  I cheered for him every step of the way because he is a genuinely likable and good guy.\\n\r\nHibito is energetic but he also seems a little more reserved, so you don't get to know him as well as Mutta.  He is still a likable character though and, at least to me, he felt like a genuine little brother even though career-wise he would be Mutta's \"senpai\" so I think they got this balance down quite well.  Hibito gets two arcs in the spotlight and they are two of my favorite arcs for spoiler-y reasons, so I'll leave it at that.\\n\r\nAnother important character is the brothers' \"aunt\" Sharon, who isn't technically their aunt but is like a mother-figure to the boys.  She's a well-known astronomer and helped cultivate the boys' enthusiasm for space while they grew up.  It's very cool to see scenes from their past and present juxtaposed and how Sharon helped them grow into who they are.  Later on Sharon becomes more important to the actual plot of the story as well.\\n\r\nThe supporting cast includes the brothers' parents and mostly other astronauts.  There are many different personalities and they are all quite unique and stand out in my mind.  I remember most of them really well and fondly.  The diversity of the cast and the skill with which their personalities are crafted and developed are comparable to works of Naoki Urasawa if you happen to be familiar with those works.\\n\r\nThere isn't really a main antagonist either.  Sometimes there are higher-ups in NASA who potentially pose a threat to some astronauts' career advancement but there is no character that everyone is working against or anything.  Basically like real life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 / Overall: 10\\n\\n\r\nA big factor in enjoyment is whether or not you tend to like slice-of-life, highly character driven stories.  I do so I was all over this, especially since I really like space and science.  I think that anyone who can enjoy slice-of-life and has an interest in space or science would definitely like this show, since you get to see a lot of cool \"behind the scenes\" type things at NASA, as well as some cool space travel.  The cast of characters is pretty amazing and I enjoyed spending time with them.  This anime can also be inspirational and awe-inspiring, which I really appreciated and enjoyed for myself.  \\n\r\nI think that this series would be something a non-anime fan could enjoy, but only if they would be okay with something slice-of-life and slower paced.  I say this mostly because of how realistic the series is and that there is no anime weirdness and no fanservice, so it is quite accessible.\\n\r\nI'm not sure this show has the best re-watch value since it's so long and kind of slow paced.  I'm not sure if that will be my final verdict though since I haven't re-watched it yet.\\n\r\nI would definitely like to own this show at some point if I am ever able to do so, and overall it's a very memorable show.  Details of this show definitely stand out in my mind and left a positive impression on me.  Overall I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks this show sounds like something they've enjoyed before.",

            "content": "Uchuu Kyoudai is an ongoing, award winning manga from Koyama Chuya. From 2012 to 2014 it got an anime adaptation from A-1 pictures. It also had a live action film adaptation that was released shortly after the anime started. I don't really know what to expect from this one so let's dive right into it.\r\nStory:\r\nThe narrative opens in 2025, Nanba Hibito is poised to become the first Japanese astronaut to land on the moon. His older brother, Nanba Mutta, isn't doing so well. He recently lost his job when he head-butt his supervisor for insulting his little brother and he's moved back in with hisparents while looking for a new job. Oddly enough, places seem hesitant to hire a guy who head-butt his supervisor. While Mutta is struggling, his mother, under the advice of Hibito, sends his resume to Jaxa and he finds himself on the list to take the astronaut exam. If he can make it past several tests, he can fulfil his childhood dream of becoming an astronaut and, eventually, travelling to space.\\n\\n\r\nWhile that is a compelling premise for a slice of life work, Uchuu Kyoudai does have some narrative problems. The biggest one is definitely the filler. There's a pretty significant amount of time wasted reiterating information they've already given and most of the episodes waste a good thirty seconds with recaps. The series also has a couple of recap episodes, one right after the other. Altogether, that results in a good chunk of time getting wasted. It also hurts the pacing, since it slows things down. The series also inappropriately introduces pseudo-scientific elements. There's a portion where we're randomly introduced to a character who possesses the power to see the future. This isn't just some scam artist, like every person who claims that they can see the future in reality. In the context of the show, she actually can tell the future. Basically, the entire purpose of her having this power is to foreshadow something. There are much better ways to do that. Random psychic powers might work for some pieces of fiction, but they really, distractingly, don't work in a series like this that's heavily grounded in actual science. I will say, it's not a huge plot tumour since it's only used for a brief arc, but it still manages to hurt the series. There are also some unfortunate choices when it comes to the portrayal of black characters that can read as a bit racist. To be fair, none of them seem malicious or deliberate. It's more that it uses some really unfortunate stereotyping.\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, the story itself is really compelling and it has a lot of good moments, both dramatic and comedic. It also manages to constantly, and naturally, introduce new sources of tension. Normally, I would take issue with a series being set this close to present time, but Uchuu Kyoudai actually handles that aspect very well. Most of the technology they have is stuff we have already or slightly modified versions where the alterations are pretty plausible. There is a little bit of new technology that gets introduced and all of it seems pretty conceivable. There's nothing that you see introduced that makes you stop and question how they developed something like that in the near future. The humorous elements largely work pretty well and the blending of drama and humour is effectively done. Koyama knows when to be serious, when to inject a little bit of humour into a serious moment and how to transition from one mood to the other so as not to diminish either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, largely, well written. The major, and most of the side, characters get developed and fleshed out enough to have verisimilitude. A lot of them have humorous quirks, but they're not quirks that seem out of place or that get exaggerated to the point of being unbelievable. The interactions are also well handled. The friendship between Mutta and Kenji is pretty stellar. As is the dynamic \u2019twixt the brothers. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation are good. The series has a pretty massive cast of characters and they manage to make all of them look pretty distinctive. The backgrounds and various objects are nicely detailed and the animation is fluid. Really, my only issue is that the series does recycle a lot of scenes. It's almost certainly done to pad the story and not because the animators are lazy, but it still gets annoying seeing the same images time after time.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe performances are all well done. Kenn and Hirata Hiroaki give solid performances as the brothers. Sawashiro Miyuki is a boss in this, taking on multiple roles, Serika, young Mutta, Apo & Fuuka, and making them all sound distinctive. Sure, one of those is a pug but it's still impressive. The music is also pretty solid.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nWe really don't get any. There's not much romance in the series, and most of it that does appear is pretty under-stated, but all of it we do get is het.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nUchuu Kyoudai does suffer from some problems. The repeated scenes, random psychic bullshit and unfortunate stereotyping being the big ones. Still, it is an overall entertaining, compelling story. If you have an interest in space exploration from a fairly realistic perspective, you should definitely give it a try. If you're fond of slice of life works and think that following astronauts and their families would make for a good premise, you should also give it a go. My final rating is going to be a 7/10. Next week, I'll move on to the second series of Love Live.",

            "content": "Space Brothers is one of the greatest slice-of-life anime of all time and certainly one the most mature themed animated series that exist out there. To put it simply, this is a masterpiece!\r\nA compelling story about two brothers and their promise to become astronauts one day. An uplifting story full of inspiration to remind everyone what it means to live for an ideal, to persevere and to devote yourself to that ideal. What it means to be an astronaut, a friend and a brother. But above all, what it means to honour your promises, one of the few unchanging things and absolute pillars in one'slife! \\n\\n\r\nThis series is an endless source of inspiration, full of life lessons, profound teachings, presented in a genuine manner with the right amount of drama and comedy. It is a mature and realistic portrayal of the life of an astronaut candidate and the painstaking training and challenges he has to undergo before becoming an actual astronaut and be assigned to a mission.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is perfect: The protagonists are very likeable, but more importantly, each and every character introduced in the series is very well developed and plays a role in the plot. The music is absolutely fantastic and very memorable, it makes your mind travel and it beautifully enhances the intention of every scene. The animation is great and a lot of effort has been put into it to create unique scenes and environments to keep you visually pleased throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nDo not let the length of the show discourage you, this is a beautifully crafted masterpiece that you cannot miss. Each episode is a vital piece of the story and is filled with emotion. One of the very few series that has managed to bring tears of joy and bliss in my eyes. It will be appreciated even more by mature audience and people with a passion about astronauts and space. This is a story for adults who have not forgotten to keep alive their own inner child through the course of time and for children with big, untamed and daring dreams!",

            "content": "I've been a member of MAL for three years now.\r\nSince then I haven't done much of a forum crawling, post-making progress; generally I've been using MAL as a place to search for new titles, as, of course, most, if not all of us here, and I didn't contribute to the community around here much.\r\nSo, why would my first review be for Uchuu Kyoudai?\r\nThat question should, no, it must be answered.\r\nFirst of all, those of you who are still uncertain as to whether or not should you watch this series, you have to be made aware of what should you expect with Space Brothers.\r\nI could ofcourse compare it here to several different in both genre and plot settings animes or mangas, but that won't do - since Uchuu Kyoudai is a hidden gem that doesn't sparkle with flashy cliche invitation. It gives a different kind of vibe, which you can only feel when you're already watching it, and only then does that gem starts to shine - a feeling of mutual appreciation for both the viewer, and the anime itself.\\n\r\nWhile watching more and more episodes, you will start to wonder, how was it possible for this gem to be hidden away for so long from you, and in turn the anime itself will amaze you with how much more it has to offer right till the end.\\n\r\nThat is of course - if you're into something, that does not need unnecessary panty shots, overpowered main characters with \"the chosen one\" history to keep itself entertaining.\\n\\n\r\n(Not that the above is wrong. Nothing wrong with panty shots, or even overpowering, though, lately its been used so many times, that it's became the biggest clich\u00e9 of animes, ever.)\\n\\n\r\nAll of that aside, what is Uchuu Kyoudai, and what should you expect, beside for a promise of a good long show?\\n\\n\r\nThe anime emphasises heavily on the struggle of a grown 31 y.o. man, who has long lost his resolve to fulfill his childhood dreams, putting them aside as impossile to accomplish.\\n\r\nHave you ever looked up to the night sky, and pondered how great it would be to explore the universe, discover new possibilities, and breach what was previously thought impossible?\\n\r\nOur main hero, Namba Mutta - a rather undecisive and cowardly character, along with his younger brother, Hibito, sure did. Though, they have put their dreams in different words.\\n\\n\r\nAs kids, Mutta and Hibito both saw UFO, which, in that moment resulted in younger brother's promise, that one day he'd become an astronaut who would fly to the Moon.\\n\r\nMutta's belief, that \"the older brother must always be ahead of the younger,\" resulted in response, that if Hibito's going to the Moon, then he must reach for the Mars, thus making a promise between themselves, that they would both one day become astronauts.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, years later in 2025 it seemed as if only Hibito was able to fulfill that promise, leaving his older brother behind.\\n\\n\r\nUchuu Kyoudai follows Mutta, as he overcomes many different hardships, such as dozens of body-stress tests and interviews (and we all know, how hard job interviews can be, let alone an astronaut-job one!), and countless of other tests that a normal human being would ran off from.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a slice of life and a seinen type, this anime also heavily emphasises on the everyday lives of the other individuals, who also dream of becoming astronauts, which also puts Mutta in a situation, where his friends become the enemies. As well as focusing on the main character, you'll be shown the people who work behind the curtain - engineers who create all of the equipment used in space, old timers, who once walked on the Moon's surface, and became jet pilots, despaired drunks who can't get over deaths of their friends, and the crew of the control mission without which a mission wouldn't be possible to do.\\n\\n\r\nConstant tests, training, overcoming many obstacles, and rising above the normal people in psychical and mental strength, decision-making and multitasking are one of many traits that an astronaut must have - all of which is exactly and spot-on explained, and shown in a way not many animes can be proud of.\\n\r\nWith its accurate and realistic approach to how the future space program would look like, even for the people who don't swing into space opera-like genres, Uchuu Kyoudai is, most certainly not only the best anime in sci-fi so far, but also one of the best titles, though at the same time heavily underrated.\\n\\n\r\nSo, answering to the question as to why did I want to write a review for Uchuu Kyoudai, I'd say, that after 99 episodes of anime, 244 chapters (at the time of writing this), and a drama movie I feel that even though the anime ended well, I should show my appreciation for it with at least this review to show how much I'd like to see the continuation led to the finale.\\n\\n\r\nAs to my personal score, I think that you already know which number it'll be.\\n\r\n10/10, would watch ten more times.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Space Brothers is one of those shows that will stick with me for the rest of my life. Even if I never happen to re-watch the series, the vast amount of thoughtful analogies, metaphors and quotes throughout the show has left a lasting impression on my psyche. A positive one, if you must ask. A very positive one.\r\nFirst of all, before you begin watching this, you're going to want to know what you're getting yourself into. This is a pretty unique series, as far as anime goes. If you're expecting an epic space adventure, I'm afraid to say that you will be sadly disappointed, asit's a lot more down to Earth than that, no pun intended. Space Brothers is, in a nutshell, a story about never giving up hope, and always striving to achieve your dreams, no matter what life throws at you.\\n\\n\r\nIt may sound clich\u00e9, but it does it so very, very well, and in such a believable, realistic way that got me engrossed from the very first episode. The character development is superb, and it's one of the things this series really shines in.\\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist, Mutta Nanba, is such a great, well-written character, whom was extremely likable right from the first episode. So much so that I had to add him to my \"favourite characters\" panel after less than 10 episodes into the series.\\n\r\nThe thing that makes him so likable? He's flawed. Right from the beginning, we see that Mutta hasn't got it easy: He's behind his younger brother whose already become an astronaut, he's unemployed, he's somewhat shy and he's a tad bit eccentric.\\n\\n\r\nOf course it's not all gloom and doom, Nanba has just as many positive traits that make for a good, well-rounded character. Not least of which is how great of a big brother he is. Although some jealously is obviously displayed at times, Mutta genuinely seems proud of his younger brother's accomplishments, and supports him greatly right from the outset when we see the brothers as children. A lot of contemporary anime these days tend to feature a protagonist that is often already blessed right from the start. Be it a guy in a harem genre that has a million girls swarming over him for no obvious reason, or a character that is vastly more powerful than those that have been doing the same thing for a much longer time in a Shounen or action anime.\\n\r\nHaving a character already handicapped from the start is a breathe of fresh air, and it just makes Space Brothers feel all that more realistic and mature.\\n\\n\r\nMutta makes for a very relatable character. Regardless of your age and current life experiences, what Nanba goes through is something we can all sympathise with. We've all had those periods of feeling like we're behind in life, or feeling like we don't compare to our siblings or peers. We feel like we've failed in some kind of way, either to ourselves or to our family when we don't achieve the things we hoped to.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's where Space Brothers' shining message comes in: \"Never give up\"\\n\r\nWhat takes place after the first episode is a journey on a very inspiring tale that tells us that no matter how old we are, how behind we are or how many failures we've accumulated, you can still strive to achieve your goals. Speaking of which, one of my favourite quotes from the series is \"an earnest failure has meaning.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe training required to become an astronaut is presented in a very realistic way. This anime reaches a level of maturity that a lot of animated shows fail to. There isn't much you can fault on the setting or plot, and the characters we are introduced to as the series progresses are all about as well-written as Mutta. I can't really think of a single person in the series that I disliked or found annoying in any kind of way, which is somewhat rare for me.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps my only complaint is that some of the episodes feel like they drag on longer than is necessary. We're not talking boring, standard Shounen filler, but it does feel like this series could have been made shorter, if only they cut out a few unneeded scenes. The ending (which I won't spoil for you) also leaves on somewhat of an unsatisfactory note. Regardless, I had a lot of enjoyment watching this. The comedy was excellent, it had some very thoughtful and inspiring messages, and the cast of characters were incredibly likable. I don't think I've ever watched anything before that was quite so motivating. Ironically, sitting on my backside watching this, often inspired me to get off my backside and try to achieve those dreams I long thought were either lost, or just pipe dreams.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is also relatively slow, which may put off those looking for something more action-packed. But I'd recommend this to just about anyone. Even if astronauts aren't quite your thing, or you're into more the fast-paced, I'd suggest that you at least try out the first couple of episodes and see what you think. You may be pleasantly surprised. This is one of those shows that is so lovable, it's pretty much impossible to hate it, unless you're part-demon.",

            "content": "If you love the ero kappa Sanji, I think you will enjoy watching this a lot. \r\nI don't understand Japanese or speak it, but just from hearing a lot of recent voices, I sort of feel like they all sound the same. For me, it's not like they are not expressive enough or good enough. It's more like, they are all following the same norm. So occasionally, when a voice really pops out, it really makes me excited about the character. \r\nThis is the case with Space Brothers. I wouldn't normally watch this type of genre, but I do go for refreshing characters and stories.Space brothers is definitely refreshing. \\n\r\nThe story is relatively straighforward, basically about an older brother chasing after the dream he had in the past and a younger brother waiting for him at the end of that dream. It's not a kid's show though, because the main character is about 30 years old, so you are basically watching a middle aged man starting afresh. Does it sound boring? Yes it did for me at least when I first heard about this series.\\n\r\nBut surprisingly, the characters and even the story itself didn't bore me. The first surprise I got is hearing Sanji's voice. It made me really excited, especially because the voice is perfect for the character. His voice is so full of personality, and it's different from the recent voices I've been hearing. I can't explain well why.\\n\r\nAnother surprise is how exciting the story turned out to be. It's down to earth, not exaggerated, and not with a lot of twists and turns, but at the same time it can move you with it. There aren't a lot of stories that don't need any over the top characterization or beyond the limit theme to have it work. An encounter with a story that doesn't need those things but even can surpasses everything else to me is both an excitement and an honor. \\n",

            "content": "Uchuu Kyoudai, Space Brothers.. Where to begin.\r\nThe basic premise of the anime is simple. It tells of two brothers who had dreams of becoming astronauts as children. Whereas the younger brother has already made it, the older brother put aside his dream, thinking it unrealistic and only after some trouble at his work place and some encouragement from friends and family does he finally take his first steps to catching his little brother with the thoughts 'the older brother should always be one step ahead of the younger brother'. The anime follows the older brother Mutta as he sets out to try and become aastronaut alongside his little brother, as he meets interesting characters and faces many challenges along the way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are many anime that are considered 'slice of life'. But most of these are silly or just overly dramatic. Uchuu Kyoudai is the one anime I can actually call 'slice of life' as although it is dramatic, it is never overly done, and I could actually imagine this story having been true.\\n\\n\r\nSo an anime that is 'realistic' and follows somebody trying to work towards one of the hardest life goals a person could have, as they go through trials, interviews, success and failure. I can't imagine anyone who could say 'I enjoy work interviews', so surely an anime that has a focus on perhaps the biggest 'job interview' a person could have, without resorting to silly humour and jokes would be boring?\\n\\n\r\nWell I thought that would be the case, and only picked up this anime on a whim as it sounded interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever... boring is the last word I would use to describe this anime. It has been going on for over 50 episodes as I write this review, and I can honestly say I have never found it boring.. this anime is easily the biggest surprise of any I have watched, as by all logic I should find this sort of thing boring, as I usually tend to get bored by anything that does not have a lot of action or comedy to it.\\n\\n\r\nSo why do I enjoy this anime so much? It is hard to say really, but It has to bey all down to the writing. The story is written incredible well as are the characters. And the art and sound is also done brilliantly.\\n\\n\r\nThe basic story is simple, but is written in such a way that it grips you and makes you eager to know what is going to happen. Sometimes it may seem predictable, sometimes it is predictable but sometimes it may completely surprise you. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also somewhat 'simple'. Again this anime is rather realistic, as are its characters, so the characters do not really have any eccentric personality's, although some are perhaps a little strange. But that does not make them dull, the characters do not need to be silly or dramatic, they are well written, likeable and are very well developed. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough it is a fairly 'serious' anime, it has humour as well, a light humour that fits the characters perfectly, and allows the story to flow well without it getting silly or overly serious.\\n\\n\r\nThe excellent writing of both story and characters with excellent animation and sound. This anime is one of the best I have ever watched and I am very glad I took the whim to watch it. If you are unsure about watching this sort of anime, you should try watching the first few episodes and just see if you get sucked in, you may be presently surprised.",

            "content": "At first glance Space Brothers seems to be an anime about two brothers that just go space and do astronaut things, but oh ho, dear reader, it is so much more than that. It is a realistic journey delving into one of the most difficult professions ever conceived by man. Now that the series has concluded [for the time being], a proper review is in order. But first, we better shake hands.\r\nSTORY: \r\nSpace Brothers cleverly depicts the pursuits of Mutta and Hibito, converging their storylines at some times and following them separately at others. This structure is beneficial to the flow and progression, and earnstop marks from me. It also uses an intriguing method of linking the past to the present, showing the audience how the brothers' upbringing helps them with the challenges on the path toward fulfilling their dreams. \\n\\n\r\nThis leads me to the most notable aspect of Space Brothers \u2013 its insanely realistic plot. The amount of research that author Koyama Chuuya had to have done is mind-boggling. In fact, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) actually helped out on it, which is noticeable throughout. Plainly stated, you just can't make some of this stuff up! Which brings me to an important question potential viewers always ask: why is it so long?? It takes a lot of time and effort to become an astronaut, and it is quite clearly portrayed in this anime. To condense any of what is shown would be an insult to real astronauts. As a rare \"long seinen,\" I approve.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, it's difficult to NOT be impressed with immense detail that the mangaka put into the setting. For instance, whenever the main characters travel to the United States, American fans are simply blown away by the accuracy of the places illustrated, such as the John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida and the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Texas. Though I've never been to either of these locations, it almost feels like I've been on a virtual tour, just by watching an anime. \\n\\n\r\nThis leaves me with the literary brilliance of its themes. As is evident from the title, family plays an important role, and not just the Nanba family; though it is crucial to note that \"family\" is not limited by blood. Although this is a comedy [and it can be pretty funny at times], it is well balanced by its serious moments. Furthermore, this is an anime about going to space.. which is a very scary place where the consequences of failure are colossal. This anxiety gives the experience an even keener flavor. Of course it deals with moral issues and other difficulties in life as well. Sacrifice and the test of friendship is a prevalent theme as the journey to the top requires leaving many behind \u2013 not everyone can be a winner. The anime also tackles psychological and neurological hardships, in addition to exposing the stress put on the families of the astronauts. However, the theme that Space Brothers always comes back to is that hard work and guts [and a lot of luck] will always pay off, even if the immediate results appear unfavorable.\\n\\n\r\nART: \\n\r\nThough there isn't very much \"action\" in this anime, A-1 pictures does a great job in the animation department. Movements are fluid and expressions are believable, to say the least. In terms of art style, Space Brothers uses an interesting blend of intrinsic \"anime-ness\" along with the natural proportions and appearances of.. well.. real life. Something that caught my eye was the attention to heredity. Characters of the same family tended to look like each other and/or their parents, which is an uncommon trait in anime. It's a nice addition to the realism this seinen provides. Hair is also quite interesting. Each character's hair style/color stays within the bounds of reality while still remaining unique from other shows. Bonus points to Serika's hair for somehow making me smile every time she's on screen. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: \\n\r\nNow, I feel this is the weakest part of the show. Don't get me wrong, it's still good, just less so in comparison to its strengths. The music is used to enforce and empower the displayed emotions and elicit the intended feels from the viewer, but the anime reuses the same songs... over and over. I actually made it a game to see how many episodes it could go without playing the same \"feel this now\" song. I guess you get used to it after a while, but it is worth mentioning. The last third of the anime gets better at diversifying its music. The OPs and EDs are pretty good though, my favorite being ED5, \"BEYOND\" by Miho Fukuhara [yea, the same Fukuhara that did Brotherhood ED2].\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: \\n\r\nMy favorite part of this anime is the incredible characterization! Practically every character is memorable due to the depth in which each is described. Their motivations and actions logically follow the person that they've become. You can easily fall in love with any number of them, and palpably feel heartbroken if things don't go their way. Viewers with weaker hearts be wary, though I never cried myself, I acknowledge that much of the anime can bring you to tears. There are several instances in which a character's reactions and facial expressions deliver far more emotion than any amount of words could. This attribute alone makes Space Brothers stand out from other anime. Simply put, the entire cast is a rainbow of personality. I don't really want to go much further into detail.. that would ruin the magic!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: \\n\r\nThis is a great show, easily one of my favorites. Whenever I found myself in an anime rut, I just sat back and watched a couple episodes. Another thing that's worth noting is that the anime is very inspirational. Seeing Mutta go through so many tribulations gave me hope for my future, and that my efforts in the present will yield fruit down the road. Maybe that's just me though.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (TL;DR):\\n\r\nSpace Brothers is an excellently constructed anime that combines a heartwarming story with delightful comedy, using realistic characters to show the audience just how difficult it is to become an astronaut.\\n\\n\r\nOh yea, we can end that handshake now.\\n",

            "content": "\"An older brother must step ahead against his younger brother\" - Nanba Mutta.\r\nLately, i haven't found any good anime to watch.. then i meet Uchuu Kyoudai/Space Brother, at the first i was like oh just an average anime which have sci-fi and bla bla bla. since i didnt have any anime to watch, i thought i could try it for just one episode. and then seems like i had learned my lesson.\r\n\"Dont ever judge anime by its cover, genre, or anything else before you watched it\" - Me, after watching this.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSTORY\r\nThe story was simple, its about Nanba Mutta as the older brother who had promisedwith his younger brother, Nanba Hibito. to become an Astronaut together. But, then the life changes them. Now, Nanba Hibito is on training for becoming an astronaut and as for the older brother, he is just being fired from his company. And until then Mutta as the older brother have a motto that older brother must take a step ahead against his younger brother, luckily, there was an audition for becoming an astronaut. and so Mutta without hestitate sign for the audition.\\n\\n\r\nSimple? yeah... its kinda remembering me about Bakuman. and so, whats make this so special?\\n\r\nfirst of all, is the story itself. like bakuman does, the story was father kinda in slow paced. we're not just gonna see the Nanba Mutta struggle for being an astronaut, but we're gonna see too the flashback about him and her younger brother, boring? I dont think so, since all that flashback was really touching. You cant help to shed your tears (that was what i feel). Well, its not all about melancholic situation, Uchuu Kyodai have great jokes too. Usually when Nanba Mutta mumbling or speak with himself, he always comments on what he feel or what he see. It just feels so natural, you cant help to not to laugh when he does that.\\n\\n\r\nand not just that, the detail of the way they tells us about space, NASA, and the outer things was really perfect. when i watching this anime, i cant help myself to google some of the fact in this anime, like \"did you know that Moon's sand was so sharp as a shard of glass?\" and not just that, the details about space and NASA is really increasing our knowledge about it. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the character. what makes appeal me a lot was all of the character in space brother. i am not exaggerating. because in this anime, there isnt any bad guys with a weird reason to do something bad. they're just people like us, who do something for some reason, behind every act they made, they have a reason. I think thats the good point, since as far as i have seen, rarely any anime made this thing (act) so naturally. They're just doing by what they're believe.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what surprise me a lot was the each character have a scene to develop. either by flashback or by their experience. and its kinda lame to said that the story was so slow (because of the flashback), YES its slow but the slow itself because they want to the viewer knows \"what kind of character it is?\" and surely, to make us, being attracted by the character.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nThird, the art. i am not gonna said to much on this section. but, if you see it carefully, you will see why this anime was so appealing, like how many anime that have a male lead which have an afro hair? then, the draws for the character was well made, yet is so slice of life anime. Not excessive on the background coloring neither the character does. When usually some anime use so many gradient or shading in coloring to make more appealing but not in space brother, they make it simple but yet its charming. Its really the style of Sentai Filmworks\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe Last, Sound. honestly, when i heard the opening songs (especially the first OP, \"Feel so Moon\") i am really attached to it, not just attached it, i realize that the OP was really fit with the anime, its about outer space. not just the first OP, the other OP was really - really well made. Even i had to replay the OP, just for hear the song. The background song or BGM is also perfectly fit with every scenes that appears. Like when there was something amazing happen, \"Sora e No Michi\" songs plays and its really hyping up the atmosphere and makes the scenes twice more epic!\\n\\n\r\nNot just the OP and BGM, the seiyuu voice was really deserves an award. They really fits with each character that being voiced. especially when Nanba Mutta talking to himself or when he sighing about his life, its like they (the seiyuu) really put their feelings into it. Of course not just seiyuu for Nanba Mutta, but all the character.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nWhen everyone focus and talk about Shingeki no Kyojin or any anime that airing in that season, They forgot to bring this anime as topic to be discussed. Oh, poor you Space Brother. But well, honestly i am happy that not many people to know this anime. I can be a hipster! lol Anyway, this anime was still airing. until i write this review, the anime had just airing their 63 episodes but it has been on my top 5 anime,Yeah, so why i had to risk on my top anime place for this airing anime? as for me, its too early for judging anime if you havent watched the whole episodes, but who cares? this anime was awesome. and its enough reason for me to put this on my top anime.\\n\\n\r\nif you're looking for a motivational , then you might try this anime... and one message for me, CATCH YOUR DREAM!\\n\\n\r\n*Thanks for reading my review! If you found this review was not helpful or doesnt good enough,please message me. I really appreciate any feedbacks*",

            "content": "You are probably wondering why I gave this series a perfect 10 even though I've only seen 10 episodes so far...\r\nWell, simply put, everything about this anime feels very authentic. Real. There is no sense of false pretense. And above all, it gives off a very contagious sense of hope and optimism. A sense that your dreams ARE reachable, and that there is no such thing as bad luck; it's all about making your own luck. \r\nI'm sure everyone has had their share of disappointments and somewhere along the line, has felt bitter about the way their life turned out. I'm also sure that everyonehas had their share of dreams that had to be abandoned for one reason or another. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, don't let your cynicism taint your enjoyment of this hidden gem. As a matter of fact, let yourself be infected by the optimism of this show...\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the plot centers around two brothers, Mutta and Hibito, who have wanted to become astronauts since they were kids. However, Hibito, the younger of the two, was the one to actually make his dream come true, while Mutta leaves his dream behind to pursue a more reachable profession. After losing his long-time job and being blacklisted in that field, Mutta tries to pick himself back up by working small, part-time jobs. But with a huge amount of encouragement from his parents and especially Hibito, Mutta aims to become an astronaut again.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, the plot is basic and straightforward, but the entertainment lies in the characters and how they persist through the situations they're thrown in.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sake of not writing so much (lol), I'll just discuss the two brothers: Mutta and Hibito, although the entire cast is well-rounded and likable as well.\\n\\n\r\nTo start off, Mutta is a fantastic protagonist. He's highly sympathetic, hilarious in unexpected ways, completely honest, and so charismatic that you can't help but cheer him on. I honestly believe that his charisma largely comes from the way his voice actor, Hiroaki Hirata, performs the role with complete ease. It's so enjoyable and so natural that Mutta seems like a real person rather than some made-up character in some anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I enjoy most about Mutta's character is that he represents two sides: disappointment and hope. Many, many times during his journey to becoming an astronaut, Mutta loses faith in himself and says \"I give up, there's no way I can do this.\" (Something I'm sure everyone can relate to) However, like any other great protagonist, he holds an inner spark of hope that drives him to persist through the challenges that are thrown at him, in spite of what he says to himself. All in all, he is the reason why I believe this show is contagiously optimistic and hopeful. Mutta, despite being an adult who has experienced a fair amount of disappointment, still retains the optimistic enthusiasm of his younger self while taking steps in achieving his long-time dream.\\n\\n\r\nHis brother, Hibito, is equally great as a character. Although, he seems like a one-dimensional stereotype of the perfect younger brother, he gets his fair share of development that makes him much more. I personally think Hibito shines brightest as a character whenever he is interacting with his brother Mutta. There's a real sense of love and affection that is mutual on both ends. The frequent flashbacks of their childhood helps to illustrate this fact, as well as their present interactions. Also, as brothers, their natural rivalry with each other is what encourages them to do their best, rather than drive each other away. \\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship, which is at the center of this show, is one of the many refreshing things about this anime. Though their relationship is somewhat similar to that of Cain and Abel from the Bible, there is no hate involved. While Mutta is jealous of the success of his younger brother, he doesn't hate him for it. Instead, he's proud to have such a brother. If anything, as the older brother, he wishes that he wasn't so pitiful in comparison, in looks and in luck. \\n\\n\r\nThe humor is certainly another refreshing point of this anime. The opening sequence should quickly point out that the humor isn't mainstream, but at the same time, its charming because of how odd and unconventional it is at times. I also enjoy the fact that this anime likes to poke fun at everyday behavior.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and overall scene direction leaves me breathless. Its quality is reminescent of American films made in the 90's (at least to me...) so I often get fits of nostalgia while watching this anime lol. While I find the style appealing (especially the music), it does come across as cheesy so heads up!\\n\\n\r\nArt is highly debatable since it doesn't appeal to those who prefer more attractive designs. (Poor Mutta, he's probably the ugliest character in the show XD) However, in my opinion, the realistic character designs help ground this anime into a sense of reality, which helps me appreciate the real-life references that are thrown in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm obviously enjoying the heck out of this anime. Reason why I haven't watched any further is because, so far, there's only 17 episodes out and I need a back-up for whenever Hunter x Hunter goes on a break lol. (Although I feel like I'm going to cave in very soon...)\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I hope this review helped! \\n\\n\r\n(If not, constructive criticism is highly appreciated!)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Uchuu Kyoudai... well I have to day that this anime is one of those inspiring ones.\r\nI first started watching the first four episodes of this anime at AX (Anime Expo 2012) with no hopes for this anime but oh boy... I was proved wrong. Throughout my life I always watched shoujo, shounen, mecha, adventure etc. \r\nFrom the fact that I only considering watching those genres it came to my judgement when it I was watching Uchuu Kyoudai at AX.\r\nAs human beings, everybody\r\nDO NOT JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER! ~Lesson learned~ -.-\r\nUchuu Kyoudai (Space Brothers in English) was obviously not one of those animes thatwasn't involved with \"destruction of the world\" but it was about Mutta (protagonist) keeping his promise to his younger brother, Hibito, in becoming a astronaut like Hibito and go to Mars.\\n\\n\r\nStory/ Plot OVERALL: 10\\n\r\nThe story is really inspiring, and heart warming. The main protagonist, Mutta, is just a average man with talent that recognized in his profession as a car builder but later because of his boss insult to his younger brother, Hibito, Mutta now was living with his parents with no job. \\n\\n\r\nRealizing that he was jobless he sets out to find another job. Hearing from his parents what happen to Mutta, Hibito reached out to Mutta by suggesting that Mutta should keep his promise to his younger brother and enter the astronaut training program. With many fail attempts, Mutta finally take his brother's advice and sets out to the astronaut training program and this is when the story begins... \\n\\n\r\nCharacters OVERALL: 10\\n\r\nPerfect! There are various types of characters that you get to see in this anime.\\n\r\nA snotty genius, a quiet thinker, a bright positive leader, etc. Each character makes this anime quite fulfilling.\\n\\n\r\nEach character that Mutta meets has a big significance to the story and it gives that slight tingling feeling of curiosity whose going to achieve their goals. As Mutta met other characters in the story it gives him more motivation in passing the astronaut training program but as he meets more characters he, sometimes, doubts himself and ask himself \"Do I have what it takes to become a astronaut? Do I have the right to become an astronaut?\" as he goes along with the astronaut training program he becomes more determine and to realization that he wants this dream to become an reality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic/ Sound OVERALL: 10\\n\r\nIt is well done. The soundtracks plays a major role of the anime that gives the scenes the tension and passion that it needs! Well done!\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt OVERALL: 10\\n\r\nReasonable. I'm glad that this anime does not have any characters that has pink hair with green eyes or women with huge over-sized breasts. To be honest, I'm sick of it... get real.\\n\r\nI cannot explain what my thoughts are of this art. :)\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap this review:\\n\r\nI would like to say that so far (as the episodes will come) I am glad that my little sister dragged me to watch this anime at AX. It is very enjoyable and inspiring. I would highly recommend it to anyone.\\n\r\n It is a joy to watch!",

            "content": "This show is a hidden masterpiece. I have always managed to simply ignore it because of its length and seemingly mundane type setting. But during the summer vacation, I unearthed this anime from my long watching list. My reaction was 'Meh, why not?' When I watched the first episode I was completely mesmerized. \r\nYes, you will not find aliens and fantasy. You will not find some crazy sci-fi anime with lazer beams blasting out of gigantic humanoid robots. But you will find the passionate story of two brothers that aim to become astronauts/cosmonauts, one of realities most dangerous and strenuous professions. You will also findgreat comedy kicking at you for a few good laughs. (Comedy and sentimental moments are always at good timings without disturbing the flow of the show)\\n\\n\r\n10/10 Story\\n\r\nAs many people might have already said the story is about the life of siblings trying to go to space. It is a character based story so you will find that the anime follows mostly on the life of Nanba Mutta and his amusing and romantic encounters with others that have the same passion for space.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 Art\\n\r\nAlthough many may disagree, I wouldn't say this art was a down-side of the show. I thought the art style fit fairly well with its theme. However, I did notice that the art of a few characters were a bit unconventional. But art is largely personal preference, so don't let my tastes push you away.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 Sound\\n\r\nI never listen to classical music or orchestra, but I have always thought they fitted with anime the best. Almost all my favorite series or all-time masterpieces, like this one, have used classical music. This anime doesn't lose in sound to any of the masterpieces I have seen. Great music always follows the mood of great scenes.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 Character\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime were all amazing. Its very hard to express characters realistically in anime but this one has particularly done an outstanding job. The depth of major characters was just great. The background stories show the personal lives of all the main characters and how it entwines into their careers as astronauts or engineers. The mini-stories also added gravity to the the character's dedication. Everyone aiming to become an astronaut has a passion. But in order to fufill their ambitions, they will be tested, casting their values, skills and determiniation into the dangers of space.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 Enjoyment\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this anime with laughs, inspiration and good food.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 Overall\\n\r\nA hidden masterpiece.\\n",

            "content": "Nostalgia...\r\nAs older brother must always stay a few steps ahead of the younger one.\r\nThe younger now leads the older...\r\n----------------\r\nSTORY 9/10\r\n----------------\r\nUchuu Kyoudai (Space Brothers), originally a manga by Koyama Chuuya which won two manga awards as well as nominated for several more, revolves around the two Namba brothers Mutta (the older brother by 3 years born on a day of agony) and Hibito (the younger brother born on a day of glory) who both vow to become astronauts after encountering an UFO in their childhood. However, as time passed, the younger brother seemed to be the only one to achieve the goal as he becomes thefirst Japanese man to step foot on the moon, where as Mutta, the older brother, gets fired from his job and is black listed from his industry. After much reflection and some encouragement from Hibito, Mutta once again pursues his promise to Hibito and tries to pursue going to space. With some unexpected help from his parents and brother Mutta is accepted to a Japanese Astronaut training program by JAXX. The rest is up to Mutta, his luck, and his own will. Now it will be the younger brother leading the older.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I particularly like about the story thus far is the realism it takes, that the trials that Mutta encounters, can't be soley blamed on \"bad luck\" or being \"born on a bad date\" although the story makes that information available, it by no means takes the route of destiny, hence opening the anime to a much deeper discussion of personal attitude and ability. \\n\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nBrilliantly adapted into an anime produced by A-1 Pictures (Ano Hi Mita... , Ao no Exorcist, Kannagi, Gash Bell!, etc) and YTV (Cardcaptor Sakura, Detective Conan, etc) directed by veterans Watanabe Ayumu (Pretty much all the Doraemon's) and art director Kato Hiroshi (Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei!), the art takes a older look to it reminiscent of BECK. The character designs are rather untextured and less \"clean\" many of the modern series. \\n\\n\r\nThe older style of art, however, really brings out more nostalgic feelings. The only drawbacks, however, would be the art quality cannot match many newer series using similar art styles. \\n\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\r\n--------------\\n\r\nThe sound of the series again screams out nostalgic. Opening them \"Feel So Moon\" by Unicorn (a Japanese rock band formed in 1993) has a classical rock vibe that resounds with the older brother because Mutta was born in 1993. Again nostalgia. The ED theme \"This Wonderful World\" (\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u304d\u4e16\u754c Subarashiki Sekai) by Gira Mundo resonates more with the younger brother, being a more modern rock sounding track with a nice electronic beat. The two themes fit perfectly to sandwich the story of two brothers.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting featured veteran Hirata Hiroaki (Sanji from One Piece) as Mutta and newer voice Kenn (Jil from Druaga no Tou). The two voice actors compliment each other and their roles, as an older voice actor and a younger rising one. The voicing are done well and I can't say I have complaints as I don't have much to base my judgement on right now.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music, again nostalgic, features overtones by trumpets and retains a \"old school\" feel, if that makes any sense. However, I didn't quite particularly enjoy these sounds and so found them mediocre at best. Sorry to the music director. \\n\\n\r\n--------------------------\\n\r\nCHARACTER 8/10\\n\r\n--------------------------\\n\r\nThe characters introduced so far are few, featuring the brothers Mutta and Hibito, their parents, and several randoms (such as bosses can co-workers). However, only Mutta and his brother Hibito are really explored farther than just a few lines. \\n\\n\r\nMutta is in appearance far my ragged than his younger brother, with curly unruly hair and a unshaven face, he looks rather like a NEET than anything else. His character is portrayed as one who us more or less hopeless, rash and lacks boldness to \"step forward\" as he says himself. As the series hasn't progressed far enough, I'd have to say he didn't have enough depth yet and that potential in his development are huge.\\n\\n\r\nHibito is the younger brother who looks cleaner with a shorter hair cut, shaved face and cleaner brighter skin, looks like a professional or a ideal male protagonist in some Jousei drama. That being said, he contrasts his brother sharply and is has opportunities which his brother does not. He is portrayed as a hopeful, bold and caring young man almost everything the older brother \"should\" be. \\n\\n\r\nby now the 3rd episode, character developments are taking root primarily as we learn about Mutta. However I do hope to see the development of the younger brother aswell\\n\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 9/10\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this? Hell yes. Mainly because of how the story resounds with me, an underachieving older brother who is wasting away in university spending his nights writing anime reviews. Just kidding. \\n\\n\r\nBut jokes aside, I think the story is really well done and takes a very wholesome and realistic approach at the lives and circumstances of the two brothers. It hints at the ideas of destiny and fated good/bad luck. However, it merely mentions it so that viewer who see it that way can relate while it slowly shows reality of how the circumstances are products of individual choices and feelings, not of just \"luck\". Mutta was fired for head butting his boss, pretty real, not unlucky. Hibito became an astronaunt beause of his boldness and passion (as seen by his quick response as a child), real, not just luck.\\n\\n\r\nThe realism really proved to be refreshing after all of the unrealistic, having circumstances thrust upon and fixed animes I've been watching recently.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I liked is how I could feel the older brother's anguish as his pride was stepped on by having his younger brother surpass him and his parents shame him. He's not a wimp, rather, realistically like an adult man, he sheds a few tears in secret and doesn't say word about his pain. *resonating feelings\\n\\n\r\nMy only criticism would be that I feel like they didn't cover enough ground so far, that there are many other feelings that should be portrayed that are missed. And that they could have made Mutta's suffering even more relatable by delaying his tears.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nOVERALL 8/10\\n\r\n----------------------\\n\r\nOk so I know I've been pretty generous this whole review, but mainly because I think its a show worth watching and I want to encourage everyone to check it out. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story is sentimental and is adapted into a tangible form of nostalgia that makes you think. Utilizing the sounds and characters, Uchuu Kyodai really causes sympathies to run rampant and makes one reflect about their own usage of life so far.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd give it the 8/10 for its ability to convey a consistent atmosphere fitting of the series thus far and the brilliant choices of music, voice actors and animation styles to compliment the story and characters.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nExpect Updates After Each Episode, the plot section won't change very much but other sections might.\\n\\n\r\nCOMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS ARE ALWAYS WELCOME!\\n",

            "content": "With this review, I am hoping to attract attention to the highly underrated anime that is Space Brothers, or I should say, Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai. I can confidently rate this anime an easy 10/10. In the following paragraphs, I will go into detail and explain why. \r\nUch\u016b Ky\u014ddai is a Seinen, Slice of Life. That being said, it is almost suitable for all ages. In the beginning, the story itself is not so much original, but it is how the events play out with a wonderfully charming cast of characters, that makes this anime unique. I have a huge interest for astronomy, and I obviously loveanime and manga. So when I discovered Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai, it seemed too good to be true. It was my two main interests in one package, so I felt inclined to give it a try.  During the first episode I immediately liked it, and then only a couple of episodes later, I loved it. Now instead of talking about myself, I will go into the specifics of why I feel every anime and manga fan should give Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai a chance. Whether you have a strong, mild or even a zero interest in astronomy, this is a very enjoyable anime. There is no need to feel overwhelmed, as this anime does not attempt to drill astronomy facts into your brain. For the most part, this anime is very character driven, but I\u2019ll get to that in the next paragraph. I don\u2019t want to waste your time with a summary of the story plot as that can be easily seen above on the anime\u2019s page, so I\u2019ll just get straight to the analysis. I can guarantee that you will laugh while watching this anime. The main character, Nanba Mutta is hilarious. It\u2019s always a joy watching the new situations he finds himself in. In terms of comedy, the anime is written very cleverly. Better more is the fact that the show is very unpredictable. From what I thought would continue to be an easy going, funny series, at one particular point had me at the very edge of my seat in suspense. A bunch of very suspenseful episodes, out of nowhere, had just been thrown at me and I was in awe. And that is the beauty of Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai\u2019s storytelling. It successfully transcends from easy going comedy, to pure suspense, adding in some beautifully written touching scenes. I won\u2019t lie; Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai has made me shed a fair amount of man tears from time to time. Some of the scenes are so beautifully written, and I can\u2019t stress this point enough, as this is one of the story\u2019s biggest strengths. It becomes obvious I\u2019ve stumbled across an amazing series when I am presented with storytelling that makes me feel all kinds of different emotions. This is what I believe makes an anime, what I would consider a masterpiece. The simple fact that I know that Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai has what it takes to; make me smile, make me laugh, make me thrilled and make me cry. \\n\\n\r\nI will now move on to the characters. I absolutely love the main character, Nanba Mutta. In my opinion, he is the perfect main protagonist. He has quite a goofy appearance, which helps immensely in his ability to make you laugh. A very funny character, but also a very true character. I love when we hear his sarcastic or pessimistic thoughts because they are easily relatable, as he innocently reveals his many annoyances. Mutta also somehow knows the right thing to say to those around him, which helps him, and many of the side characters that he meets along his journey. When Mutta does this though, it doesn\u2019t feel forced but instead very natural. His voice actor, Hirata, Hiroaki, who has been in many different anime, fits the role perfectly and does an exceptional job. Mutta will certainly make you laugh many times, but most importantly, he\u2019ll make you fond of him within a heartbeat. Mutta\u2019s brother, Hibito, is more of a serious character. This suits the series well however, because when there are a bunch of episodes that mostly focus on him, the show itself shifts to a more serious nature. I find this to be clever because as an audience, we are more concerned with the events and struggles of what is happening, instead of relying on Hibito to say something funny. Both brothers are easy to love, though Mutta is more charming and entertaining as a whole. I won\u2019t go through the other characters in detail, as that would take up too much time; however I will say that there is very sufficient variety of characters and side characters to keep the show in order. Examples include; a very cute and innocent, but smart, love interest for Mutta. A very sincere, likable and hard working man. (Mutta\u2019s best friend.) A witty, confident and tough, but down to earth guy. (One of Mutta\u2019s colleagues.) And a couple of smartasses (I mean this in a positive way, as it adds great comedy to the series), who may seem annoying at first, but you easily, grow to love.  There are many more, but I\u2019ll leave that for you to discover after hopefully viewing this show. Something which is very well done in Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai is the depth that is explored in each character. There have been many times in which a character is introduced and due to the very detailed exploration of said character\u2019s past, a new feeling of care is now added to the audience. Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai is great with flashbacks because they aren\u2019t too long, they\u2019re informative, and most importantly, enjoyable. A great feature of Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai is the continuous flashbacks of Hibito and Mutta as children, which will then resume to the present and connect brilliantly to the story.  \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the quality of the art, Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai is quite impressive. I feel that A-1 Pictures have done a very nice job with the series, and the art is always beautifully presented. The art style of the series itself is very realistic, and I find this to be a nice breath of fresh air. Serika, one of the female main characters looks very life like, and this is a nice change as we all know that females in anime can very often look quite unnatural. One of the very few flaws of the series is the soundtrack. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think the soundtrack is great, and fits the mood of the series wonderfully. However, the problem I have is the limitation of the soundtrack. There are not very many themes at all; in fact, two of the most commonly played pieces of music can be heard in every episode. The soundtrack can become a little too repetitive and over played unfortunately. However, this is basically the only gripe I have with Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai. And this alone, is not nearly bad enough for me to feel obliged to deduct a point from the overall rating. \\n\\n\r\nI definitely feel like I could go on for much longer, though I don\u2019t want this review to seem too overwhelming in its length. Overall, I have made it obvious that I adore this series and will continue to watch until its finale. As of now, I have shown this anime to my sister, my cousin, and my best friend, all of whom find the series very enjoyable. Unfortunately not many of my friends are into anime and manga like I am. However, there\u2019s one thing that I will continue to do with anyone I meet in the future, with the same passion for anime and manga. I will certainly, without a moment\u2019s doubt or hesitation, recommend this gem that is Uch\u016b Ky\u014ddai.   \\n",

            "content": "Space brothers is about two brothers' journey to space. Its a feel good comedy about reigniting your passions in life and chasing dreams you thought were impossible.\r\nNamba Hibito is cool, carefree and about to become the first Japanese person on the moon while his older brother Mutta is down on his luck, having been fired from his job designing automobiles. He gave up on his dreams years ago but a little nudge from his little brother starts him on the journey to realise his childhood dream of joining his brother in space.\r\nSo first off this is not a show about adventures in space. There isof course some space travel but it is more of a character driven comedy that showcases a lot of training as well as the grueling selection process on the road to becoming an astronaut. But even though that may sound boring it does manage to keep interesting plots happening most of the time, and its a pretty funny show so I think that makes up for it. It has a bit of a lull around the 25 episode mark but if you keep going it ramps up again, it is a very fun series and will make you (in the words of the opening song) feel so good.\\n\\n\r\nSo as I mentioned this is a character driven show. There are a lot of great characters. I particularly enjoyed the cringeingly awesome parents, and Lowry the American Weeaboo astronaut who is always misusing Japanese phrases but the whole cast is pretty colourful. Our hero Mutta is a loserish 30 something year old with hidden talents. He is the perfect hero for people in their thirties (or late twenties like me) who want to start dreaming again. It is a bit more mature that a lot of the anime out there but still has those awesome Japanese elements I love like a celebration of lofty dreams and the determination and resolve to realise them.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art I felt like this wasn't a focus for the creators. The individual pictures are a bit more on the realistic side and while they mostly look ok on their own the animation itself is often stilted and awkward. After a while I stopped noticing it most of the time but every now and then there would be some really awkward movement, for example there is a particular dance scene that looks borderline creepy. But for the most part you are just watching simple animation and it does the job.\\n\\n\r\nOne negative thing I will say for this show is that although the ending is good it kind of ends in an unsatisfying place. The last episode was exciting and resolved stuff and didn't feel rushed, but you will see when you get there (if you watch it) that it doesn't end where you want it to end. I do sort of hope they start the anime again because even though I liked the ending there were some things I wanted to see happen.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is incredibly feel good. It has some more real moments but overall its the kind of show that is always a bit warm and fuzzy. They are basically a bunch of lovable space nerds fulfilling their dreams, and triumphing thanks to determination and hard work. So yeah if you are turned off by things that are too happy, or where things work out too well for the cast you might find that annoying. Personally I found it suspended disbelief really well. However it did have the unfortunate side effect of making me wish I was an astronaut. So be warned.",

            "content": "~Woyouuuu~ (Burusu Lee style!)\r\nI just picked up this anime by chance when my friend told me that the manga it was adapted from was really good, and was even considered for the Manga Taisho award. And boy, am I glad I listened to him.\r\nWe all have dreamed of being into space at one point; I won't believe anyone who claim otherwise. When I was a kid, I was really interested in (what have been) the nine planets, and my ever-growing speculation of possible existence of life in each of these. It was one of my childhood goals to see the Earth from outer space, alongwith my dreams of finally discovering my superpowers or discovering my magic abilities. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, the harsh reality struck the most of us around the time we hit puberty. We give up on dreaming big, on claiming to have seemingly unachievable goals and sharing it with others. By then most of us dream of having a stable family, a 9 to 5 job or starting a business; with having a doctorate degree or owning a multi-national company being the best of our \"realistic\" goals.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, Uchuu Kyoudai starts in a quixotic fashion (spoiler alert): \"two boys inspired of becoming astronauts just because they have seen a rice-bowl UFO? C'mooon..\" Because of that, I had the impression that this show would continue to have an unrealistic atmosphere, which would kinda turn me off. Good thing I was wrong; the show was as realistic as it could be. \\n\\n\r\nMy suppressed dreams of donning the white suit and doing the moonwalk in the Earth's only natural satellite came back to me, as the show placed itself very well in order to sympathize yourself with the characters, especially with Nanba Mutta, the main protagonist: Mu-chan starts out as a guy with above-average skills paired with some bad luck, which most of us would use as an excuse for our failures. Right from the start, the story served a dish of bad luck for Mutta, but with the help of his brother, that event had been a blessing in disguise. The way it started out really helped the viewers sympathize with Mu-chan, which made it easier to relate to him as he goes into higher grounds.\\n\\n\r\nRight then, I realized that the UFO the two brothers saw at the beginning can make do as a metaphor of our childhood dreams which feel like they're impossible to reach. However, one of the two brothers have reached it. The challenge is up to us, the other bro, to stand up and fight for our dreams - or let them haunt us with regret.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot seems like a good brew for a feel-good anime, but what makes Uchuu Kyoudai stand out is its suave execution of blending the storyline with some well-delivered comedy, usually resulting from Mu-chan's unconventional way of thinking. Even when things get too serious, you suddenly forget the conflicts for a while because of these moments.\\n\\n\r\nThough it has not finished yet, I'm really impressed by this show so far. This realistic take on achieving your dreams and making the most out of every day gives us encouragement to achieve whatever you may want to, and not giving up when you're presented with obstacles and hindrances. Uchuu Kyoudai is an anime apart from others, as it is not really a slice-of-life anime, but at the same time, is as realistic and \"down to the ground\" as a somewhat sci-fi story could get (unless you count the rice bowl-UFO and Japanese-speaking Americans :P).",

The story is unique, the characters have a ~quirky~ (I hate that word) sense of humor, and the themes (losing your job, feeling inadequate, reinventing yourself, sibling rivalry, doing what you love even if it's hard) are quite relatable and relevant given the world's current state. Readers of the manga will be happy to know that they followed it almost word for word. I found that the choice of voice actors was weird and I'm not really happy about that, but it's my only major complaint. The soundtrack is greatand the art is simplistic but vibrant. Overall, I would definitely recommend this anime and I can't wait to see where it goes as the season progresses.",

            "content": "This will be the very first review I have submitted to MyAnimeList, so I apologize if is not in keeping with the style you are accustomed to.\r\nLet me begin by stating that if in order for you to enjoy an anime it must contain action, giant robots, aliens, moe, magical girls or similar fantastical events, this is probably not the series for you. What you will find here is a story of how with sufficient determination, your dreams are within reach. \r\nThe plot thus far has been simply wonderful, with optimism and inspiration radiating from it in vast quantities. One such example of this isthe fact that the series is set in 2026. This means that in 2012, Mutta and Hibito would have been the same age as the average viewer, which is a subtle way to say that if you are sufficiently determined, you could plausibly become an astronaut by the same time as Hibito. I must admit that many tears were shed over the course of the series up to this point. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the OPs and EDs have been highly enjoyable (although \"Feel So Moon\" was the best in my opinion) and the soundtrack is one of the best I have heard since Angel Beats. It is performed by a full orchestra and adds tremendously to the emotional impact of numerous scenes. I will have to acquire it at some point. \\n\\n\r\nThe series has such a classic feel to it and the realistic animation style works to focus one's attention on the plot rather than watching the cute lolis (not to slight lolis, of course). All of these factors combine to make this my absolute favorite anime of the last couple of years, if not one of my all-time favorites. It will air for about 45 episodes and I highly recommend it to anybody looking for something unique.",

            "content": "-Summary-\r\nStory: 10\r\nArt: 9\r\nSound: 8\r\nCharacter: 10\r\nEnjoyment: 10\r\nOverall: 10\r\n-Details-\r\nStory: 10\r\nGenres: Drama, Seinen, Slice of Life, Sci-fi, Space\r\nAs far as slice of life anime go, the pacing of Space Brothers is slightly slower than average.  It has a continuous narrative, mostly told from the point of view of one of the two main characters/brothers.  The story is slightly non-linear in that there are many juxtapositions of the main characters' past and present experiences.  You get to see the main characters when they are about 12 or so and see how those experiences shaped who they are at the present, in their late 20's-early 30's.One of the only things that stuck out to me as negative was that almost every episode opens with one or two minutes of recap, even when it didn't seem necessary.  There were also a couple of recap episodes along the way.\\n\r\nThe story itself is mostly about the process of becoming an astronaut and the setting is earth/NASA for most of the story.  A major appeal of this story is seeing the \"behind the scenes\" aspects of becoming an astronaut, which is something you don't always see in stories about NASA and space.  The story seems very realistic and is very character driven.  There are moments of comedy and drama sprinkled throughout the story; both the comedy and drama elements are well done and work well.  Overall the story is simple and straightforward, and you can easily sit back and enjoy watching the main character work towards becoming an astronaut.\\n\r\nAnother aspect of this show is that it is set slightly in the future--the main part of the story takes place in the 2020's.  Thus there is a bit of a sci-fi element involved in predicting what kind of technology we will have at the time.  Overall I think the predictions seem very reasonable and it's actually very cool seeing stuff that we might actually have in the near future.\\n\r\nThe anime was catching up to the manga at the time it ended.  Rather than coming up with some alternate ending, the anime basically just stopped at a point that seemed reasonable to stop.  So the ending doesn't really wrap things up like a true ending; it seems like another season could potentially be tagged right onto the end of it in the future.  The ending doesn't seem like a negative aspect per se but it will leave you wanting more and hoping for more adaptation of the manga in the future.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nStudio: A-1 Pictures\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good and clean, and the style of rendering the characters is realistic.  Every character looks unique and is easily identifiable (even by their hair, which the series itself pokes fun at).  The quality is fairly consistent throughout the whole series; there are one or two arcs where it gets a little better during more dramatic parts of the series.  Overall I would say the art does what it needs to do in order to tell the story effectively.  It's not super amazing but it's not bad either.  It gets the job done.  The openings and endings look good as well.\\n\r\nThere are times when CGI is used for things like airplanes and rockets.  The CGI is done quite well and I think it works well when used and doesn't hinder the effectiveness of any specific scenes.\\n\r\nI've never been to NASA but many fans say the backgrounds are rendered very well and very realistically.  If you've been to NASA then you might feel like you're there again while watching this show.  Things like the rockets and space-suits also look really good.  Overall there really isn't anything bad about the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are pretty good--for many fans the first opening theme stands out as a favorite.  They capture the mood of the series pretty well.  \\n\r\nThe voice acting was well done and posed no problems.  The voices all work well for the realistic setting.  There are moments of comedy and when those occur the voice actors do a good job of making it funny as well.  There were no stand out negative performances.  I think the voice actor of the main character did a particularly good job, which is important for this show since he gets a ton of screen time.  I can still remember what he sounds like in my head, and I personally really like his voice.\\n\r\nSounds effects are good.  Nothing ever stuck out to me as out of place.  They are good enough to aid in the immersion factor.\\n\r\nThe mood of the OST fits with the show well.  There is some good slice of life music.  The show itself is also quite inspirational at times and the music usually reinforces that feeling quite well.  \\n\r\nThe OST didn't really have any stand out tracks that I would feel compelled to go listen to for fun.  But it's not like there was any terrible music either.  One thing which is pretty noticeable is that many of the tracks repeat quite a bit--I think there's even one piece which appears in nearly every episode.  This is something you will very likely notice especially if you tend to binge watch shows.  It's not a bad track so this isn't necessarily a negative, but I would have liked more variety.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is meant to be very realistic and the characters end up feeling like real people so that is a big plus.  There is no narrator except for recap moments/episodes.  Characters in this show are all in their mid 20's or older.  No high schools students.\\n\r\nGiven the name of the series it's not surprising that the two main brothers get the most screen time, and of those two the main character, Mutta, gets by far the most screen time.  This story is really all about Mutta trying to grow and become an astronaut while he chases his brother Hibito who is already an astronaut.  Mutta is a very likable guy.  He starts out a little depressed because he was recently fired from his job, but things start to turn around for him as he begins the process of becoming an astronaut.  You gradually learn more about him--why he's qualified to become an astronaut, what his personality is like--and you see him grow in confidence quite a bit.  His character development is realistic and you get to see him in all sorts of life situations, like at parties, at home, etc, so you get to learn a lot about him, and personally I got really attached to him and he is one of my favorites characters from anime.  I cheered for him every step of the way because he is a genuinely likable and good guy.\\n\r\nHibito is energetic but he also seems a little more reserved, so you don't get to know him as well as Mutta.  He is still a likable character though and, at least to me, he felt like a genuine little brother even though career-wise he would be Mutta's \"senpai\" so I think they got this balance down quite well.  Hibito gets two arcs in the spotlight and they are two of my favorite arcs for spoiler-y reasons, so I'll leave it at that.\\n\r\nAnother important character is the brothers' \"aunt\" Sharon, who isn't technically their aunt but is like a mother-figure to the boys.  She's a well-known astronomer and helped cultivate the boys' enthusiasm for space while they grew up.  It's very cool to see scenes from their past and present juxtaposed and how Sharon helped them grow into who they are.  Later on Sharon becomes more important to the actual plot of the story as well.\\n\r\nThe supporting cast includes the brothers' parents and mostly other astronauts.  There are many different personalities and they are all quite unique and stand out in my mind.  I remember most of them really well and fondly.  The diversity of the cast and the skill with which their personalities are crafted and developed are comparable to works of Naoki Urasawa if you happen to be familiar with those works.\\n\r\nThere isn't really a main antagonist either.  Sometimes there are higher-ups in NASA who potentially pose a threat to some astronauts' career advancement but there is no character that everyone is working against or anything.  Basically like real life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 / Overall: 10\\n\\n\r\nA big factor in enjoyment is whether or not you tend to like slice-of-life, highly character driven stories.  I do so I was all over this, especially since I really like space and science.  I think that anyone who can enjoy slice-of-life and has an interest in space or science would definitely like this show, since you get to see a lot of cool \"behind the scenes\" type things at NASA, as well as some cool space travel.  The cast of characters is pretty amazing and I enjoyed spending time with them.  This anime can also be inspirational and awe-inspiring, which I really appreciated and enjoyed for myself.  \\n\r\nI think that this series would be something a non-anime fan could enjoy, but only if they would be okay with something slice-of-life and slower paced.  I say this mostly because of how realistic the series is and that there is no anime weirdness and no fanservice, so it is quite accessible.\\n\r\nI'm not sure this show has the best re-watch value since it's so long and kind of slow paced.  I'm not sure if that will be my final verdict though since I haven't re-watched it yet.\\n\r\nI would definitely like to own this show at some point if I am ever able to do so, and overall it's a very memorable show.  Details of this show definitely stand out in my mind and left a positive impression on me.  Overall I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks this show sounds like something they've enjoyed before.",

            "content": "Uchuu Kyoudai is an ongoing, award winning manga from Koyama Chuya. From 2012 to 2014 it got an anime adaptation from A-1 pictures. It also had a live action film adaptation that was released shortly after the anime started. I don't really know what to expect from this one so let's dive right into it.\r\nStory:\r\nThe narrative opens in 2025, Nanba Hibito is poised to become the first Japanese astronaut to land on the moon. His older brother, Nanba Mutta, isn't doing so well. He recently lost his job when he head-butt his supervisor for insulting his little brother and he's moved back in with hisparents while looking for a new job. Oddly enough, places seem hesitant to hire a guy who head-butt his supervisor. While Mutta is struggling, his mother, under the advice of Hibito, sends his resume to Jaxa and he finds himself on the list to take the astronaut exam. If he can make it past several tests, he can fulfil his childhood dream of becoming an astronaut and, eventually, travelling to space.\\n\\n\r\nWhile that is a compelling premise for a slice of life work, Uchuu Kyoudai does have some narrative problems. The biggest one is definitely the filler. There's a pretty significant amount of time wasted reiterating information they've already given and most of the episodes waste a good thirty seconds with recaps. The series also has a couple of recap episodes, one right after the other. Altogether, that results in a good chunk of time getting wasted. It also hurts the pacing, since it slows things down. The series also inappropriately introduces pseudo-scientific elements. There's a portion where we're randomly introduced to a character who possesses the power to see the future. This isn't just some scam artist, like every person who claims that they can see the future in reality. In the context of the show, she actually can tell the future. Basically, the entire purpose of her having this power is to foreshadow something. There are much better ways to do that. Random psychic powers might work for some pieces of fiction, but they really, distractingly, don't work in a series like this that's heavily grounded in actual science. I will say, it's not a huge plot tumour since it's only used for a brief arc, but it still manages to hurt the series. There are also some unfortunate choices when it comes to the portrayal of black characters that can read as a bit racist. To be fair, none of them seem malicious or deliberate. It's more that it uses some really unfortunate stereotyping.\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, the story itself is really compelling and it has a lot of good moments, both dramatic and comedic. It also manages to constantly, and naturally, introduce new sources of tension. Normally, I would take issue with a series being set this close to present time, but Uchuu Kyoudai actually handles that aspect very well. Most of the technology they have is stuff we have already or slightly modified versions where the alterations are pretty plausible. There is a little bit of new technology that gets introduced and all of it seems pretty conceivable. There's nothing that you see introduced that makes you stop and question how they developed something like that in the near future. The humorous elements largely work pretty well and the blending of drama and humour is effectively done. Koyama knows when to be serious, when to inject a little bit of humour into a serious moment and how to transition from one mood to the other so as not to diminish either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, largely, well written. The major, and most of the side, characters get developed and fleshed out enough to have verisimilitude. A lot of them have humorous quirks, but they're not quirks that seem out of place or that get exaggerated to the point of being unbelievable. The interactions are also well handled. The friendship between Mutta and Kenji is pretty stellar. As is the dynamic \u2019twixt the brothers. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation are good. The series has a pretty massive cast of characters and they manage to make all of them look pretty distinctive. The backgrounds and various objects are nicely detailed and the animation is fluid. Really, my only issue is that the series does recycle a lot of scenes. It's almost certainly done to pad the story and not because the animators are lazy, but it still gets annoying seeing the same images time after time.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe performances are all well done. Kenn and Hirata Hiroaki give solid performances as the brothers. Sawashiro Miyuki is a boss in this, taking on multiple roles, Serika, young Mutta, Apo & Fuuka, and making them all sound distinctive. Sure, one of those is a pug but it's still impressive. The music is also pretty solid.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nWe really don't get any. There's not much romance in the series, and most of it that does appear is pretty under-stated, but all of it we do get is het.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nUchuu Kyoudai does suffer from some problems. The repeated scenes, random psychic bullshit and unfortunate stereotyping being the big ones. Still, it is an overall entertaining, compelling story. If you have an interest in space exploration from a fairly realistic perspective, you should definitely give it a try. If you're fond of slice of life works and think that following astronauts and their families would make for a good premise, you should also give it a go. My final rating is going to be a 7/10. Next week, I'll move on to the second series of Love Live.",

            "content": "Space Brothers is one of the greatest slice-of-life anime of all time and certainly one the most mature themed animated series that exist out there. To put it simply, this is a masterpiece!\r\nA compelling story about two brothers and their promise to become astronauts one day. An uplifting story full of inspiration to remind everyone what it means to live for an ideal, to persevere and to devote yourself to that ideal. What it means to be an astronaut, a friend and a brother. But above all, what it means to honour your promises, one of the few unchanging things and absolute pillars in one'slife! \\n\\n\r\nThis series is an endless source of inspiration, full of life lessons, profound teachings, presented in a genuine manner with the right amount of drama and comedy. It is a mature and realistic portrayal of the life of an astronaut candidate and the painstaking training and challenges he has to undergo before becoming an actual astronaut and be assigned to a mission.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is perfect: The protagonists are very likeable, but more importantly, each and every character introduced in the series is very well developed and plays a role in the plot. The music is absolutely fantastic and very memorable, it makes your mind travel and it beautifully enhances the intention of every scene. The animation is great and a lot of effort has been put into it to create unique scenes and environments to keep you visually pleased throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nDo not let the length of the show discourage you, this is a beautifully crafted masterpiece that you cannot miss. Each episode is a vital piece of the story and is filled with emotion. One of the very few series that has managed to bring tears of joy and bliss in my eyes. It will be appreciated even more by mature audience and people with a passion about astronauts and space. This is a story for adults who have not forgotten to keep alive their own inner child through the course of time and for children with big, untamed and daring dreams!",

            "content": "I've been a member of MAL for three years now.\r\nSince then I haven't done much of a forum crawling, post-making progress; generally I've been using MAL as a place to search for new titles, as, of course, most, if not all of us here, and I didn't contribute to the community around here much.\r\nSo, why would my first review be for Uchuu Kyoudai?\r\nThat question should, no, it must be answered.\r\nFirst of all, those of you who are still uncertain as to whether or not should you watch this series, you have to be made aware of what should you expect with Space Brothers.\r\nI could ofcourse compare it here to several different in both genre and plot settings animes or mangas, but that won't do - since Uchuu Kyoudai is a hidden gem that doesn't sparkle with flashy cliche invitation. It gives a different kind of vibe, which you can only feel when you're already watching it, and only then does that gem starts to shine - a feeling of mutual appreciation for both the viewer, and the anime itself.\\n\r\nWhile watching more and more episodes, you will start to wonder, how was it possible for this gem to be hidden away for so long from you, and in turn the anime itself will amaze you with how much more it has to offer right till the end.\\n\r\nThat is of course - if you're into something, that does not need unnecessary panty shots, overpowered main characters with \"the chosen one\" history to keep itself entertaining.\\n\\n\r\n(Not that the above is wrong. Nothing wrong with panty shots, or even overpowering, though, lately its been used so many times, that it's became the biggest clich\u00e9 of animes, ever.)\\n\\n\r\nAll of that aside, what is Uchuu Kyoudai, and what should you expect, beside for a promise of a good long show?\\n\\n\r\nThe anime emphasises heavily on the struggle of a grown 31 y.o. man, who has long lost his resolve to fulfill his childhood dreams, putting them aside as impossile to accomplish.\\n\r\nHave you ever looked up to the night sky, and pondered how great it would be to explore the universe, discover new possibilities, and breach what was previously thought impossible?\\n\r\nOur main hero, Namba Mutta - a rather undecisive and cowardly character, along with his younger brother, Hibito, sure did. Though, they have put their dreams in different words.\\n\\n\r\nAs kids, Mutta and Hibito both saw UFO, which, in that moment resulted in younger brother's promise, that one day he'd become an astronaut who would fly to the Moon.\\n\r\nMutta's belief, that \"the older brother must always be ahead of the younger,\" resulted in response, that if Hibito's going to the Moon, then he must reach for the Mars, thus making a promise between themselves, that they would both one day become astronauts.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, years later in 2025 it seemed as if only Hibito was able to fulfill that promise, leaving his older brother behind.\\n\\n\r\nUchuu Kyoudai follows Mutta, as he overcomes many different hardships, such as dozens of body-stress tests and interviews (and we all know, how hard job interviews can be, let alone an astronaut-job one!), and countless of other tests that a normal human being would ran off from.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a slice of life and a seinen type, this anime also heavily emphasises on the everyday lives of the other individuals, who also dream of becoming astronauts, which also puts Mutta in a situation, where his friends become the enemies. As well as focusing on the main character, you'll be shown the people who work behind the curtain - engineers who create all of the equipment used in space, old timers, who once walked on the Moon's surface, and became jet pilots, despaired drunks who can't get over deaths of their friends, and the crew of the control mission without which a mission wouldn't be possible to do.\\n\\n\r\nConstant tests, training, overcoming many obstacles, and rising above the normal people in psychical and mental strength, decision-making and multitasking are one of many traits that an astronaut must have - all of which is exactly and spot-on explained, and shown in a way not many animes can be proud of.\\n\r\nWith its accurate and realistic approach to how the future space program would look like, even for the people who don't swing into space opera-like genres, Uchuu Kyoudai is, most certainly not only the best anime in sci-fi so far, but also one of the best titles, though at the same time heavily underrated.\\n\\n\r\nSo, answering to the question as to why did I want to write a review for Uchuu Kyoudai, I'd say, that after 99 episodes of anime, 244 chapters (at the time of writing this), and a drama movie I feel that even though the anime ended well, I should show my appreciation for it with at least this review to show how much I'd like to see the continuation led to the finale.\\n\\n\r\nAs to my personal score, I think that you already know which number it'll be.\\n\r\n10/10, would watch ten more times.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Space Brothers is one of those shows that will stick with me for the rest of my life. Even if I never happen to re-watch the series, the vast amount of thoughtful analogies, metaphors and quotes throughout the show has left a lasting impression on my psyche. A positive one, if you must ask. A very positive one.\r\nFirst of all, before you begin watching this, you're going to want to know what you're getting yourself into. This is a pretty unique series, as far as anime goes. If you're expecting an epic space adventure, I'm afraid to say that you will be sadly disappointed, asit's a lot more down to Earth than that, no pun intended. Space Brothers is, in a nutshell, a story about never giving up hope, and always striving to achieve your dreams, no matter what life throws at you.\\n\\n\r\nIt may sound clich\u00e9, but it does it so very, very well, and in such a believable, realistic way that got me engrossed from the very first episode. The character development is superb, and it's one of the things this series really shines in.\\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist, Mutta Nanba, is such a great, well-written character, whom was extremely likable right from the first episode. So much so that I had to add him to my \"favourite characters\" panel after less than 10 episodes into the series.\\n\r\nThe thing that makes him so likable? He's flawed. Right from the beginning, we see that Mutta hasn't got it easy: He's behind his younger brother whose already become an astronaut, he's unemployed, he's somewhat shy and he's a tad bit eccentric.\\n\\n\r\nOf course it's not all gloom and doom, Nanba has just as many positive traits that make for a good, well-rounded character. Not least of which is how great of a big brother he is. Although some jealously is obviously displayed at times, Mutta genuinely seems proud of his younger brother's accomplishments, and supports him greatly right from the outset when we see the brothers as children. A lot of contemporary anime these days tend to feature a protagonist that is often already blessed right from the start. Be it a guy in a harem genre that has a million girls swarming over him for no obvious reason, or a character that is vastly more powerful than those that have been doing the same thing for a much longer time in a Shounen or action anime.\\n\r\nHaving a character already handicapped from the start is a breathe of fresh air, and it just makes Space Brothers feel all that more realistic and mature.\\n\\n\r\nMutta makes for a very relatable character. Regardless of your age and current life experiences, what Nanba goes through is something we can all sympathise with. We've all had those periods of feeling like we're behind in life, or feeling like we don't compare to our siblings or peers. We feel like we've failed in some kind of way, either to ourselves or to our family when we don't achieve the things we hoped to.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's where Space Brothers' shining message comes in: \"Never give up\"\\n\r\nWhat takes place after the first episode is a journey on a very inspiring tale that tells us that no matter how old we are, how behind we are or how many failures we've accumulated, you can still strive to achieve your goals. Speaking of which, one of my favourite quotes from the series is \"an earnest failure has meaning.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe training required to become an astronaut is presented in a very realistic way. This anime reaches a level of maturity that a lot of animated shows fail to. There isn't much you can fault on the setting or plot, and the characters we are introduced to as the series progresses are all about as well-written as Mutta. I can't really think of a single person in the series that I disliked or found annoying in any kind of way, which is somewhat rare for me.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps my only complaint is that some of the episodes feel like they drag on longer than is necessary. We're not talking boring, standard Shounen filler, but it does feel like this series could have been made shorter, if only they cut out a few unneeded scenes. The ending (which I won't spoil for you) also leaves on somewhat of an unsatisfactory note. Regardless, I had a lot of enjoyment watching this. The comedy was excellent, it had some very thoughtful and inspiring messages, and the cast of characters were incredibly likable. I don't think I've ever watched anything before that was quite so motivating. Ironically, sitting on my backside watching this, often inspired me to get off my backside and try to achieve those dreams I long thought were either lost, or just pipe dreams.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is also relatively slow, which may put off those looking for something more action-packed. But I'd recommend this to just about anyone. Even if astronauts aren't quite your thing, or you're into more the fast-paced, I'd suggest that you at least try out the first couple of episodes and see what you think. You may be pleasantly surprised. This is one of those shows that is so lovable, it's pretty much impossible to hate it, unless you're part-demon.",

            "content": "If you love the ero kappa Sanji, I think you will enjoy watching this a lot. \r\nI don't understand Japanese or speak it, but just from hearing a lot of recent voices, I sort of feel like they all sound the same. For me, it's not like they are not expressive enough or good enough. It's more like, they are all following the same norm. So occasionally, when a voice really pops out, it really makes me excited about the character. \r\nThis is the case with Space Brothers. I wouldn't normally watch this type of genre, but I do go for refreshing characters and stories.Space brothers is definitely refreshing. \\n\r\nThe story is relatively straighforward, basically about an older brother chasing after the dream he had in the past and a younger brother waiting for him at the end of that dream. It's not a kid's show though, because the main character is about 30 years old, so you are basically watching a middle aged man starting afresh. Does it sound boring? Yes it did for me at least when I first heard about this series.\\n\r\nBut surprisingly, the characters and even the story itself didn't bore me. The first surprise I got is hearing Sanji's voice. It made me really excited, especially because the voice is perfect for the character. His voice is so full of personality, and it's different from the recent voices I've been hearing. I can't explain well why.\\n\r\nAnother surprise is how exciting the story turned out to be. It's down to earth, not exaggerated, and not with a lot of twists and turns, but at the same time it can move you with it. There aren't a lot of stories that don't need any over the top characterization or beyond the limit theme to have it work. An encounter with a story that doesn't need those things but even can surpasses everything else to me is both an excitement and an honor. \\n",

            "content": "Uchuu Kyoudai, Space Brothers.. Where to begin.\r\nThe basic premise of the anime is simple. It tells of two brothers who had dreams of becoming astronauts as children. Whereas the younger brother has already made it, the older brother put aside his dream, thinking it unrealistic and only after some trouble at his work place and some encouragement from friends and family does he finally take his first steps to catching his little brother with the thoughts 'the older brother should always be one step ahead of the younger brother'. The anime follows the older brother Mutta as he sets out to try and become aastronaut alongside his little brother, as he meets interesting characters and faces many challenges along the way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are many anime that are considered 'slice of life'. But most of these are silly or just overly dramatic. Uchuu Kyoudai is the one anime I can actually call 'slice of life' as although it is dramatic, it is never overly done, and I could actually imagine this story having been true.\\n\\n\r\nSo an anime that is 'realistic' and follows somebody trying to work towards one of the hardest life goals a person could have, as they go through trials, interviews, success and failure. I can't imagine anyone who could say 'I enjoy work interviews', so surely an anime that has a focus on perhaps the biggest 'job interview' a person could have, without resorting to silly humour and jokes would be boring?\\n\\n\r\nWell I thought that would be the case, and only picked up this anime on a whim as it sounded interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever... boring is the last word I would use to describe this anime. It has been going on for over 50 episodes as I write this review, and I can honestly say I have never found it boring.. this anime is easily the biggest surprise of any I have watched, as by all logic I should find this sort of thing boring, as I usually tend to get bored by anything that does not have a lot of action or comedy to it.\\n\\n\r\nSo why do I enjoy this anime so much? It is hard to say really, but It has to bey all down to the writing. The story is written incredible well as are the characters. And the art and sound is also done brilliantly.\\n\\n\r\nThe basic story is simple, but is written in such a way that it grips you and makes you eager to know what is going to happen. Sometimes it may seem predictable, sometimes it is predictable but sometimes it may completely surprise you. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also somewhat 'simple'. Again this anime is rather realistic, as are its characters, so the characters do not really have any eccentric personality's, although some are perhaps a little strange. But that does not make them dull, the characters do not need to be silly or dramatic, they are well written, likeable and are very well developed. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough it is a fairly 'serious' anime, it has humour as well, a light humour that fits the characters perfectly, and allows the story to flow well without it getting silly or overly serious.\\n\\n\r\nThe excellent writing of both story and characters with excellent animation and sound. This anime is one of the best I have ever watched and I am very glad I took the whim to watch it. If you are unsure about watching this sort of anime, you should try watching the first few episodes and just see if you get sucked in, you may be presently surprised.",

            "content": "Contains minor structural and narrative spoilers; All links used are for educational purpose.\r\nThe main-error of Uchuu Kyoudai is its state of inconclusion.\r\nThis series is a journey through the life of two brothers who are much different in appearance but share the same yearning for space, and the fascination for space shared by many. \r\nIt features a plot derived from contrived storytelling, accurate implementation of nonfictional science (or extrapolating from current technology), and realistic development. If that were all, then it would be unconventional on these merits alone.\r\nUchuu Kyoudai does not rest on a premise of realism, detailed accuracy, and logical progression. It delivers in executionand manages to wave a mundane journey filled with droughts together with lighthearted comedy. The comedy brims with variety. It features everything from referential comedy to Buster Keatonesquece physical comedy. Most of it is well-executed with its highs being the observational comedy and its lows being the running gags in multiple arcs.\\n\r\nArcs are handled carefully and offer enough room to build and reduce the suspension to flow into a coherent style. The pacing throughout the story is phenomenal.\\n\\n\r\nGood pacing serves its narrative. \\n\r\nAction, as a genre, is conveyed through quick cuts and few descriptions. The merit is a tempo that serves movement and builds excitement. \\n\r\nLife is not goal-orientated it always focuses on the very next step/stage. Dreams are ideas that inspire us to move in a particular direction. Sometimes this results in storylines being out of focus.\\n\\n\r\nThe impact that out of focus storylines have in the world emphasises on the living world that continues to move without the main cast. Main characters change things in the world, but they aren't the centre of the universe. Side characters have, at times, a more predominant influence on current events. This treatment, however, doesn't take away from the stakes and importance of the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe diverse cast of well over 50 characters sparks with interactions, with most of them having some level of backstory and character development. Their fears and motivations make sense and are consistent with their actions. Every further explored character has some character-flaws and comes off as relatable. Character development and events have sequential consequences.\\n\\n\r\nThe conflicts are relatable and never forced. From not meeting expectations to death of loved ones, it covers the full plethora of conflicts and ties them into an ever progressing overarching narrative. Topics like age-gap romance, anxiety and terminal disease are explored in various arcs and handled with appropriate respect and care.\\n\\n\r\nThe immense craftsmanship that it put into the arrangement of the story, what Aristotle would call mythos, and details of contraption construction (supervised by NASA and JAXA), has very few contenders. \\n\\n\r\nThe character design is simple and distinctive, albeit slightly cartoonish to emphasis. Colour palettes amplify the lighthearted aspect without interfering in dramatic moments. The realistic object design and reconstruction of real places stand out and further support the grounded nature of the series.\\n\r\nThe animation is functional and serves the atmosphere. There are very few exceptional scenes, most of them include the launch of spacecraft, other moving objects or a situation of grave peril.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting and sound design are stellar. Hiroaki Hirata as Mutta delivers goofy comedy antics and drama with seemingly effortless elegance. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTwBfMGsfR0 from episode 25 is one of my favourite snippets, showcasing Hiroaki's abilities. The rest of the cast does a good, up to a fantastic job.\\n\r\nJapanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide provided his voice in the 31st episode, recorded and performed from space. Multiple engine sounds and launch sounds were recorded at Tanegashima Space Center, improving viewer immersion.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes change with each course. Most of them are either referential or lighthearted and inspiring - fitting the overall mood of the series without being exceptional for the majority. All of them highlight either interaction or separation of the main cast and their current attitude towards their dream. The one exceptional outliner is the first opening \"Feel So Moon\" which also has a great music video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcNcYk-qYtc\\n\r\nThe soundtrack itself is good but lacks any innovation at all. It has tried and tested music, traced in the style of major movie productions.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc of Uchuu Kyoudai is a character and motivation introduction. It deals with Mutta's reaffirmation of his dreams and introduces one of his main struggles - with anxiety and the fear of failure/meeting expectations.\\n\r\nThe second arc of Uchuu Kyoudai is a realistic journey through the first two of JAXA's three astronaut-tests. Many characters get introduced, we learn about their dreams, fears, and motivations. Backstories and character development tie in the daily task and hurdles set by JAXA. The answer to the appeal and benefit of space-travel appear naturally woven into JAXA's testing. We see a variety of differently motivated answers, ranging from altruistic to self-interested.\\n\\n\r\nAt the start line of the journey, nothing gets decided yet. Mutta deals with job hunting and pressure due to his family. An adventure story would likely streamline this, but for a slice of life story, it is imperative.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to spoil further story arcs. Go ahead and experience what the series has to offer!",

The story of uchuu kyoudai is very realistic,no friendship power, no shitty things like that (says the shonen fan haha). The pace is also very good,the flashbacks are well used. The drama also is flawless and is neither overused or underused.However the only minor problem that I found is the comedy , it's rare and it's not well used. a solid 9/10 for the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : the characters are the strong point of the show, neither character is useless, and almost every important character is well developed, from the main ines like Mutta and Hibito to the supporting ones like Sharon Kenji.. Another good point in the characters is the connection between them. a 10/10 for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt : Good art and good animation.9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound : Very good openings and endings and voice acting however I don't remember some catchy ost so it's an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : I enjoyed this show a lot, it's not the kind of show that will make you finish it in 3 days but it's like an addiction every day I watch about 3 days and it's really relaxing. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall : (The story,the characters and the enjoyment have a coefficient of 2 while the sound and the art have a coefficient of 1 ) the overall score is 9.37 so It's a 9 for a show that I recommand to watch.",

Being a shounen series with such an optimistic promise between the brothers, you would think this would spin an idealistic take on the two working together to get what they want. However, the series doesn't go this route as the title's first half is mostly focused on Mutta struggling through the evaluation and training stages to bean astronaut, with the second half focusing on Mutta working to get in a position where he could finally earn the right to have a mission while Hibito gets focus on overcoming a panic disorder he sustained during a mission that has effectively sidelined him from future NASA missions.\\n\\n\r\nThe series has a rather large cast consisting of those part of Hibito and Nanba's personal life, other trainees, instructors, and JAXA and NASA staff. Many of these characters get a good amount of fleshing out for one to know of their backgrounds and what led them to making the decisions that got them their positions with JAXA or NASA, even at possible risk of their lives if they are astronauts. Plus for the most part, the series does believably explore the challenges and preparations that have to be made in training as an astronaut and accounting for all possible scenarios for a mission involving equipment and any hazardous conditions in space. The series takes place in a near-future setting and does believably incorporate future developments that are being considered by NASA such as decommissioning the International Space Station and setting up a research center on the moon.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn't to say this baby's all perfect with what it offers, with some elements to its storytelling being a double-edged sword. While the slow pacing of the series allows decent buildup of suspenseful moments involving the cast and allowing one to take in developments explored with the cast, it does lead events to drag at points (particularly during one of the stages in Nanba's evaluation and on Hibito's moon mission) and there are a few episodes straight of recap episodes during the middle of the show's run. While the comedy helps to lighten the mood of the title's more serious moments, I found its delivery to be hit or miss at many points of the show which mostly consisted of odd quirks and mannerisms with Nanba and others. Some other general issues I had with the show included some plot developments seeming a bit too convenient to occur and the series lacking a proper ending as a number of lingering plot developments involving the characters of the series are left hanging.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the presentation for the series is decent for what it offers sporting vivid scenery shots and a good amount of diversity in the character designs drawn that sport a decent amount of visual detail. CG animation is used in the rendering of rockets, space stations and other manned devices used by astronauts which do stick out quite prominently from the regular animation and animation shortcuts are employed quite often with still shots and resorting to reused scene shots to conserve on animation budget.\\n\\n\r\nDespite what issues I do have to express though, Space Brothers is still a decent watch in its focus on Hibito and Mutta dealing with their issues in aiming to be or making sure they can still be astronauts. With a good amount of depth on its large cast and mostly believable exploration of the technologies and preparations employed for space exploration, this is worth a watch provided you are willing to commit to it for a long haul with its 99 episode length.",

I enjoyed every single moment of this show and I loved the fact that characters are very real, you don't need tons of action that most animes have, but a simply story of 2 brothers that share the same dream: to become astronauts. I liked Mutta for the very first time, his personality is amazing, he has not the same luck of his brother Hibito, his life sucks at the beginning of the story, he was fired of his job by that headbutt hahaha,defending the pride of his brother, I like the fact that he is a very good brother, he is not envious of Hibito's achievements and he always helps his brother when he needs it, Hibito by the other hand is a successful man, he really gets all  what he proposes, he is always cheering up Mutta to make his dreams real. A beautiful story of 2 brothers fighting hard to achieve their life's goals.",

            "content": "This series is simply phenomenal.  The season it first began, I took a pass on it, because the synopsis sounded too envy-driven to me.  Boy was I wrong.  If you are in the need of anything uplifting (which everyone could use more of) this is such a perfect anime.  The only negative thing I have to say about it is the fact that the story hasn't finished.  Because of the slow pace of the manga, the show stopped at 99 episodes until they build up a good amount of content to cover from the manga.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe premise sounds potentially dull,but nothing will inspire you more than the drive of these characters to become astronauts.  This isn't some super futuristic space odyssey that we're all used to seeing in anime.  This is set less than 20 years in the future.  Technology has advanced in minimal ways.  They're probably on the iPhone 13 by this point.  This is something I am amazed by as far as writing is concerned.  The technological ideas aren't so futuristic sci-fi that we simply accept them.  These are technologies that we are introduced to, and can truly believe are feasible within the next decade or so.  The setting is so entirely immersive because of this.  It's simply real.  You'll find yourself so connected to the story of these characters.  You'll just be on the edge of your seat all the time.  But in an excited, rather than anxious, way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nI don't have a great deal to say on the art of this show.  It looks good, and many of the unique illustrations of space are exciting.  Comedic moments are done well.  Nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you've ever heard someone say that the music makes the movie, I feel that resonates well with this show.  The orchestral themes really pluck your heartstrings, and you'll feel like you're watching an entire show with John Williams on staff.  Brilliant!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nIt's absolutely imperative for a longer show like this to have a protagonist that your audience can connect with.  That especially goes for a show that doesn't revolve around powers and fighting. Sure, Naruto might be likeable, but nobody would give a crap if he wasn't this super powerful ninja.\\n\\n\r\nMutta is everything you want.  He's your drama and your comedy.  He's brilliant, but in a way that I feel he could be my best friend.  The supporting cast is equally impressive, but if you don't love Mutta, you might not have a soul.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI think it's pretty freakin' clear I love this show.  Certainly one of my top 10 anime picks.  Watch this anime!",

I couldn't have been happier with my decision. In my honest opinion this anime is absolutely outstanding. Everything from the character structure, plot, animation, music, the feeling and everything in between is extremely well done.\r\nThis is the only anime I have ever watched that gives me an undescribable feeling not only when I am watching it, but reflecting on past episodes and events. This show, much like the first opening theme, willmake you \"Feel So Moon\"\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Nanba Mutta is probably the coolest anime character I have ever come across. I think one of the things that makes him so awesome could be said about this anime as a whole. It really shines because there are no outlandish super powers, no over the top slice of life that has almost become cliched over the years. It's just a show about normal people and their job and passion. Awesome show overall. Hopefully I have convinced someone to check it out, but as the people who have already seen are well aware; this is definitely worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nCheers!",

It is not merely a story of an older sibling having fallen behind, but is much more intriguing. The challenges of realising your dream, working hard to achieve it, finally fulfilling it, and even some of the difficulties that arise for you to sustain it, all of these are beautifully depicted in this anime. Sure, it is almost 100 episodes long; but, by the end of the anime, you would merely treat it as another number.\r\nStunning visuals and voice acting are probably the best aspects of thisanime; you can completely understand the emotions in dialogue. The characters are a joy to watch, and the story itself is decently paced and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIf you do decide to give this a watch, you will not be disappointed. I honestly hope there's a continuation, as there are several things that can still be explored with the series.",

            "content": "An unwavering dream can be like a mountain, as steep and as long as the journey might be, reaching top is never impossible. Uchuu Kyoudai proves that nothing is ever too late when it comes to following your dreams. \r\nSTORY\r\nThe story is not very complicated. It's about two brothers: big brother Namba Muuta and little bro Namba Hibito and their childhood promise of becoming Astronauts and going to the moon together. However, this dream of theirs took a detour. Although Hibito stayed on track and became an astronaut, his brother Muuta didn't and was just fired from his company. Like the saying when one doorclose and another open, an audition for new astronauts reached him just after his termination. With little hesitation, he signed up to once again try his dream. \\n\\n\r\nThe story might sound so simple but it's far more deeper than many others I've seen. The story is not fast-paced like others but rather, it gives opportunity for the viewers to enjoy every little moments of the story. Moments that makes Uchuu Kyoudai such a great anime. Rather than being annoyed of the speed of the story, I realized that this is the reason why Uchuu Kyoudai is amazing. Opportunities of learning about the colorful characters are always given and because of this, the story makes a more powerful impact to the viewers. Although there are solemn moments, there are many more comedic scenes that keeps the mood of the story light and fun. Especially, the main protagonist Namaba Munta. His soliloquies bring such life to the story. Furthermore, accurate real life details about NASA and the space increase the breathtaking and thrilling moments of the show.  There are so much details throughout the show that just make you like space even if you don't. This anime is so informative as much as enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nUchuu Kyoudai has a lot of characters with different personalities and because of them, the show is such a joy to watch. They might not have jaw dropping transformations into robotic superheroes or mind-boggling abilities that defies the law of the Universe, each one of them still stand out. The thing that made a big impact to me is the way they act like us. Normal people. Although there might be a slight difference, they think the same, act the same, and live their lives the same way as us. They strive, fight, and push forward for their dreams. The way they are put together is so amazing that you can't help but give the creators props. Because of this, I find myself imagining them as people that I know and everytime I do this, I understand them better. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, most of the characters, even the supporting ones, have some sort of flashback or a scene for viewers to understand their history and what makes them tick. These scenes are always the defining moments of the show where you get to learn more and you might even find yourself changing your opinion about them. Because of these flashbacks and \"special\" scenes, the people that I use to dislike became people that I understand. I can easily say that there's no character in this show that I dislike. That's how awesome this show is. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nIf I can describe the sound for this anime in one word, it would be: EPIC! Seriously, the sound of this show is so great. I always watch the OPs and EDs of this show and no matter how many times I've seen it, I still watch it. It's so catchy and enjoyable. Putting this together with the art animation and it's just a masterpiece. Same goes for the background music. They're place just in the appropriate time to make the audience feel emotions that they wanted to feel. I couldn't talk about sound without talking about the Seiyuus. The wonderful and amazing voice actors. They bring such life to the character that any emotions they want to invoke from the viewers surface. They're fantastic. \\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nI don't have a lot of things to say about the art of this show. All I can say is that it's beautiful and it wouldn't make you curse the creators for not making a clearer and better anime. Nothing is overly colored and the background is not excessively made. Unlike other anime that bathe your eyes with rainbows and fountains of colors, Uchuu Kyoudai stayed true to its charming and vibrant nature which I find appealing.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION    \\n\r\n\"Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve\" --- Napoleon Hill\\n\\n\r\nThis anime, in the span of the two days that I've seen all of its 78 episodes, easily made it to my top 5 favorite animes. This show just proves that looks can be deceiving. I feel bad about it because instead of this great showing being under the spotlight, many overrated and exaggerated shows are being notice. Anyway, this show is cool and awesome. Two words I don't just say easily to anything. \\n\\n\r\nUchuu Kyoudai gives you the feeling that even you, if you pursue it, you can achieve your dream. Nothing can stop you as long as you want it. There are indeed many hardships along the way but with belief to the power of your dreams, you will get there. Nothing is too late and never is not real.Take a breath, step forward and just like the Namba brothers, reach out for the moon. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review. If you have any questions or issues about it, message me and we'll sort it out. \\n",

            "content": "Don't let the sweet tag of \"seinen\" fool you, this is a shounen anime. A shounen anime that masquerades as a serious space drama, but follows the same pattern of conflict creation and resolution as Naruto. \r\nIt's kind of an exaggeration to say it's a shounen anime, 95 of the 99 episodes are shouen. There's a four episode stretch somewhere in the middle where they are actually in space, along with a few one minute segments spread out across fifteen or so episodes. Those are (aside from one well paced scene) the best part of the series. Those one minute segments are a sci-fi sliceof life that I'd love to see elaborated into a full series, and that four episode stretch is a genuinely absorbing conflict about survival in an unforgiving environment. \\n\\n\r\nBasically everything aside from that is mediocre garbage. The conflict and resolution pattern is something difficult to explain, so I won't, but it's really worth noting that basically every episode ends on a cliffhanger. Cliffhangers, are a good way to keep the viewer watching, but a bad way to pace a conflict. It's a sacrifice of quality for audience retention. This makes any potentially good moment fall completely flat.\\n\\n\r\nPartway through I started playing minecraft while I watch this series in the background, because the alternative was to drop it and frankly there's no way I'd come back if I drop it. Since I've come that far I didn't want to just abandon my efforts. That said, I really can't imagine how anyone could bear to watch this if they didn't do so. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending of this series is an \"end in the middle\" kind of deal, and I normally prefer that to an incomplete and rushed ending (I'm looking at you Happy Sugar Life) but Uchuu Kyoudai is really the type of series that needs a conclusion, if only to grant us more spacey goodness.",

            "content": "Everyone wanted to be an astronaut someday, that must be the reason they are so praised in our hero-lacking world.\nIn SB we don't have the super powered hero, a beautiful damsel in distress or whatever stereotype we may find in all shows we have nowadays. We have people, complete pessimists, total optimists, worrywart ones and let-it-go ones as well. Each one sometimes strong, sometimes weak. That's what makes SB really appealing as an slice-of-life, its characters.\nSTORY: Someone famous in our world history said once: \"I have a dream\". Someday, whether we were kids or gramps, we all could answer this quote with \"Yeah, me too,I wanna be an astronaut!!!\". When a kid, Nanba Mutta wanted to be one, but society had other plans for him and, watching his dream gets farther away while his little brother, Hibito, gets closer to be the first Japanese to step in the moon. His own brother helps Mutta get closer to his dream, and with lots of sweat and tears, Mutta gets accepted into NASA.\\n\\n\nAnyone reading this must be thinking \"ok, another shounen-like anime\". You might be right, but as I said, this is not your stereotypical anime, this is one of a kind. What makes this unique is the fidelity it shows...the real life. Mutta is skilled, but skill don't get you anywhere if you are not putting your all into it. He's a pessimist, and almost always look into what he done with bad eyes, while always looking to other ones as \"people more apt than me\". But he doesn't give up, he keeps trying to get closer to his ideal, the moon (or Mars, as he said in the beginning). If there is any bad thing I can say to the story is that it is slow paced, but all long-term animes are like this. I don't know if the anime follows the manga, for the story sometimes really stops, gives the \"filler looks\" into it. But most of it is well told, and it couldn't finish in a better spot for a sequel, that I'm looking forward to.\\n\\n\nART: Not that much can be said about art, except that a well drawn anime episode cost tons of money, a 24 eps series cost TONS of money. 99 eps? The only thing I can say is that it was well done when it should be, but lacked when it could, flawless in its own flawed way, beautiful huh? But I can give some good points for the opening and ending sequences, mostly all of them were quite well drawn.\\n\\n\nSOUND: The openings were awesome, I had some doubts about the show when I first looked into it, but that \"Feel so mooooon\" cast all doubts aside. That was the first time I cried watching an Op (remember that I have a dream stuff? It got me in that spot). If the first Op was awesome, the others that came after weren't any way worse, they did a great job keeping the \"I wanna  go to the moon\" feels, and the ending sequences also gave the vibe of what this anime would be. Not a show for space zealots with lots of space stuff, but for real people fans that like real people stuff (nothing against space zealots, please keep your asteroids in your belts).\\n\\n\nSB must be quite hard for a seiyuu, 99 eps for starters, and all characters had \\n\nquite the screen time. If it couldn't get harder, SB had humor, drama, sadness, happiness, anger and everything else. Anyone can scream stuff like a shounen anime, but a sad whisper, that \"I'm really happy for you\" that makes you think that he's really happy, or that well done laugh, are for the greatest seiyuus. Honorable mention to Hiroaki Hinata, Mutta's seiyuu. I can't remember a show where the MC had so many humor fluctuation.\\n\\n\nCHARACTER: I never, EVER, rooted for someone as much as I did for Mutta, and for the other characters in a lesser extent. I cried lots because of him (damn you Hiroaki this is embarrassing!) and for other characters, sometimes.\\n\\n\nBut at the same time there were times that I really felt that some characters flashbacks were only for filling the 24 minutes, sometimes quite useless, and I had the feeling that half of the episode was stupid flashbacks that got in the way more than it helped. Again, I don't know if the anime followed the manga, if they really had to fill in stuff as to let the manga get farther in the story, or even if those flashbacks were in the manga (I doubt it) as usually as in the anime. I get the feeling that SB could be made into a 40 or 50 eps show.\\n\\n\nENJOYMENT: Hell yeah I did, this show got me hooked up for 2 years (though I really wanted to quit 2 times in the middle of it, for the aforementioned reasons), but it is not the kind of anime that makes you crazy for a rewatch (well, there are 99 eps after all), since it have its good and bad parts in the seasons. Good and bad parts apart, it was quite a nice rollercoaster.\\n\\n\nOVERALL: 8/10, took some points out of the art and the slow paced story, the rest is great as it is! You should definitely watch it!!! I hope you like this review.",

            "content": "This anime is great up until around episode 21. After that supporting cast members start having their life stories fleshed out. Most of these episodes are quite boring, the motivations provided are often bland and even when they aren't they feel drawn out. \r\nAround this point is when the tone becomes an issue. I'm sure most anime veterans are used to the same music being used for every \"dramatic\" or \"inspiring\" moment in an anime. Sometimes well, sometimes not but it always feels a bit like the creators are cheating a little to add emotion to a scene that doesn't otherwise earn it. This animetakes that to the next level. By the end of it you will be rolling your eyes every time you hear one of the same three songs played for some inane plot point. This is especially frustrating by the end of 99 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really creates this issue is the overuse of flashbacks and recaps. It feels like you are being treated like an idiot. Many episodes will recap on content used just 5 minutes prior and most episodes will reuse scenes from earlier in the series. When you reach the three recap episodes in a row this becomes painful. I highly recommend skipping those episodes if you choose to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few plot holes here and there but over all it is an enjoyable anime that is ruined through being dragged out. The main character is interesting, the MC's brother is OK the rest of the cast is OK to good with a few annoying characters that don't really detract from it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can find a fan edit or omnibus this would be a great watch. As is it feels like a chore too often. 5/10",

I first I was surprised that this anime because I could see myself like him, like being the elder brother but being jumped ahead by his younger siblings and the way he thinks of things and its all about luck/gambling mentality and how unlucky and regretting that he is born, after watching the first ep. I really looked forward finishing the series in one sitting, but it took me a week because of my work, at NASA. (lol)\r\nThe story Progressesreally step by step, and the jokes are pretty funny if you understand what really it means.\\n\r\n the fact that it really delivers the spice of life on its illustrations, and way it also shows what might really happen in real life 10 years from now give you a really good feel about the anime, the plots is really promising on how it develops, the sound/music is great it gives you a sci-fi feeling, the characters fill there roles nicely and really have connection with each other, and sort of why they want to be an astronaut, It also shows the nature of each person and what they are thinking/imagining when they are alone. and peoples weirdness when they are in a bind. and how he reacts in situations which is hilarious and how the problems are solved in a unusual manner and how his skills and talents surface when they needed it most.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Do you have a dream for your future? If you do, watch \"Space Brothers.\" It is truly inspirational in a unique way.\r\nLet me start by stating that this anime is NOT for everyone, despite how amazing and motivating it is. This being said, I believe that everyone has something to gain by experiencing this legendary story. \"Space Brothers\" is a mature anime, not because of inappropriate content or overly complex scenarios, but because I imagine it would be hard for some younger viewers to connect with the entire complexion of its characters. On the other hand, anyone of any age with a dream for theirfuture \u2013 one that brings chills down your spine as you close your eyes and imagine it \u2013 will love and benefit from this story.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: \\n\r\n\"Space Brothers\" is realistic and simple. It follows the journey of a pair of adult brothers who dreamed of going to space as children. It is renowned for its accuracy in telling the story of an astronaut, and effectively portraying the challenges faced the entire way. Its important to note that the story is only half of what makes \"Space Brothers\" incredible. The other half is because of the characters and their relationships (which I will discuss in more detail later).\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story is great, its important to note that there is literally zero action. If you are a person who NEEDS action, then maybe this anime isn't for you. I would discourage abandoning the prospect of watching it however, as the action is replaced by a constant emotional tug in all directions! The story makes you FEEL like no other.\\n\\n\r\nWhy did I rate the story a 9?  Well its fantastic, and very little could be done to make it better. That being said, there is a bit of a lull in the middle where they start to use repetitive flashbacks that are not entirely necessary. This does not make the story frustrating to watch, but the time used on those flashbacks would be better used closing up a few elements of the story that I feel go unfinished at the end. Many promises were made and set into motion simply are not addressed by the ending. Due to the nature of the show, the open-ended conclusion works quite well, but I would have appreciated a little more, especially concerning what happens to Hibito.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: \\n\r\nIn short, the characters make up half of the beauty of this anime. If character development is as essential to you as it is to me in how you regard anime, then look no further: this one is a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing. The way \"Space Brothers\" develops the relationship between Hibito and Mutta is flawless. As an older brother (of a talented brother), I feel that every part of how Mutta feels about his little brother is INCREDIBLY real. \\n\\n\r\nMutta and Hibito are not the only characters that are very fleshed out and developed however. There are many support characters that are important, and each one is explored perfectly over the course of the show. Their relationships with Mutta feel essential to his progress as both an astronaut and a human being. Even the parents, who don't play as large a role as may be expected, are absolutely hilarious and a treat to have present when they show up during the story.\\n\\n\r\nPRESENTATION: \\n\r\nAs for the art, \"Space Brothers\" does a good job of keeping things very clean and real. A review I read before watching this anime claimed that heredity was well portrayed throughout, and I couldn't agree more! The stylistic choices for characters are great, as they add to both their individuality and realism at the same time. There are neither perfectly sculpted women wearing almost no clothes, nor exaggerated features to emphasize specific personality traits (such as a greedy character being far too fat).\\n\\n\r\nProbably the weakest part of the show is the music. It isn't bad, and more importantly, it isn't distracting, but my god it is repetitive. They have like three tracks that they play over and over again. On the other hand, all of the openings/endings were good enough to watch, and I LOVED the 1st OP/3rd OP/3rd End. \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION: \\n\r\nHere's the short version: \"Space Brothers\" depicts an incredibly difficult journey in an unexpectedly realistic and beautiful way. The characters are developed perfectly in a well-paced manner, and contribute to what I consider to be one of the best stories of character relationships ever shown through the medium. There are few stories that I can empathize with as well as I can with \"Space Brothers.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn my own personal rating system:\\n\\n\r\n   Masterpiece\\n\r\n**Near Perfect**\\n\r\n   Enjoyable\\n\r\n   Sub-Par\\n\\n\r\nDo you have a dream for your future? If you do, watch \"Space Brothers.\" It is truly inspirational in a unique way.",

            "content": "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n Introduction\r\nI'd say this anime is one of the best choices I have made.  After clicking through websites, I found a top one-hundred list for anime targeted towards a more mature audience.  I had recently discovered that I should not judge an anime by the picture or general idea, and if I hadn't... I'm not going to go there. Nanba Mutta, the man who brings the inspiration and beauty of this anime, should leave you smiling episode to episode. In order to watch this, I even suffered through crunchy roll's painful ads.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSTORY 10/10\r\nAs children, Nanba Mutta made a promise to his younger brother,Nanba Hibito, to travel into space. Nanba Mutta strives to be the best older brother he can be.  When both brothers were young, Mutta would always push to be one step of his younger brother; however, eventually Mutta lost hold of his dream.  Meanwhile, Hibito has become an astronaut chasing after his well earned dream.  Given the rare opportunity, Mutta is provided an invitation to audition for the job of his dreams.  After motivated by the people around him, Mutta begins his journey to become the older brother he once was.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime, the explanations of everything are concise and understandable to even a younger audience while being very interesting towards a mature one.  I found the factual details, physics, and overall story to be very clean and believable. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are very well developed, and I found myself loving specific parts of every one of them.  This characters in this anime should prove motivational and relatable.  As astronauts, each of them chase their dreams without giving up.  \\n\\n\r\nIn another anime, I sometimes found the backstory episodes of side characters to be unimportant; therefore, I quickly became uninterested.  Space Brothers has beautiful backgrounds that kept me attached to each one of them.  I found myself slowly diving into a world where not a moment was wasted-every episode kept my interest peaked and my smile broad.\\n\\n\r\nART 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe simplicity of the art makes this anime beautiful in its own way.  While being realistic in certain aspects, it brought an atmosphere that sucked you into the story.  My favorite part about the art in every episode was Mutta's beautifully sculpted afro. Nothing is better.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't often obsess over music throughout an anime, but I believe this anime deserves the rating above.  The music perfectly fit the mood and beauty of the anime.  Even the months after listening to the music from each episode, I still haven't gotten tired of it.  \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't a person I wouldn't recommend this anime to.  It definitely isn't a genre everyone would be interested in if given a brief explanation.  If you give this anime a chance, I believe it could strike the heart of anyone reading this.  This anime is beautiful, inspirational, interesting, and funny.  Most people can relate to the desire to chase your dreams, but many never do for countless reasons.  They become involved in other things, and forget about their dreams because they seem too difficult.  I know that's the case for me, and this anime is sure to be the inspiration for many future astronauts of tomorrow.  I really wouldn't be surprised if I became an astronaut in the future... (:\\n\\n\r\nI personally believe this anime deserves such high marks. Even while I feel people will roll their eyes at my perfect ratings for this, I cannot let this anime be reviewed less than it deserves.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed my review, please tell me what you loved. This is my first review, so please do criticize  it as well. Thank you!",

            "content": "\"What took a very long time to build takes moments to destroy. But you can always start over.\"\r\nUchuu Kyoudai is a touching story about two brothers, who aspire to become astronauts and reach the moon as children. Now, years later, older brother Mutta (33) traces his younger brother's footsteps in an attempt to fulfil their seemingly idle dream.\r\nSTORY:\r\nWhile at first, one may think this anime to be simply about two brothers going to space and doing space stuff, I assure you that it is much more than that. Space Brothers portrays the hardships of life in a very realistic and relatable manner whilst also exploringthe concepts of determination and dreams, teaching the viewer important lessons that can be applied even in the real world. \\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist of the series is Mutta, the older brother, who\u2014 plagued, though inspired, by his younger brother's overshadowing achievements\u2014 struggles to cope with the harsh procedure of becoming an astronaut and fulfilling his promise with his younger brother Hibito. Despite his goofy appearance and comedic demeanour, we quickly learn that Mutta is more than he seems, and he often appears to be used as author surrogate at several points of the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst the story is primarily centred around Mutta, the younger Hibito also plays a major role throughout the show as the deuteragonist of the series. Similar to his older brother, Hibito's careless personality and childish behaviour are often contrasted by his abilities and determination that make him the driving force of the show; his influence on Mutta is evidently significant as a method of moving the show forward and is the initial factor that gives life to the show.\\n\\n\r\nMutta's and Hibito's characterisation is essential in depicting the difficulty of achieving one's dreams and sustaining that dream, whilst also helping to convey what I deem to be the moral of the story: the painfully realistic fact that not everybody is able to achieve their dreams, but, even so, it is never too late to try again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nUchuu Kyoudai's art is not the flashiest of art styles and, at several points, the show appears to have slacked or perhaps been low on budget, though this is unnoticeable to most people and does not affect the performance of the anime. Overall, I believe the art to be decent, though what really stands out is the precision with which some real life places have been illustrated, such as the Johnson Space Centre in Houston. Personally, I perceive the show to be one that focuses on the plot and character development, rather than an extravagant art style, an idea that I believe to be axiomatic with the development of the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: \\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the art, the show does not heavily rely on flashy soundtracks, but the music in Uchuu Kyoudai is very fitting and beautiful nonetheless. My personal favourite soundtrack of the series, 'Wasureteita Akogare', is a great example of music that strengthens and aids the building of a mood through its appropriate use, unlike some soundtracks in other anime that are used incorrectly and force an emotion upon the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, the openings are fitting of the series, and most are comical and enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of this, the most significant aspect of sound in an anime is the voice acting, which is greatly implemented in the show. Whilst many may not be familiar with most or any of the voice acting cast, the show does not fail to deliver when it comes to bringing the characters to life, making any viewer love the realistic intonation and likeable voices of the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned previously, Space Brothers is a show that revolves around character development and its truly masterful plot. Every character has a lot of thought put into them and none of the characters that are significant to the story are left undeveloped. \\n\\n\r\nMany of the characters presented have a considerable amount of impact on the story line and some of the characters that may appear insignificant at first are still mentioned and developed in later arcs. When assembled, the 'puzzle' of characters comes together beautifully to build the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnother way in which the show shines when utilising characters is by often presenting the thoughts and experiences of different characters from their perspective, along with their hardships. This gives the audience an insight into the dreams and emotions of various characters, which has a major impact on the reality presented throughout the series; it gives a voice to the smaller characters, rather than filtering their behaviour through the main character's perception of them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nSpace Brothers is definitely an enjoyable series. A wonderful plot is presented alongside a massive load of comedic content, making it a delight to watch whether you're looking for great comedy or a heartwarming story. Both of these aspects are greatly executed throughout the show, making it enjoyable to a wider audience.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\\n\r\nAn amazing story that teaches the viewer real-life lessons and immerses the audience into its overwhelmingly inspiring story. Sheer brilliance.",

(Btw, I'm currently on episode 25) Also my first review.. cause it's just too good... don't want y'all to miss out :) I once again reminded myself \"DON'T JUDGE AN ANIME BY IT'S ART\"\r\nBefore I watched this anime, I passed on this anime based on the cover's art. After watch 400+ anime, and running out of stuff to watch, I decided give this anime a try. And I can't believe Ididn't watch this earlier.. anyway.. here's why I give this anime a 10.\\n\\n\r\nFirst it has a unique story, like how many anime talks about astronauts?\\n\\n\r\nSecond characters, the MC, Mu-chan is not some good looking, rich, strong, young character. He's 31, quite old you might think, but young at heart, and still chases after his dreams.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the other characters you encounter through out the anime, it makes you feel sympathy for them. It's not just throwing in some random people and tossing them out after a few episodes.  There's a link between them and Mu-chan. \\n\\n\r\nArt, sound, they're not bad.. it's considered an old anime, so the art and sound is quite good. The art isn't flashy or anything which matches well with the slice-of-life genre. \\n\\n\r\nStory is great. About two brothers who's going to keep their promise they made when they're kids. There's a nice flow throughout the anime, not much filters or random side-stories in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.. if you want a bit of everything, wanna laugh at times, cry at times, see some romance, sympathy, or whatever it is you're looking for, you'll probably find it in this anime. (No ecchi though.. ok maybe a little? ) \\n\r\nI'm not a fan of space, astronauts, aliens, UFO, or any of that, but I found this anime quite enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah.. Overall I give this a 9. To be honest I'm only on episode 25, which is where I ended on the first day of watching this anime. And I'll watch more after this review. Anyway all I have left to say is.. Don't miss out on such a good anime.. and DON'T BASE AN ANIME BY IT'S ART. Bye bye :)",

            "content": "Im writing this review knowing its still ongoing, i haven't seen every episode yet. But if they managed to flop this anime, i'm gonna quit watching all together. And if they dare to cancel this it, i'll plan my next vacation in japan, visit their company to tell the lady behind the front desk her boss is an ...something not so nice, use your imagination :P -       \r\n   I've been watching anime for quite some time now, completed up to 390 series. Without a doubt, this is one of my favorite. I went trough thefirst 65 eps in 2,5 days, that's more than 25 hours in total. It might look weird that im giving a full 10 here, but if you look at my anime list. Out of 400 anime, i gave only 3 others a 10. And only to prove a point i'd be willing to downgrade all the other anime.\\n\\n\r\nTHE REVIEW\\n\r\n   It won't be an anime loved by everyone, it isn't filled with fighting, packed with humor or some mayor love story. Its a story of a person named Mutta who wanted to be the best older brother, staying one step ahead of his younger brother, Hibiki. Not that big a story is it? But what if your younger brother tells you he wants to go to the moon, become an astronaut? That would spice things up wouldn't it :)  \\n\\n\r\n   Like i said earlier, this anime isn't filled with action/comedy/love. But it does contain al those elements, filtered and well placed. After all the anime I've seen, i cant think of a comparison where this kind of balance can be found. But i can compare it with Naruto, Bleach or even with DBZ. All these series are/where long term shows, but after a while they fall back to a certain pattern. Trauma/evil -> training ->fight, and again, new evil -> training -> fight. Uchuu Kyoudai story line keeps it new, not afraid to lose characters or locations after making it a part of the anime.   \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\n\"Uchuu Kyouda\" is realistic yet out of reach for most. Has humor, but is not ruled by it. It contains romance but it isn't a love story. The story keeps renuwing itself, keeps it interresting. It's not just another anime, it's unieke, the quality of the story and how its translated to anime is mature and experienced. For me its the first time seeing this in an anime, i'm flabbergasted.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nIt fits the anime perfectly, its not a try-out for a new techniek. The story doesn't need it to be flashy, that would only distract you from the story. After saying that, i still really like the art :)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI never really stood still by the influence of the sound/background. But after writing this review i re-watched the last few eps, once again im amazed. Just like the art it fits the anime, it fits the mood, happy/sad/exited/bored.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nMutta is now one of my favorite characters, i find it hard to describe why without giving to many spoilers. But the characters are perfectly woven within the story, their past, present and future. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI always prefer saving some eps and then watch them in one go. To get e better feel for the story. Like i've already said, its uniek. I have the feeling it isnt made to get ritch or rushed to make a deadline. I have the feeling this project has been handled with care end experience, specifically for our enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nThe story together with the characters are the red-line in this anime. The art and sound are there to enhance that, and they are doing that perfectly\\n\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely one of my favorite anime!!",

            "content": "TLDR; Uchuu Kyoudai is sometimes criticized for being slow, but actually shows what a slow paced show should be like, and is even better on a second viewing.\r\n       This review focuses solely on one of this shows most (in)famous points: the pacing.  Generally, the words \"slow-paced\" mean endless amounts of fillers and padding.  Not so in Uchuu Kyoudai.  It demonstrates how a slow pace can be a defining asset of a show, immensely fleshing out even the side characters and providing fantastic details about space travel.On first watching, the slow pacing (and the CLIFFHANGERS! AGH!) can be immensely frustrating, when climactic plot points are consistently left unrevealed for several episodes.  The show that benefits immensely from rewatching.  Its length means you probably won't clearly remember events from the beginning episodes, and watching a second time, knowing outcomes in advance, allows you to relax and enjoy the shows astonishing depth.  Additionally, you can appreciate the foreshadowing.  Offhand mentions in one episode can pop up forty episodes later!\\n\\n\r\n         Considering its length and leisurely tempo, Uchuu Kyoudai also does a good job of keeping its episodes from being boring.  Only one arc, in the 50 episode range, drags out a little too long.  A healthy mix of plot, tension, character development, occasional romance, and a truly amusing sense of comedy keep this series high on my watch-priority list.",

As the older one, Mutta vows to go into space before his younger brother. However, growing up, it seems Hibito managed to speed past him in achieving this instead.\r\nThis story focuses on Mutta's journey to relive his childhood dream to be an astronaut. It is full of humor due to Mutta's lovable and slightly nerdy yet eccentric character. It is also fullof touching moments from the other characters that prove to be staple in Mutta's journey to be an astronaut.  \\n\\n\r\nThe other (smaller) part of the anime tells about Hibito's success on being the first and youngest Japanese man to land on the moon. But to me the reason why I love this anime so much is Mutta's story. The other staple characters I mentioned also seems to have a stronger bond and play a bigger part in Mutta's character development than Hibito. (Im not saying Hibito did not play a part, just that his part in Mutta's life seems small in comparison to say, Sharon and Kenji for example)\\n\\n\r\nThere were episodes that fill you with laughter, that makes you cry, that makes you so inspired. I am full of admiration for Mutta and find myself wishing all the best in his success to achieving his dream.  \\n\\n\r\nBTW, the anime is only a small part of the manga, which is still ongoing. so after watching this you can continue with the manga:)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Review out of 100. 35 for Story, 35 for Characters, and 30 for Production Values\r\nStory (30/35) A really nice heartwarming tale of a guy trying to fulfill his dreams of being an astronaut. Slower pacing and can be predictable and cheesy at times, but overall an entertaining watch. \r\nCharacters (35/35) I wouldn't change one person in this amazing (and large) cast. All of them bring something special to the table and none of them are annoying as they are given a lot of time to be fleshed out and properly developed. Special mentions go out the the main cast, especially Mutta. \r\nProdction Values: (25/30) Itlooks good when it needs too and the score is very nicely done. Great openings and endings too. It also has great characters designs that look different than your average 2012/13 anime (no moe). \\n\\n\r\nOverall (90/100) A great show, that has only a few problems. Watch this is you want a show that'll make you feel good inside, has some great characters, and if you don't mind long stories. But if you are looking for a fast paced show with some action, and dislike watching long shows, this might not be the show for you. \\n\\n\r\nUchuu Kyoudai and GTO are my go to Feel Good Anime. If I finished watching something sad or bittersweet, I can put on one of these two shows and almost immediately feel better. The story of Uchuu Kyodai is a big part of why. Uchuu Kyodai is about a normal guy (Mutta) trying to reach his dream of becoming and Astronaut, and beat his little brother to Mars like he promised (Hibito, his little brother, is already an astronaut). That's pretty much it. We see everything through Mutta's eyes and we experience all his trials and tribulations. It really is a very heartwarming and touching story, but it isn't without its problems. The story can be very predictable at times, and only a few times did I question what would actually happen. Along with its predictability, the story can be a little too cheesy, but nothing major and the great dialogue more than makes up for it. The pacing is on the slow side, but that is made up for by the character development you get, as the show uses its extra time to flesh out its cast. The setting is also a bit weird for me. I'm a real geek when it comes to technology, so when a show like Uchuu Kyodai takes place 10 years in the future, I expect to see some technological breakthroughs. It is offsetting for me because it seems like the only things that has been making advances in the past 10 years is space travel. Many of those complaints are small though, so I feel obligated to give Uchuu Kyodai a very good score in the story department. (30/35)\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the only thing Uchuu Kyodai does better than telling a good story is its characters. Seriously, this show has probably the most charming cast of characters I have ever seen. Like I said earlier, the show sacrifices a faster pacing so it can flesh out the characters more, and I have to say they made a really smart move. By the end of every arc, all the characters become likable in some way, and you are never left with some really annoying character who gets no development and is just all around irritating. Are there characters you might not like at first? Yes, but through its time the show fleshes out every single one of them to the point where you can't help but feel for him/her. Seriously, there were like 3-4 characters that pissed me off when they were first introduced, but the more time you spend with them and come to understand them makes them more likable. And that is only talking about the side cast. The Main Cast (Mutta, Hibito, Kenji, Serika, etc.) are even more likable. Especially Mutta, who has quickly become one of my favorite characters in anime. Seeing everything from his eyes and hearing his thoughts makes him even more of a charming character than he already would have been. I love the main cast. (35/35)\\n\\n\r\nThe production values for this show are good when they need to be, and that's it. The characters are beautifully drawn and the show looks good when it needs to, but any other time it is obvious they are skimping a little. This isn't a big deal as the show is very dialogue heavy so not much movement is needed, but still. And for a show where a lot of the story takes place in America, they sure do mess up every English word in here. I do give it extra points for having very good characters designs, that do not seem moe influenced at all. It really is refreshing. The music in the show is above average. The Background Music (BGM) is reused many times throughout the show (I think it helps give the show some identity), but I'd be lying is I said the music wasn't good and that it didn't fit the show to a T. I will admit I'm not the biggest fan of ALL the BGM in this show, but overall I was pleased with it. Lastly, the openings and endings for this show are very good. There have been 5 openings and 5 endings as of the time of writing this, and only 2 or 3 were lackluster, and none of them were bad. The first opening, \"Feel So Moon\" is one of the catchiest opening songs I have ever heard, and would put an instant smile on my face. Overall I'd say the production values for this show are above average. (25/30)\\n\\n\r\nIf you hadn't already guessed, I really love Uchuu Kyodai. Everything from the story, to the amazing characters, to the music is just great. But I wouldn't recommend this show to everyone. If you want a fast paced show with some action, you won't find that here, and you'll possibly hate this show as it is the exact opposite of that. If you are someone who dislikes long running anime, this show might not be your cup of tea, as it has 65 episodes as of writing this and isn't even close to catching up with the manga (at least for another year). But if you are someone who is fine with long running shows with really good characters and a heartwarming story, look no further than Uchuu Kyodai. (90/100).\\n",

            "content": "Every anime is a journey. And, oh, boy, \"Uchuu Kyoudai\" is a wonderful journey.\r\nWhen I was younger, I was deeply interested in space. I used to read Carl Sagan's essays, books about the universe... I watched many movies related to this theme. But, for some reason, I grew up and I started to feel... fear. Fear of the unknown, fear of this vast reality. I was scared of black holes, of things I could not understand because they were beyond my limited comprehension. \r\nThis is similar to my personal life. When I grew up, I started to fear the future. As most of people, Ihad dreams, projects, but as reality hit me, something didn't feel right. Will I be able to accomplish my dreams? I am almost 30 and I did nothing relevant. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I can't change anything, after all.\\n\\n\r\nThen, I found \"Uchuu Kyoudai\". I have always loved the \"slice of life\" genre, so I thought I could try it, even though I wasn't too excited with the possibility of watching 99 episodes (I have never enjoyed huge series with lots of episodes). Fortunately, I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\n\"Uchuu Kyoudai\" is a very special anime. First, it is about having courage: courage to change the most difficult thing in the universe - yourself. The characters are amazing and their evolution through these 99 episodes is one of the most beautiful aspects of it. You will laugh, cry, suffer, relax and even learn. Sure, it has its flaws (sometimes, there are very \"cliche\" characters, who represent the Japanese view of some nationalities); but all of them are irrelevant, in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is not composed by several great tunes; instead, you'll find 2 or 3 main themes, but they'll make you feel comfortable. The art is good and the dialogues are a gem. Overall, a great show.\\n\\n\r\n\"Uchuu Kyoudai\" is inspiring. I think this is the best adjective to define it. I've finished it a month ago and I still miss it. Because of Mutta, Hibito, Serika and everyone, I am not afraid of space anymore. And I think I have more courage to fulfill my dreams. And that is an amazing thing, isn't it?",

            "content": "An anime about an average man that had a dream. A dream to go to the moon. Basically a story of a man that wants to become an astronaut and follow his younger brother to the moon.\r\nStory \r\nThis anime should be boring, but it is not. Every episode makes you want to see another one. When I first started to watch it I thought \"man this will be boring as hell.. I will probably drop it after ep. 1\". But then I was soon attracted by the characters, especially by Nanba Mutta. Even tho the main characters should be both Nanba brothers the anime mainlyfocuses on the older Mutta. The story is set so that almost every ep. end is a cliffhanger that makes you want to see another episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation \\n\r\nThe animation was fine. It was nothing special or amazing but it fit the show really well. Not really much to say about it. The sound was ok, voice acting done well and the OST was used really good on the ocasions it needed to be. The song might have been used multiple times but that did not ruin the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n Mutta is a fantastic character. He is funny and intelligent. Mutta is what makes this anime interesting, his facial expressions, his emotions, his everything is what makes him a great character. The other characters are great too, I don't thing there is a character I disliked or a character that was badly written. A lot of them get enough screen time to get an actual development and you can even get attached to some.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoymen\\n\r\nt I really enjoyed this anime, it might look boring but once you get in it it is really entertaining. Well someone might disagree but I thing the writink was really well done to keep you entertained.\\n\\n\r\nOverall So this is an interesting anime that can be seen regardless of your interest about space traveling or astronaut training and still be really entertaining. \\n\r\nFinal score 9,5/10",

            "content": "NO SPOILERS. This is my first ever review, and I thoroughly enjoy the heck outta it. Where do I even begin to elaborate how wonderful this anime is.\r\nFirst off - the story. Ok, you have heard of countless anime with space themes, but ones that actually depict a realistic situation? Probably only this. Mutta, the older and seemingly unlucky brother, is someone I can relate to (well, except the smartness he possesses lol). With a very profound imagination and crazy thoughts that are not shown to his friends and family, it spectates what many of us think to ourselves on a daily basis.\r\nHardwork does payoff, but you must strive hard first. That's what struck my heart about this series. The realistic portrayal of hard work of all these characters bring shame to other anime. It also lets viewers know that wanting to go to space is not as easy as you think. Why else would this series be so long, together with an ongoing manga too! With the countless intelligence and quick wits needed, it really gets your brain working as the characters perform.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the artwork... Damn, is this Unlimited Budget Works?! The scenes of the earths and moons shown are just outstanding. You can tell much effort is put into the whole 99 episodes, the OPs and EDs. Can I just say how much I love the eyes of the characters? The  \"shininess\" of it just renders me staring. \\n\\n\r\nThirdly, the soundtracks. I. LOVE. IT.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: just watch it, YOU WON'T REGRET THIS",

            "content": "If you ask anyone if they find space interesting, you\u2019ll almost always get a yes in return. The vast unexplored expanse before us, beautiful yet mysterious. So much of our media is filled with stories of space travel. Tales of 'the final frontier' and 'a galaxy far far away'. However, stories relating to space that are grounded in reality are surprisingly rare. And along here comes A-1 pictures\u2019 2012-2014 adaption of the manga that began in late 2008, Space Brothers.\r\nSpace Brothers recounts the story of the two siblings Mutta and Hibito Nanba. Long ago as children they made a promise. They promised to become astronautsand stand on the moon together, but Mutta has forgotten his goals while his younger brother Hibito is already fulfilling them. This story follows Mutta\u2019s journey to finally grab hold of his dream, and all the struggles he and his younger brother overcome.\\n\\n\r\nSet in the near future of 2025, it presents new inventions and improvements on the current systems. I won\u2019t lie, I have a pretty small knowledge of the space program and technology behind it, yet just as a person living today, the inventions and technology displayed feels exactly like something that would come out of the near future, some of which is even technology we\u2019re already exploring in present day. It doesn\u2019t gloss over it either, no you get the near-whole experience, in all its 99-episode glory. -I say near-whole because the manga\u2019s ongoing, and the anime is on hiatus for who knows how long.\\n\\n\r\nOne might think that with 99 episodes of content, it would get boring pretty quickly. While it\u2019s certainly a journey to finish, boring isn\u2019t a word I\u2019d use in describing Space Brothers. It covers such a long period of time that each episode feels brisk, and because the show\u2019s split into arcs with a few intermediary episodes between, it\u2019s quite easy to binge, take a break, and return to the show again thanks to the uncomplicated way it is presented. One issue is that sometimes I\u2019d get a little stuck when the preceding arc was far better than the current one or at least better than the establishing episodes of the current arc, and there would sometimes be a lack of needed tension to keep you engaged.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters really are what keep you watching episode after episode.\\n\r\nEach character is distinctly unique, from their personality to their voice to their character design. Some of them are introduced and seem to be offputting or unlikeable, yet as the show progresses more of their personality and backstory is revealed, and you can come to see they\u2019re a lot more than they seem at face value. The way each character is implemented into the story is fantastic, with each person bearing important value to and being connected to other characters in the show. Everyone feels relevant, and through each character we learn things about others. It is true that some characters could come off as irritating, gimmicky, or perhaps even a bit pointless. But ultimately, out of the massive cast I find that the majority were incredibly well characterized. Mutta and Hibito, along with the many people around them who facilitated their growth one way or another, are a major factor in one\u2019s enjoyment of this show.\\n\\n\r\nOur main character Mutta and his story is a very relatable and inspiring one. He pursues his dream after letting the harshness of reality push him away, and takes the steps towards it with hard work, support of his friends, and even a little bit of luck. His personality is a balance of awkward yet hidden wiseness. Mutta\u2019s foolish and simultaneously brilliant. A person whose goal seems accomplishable but not without some effort put in, creating a character that you really want to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, however, at best is describable as \u201ceh\u201d. It\u2019s not exactly Deen levels of embarrassingly terrible, yet for a lot of the time I\u2019d describe it as below average. The animation of the characters feels stiff, and often the animation itself is inconsistent, leading to some Deen-like expressions and movements. Even excluding that, a lot scenes feel almost purposely framed to avoid showing movement. There are lots of close to the face, standing still, and undetailed far away shots, including the use of some very out-of-place panning still shots. A lot of CG used throughout for the massive machines, planes, etc, but that\u2019s surprisingly not the largest negative. The CG, while by no means impressive nor perfect, accomplishes its goal without feeling too out of place. The CG used during rocket launch sequences in particular felt rather natural. Nothing about the animation overall is particularly remarkable nor offensive. It\u2019s there, it\u2019s flawed, and you kind of just get used to it, which is aided by the fact that this show is not one that is reliant on visuals. That's not to say it does not have its moments. Particularly during an arc relating to Hibito\u2019s lunar exploration, the animation quality spikes up pretty greatly to meet the increased drama and stakes in stride, but these are but special occasions within the show.\\n\\n\r\nThat is the animation. But what about the general aesthetic? Well the character designs are memorable and fun. Each one stands out in its cartoony way, and are unique and diverse as well as indicative of their main character trait. The background art also is well utilized. During your average episode, it doesn\u2019t stand out much, but as soon as the scene hits the sky and beyond it stands out in a brilliant way. For a series promoting space, it certainly does its job and fantastically illustrates the beauty of it.\\n\r\nWith music, Space Brothers has some pretty enjoyable Opening and Ending themes, though not all of them particularly memorable. I will comment on the first OP, \u201cFeel so Moon\u201d, which is arguably the best OP out of them all and is the one that defines the show the most. Everything about it is amazing. It starts off with synths and drums getting the \u201cspace\u201d feel across right off the bat and leading into a guitar and vocals. After that, it builds up in a way that really emulates the idea of a spaceship taking off, uses a vocal filter with the guitar backing off for the idea of space, and finally builds up once more for the song's strong conclusion. It\u2019s memorable, fitting, and an enjoyable listen overall. Now for the OST.\\n\\n\r\nSpace Brothers\u2019 OST is a very orchestral one, heavily relying on particular themes for each various mood throughout the series. It\u2019s very similar to Chihayafuru\u2019s soundtrack, though not quite as memorable. Each song does a good job of expressing emotion, with a fantastic sense of scale throughout, and the songs come off as sincere. The primary flaw with the soundtrack is simply that it does a lot of things similar to soundtracks before it. The repeatedly scaling strings, the steadily booming brass, the slow note-by-note emotional piano, all of these are very familiar to us, and even if the songs themselves are well-made, this still causes it not to stand out much in one\u2019s memory. These songs sound exactly like the ones I\u2019ve heard in every other heartwarming against-all-odds flick. Except for a select few songs that listening back strongly evoke the emotion of the scene it accompanied, it\u2019s not an OST I\u2019d go out of my way to listen to, as a lot of the pieces have that typical background music style of repetitiveness. This is not to say the OST is a poor one. It certainly does do its job. It well suits the scenes it accompanies, but fails to really go that extra mile in creating a truly memorable and powerful audial experience.\\n\\n\r\nSpace Brothers is a series that comes off as both compelling and sincere. The story and characters feel unique yet familiar, and for those 99-episodes, it\u2019s a wonderful friend you can always rely on when you\u2019re feeling down. It\u2019s silly, it\u2019s serious, it\u2019s dramatic, it\u2019s inspiring, and overall it\u2019s just incredibly uplifting. It takes its time and everything about it is definitely a matter of personal taste whether or not it will be to your liking. Despite occasional tonal changes and various surprising events throughout, it still is very much so the same show stylistically from start to finish. With that said, I do urge everyone to give it a chance, even if you don\u2019t usually care for this type of show. Simply put, it\u2019s incredibly enjoyable to watch. Through its diverse, fun cast and interesting story it is a show that despite it\u2019s length, once you\u2019ve finished it, feels like you had just started.\\n\\n\r\n(Originally Written May 27th, 2015)\\n\\n\r\nhttps://writtenandwriting.wordpress.com/",
