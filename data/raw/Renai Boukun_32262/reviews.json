            "content": "Death Note is easily one of the most popular and instantly recognisable anime out there, currently sitting at the number one spot here on MAL for the number of members it has. It's a show that has been referenced and parodied time and time again by fans of the show, as well as in other anime. However, Renai Boukun, otherwise known as Love Tyrant, takes it a step further by making an entire show a parody of Death Note itself! And it's completely mediocre, with forced and bland comedy that becomes stale incredibly quickly, a lacklustre cast of characters while, at the same time, hardlydoing anything with its set-up or parody elements. I honestly really wanted to like this, I really did, but each passing episode became even more incredibly bland and dull than the last resulting in an end product that most people will forget in only a couple of months and leaving me with a feeling of genuine disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nAs I just mentioned, the show is essentially a parody of the series Death Note, but in this instance, the Death Note is now replaced with a new book called the Kiss Note; an extremely powerful tool that, when two names are written inside it next to each other, they will both fall madly in love with each other regardless of the gender, providing that they kiss one another that is. This feature, in particular, comes greatly in use for the yaoi enthusiast,  Guri, a hyperactive idiot cupid whose task is to match up potential couples with each other. However, she accidentally writes the main protagonist's name in the book, by the name of Seiji Anno, and he has to kiss someone otherwise Guri will die (which we later learn is an outright lie). He decides to kiss his crush, who turns out to have a mad obsession with our bland as hell main character here, bordering on Yandere tendencies, pulling out random knives and swords from her tits in the same way a girl may keep her phone down there or something? They eventually do kiss, but Guri makes herself, and Yandere-chan, known as Akane, into a three-way relationship, eventually adding Akane's sister,  Yuzu (who actually loves Akane) into the mix. And that's pretty much it for an overall narrative, which, I believe is fine for a comedy anime as long as the characters are fun and the comedy is funny and varied, which, unfortunately, is something I believe the anime lacks.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, let's discuss the wasted potential in the Death Note parody gimmick and set-up of the narrative. Despite being a parody of said series, Love Tyrant hardly utilises the Kiss Note to any substantial merit and the show pretty much forgets about this item throughout much of the duration, which, in my eyes, is wasted potential for some comedic moments. It feels like the Kiss Note was added as a way to make the show more marketable by riding on the popularity of Death Note, rather than being used as satire. There is no clever meta-commentary or callbacks to the actual series either, so the Kiss Note, aside from being used to start the story, feels inconsequential and rather pointless to boot. Not only that, but the comedy, for the most part, feels incredibly weak and trite despite the potential in the first two episode. I'll honestly admit, that the first two episodes of Love Tyrant are actually pretty funny and engaging to boot; I was having a great time with the show. The jokes, at the beginning anyway, felt fresh and they often were more hit than miss, but, as the show progresses, it feels more tiring to watch since they never switch up the dynamics and repeat the same jokes throughout. This makes the show feel so damn repetitive to watch, and repeating the same jokes is essentially a cardinal sin in comedy; it becomes stale by episode five! In addition, the jokes and comedy itself feels extremely forced and most jokes can be seen a mile away before they're even delivered! It doesn't help all too much either that the characters have hardly any chemistry with one another nor do their personalities bounce off each other well either.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sake of argument, let's compare it to another comedy this year, from the previous season, called Gabriel Dropout. While that show is not a comedic masterpiece or anything, it was able to remain a fun ride throughout since its characters had defined personalities which had chemistry with one another, while, at the same time, spicing things up just enough with its joke variations to keep things from becoming too stale. This doesn't happen in this show and each joke feels as bland as the last. There is no snowball effect taking place, nor are the character's personalities strong enough to carry the weight of the show. The comedic timing could also feel pretty off, and often at times jarring! The problem with the show is that it doesn't quite know if it wants to be a comedy, a drama or an edge-fest and combines them all together, with an end result that feels clunky to watch. It's not necessarily uncommon for anime to combine multiple genres together, but here there is hardly any downtime between any of the events, so in one moment they are laughing and joking, and in the immediate next, the main character is being tortured. There is no downtime between any of these events and thus it can feel really awkward and jarring while watching the show since the pacing for this show is strangely inconsistent, but is normally pumped up to eleven at all times. Again, for the sake of argument, Gintama is also an anime that features a lot of comedy intermixed with more serious and emotional moments, but, in that show, these two never feel all too intrusive on each other since there is a good amount of downtime between each one. Perhaps this is an unfair comparison considering the sheer difference in the lengths of both shows, but there are plenty of other shows that can achieve this, so why not this one?\\n\\n\r\nThis doesn't help when the music for the show is so badly implemented and placed at the worst of times. One of the worst examples comes from episode eight in which the main character is being continuously stabbed with a sharp object, while light and carefree music is being played over it, music that would fit right at home in children's shows. It just feels, yet again, jarring, and that's the best word I can use to describe this show: jarring.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters, they don't fare much better. The main character is as boring in personality as he is in visual design. He plays the typical main character lead; spiky hair, getting embarrassed when a girl gets close to him, and so on and so forth. He is a rather boring character, who is pushed into playing the straight man role for the group and nothing else beyond that. He responds with the typical reactions you'd expect from a character in his position and jumps in to save the day whenever he is needed to do so. He is not a bad character necessarily, just an extremely dull one. Akane has a little bit more going for her, in that we do actually learn her back-story, which does explain the reason behind her action and general personality, details I can appreciate, it's just that each scenario and joke she is in, always is about how she is a yandere, while, at the same time, pulling out weapons from her tits. While beautiful in her visual appearance, her character doesn't really have all too much in likeability nor does she receive all too much development as a person either, aside from her rebellion against her mother in the eighth episode of the show. Yuzu receives a little bit of exploration into her character and reasoning behind her love for Akane, while, at the same time having superpowers (which the show never actually explains why she has those now that I am thinking about it) but, again, it feels like I'm repeating myself here, needed more in the way of development in order for her character to be good. The only character I liked was Guri, mainly because I have a soft spot for his aloof idiot types of characters, but I generally found her to be kind of charming in her own little way. I liked her character design perhaps the most, and the various facial expressions she did were kind of funny in their own little way, although nothing remarkable as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing I can praise, it is the artwork and general look of the show. It is very colourful and pops pretty well, and, as I said, I liked the various faces and chibi-ness of some of the facial expressions too. I also liked the opening and ending tracks, especially the opening which is incredibly catchy. It's upbeat, lively and full of energy, which, the rest of the show should have been as well, which is a shame since it did have a few things going for it. Some of the comedic moments were alright and the initial set up was good, but unfortunately, the show was not funny in my eyes. \\n\\n\r\nBut this is where it becomes difficult, however. Comedy is something that is extremely subjective, and thus, I can imagine many people finding this show very funny to watch, which is completely fine. After all, many people consider the second season of Konosuba to be weaker than its prequel, yet I found it funny still, which is something I have to consider when talking about comedy. My sense of humour is pretty damn strange, and I find pleasure in absurd humour. On that end, I would like to recommend this show, on account that you personally may find it funny to watch, but, on the flip side, there are so many other comedy anime out there that take the time to write much more varied jokes that don't come across as forced or jarring when they switch to a more serious tone. It's unfortunate that I didn't enjoy this show, since, as I said in the opening paragraph, I really did want to like this show, but I just couldn't...\\n",

Given that it's a parody, expect some over-the-top humor displayed through unrealistic situations. It doesn't, by any means, take itself serious: This casual anime is simply one that contains some light-hearted humor. In addition, it contains yuri, yaoi fandom, and the yandere archetype, in case you're a fan of one of those three. (It has more yandere--and a super obvious form of it--than the other two.)\r\nI would have to say the production (story, art, sound, etc.) is pretty standard forbeing 2017. It's neither a piece of art nor is it sub-par in quality. We'll see if it continues to deliver as its story develops. If nothing else, Renai Boukun has the rare yandere archetype and is a parody of the most popular anime on MyAnimeList. (I mean, it really boggles my mind how no one has yet parodied Death Note since it's been out for over 10 years.) Renai Boukun got my interest.",

            "content": "*No spoiler review*\r\nTL;DR: A deconstructed school harem rom-com parody that is actually quite fun to watch if you are ready for a Love Octagon of epic proportion. The humour never dies, the seriousness never shines. The love comes and goes & the parody just flows. \r\n[Story: 5/10 , Characters: 7/10, Art: 7/10, Sound: 6/10, Enjoyment: 7/10]\r\nWhat do you get if you give the power of something serious as \"Kiss Note\" (similar to Death Note but kissing) to a clueless cupid who just wants to use it to make her wildest fantasies come true? You get a deconstructed rom-com parody that somehow keeps you watching formore. This show never takes itself seriously and frankly it's because of this that this show shines as a whole. In Renai Boukun aka Love Tyrant, a Kiss Note (parody of Death Note) is a powerful notebook that makes people who have their names written together instantly fall in love if they kiss each other, regardless of any circumstances. If they don't\u2026 they will remain a virgin forever and c'mon which person would want that? Enter Guri, a cupid clueless about Love, accidentally writes Seiji's (MC) name mistaking him for someone else. She shows up to his door, explains the concept to him, they kiss, and the problem begins from there. This whole show starts off from this tiny snowball of a problem that just keeps rolling down the hill and it gets just bigger and bigger. Quite a rollercoaster ride if you ask me. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I get into the plot, it's the characters that makes this show so enjoyable. You have Guri, a BL obsessed undere cupid who is clueless about love. Then, Akane, a psychotic beautiful yandere, that will kill anyone that touches her love. Cue in Yuzu, a tsundere wincestual stalker, in love with her step-sister. Next the cousin of Akane & Yuzu, Shikami, a sado-maso mayadere who gets off on pain, obsessed with stealing other's love. On the side, you have the MC's younger sister Akua, a kuudere with severe brother/sister complex hoping for her brother's love. Finally, you have the weak & pathetic yet kind MC, Seiji, who is \"not handsome, quick to anger, stubborn, insensitive and just a really boring guy\" wanting to find true love. Throw them all in one pot, thanks to the supernatural power of \"Kiss Note\", you have a chaotic mess that will deliver enough comedy to keep you watching for more. Seriously, the characters all feel unique and though the point isn't for viewers to identify themselves as one of the character in the show, you just can't help laughing at each of their hilarity. Even the Kami, aka God, and Maoh, aka Devil, are presented in such comedic manner that the only less outrageous character in this show is the MC himself. You really do start to pity him seeing the stuff he gets himself into. Despite all the chaos, each of the characters actually undergoes some form of character development to better their personality. Now that you have a better grasp of the characters and their \"goals\", let's dive into the plot. \\n\\n\r\nPlot wise, the story sort of follows a linear pattern as the show is supposed to showcase Guri's coming of age story as she becomes a better Cupid who will succeed Kami in the future by truly understanding the concept of love. However, this show isn't about reaching that destination, it's about enjoying the messed up journey these characters gets themselves into. At its essence, this is a parody that deconstructs the rom-com genre by showing how obscure the concept of school love is by portraying it through a comedic lense. Each episode is a two part episode where the characters find themselves in stereotypical harem/rom-com messy situations that gets resolved by the end after poking much needed fun at its obscurities. The constant juxtaposition of presenting different deretype characters really adds to its comedic value, plus the dialogues go from corny to cheesy to somewhat deep at times. It's almost as if the director snaps their fingers at the viewers to tell them, \"sssh, serious matters are being shown here\u2026 or so we think.\" Seriously, the best part about this show is that neither the plot nor the director takes the show seriously which allows for the \"quit pro quo\" comedic style to flourish so well. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the animation team behind Renai Boukun did a great job. Each of the major characters stand out from one another and they made the MC a very relatable looking character that is both bland yet unique looking. The use of bold vibrant primary colours really shines throughout the anime. It is able to contrast the deep satirical emotions of love with the outrageous comedic elements of chaos. Though scattered if observed individually but seems cohesive when seen together. The OP song is quirky & catchy and the ED song is nice but its the OST that really shines as it helps the anime flow well with the story by constantly aiding in the creation and diffusion of tension. Definitely worth a listen as a standalone. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Renai Boukun is a fun show to watch, not just on a whim. It's a good parody and it never takes itself seriously so the comedy never dies. I enjoyed watching it despite not being a fan of rom-com because it is a deconstructed parody of this genre. If you are debating whether or not you want to watch the show, just ask yourself this. Do you want to watch a show that is utter madness due to hilarious characters? Do you enjoy good comedy? Do you like a bit of fan service? Regardless of yes or no, you should watch this show. Simple as that... joking. Anyways, give it a watch and let me know later how you like it. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!\\n\r\nP.P.S. \"What is love? It's not about knowing what love is\u2026 being in love means whether you are happy or sad the heart always aches for that one special person\"",

            "content": "-- This review contains spoilers. Only read if you have finished the series. --\r\nStory:\r\nWhen thinking of this show, the word wacky comes to mind. We're introduced to characters that fit their \"niche,\" if you will, but with a slight spin on it. They are basically forced together with the end result of their shenanigans being rather bizarre at times. This comedy follows the job of a cupid and the troubles that go along with it. With that said, it may be repetitive here and there which brings the show down overall. However, one of my biggest problems with the show is that the story itselfquickly goes downhill somewhere midway when Guri is basically forced to find love for the sake of \"developing\" her character; the way it was brought about was rather sudden and obvious in intention. As if the romance wasn't stiff enough as it is. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, I do enjoy the ever-present theme of \"good vs. bad\" within the show; to be more precise, angels vs. demons. It really plays off the characters really well, and I think it was a great setup. For instance, our \"antiheroine\" Akane comes from an assassin family skilled with swords while her half-sister's family offers protection in the form of a shield, or rather, a barrier. Likewise, we can say the same thing towards Seiji's sister - being on the good side - and Shikimi - being on the bad side. Interestingly enough, Guri is a living and breathing oxymoron herself. She's an angel, yet she loves to stir up trouble every so often. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe exaggeration of the characters' actions brings home the idea that this anime should not be taken too seriously. It's really more for entertainment value, rather than being realistic. From the faces they make to the times they should have \"died,\" the art makes sure to convey a comedic tone to it. Much to my surprise, it does a decent job of balancing out the tone in critical points. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThis department was pretty lackluster, admittedly. While it fits the general atmosphere, it's not exactly something you would want to listen to by itself. It has a somewhat quirky feel and generally compliments the show. Overall, it definitely gets the job done when it needs to, even if it's half-heartedly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nProbably the most disappointing aspect of the show. It's a comedy, and I get that; they are funny in their own way. Although, that's not necessarily a good reason to cling to when they get so predictable early on. After a first impression or two, it's pretty obvious to see that Akane is a yandere, Guri is a carefree spirit, Seiji is clueless, Yuzu is obsessive, Shikimi is sadistic, and Akua is a tsundere. It's not exactly original. There may be some character development here and there - which is great - but then why does it go back to being redundant almost immediately afterwards? The change is definitely there, but it's just extremely hard to tell sometimes. More often than not, it's stagnant. While the characters did bring a smile to my face once in a while, I would not go so far to say that they have depth. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, it's an entertaining show. I would recommend it to anime fans that are looking for something... \"peculiar.\" Despite the things it does right, it's just not my cup of tea. From my perspective, there were more negatives that outweighed the positives. As a whole, I would say it's pretty unoriginal yet amusing at best. You can interpret that however you wish. \\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 3/10.",

            "content": "Love is weird.  On one hand, you can fall head over heels for your partner, but you could also want to dig your fingers into their throat because of how annoying they can be.  I hope not every relationship is like that, but it can and has happened.  Through it all, love can be hilarious due to how nonsensical the concept it can be when you put it in perspective.  So why does it matter anyway?  Well to Renai Boukun (aptly titled \u2018Love Tyrant\u2019), it means a lot.  \r\nStory: Aino Seiji is just your typical harem protagonist.  Niceto everyone, easygoing, and comes into contact with a plethora of very troublesome women through very unfortunate circumstances.  After coming into contact with a girl who presents him with a \u201cKiss Note\u201d (Yes, it\u2019s a death note reference.  Don\u2019t think too hard about it), he is brought into the realm of couple-making where he must help couples get together, all the while dealing with a small trail of women himself.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is in a word, rushed.  Smashing together about forty or so chapters of the original manga into a twelve-episode anime, the story for Renai Boukun follows the story of a hyperactive fujoshi, a shrill, incestuous stalker, a kukuri wielding yandere, and the main protagonist, as they come across various, loosely love-based scenarios that culminate into\u2026something.  When looking at it from face value, it\u2019s quite unclear to understand what it is the show wants to be.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from the overall theme of love and how love exists in various kinds of romantic relationships, the show zip zaps around from being one-off episode comedy plots, to one-two episode long drama plots involving one of the main characters.  Due to the rushed nature of trying to get to the end, the show suffers from poor comedic timing, as the necessary time to let the audience breathe from in-between jokes is absent and thus makes it very difficult for the audience to really get a full kick out of what we\u2019re supposed to laugh at.  Not only that, it doesn\u2019t help that the show relies mostly on repeated gags in order to try and be funny either.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is character development.  Due to the fact that the show attempts to squeeze so much in so little, any and all character development that the show tries to accomplish feels contrived and stiff.  Two of the main girls in particular get arcs dedicated to them, and it doesn\u2019t really feel like they accomplish much of anything in the end because we\u2019re given less than hour each of total focus to even give a crap.  The ending doesn\u2019t really help either cause things are more or less thrown back into the status quo of things, so I guess like some aspects of life, some things never change.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story of Renai Boukun is a mess of fragments broken off from an existing manga shoddily put back together to try to create some semblance of an anime.  A lot of the in-between details are missing and while the show does tell a story in the end, it doesn\u2019t really feel genuine or rewarding because the journey watching these characters feels so half-hearted.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  TERRIBLE pacing (Some episodes are one chapter.  Others are three-four.)\\n\r\n-  Poor comedic timing\\n\r\n-  Contrived character development\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  If I\u2019ll give the show anything, it\u2019s that its main cast is\u2026something.  It\u2019s something all right.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, we have Aino Seiji.  Now I don\u2019t know why this guy is our protagonist of all characters, but I safely say that he is as bland as they come.  Seiji is your typical \u2018nice\u2019 protagonist: respects women, nice to all, easygoing, and most of all, dense.  Maybe he\u2019s not that last one so much, but the rest for sure.  The most interesting part about his character I\u2019d say is how he at least acknowledges the affection he gets from the girls (At least one of them) and has the willingness to be a kind soul regardless of the situation.  Which honestly is something you have to give to the guy considering his harem is filled with absolutely terrible people, deals with haphazardly stupid situations daily, and he gets blamed for stupid shit when his involvement in things aren\u2019t always his fault anyway.  Beyond that, he\u2019s about as interesting as a saltine cracker.  \\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Guri.  I want to separate this one from the rest of the harem specifically because she is the cause of everyone\u2019s problems.  Noted previously as the \u2018hyperactive fujoshi\u2019 who likes to cosplay, Guri doesn\u2019t understand love, yet does whatever she wants because she\u2019s a free spirit and can\u2019t be held down by any form of convention so long as it\u2019s fun and whatnot.  This can be a good archetype, except the show makes her really, really annoying.  For the most part, she causes a lot of the series\u2019 conflicts (she\u2019s the one that jumpstarted the plot anyway), leaving Seiji in particular to try and fix some things.  She\u2019s just\u2026not a very good character, especially since the ending tries its best to get the audience to care about her when the show up until that point gives us very little reason to give a damn in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019re the two half-sisters, Yuzu and Akane.  Yuzu shares similar problems with Guri, with most of her gags and annoyances coming off as creepy yuri as she jealously tries to garner the attention of her \u2018onee-sama\u2019 when in reality Akane gives little shits about her half-sister\u2019s attention.  Yuzu\u2019s whole saga throughout the series is all over the place and lacks enough cohesion to warrant any form of sympathy or care from the audience.  As for Akane, she acts as the series\u2019 mediator while also being batshit crazy herself.  Carrying kukuri knives and comically threatening anyone who gets in the way of her and Seiji, Akane is surprisingly the most level-headed member of the entire female cast as she carries a lot of reasoning and understanding that most of the girls in this series lack.  Of course she does share her own fair share of problems (like having her arc be completely rushed to the point it didn\u2019t even really matter), but in comparison, she fares so much better than the other girls in the series.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond them, the sidecast involves various family members of the characters\u2019 families (who are also all crazy might I add) that add to some of the arcs in various ways with similarly varying degrees of success, a bunch of cast members who provide their own one-off love stories to help fill up the runtime and provide a different kind of romantic relationship, and the rapey penguin.  Yes, you read that right.  Why he\u2019s there, I don\u2019t know, but he has a surprisingly large part (by supporting cast standards) in this series so\u2026that\u2019s there, I guess.  (There\u2019s also the character \u2018Shikimi\u2019, but we don\u2019t talk about her and how much of a bitch she is.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Some level-headed characters\\n\r\n-  Most of the cast is crazy (and not the good kind)\\n\r\n-  Rapey penguin?  (Don\u2019t know if this is necessarily a bad thing, but I\u2019m adding it.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by EMT^2, Renai Boukun\u2019s art is what I would describe as lazy.  The colors are blindingly bright to the point that it looks uncomfortable to watch; background characters are usually just gray silhouettes, and the characters just look gaudy with how the colors used on them are.  \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not even just the art.  The animation for some scenes clearly show little effort is put into them, thus giving off this really cheap, cost-efficient look to the whole thing that looks very uninteresting to look at.  Not only that, but character designs have their own sets of problems.  Personally I find Yuzu\u2019s hair very irritating to look at.  The huge pigtails on her sides combined with the cheap looking animation make her look like an eyesore every time she came on-screen.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Lazy, cheap looking art\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The OP known as\u2026\"Koi? de Ai? de Boukun desu!\u201d (Lord that\u2019s a mouthful) is a poppy, upbeat song that actually fits well with the show\u2019s wacky and comedic story.  Sure it\u2019s just a pop idol girl song, but it has merit to it for having a unique beat to it so that it\u2019s not just some generic anime opening that sounds similar to heaps of other openings from other shows.\\n\\n\r\nIts ED, 'Suki' wo Oshiete\u2019 on the other hand isn\u2019t so fortunate.  Comparatively, it\u2019s not really all that unique and falls into a generic sounding song that while sounds good, doesn\u2019t really have much in the way of memorabilia so that you would want to listen to it again, and not so you have to loop it in the background so you can accurately come up with the words to describe it.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent tracks\\n\r\n-  Ed isn\u2019t really all that memorable\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  Having read the Renai Boukun manga, the adaptation disappointed me for not only not being on the same level as the original, but for rushing so much to get to a certain point in the story that it had to sacrifice so much just to get there.  As such, I had a really hard time finding many positives to say since not only was the plot not that stellar to begin with, it actually got worse because it was adapted into something with a limited time frame.  As such, my enjoyment with this series dipped down a bit, and I really wish it didn\u2019t.  Because I did kind of enjoy just being forced to go along with the flow of things sometimes cause like the MC, there\u2019s really no other way out of it.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?  \\n\\n\r\nThere were a few choice moments I\u2019m glad they animated.  Not only that, but I\u2019m glad Akane mostly stayed intact.  Despite her obsessive nature, she\u2019s the series\u2019 main voice of reason and maintains her sensibility (mostly) throughout the show despite the random shit going on around her. \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn\u2019t I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nAside from the obvious plot problems, the rest of the girls in the main group: Guri, Yuzu, (and Shikimi, technically) really irk me.  Their archetypes to me are actually really unlikeable because not only do they center around one thing, which is being annoying, they do it so persistently throughout the series that it never feels like they have any kind of growth to them that would warrant me to like them.  There\u2019s almost no change with their characters and it upsets me that in a harem series of all things, there are very few candidates for \u2018best girl\u2019.  (Not like any of them really are stellar choices.)\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nIf you are going to watch this, turn your brain off.  Your enjoyment will skyrocket if you do.  Beyond that, this really isn\u2019t something worth recommending.  Its plethora of problems with its pacing and characters combined with a really cheap looking animation style make Renai Boukun a really difficult watch.  Coupled with poor comedic timing and a newbie seiyuu for Yuzu whose voice grates the ears, I honestly have a hard time finding many redeeming merits for this show to watch.  I\u2019d say read the manga if anything, but even then it\u2019s best to turn the good ol\u2019 noggin off.",

            "content": "----------\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\nThe following review is completely spoiler-free, and is meant for users who are curious about whether to watch the show or not. While I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself!\r\n---------\r\nPositives\r\n---------\r\n- Ridiculous Fun\r\nRenai Boukun is the classic example of a show that doesn't try and take itself too seriously. Its parodic intro to the show (with the \"Love Note\" parody) is a fittingly silly,tongue-in-cheek, and completely not subtle icon that symbolizes the whole show. The concept is crazy, the characters are ridiculous, and the hijinks they get up to are top notch. Additionally, there are many references and parodic elements that keep the energy going in the right direction.\\n\\n\r\n- Support Structure Story\\n\r\nDirect romances and the underlying romantic story as a whole are not spectacular, but they also do not take away from the show in the slightest. They act as a nice underlying current that runs confidently beneath the shenanigans pushed to the forefront. There's no needlessly contrived plot points or backstory, just ones that are handled quickly. As if to say: \"Look, this isn't the focus of the show, but that doesn't mean we were going to slack off on it\".\\n\\n\r\n- Charming Characters\\n\r\nRenai Boukun's core production strength is its ability to recognize exactly what to emphasize. While I've already mentioned its ridiculous comedy, the conduit to this comedy (the characters and their interactions) is arguably even more important. The characters were varied, yet equally ridiculous and the MC, Seiji-kun, was a good straight man to the rest of the show's goofy ways. Each of the main/major side characters felt sufficiently fleshed out for a 12 episode season, without feeling burdened with unnecessary fluff that could take away from the show's core feeling.\\n\\n\r\n- Matching Art Style\\n\r\nThe artistic style of the show does a fantastic job of not only contributing to the over-the-top moments of the show, but also serves as a very nice visual in between those times. There is a clear emphasis on popping colours and shining characters, which is exactly what a show like this should be pushing to the front.\\n\\n\r\n- Excellent OP\\n\r\nThis OP hits all the right points for me. Catchy music, character introductions, and a perfect set-up for the show you're about to watch. Never skipped it once, and it always got me in a \"Renai Boukun\" sort of mood.\\n\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nNegatives\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\n- Good, Not Great\\n\r\nOne of the disadvantages of pushing a few themes to the very forefront is that you leave some other elements behind. Let me be clear: Renai Boukun's overall story, character backgrounds, and world building are far from bad. They are adequate. As I mentioned above, this is to keep the comedy and madness at a high for as long as possible, but if you're looking for deep lore, complex characters, or an uber compelling romance plot, you won't find it here.\\n\\n\r\n- Kissed Potential\\n\r\nThe show's introductory episode was brilliant, and its roots in parody-ing \"Death Note\" with its counterpart, the \"Kiss Note\", was incredibly compelling and a great tool to get the characters in a wealth of kooky conundrums. Where the show goes wrong is where it throws that concept aside about halfway through the season. It leads to a generally disjointed feeling to the arc, as it takes back seat to slightly more serious arcs for each of the main girls. I wish they could have incorporated more of this fun concept into the story.\\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nSome anime is meant to tug at your heartstrings. Some anime is meant to fill you with a \"Go Get 'Em!\" spirit. Some anime captivates its audience with deep, twisting plots that have you drooling for more. Renai Boukun is not any of those shows. It doesn't break new ground with confidence or ease. But what it does do is allow you to turn your brain off for a little bit and enjoy pure, unadulterated ridiculousness. It doesn't take itself to serious (even in its more serious moments), and neither should you.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no more perfect analogy for Renai Boukun than to describe it as \"junk food\" anime. It's not particularly good for you, and it won't quell a deep hunger in dire anime situations. However, it will provide a light, focused entertainment series. It knows its strong points, and focuses on them, providing you with a silly, romcom to keep you smiling in between heartier meals.\\n\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nFinal Rating\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nWhile it makes for nice averages and wonderful sorting, when it comes to reviews I personally do not like direct numbering systems. Instead, I am to answer the question: \"Would you recommend I watch this show?\". So,\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of romcoms and/or harems, Renai Boukun is a perfect(ly silly) addition to your collection.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy shutting your brain off and wondering just what crazy situation a set of characters will get themselves into this time, you'll be right at home.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, if you're hoping for a heartier look into the genre(s), I'd recommend choosing a more refined, deeper anime.",

            "content": "I am loving it so far, especially after the fourth episode, where it takes an amazing turn. When I first started watching it I thought, hey, a normal romantic comedy, quite enjoyable. But after the fourth episode, I fell completely into it. . I really hope this new girl is common in the anime, because she made it fantastic. \r\n-Art-\r\nThe art is pretty great too. Though sometimes it tends to get loose, the dialogue makes up for it. \r\n-Character-\r\nOkay, so first we have the yandere, Akane. Honestly, quite a shocker but I was glad she did turn out to be one, added some spice intoit. After episode 3, she doesn't seem as Yandere though, maybe accepting the harem a little bit? Guri, pretty standard character, but she enjoys yaoi, so she s pretty much a yaoi fangirl.... Akane's sister, I can say I don't find too annoying, since I usually hate sister types(such as Oreimo), but she doesn't seem to want to get in the way of anyone in the harem, so I don't mind her. She is quite sweet as well. Shikimi(watch episode 4), just.. damn. She turned the tables on this anime with her personality, and I completely fell head over heels for this character. The main character is quite enjoyable as well, with his gags and all. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story is fairly harem-type, but it is still quite enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\n--Add on since I've watched the whole series now.\\n\\n\r\nI don't understand why people compare it to death note, at the beginning it has that \"Kiss Note\" but honestly the rest of the anime is not even similar. I do wish that Shikimi got more screen time, since she only kinda got added to the harem in the last episode. That's the only thing I would change. I also liked how they all loved each other at the ending as well, which made it more of how it is supposed to be, they're all in a relationship with each other.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Spoiler free review\r\nI welcome feedback on my reviews\r\nDo you have trouble with women? Can't talk to your school crush? Always wanted to build your dream harem? Well, look no further, cause we have a product made just for you. Introducing the Kiss Note! No Kira calm down stop laughing like a maniac we said Kiss Note not Death Note. Ugh anyway... With this handy little book, you can write down your name along with the name of your preferred crush and viola. One kiss and you'll become an official couple. You can even put down several names at once! Why have only one girlfriend whenyou can date your entire school? (even that weird girl that sits in the back drawing summoning circles) So don't wait, don't delay! Buy your very own Kiss Note today for the low low low low low price of 1 million dollars.\\n\\n\r\nDisclaimer: Only a cupid can activate the powers of the Kiss Note, it's basically useless in the hands of a human. But buy it anyway I need to buy an Akane body pillow help a guy in need\\n\\n\r\nLove Tyrant is a parody harem. We got our own male MC Seiji Aino who meets Guri, a cupid that accidentally wrote Seiji's name into her Kiss Note and now has to get him to kiss someone or she will die cause gotta keep that Death Note reference alive. We progress from there with Seiji hooking up with his crush Akane Hiyama, triggering a series of events that turn Seiji's life upside down. It gets pretty insane as Seiji tries to get used to all the shenanigans that has now arrived due to Guri's interference. There's not much story besides the few arcs that throw in some drama to spice things up, but these can either take away the silly charm of the show with some temporary seriousness (give us back our craziness drama!) or be quite heartwarming as we all declare our love for each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy here is the main and best aspect of Love Tyrant. The interactions that the characters have with each other and the crazy situations (that range from running away from a horny demonic demon penguins to dying and meeting your omnipotent father in law) are all incredibly funny, throwing joke after joke to keep you laughing without end. It pokes fun at harems and deres, subtly pointing out the ridiculousness of these tropes that we have become so used to The pacing does start off a little rushed, but it just adds onto the comedy as it gives us more and more hilarious scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty great as well. Akane is the school idol that turns out to be a kukri-wielding yandere, Yuzu Kichougasaki is a barrier creating tsundere lesbian who's in love with her sister, and you can't forget Guri, our lovable otaku cupid that loves creating yaoi ships and causing trouble. Even Seiji, who acts as our slightly dumb Harem MC, has a certain charm to him with his attempts to keep his girlfriends under control so they don't end up causing too much damage. The rest of the characters (which consists of cupids, sadists, gods, angels, demons, super-powered assassins and bodyguards, the list goes on and on just like this sentence I should really stop) are just introduced to create more comedy or drama, but they get enough screen time across the show to let you see their own unique personalities and quirks\\n\\n\r\nRomance is handled quite nicely with the whole harem skit. There aren't any pussy men that can't handle being 10 metres around women. In fact, there are several dates and kisses shared across the harem as the anime progresses. Sure the show isn't really that romance heavy as we have Seiji trying to figure things out due to him keeping some generic harem mc traits, but the rest of the show is able to make up for it with its comedy and the occasional sweet moments that just makes your heart skip a little.\\n\\n\r\nLove Tyrant is definitely not for everyone. Due to it being a harem and comedy anime, there are many people will get turned off due to that fact that they either dislike the overused idea of several girls dating one guy or just don't enjoy the comedy the show has to offer. However, I highly recommend this show to everyone to at least try out for a few eps. If you dislike it, drop it. If you enjoy it, welcome to the club. We'll get Guri to write your name in the Kiss Note so you can join the harem.",

It has a promising start, setting up an interesting concept that\u2019s slightly different yet feels familiar at the same time! This is achieved in the following way, familiar cause it falls for the same corny ironies such as an MC who\u2019s both dense and uncertain about what he wants while at the same time the anime differs itself with its near perfect timing of comedy which is really the best type! Even though it starts off with an amazing pace, itends on an annoying and boring term because it can\u2019t help shake off all its clich\u00e9d tropes. The beginning part worked because the anime understood itself and accepted it without any regrets! What I mean is that the writers knew this show isn\u2019t for everybody so they didn\u2019t waste any time in pleasing everyone, instead they just throw you into this messy story and let you decide whether you want to stick with it or not! It made a point of mocking the Harem genre which worked for a while but later the joke turns on them itself! Comedy is the best thing here, hitting you with unexpected type of jokes which is always fun. But they pretty much bash your head with the same type of gags again and again until it becomes irritating. Towards the end, they jolted to focus more on their preposterous concept by reducing their Comedy which sucked out all the fun from the anime, making everything dull and the climax was pointlessly hastened. \\n\\n\r\nA cupid cosplaying as a demon named Guri is not very good with her job since she doesn\u2019t understand the concept of Love. Ironic, right? On top of that, she gets bored all the time cause she\u2019s freaking dense so she easily gets distracted from her task whenever something \u2018Fun\u2019 comes around! She crosses paths with the MC, Seiji who\u2019s your clich\u00e9d nice guy surrounded by pretty girls, and writes his name in the \u2018Kiss Note\u2019 which is a diary that makes people fall in love once their names are written in it. But in typical \u2018Death Note\u2019 fashion, if only 1 name is written then that person must find a partner quickly or remain a virgin for life! Seiji resolves to put Akane\u2019s name next to his cause he has a secret crush on her which\u2019s suitable because Akane\u2019s crazy about Seiji as well which is very fortunate for him. When I say crazy, I mean literally cause unfortunately she also happens to be a psychological Yandere character who gets effortlessly envious and resorts to extreme violence at once! Sadly, that\u2019s all she does, for the anime opts to replay that same joke over and over again where Akane gets mad and starts stabbing someone! Then Guri, in her nonsensical habit, adds her name into this relationship just cause she thinks it will be fun! Soon the follow up is Akane\u2019s half-sister, Yuzu, who also adds her name cause she\u2019s in love with Akane and this is where the plot starts to make no sense so you should just go along with it. Oh yeah, Yuzu is a clumsy girl who has this morbid fixation for Akane which was creepy to watch but since this is a Harem she also starts eliciting feelings for Seiji as well. Anyway, at one point all must help this lazy plus hyper cupid to do her job cause otherwise they all will end up in hell for some lame reason and that\u2019s how the show starts. Boy that was hard to explain! And what\u2019s worst is this plot rarely ever surfaces again! The story is weak throughout the series, the only difference is that it\u2019s commencement was buoyed with a riveting idea which is why it\u2019s tolerable at first. But due to the half ass effort, the anime later fails to hit the right points with its storytelling which is why it gives off a bitter and boring vibe when the show shifts its focus to more serious exposition! This is the reason why sub plots like the whole family drama between Akane and Yuzu or the backstory with Guri didn\u2019t land with the audience since it lacked any real depth to it. An attempt was made to flesh out their female characters but they were so rushed and poorly done, I couldn\u2019t help ask why even bother? Proper development is achieved by giving details and time to tell a well-fashioned tale which is never applied here, instead characters are one note with distinctive epitomes of other anime\u2019s.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork falls in with every other Harem anime with its bright colours and fan service but there was something with the character designs that caught my eyes for I could tell something was off but I can\u2019t seem to place it! It was slightly distracting! The animation met the standard outlooks despite some untraditional attempts with the camera angles. Even the sound effects used to play up the humour wasn\u2019t very notable but the Dubs here was great, nicely capturing the vibe for these whacky characters which the Subs failed to carry. Both OP/ED botched to leave any impression and shall be forgotten quickly though the video for OP was kinda nice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the first few episodes, thinking this might turn into a great Comedy anime for I didn\u2019t mind its chaotic setup or straightforward characters. And I did laugh at some jokes though this show needed more since it lacked fresh and self-aware humour, rather much of its Comedy comes from overused gags which becomes dull after a while. With nothing else going on except for clich\u00e9d characters and story that relies heavily on repeatable puns, it turned this \u2018could have fun show\u2019 to a predictable one that just can\u2019t be recommended to others! Instead I offer you to check out \u2018Kono Subarashi\u2019 that really nails the head with its Comedy, Story and Characters!",

            "content": "Plenty of rom-com series focuses on school life relationships these days between young teens. I can\u2019t say this enough but every season seems to have them in some way or form. Then, there\u2019s Renai Boukun which seems normal at first. But then, you add a thing called the \u201cKiss Note\u201d, a red headed yandere, a Shinigami, angels, and you get a show of bizarre shenanigans. \r\nAdapted by the manga of the same name, Renai Boukun is what I envision as a parody or perhaps deconstruction of the rom-com genre. The series starts off with Aino Seiji, a normal high student living his daily life asusual. That is, until one day\u2026he encounters Guri, a female Shinigami who shows him a Kiss Note. It\u2019s a supernatural notebook that makes anyone who has their name written together instantly fall in love if they kiss each other. Things take a weird twist when Seiji\u2019s name gets written into the book and he kisses his long time crush, Akane. See where this is going? A bizarre rom-com that adds in supernatural context to entertain the viewers. For me, I think it\u2019s some popcorn comedy that will easily draw some laughs.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing to mention, Renai Boukun excels at selling its humor. The show has romance but delivers it in such a way that you can\u2019t help but laugh at it. The comedy is played out that can feel ridiculous with characters such as Akane, the beautiful and popular yandere. In almost every scene they are together, she obsessively attaches herself to Seiji. Whenever she senses that Seiji may be \u201ccheating\u201d on her, she goes into full yandere mode in comedic fashion. On the other hand, there\u2019s Guri who seems rather oblivious to the concept of love. The first few episodes shows that she is a very playful girl with a childish personality. Akane doesn\u2019t get along with her as she sees Guri as a \u201clove rival\u201d. In essence, the show portrays their rivalry as a humorous gag rather than a serious drama story. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, that\u2019s not all. The show introduces more girls into Seiji\u2019s life that adds more humor into the show. Yuzu (half-sister of Akane) adds some subtle yuri context as she seems to be in love with Akane. Her relationship with Seiji is mixed as she sees him as an obstacle but also seems to falling for Seiji as the story progresses. Shikimi Shiramine (Yuzu and Akane\u2019s cousin) adds perhaps a more dramatic element of the show. She doesn\u2019t seem to get along with anyone and sees life like a game. Manipulative and cunning, she enjoys afflicting people and having fun with her games. The relationship she share with Seiji can get quite indecent at times. Unlike Akane, she doesn\u2019t seem to be actually in love with Seiji but often tries to seduce him for the fun of it. Her role in the show adds more drama than any others as some of her actions really influence the plot and characters. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the amount of humor injected into the show, there\u2019s also some genuine relationship building in particular with Seiji\u2019s sister, Aqua. As the tomboyish sister, Aqua seems to have a rocky relationship with Seiji and we\u2019re shown why through some background storytelling. The series takes a more realistic approach at developing that relationship after certain evens happen in the show. So in a way, not every relationship in this show is a comedy gag. Akane also faces emotional troubles of her own and the series brings that into more light in later episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAs most viewers can expect by now, Renai Boukun is pretty much saturated with comedy that doesn\u2019t even feel like rom-com. Some may can it at a harem given the male-female ratio of the cast. I would say that the show can be enjoyed if you watch it for humor. However, the storytelling itself isn\u2019t well written and in particular, I can\u2019t really connect with the plot from most of the episodes. Only a few episodes portrays itself in a more serious manner and even then, it brushes off in a quick fashion afterwards. The supernatural context can quickly grow dull once you\u2019ve seen it a dozen times. One other issue I find in this show is the presence of Yuzu. This girl has a personality that seems even more childish compared to Guri and I find her presence to be extremely annoying. Seiji himself isn\u2019t an interesting character either. In retrospect, the characters in this can easily be distracting to watch and despite their humorous roles, they don\u2019t stand out particularly much on their own.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, I have some rather mixed feelings. Characters such as Guri, Akane, and Shikimi stands out by their designs while others such as Seiji and Aqua looks too normal. Comedy is portrayed through character expressions that is effective to sell its comedy. However, it sometimes relies on it too much at times that feels uncanny. Oh and some characters just looks ridiculous. I mean, a demonic penguin? An angelic cat? Really? The character designs also has some distracting outlines around them that can be bothersome to look at.\\n\\n\r\nTo say the least, the soundtrack of Renai Boukun is just silly. The OP and ED theme songs parodies character relationships and puts little effort into the choreography. It\u2019s only catchy enough with its lyrics although on most parts, I find it to be absurd. However, I would add that character voice mannerism is memorable particularly with Akane\u2019s yandere tone and Shikimi\u2019s manipulative voice.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch Renai Boukun? Is it worth the time? Honestly, the answer to that is up to you because supernatural rom-coms like this is adapted to create laughter. By the end of the day, it hopes to make you laugh rather than getting you invested into the story. When I finished watching this show, I can\u2019t really look back and say \u201cI should have watched this sooner\u201d.\\n",

            "content": "A cosplaying angel descends to Earth with the goal of utilizing her magical Kiss Note to create couples (preferably yaoi ones) by writing their names down in it to make them fall in love with each other, and somehow manages to end up in a 4-way relationship between herself, a yandere, a lesbian siscon and a perfectly ordinary guy. Sounds ridiculous? Well, that's Renai Boukun in a nutshell for you.\r\nThis is a hilarious parody of your stereotypical romcom, Death Note and more. Renai Boukun does not take itself seriously whatsoever and is packed to the brim with light-hearted gags and references. It is utterly sillyin every sense of the word but doesn't pretend to be anything else, resulting in a plethora of shameless, unapologetic comedy. And oh boy is it fun to watch. When the mischievous angel Guri arrives in the average joe Seiji's life, she helps him finally being able to get together with the girl of his dreams\u2014Akane\u2014only for him to find out that she was actually a psychopathic yandere all along with madly possessive feelings of love for him. And when Akane's little sister Yuzu confesses that she in turn had always been in love with her own sister, things quickly become about as chaotic as it gets after all four of them are roped together into a twisted relationship thanks to the power of Guri's Kiss Note, which also gives them all immortality. Add to that a creepy dog-angel, a giant black rapist penguin of doom and you've got yourself one hell of a strange anime. The whole thing is all over the place, but it results in a ton of absurd slapstick comedy which is very well-executed in general.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Renai Boukun however is that it doesn't maintain the same quality for very long. The first four episodes are hilarious, but starting with episode five, Renai Boukun starts to drop off pretty fast. And it starts with the introduction of a new girl called Shikimi, who just so happens to be *another* psychopath, but unlike Akane, this girl is one of the most obnoxious characters I've ever seen. She is the epitome of being crazy for the sake of being crazy with little rhyme or reason attached to it. But her being annoying in person is not the main problem, but rather that she takes the role of the villain in the story and starts interfering with the main characters consistently for her own strange reasons, which results in the anime as a whole becoming significantly more serious as there's now an enemy they have to fight. Thus, the hilarious comedy/parody content almost disappears entirely to make room for it, which is an awful trade-off. It just leaves you wishing that the story would've kept doing what it was doing originally instead.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to the manga, Renai Boukun is technically a pretty rushed adaptation in terms of how much content is covered in every episode, but given the hysterical and hyperactive nature of the show, the faster pacing ends up working out alright anyway I think (kind of like with the Prison School adaptation). However, the genre-switch unsurprisingly bothered me just as much in the anime as it did in the manga, and that is the main downfall of Renai Boukun.\\n\\n\r\nNow that doesn't mean that the show isn't worth watching all of a sudden. The first few episodes are quite good and even later on it's still bearable, albeit not great. It's just one of those series which leaves you with a bad taste in the mouth solely because you know it could have been so much better still.",

When comparing it to other anime of the same caliber, then it's arguably one of the better ones.\r\nIt starts off making us laugh right off the bat with constant parodies like the kiss note (death note reference) and while it does go \"downhill\" after the first few episodes, it doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. Yes, you may not laugh as much as you used to but if you don't compare the episodes and judge them individually, it isn't that bad.\r\nThe characterswhom all have their own trope, use it to their advantage. They take it and use it to entertain us. They all have their own distinct trait that make them stand out from each other which can be pretty obvious because of the beautiful and clear animation. They aren't \"fleshed out\" but as since this is a character driven anime and the only purpose for them is to give us humor, then it's safe to say they did a good job.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, that doesn't make it an excuse to ignore the flaws of it. It did have lot's of potential wasted. It did go downhill to a certain extent. But in the end, it still made me laugh a ton and it would take more than 10 hands to count how many times i've smiled.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like harems, comedy, an actual decent harem protag, yandere, parodies, and overall mindless fun then this is your go-to anime. Definitely a must-watch. Trust me on this one.",

Guri, an angel with the absolute power to make people fall in love for the rest of their lives, has dedicated her life to randomly pairing men together for funsies! On nothing but her own whim and an inability to comprehend any level of responsibility,  she pairs random couples--who now have to spend their lives together\u2014forever. \r\nAt this point I feel that it\u2019s important to tell you that her power stems from a \u201cKiss Note\u201d that looks exactly like the Death Note. They make a joke aboutit. It\u2019s funny. They laugh. I\u2019m dead inside. \\n\r\nFor some reason or another, please don\u2019t ask the particulars of her incredible gift. I\u2019ve tried to determine the exact rules and all I know after 5 episodes is that there are no rules. None. Any rules that do get set in place are almost immediately broken or contradicted or both.  The more you watch, the more you realize you are actually in hell.\\n\r\nBut back to what is probably considered \u201cplot.\u201d Guri has now put herself in a relationship by writing her name, the main anime boy \u2122\u2019s name, his crush, and his crush\u2019s sister\u2019s name in the notebook and connecting them together. \\n\r\nThe little sister wants to bone the bigger sister, main anime boy\u2122 wants to bone the bigger sister, the bigger sister wants to kill fuck the main anime boy\u2122, and also the sisters have a cousin who just wants to plain kill all of them? And they\u2019re all forced to love Guri\u2014who thinks this is all hilarious and fun. And remember, they\u2019re together forever. \\n\r\nThey exist in a landscape built of psychological horror. \\n\r\nThey\u2019re not allowed to love anyone else. Ever. I mean, I think I\u2019d feel bad for them, but even the little sister loses sympathy points after she sneaks into her sister\u2019s changing room and takes naked pictures\u2014which Guri then promptly sends to the love\u2026pentagon?\\n\r\nSo this is the conclusion of my 2:30AM anime review of this PILE OF BURNING TRASH.  I watched this with my friend and we are both a little bit less human because of it. \\n\r\nTL;DR: This anime is hell and anyone who likes pink haired girl as a character should reevaluate themselves as a living being. Stalking is not cute.\\n\\n\r\n(This was edited by my dear friend so it is easier to read and conveys the point better)",

Forget all about this having anything to do with Death Note, that connection is nothing more than the type of comedy that most people who worship Death Note won't like at all.\r\nEverything except story gets an 8 from me, this is also the first time I've ever loved (instead of absolutely despised) a yandere because she isn't just aviolent bitch for no reason.

            "content": "Another excellent example of a great Harem RomCom, Renai Boukun leaves it's mark as one of the really good anime of its kind out there. And with good reason too.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story like most other harem, picks up the pace quickly at the start and slows down towards the middle. It was really hilarious to see how it turned out as the comic Death Note parody is featured almost everywhere throughout and it adds to the humor (especially if you've watched Death Note). The pace is slow like I mentioned before and helps familiarise with the characters. Though apart from the Death Note parody itbrought nothing new to the table, which in itself isn't much of a disadvantage but could've helped score higher.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was amazing. A special mention goes for the way the eyes were designed. It looked really beautiful to say the least. And another special place was the coloring. They coloring was very vibrant and bright and set it apart from most other anime too. EMT\u00b2 did a brilliant job here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was above average I could say. The VAs did a good job but the background music felt lacking and the OP/ED weren't that great either. I found myself listening to them maybe once or twice while watching and the rest of the time I skipped them. Other than that it was ok.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nYou can't expect much character development from a harem anime, and so the same was felt here albeit with the inclusion of a Yandere (Akane) which was very new and a really good idea.\\n\\n\r\nSeiji: Our Resident dense MC, Seiji isn't that dense you could say as he realised others' feelings maybe an episode or two faster than the average dense MC. Apart from that, it was nice to see him taking somewhat of an active role with the characters (especially because he started dating Akane from the first episode itself (so not a spoiler :P) which clears any existing faults within him.\\n\\n\r\nAkane: A textbook example of a well-done Yandere. Akane is everything you could ask for from an anime girl. Looks, personality, a bit of Yandere too if you may and there you have it! Nonetheless she was one of the strong points of the anime (pun intended) and not a second went by without my appreciation of her great character.\\n\\n\r\nGuri: Strangely it's tough to categorise Guri into an archetype, and I was happy with that as it showed that this anime did have something original to bring to the table too. Strangely even though she was a main character she didn't get the focus she needed until the final arc that spanned just two episodes. And let's just say it wasn't all that satisfying. The actual final anime ending was very memorable though, I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI had a lot of laughs with Renai Boukun. It's 'plain stupid' comedy approach was very well done and I found myself laughing at almost every situation. The same could be said of the romance, though not too fulfilling it made it's important mark too. A lot of the things appealed to me in Renai Boukun especially the fact that it wasn't just a story of love it was a story ABOUT love, which isn't something I see everyday.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.8\\n\\n\r\nRenai Boukun is one of the best examples you could give to someone who's new to Harem RomCom anime. It's got an almost perfect balance of all the three along with a sweet slice of life added to it. It's brilliant art style by EMT\u00b2 steals the show for me. The characters were applaudable too. One of the best Harem RomComs out there!\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Akane is best girl <3",

            "content": "Let me start by saying this, Love tyrant is an underrated show. That being said it isn't perfect and far from it, it's pretty sloppily made  and can seem very uninspired, which it might very well be, but if you are willing to go past that and stop expecting a \"normal\" show you will find that it is an extremely entertaining parody of the most clich\u00e9 tropes in anime. \r\nWhether it is on purpose or by accident, they reuse every tired anime trope but instead of adding something original, they crank it up to 11 which leads to everything the characters do being incoherentwith the story in an unprecedented clash that will instantly shatter any bit of immersion you may have had in the story. This contrast between what is expected and what you get turns out to be a very powerful tool of parody making the viewer realise the storytelling flaws of widely accepted anime conventions.\\n\\n\r\nOf course this premise would get tired very quickly were it not for the humor put forward by the show. I'm not going to praise it as being a work of genius or anything, the laughter comming mostly from simple shock humor and visual gags but let's be real, this is anime we are talking about, the bar is already set pretty low on what constitutes a funny bit. So as I was saying, the jokes are not all that great but the writers manage to keep it relatively fresh and though I wouldn't say I laughed at all the gags, not even most of them, but a couple moments managed to make me laugh out loud (something I rarely do) even if it was only at how jarring some parts are.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately it goes a bit downhill at the end when  the \"story\" took a turn to something more serious, in any capacity this thing has to be, and lost the one redeeming quality it had. You end up having to follow for 2 episodes these washed up jokes of characters trying desperately to have some development that would lead to a climax and doing so, threw out the window every bit of surprise or weird factor that it previously had. All of this strongly hinted at the fact that the writer did intend to write an actual story but nevertheless, I dont believe that the intent takes away anything.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, can I say that it was a good show? Not really, but it sure was entertaining to watch because in the end, even though I'm not exactly sure if I was laughing with or at it, I can tell you one thing, I was laughing. \\n",

            "content": "Real Score 6.75\\10\r\nLet's get this straight, Renai Boukun(Or Love Tyrant) is not a Death Note parody, it just takes the Death Note element but it's not trying to parody that show. Renai Boukun is a parody of the Harem genre: in a time where we had the Superhero\\Shonen Parodies, Adventure\\Fantasy Parodies and even Daily life parodies, we never actually had a fully developed parody of the Harem genre. Renai Boukun starts incredibly well, it takes some of the worst and best elements of the Harem genre and makes fun of them in a clever and funny way, the characters are walking parodies of typical Haremstereotypes: we have The Yandere, The Good guy everyone falls in love with, the Tsundere eccetera...\\n\r\nThe biggest problem lies in the rundown of the show, in fact the more we good deep in the show, the more we approach the end, the more the show falls in the same Clich\u00e9 abyss that it tries to make fun of, it never loses its identity but it loses a lot of steam and that entertainment shown in the first 3 episodes\\n\\n\r\nStory 6.25\\n\r\nThe story is simple and effective, and it should have stayed that way the entirety of the rundown, shows like these don't need a convoluted and serious story, however, during the end, the show  makes the enormous mistake  to take itself too seriously with a subplot that could have been easily avoided. The parody elements are quite funny, it takes a little bit of everything that we know or have seen and parodies them in a really fun way, just look at the Akane characters, she's a walking Yandere and Rias(HighScholl DxD) parody. Here everything is overly exaggerated  and approached in a humorous and, i have to say, kind of unique way: it's nothing new, but some of the directions of the story are pretty unexpected in their exaggeration\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6.5\\n\r\nThe characters are, by far, the most entertaining part of the Anime, Aino Seiji is your typical  stereotype of the genuine good guy that everyone fall in love with, but everyone that surrounds him is that damn good. Akane is your typical Yandere, but she's so exaggerated and she's put in so many incredible situations, all in order to show a different take of the Yandere character and, at the same way, parody the Yandere in general. Yuzu is your typical Tsundere, she's bipolar and could be annoying sometimes , but if you take her as a parody of all of the Tsunderes you know and, maybe, love, if you see her in a different light, you can actually see and get what the author tried to express trhough Yuzu, a good and charming parody of the Tsundere. Shikimi is the least developed and, to be honest, her character arc is nonexistant, she's just there for the sexy shots and for the sadist moments, not that good. But the best character also is  the incarnation of the theme of the Anime: i'm talking about Guri, she is the quintessential essence of the parody part of this Anime, she's funny, charming, she doesn't care about the story, spits references every 5 minutes(some really funny) and acts like she wants the story to follow the patterns of the genre, while at the same time parodying them. Too bad that Guri suffers from the same problem of all the characters and the story itself, her character arc is wasted and it takes itself too seriously, taking all of her magic and charm away\\n\\n\r\nSound 7\\n\r\nThe music perfectly gets the tone and, Satoshi Motoyama really did an incredible job capturing the themes and parody aspect of the show in his compositions. The Opening, done by Wake up Girls, also is perfect fpr the show, energetic, dynamic, exagerated and over the top. The soundtrack is energetic thourghout the entire  show, never goes beyond that, and it has not the need to do it, the music's fine as it is\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Direction 7\\n\r\nThe drawings and the art are pretty cool, the white and trasparent lines add that little bit of exaggeration needed to the characters. The frames look good but some of the drawings, especially in the background, are lackluster. The direction is standard, it's good but it suffers some problems, especially in the \"FanService\" shots, which become tiring really fast. The animation is solid and the bright colours fit the parody element really well\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7.5\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun with this Anime, even though i didn't like the serious tone that the final episodes take. Comedy can be subjective, i know that, but the parody elements and, knowing the Harem genre, the way the show parodies them, makes fun of them and basically spits in some of the most famous tropes. Quick mention to some of the reactions and faces of the characters, they're really cool and pretty amazing at times, they have that Gintama vibe that's always appreciated. I laughed at some of the references, there are a lot of them, and a pretty fun time overall, i really enjoyed the jokes and parody element, and Guri was always entertaining, until the end of course\\n\\n\r\nSo this was Renai Boukun, a really fun show, a really interesting parody of Harem  genre while, at the same time, being a funny take of some  of the most common characters in Anime industry. It could have been a really fun satire\\parody if it just didn't take itself too seriously at the end end if ti didn't add a characters who's just there for, i guess, sadistic purposes(I think). This, however, doesn't take that much away from what Renai Boukun really is: a nice, funny and amusing to spend your time, just turn your brain off for a little bit and enjoy this really fun ride that was \"Renai Boukun\". Thanks for reading this review, May our Sweet and Merciful Madoka be with you and with the power of The Kiss Note, you will all fall in love with Our Sweet Lady, who will enlighten you with Her Dear Kiss",

I am just going to give you a straight  review\r\nStory 5\\10\r\nFirst off, its a parody of death not and a slice of life\\comedy anime so not really looking for much.  The story is based off our MC meeting Guri an angel trying to make couples. This is done through the kiss note which is essential the death note but you write two peoples names and they fall in love. This anime follows that story for a bit than focuses on the charactersmore or less the second half of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7\\10\\n\r\nThe character are not linear and have backstories that are explained properly or given a good shot at least. The characters besides the MC make the show worth watching. Most of them have some generic tropes along with there own spice or something totally new and the show made me laugh quite a bit. For a while now most \"comedy anime\" has made  me cringe or sigh more than laugh so this anime was a nice pick up for this alone.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8\\10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is very nice with some cool art styles in the op and the anime. It was nice to see something new that worked so well. It was a real treat to look at.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7\\10\\n\r\nThis anime is a fairly good comedy done right with some problems sure but if your looking for a good parody\\comedy this is worth picking up. right now the chances of a second season are basically 0 since  the manga is not much further ahead than the anime along with popularity not being high but for what we have alone, its better than most comedys coming out today.\\n",

            "content": "Death Note is easily one of the most popular and instantly recognisable anime out there, currently sitting at the number one spot here on MAL for the number of members it has. It's a show that has been referenced and parodied time and time again by fans of the show, as well as in other anime. However, Renai Boukun, otherwise known as Love Tyrant, takes it a step further by making an entire show a parody of Death Note itself! And it's completely mediocre, with forced and bland comedy that becomes stale incredibly quickly, a lacklustre cast of characters while, at the same time, hardlydoing anything with its set-up or parody elements. I honestly really wanted to like this, I really did, but each passing episode became even more incredibly bland and dull than the last resulting in an end product that most people will forget in only a couple of months and leaving me with a feeling of genuine disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nAs I just mentioned, the show is essentially a parody of the series Death Note, but in this instance, the Death Note is now replaced with a new book called the Kiss Note; an extremely powerful tool that, when two names are written inside it next to each other, they will both fall madly in love with each other regardless of the gender, providing that they kiss one another that is. This feature, in particular, comes greatly in use for the yaoi enthusiast,  Guri, a hyperactive idiot cupid whose task is to match up potential couples with each other. However, she accidentally writes the main protagonist's name in the book, by the name of Seiji Anno, and he has to kiss someone otherwise Guri will die (which we later learn is an outright lie). He decides to kiss his crush, who turns out to have a mad obsession with our bland as hell main character here, bordering on Yandere tendencies, pulling out random knives and swords from her tits in the same way a girl may keep her phone down there or something? They eventually do kiss, but Guri makes herself, and Yandere-chan, known as Akane, into a three-way relationship, eventually adding Akane's sister,  Yuzu (who actually loves Akane) into the mix. And that's pretty much it for an overall narrative, which, I believe is fine for a comedy anime as long as the characters are fun and the comedy is funny and varied, which, unfortunately, is something I believe the anime lacks.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, let's discuss the wasted potential in the Death Note parody gimmick and set-up of the narrative. Despite being a parody of said series, Love Tyrant hardly utilises the Kiss Note to any substantial merit and the show pretty much forgets about this item throughout much of the duration, which, in my eyes, is wasted potential for some comedic moments. It feels like the Kiss Note was added as a way to make the show more marketable by riding on the popularity of Death Note, rather than being used as satire. There is no clever meta-commentary or callbacks to the actual series either, so the Kiss Note, aside from being used to start the story, feels inconsequential and rather pointless to boot. Not only that, but the comedy, for the most part, feels incredibly weak and trite despite the potential in the first two episode. I'll honestly admit, that the first two episodes of Love Tyrant are actually pretty funny and engaging to boot; I was having a great time with the show. The jokes, at the beginning anyway, felt fresh and they often were more hit than miss, but, as the show progresses, it feels more tiring to watch since they never switch up the dynamics and repeat the same jokes throughout. This makes the show feel so damn repetitive to watch, and repeating the same jokes is essentially a cardinal sin in comedy; it becomes stale by episode five! In addition, the jokes and comedy itself feels extremely forced and most jokes can be seen a mile away before they're even delivered! It doesn't help all too much either that the characters have hardly any chemistry with one another nor do their personalities bounce off each other well either.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sake of argument, let's compare it to another comedy this year, from the previous season, called Gabriel Dropout. While that show is not a comedic masterpiece or anything, it was able to remain a fun ride throughout since its characters had defined personalities which had chemistry with one another, while, at the same time, spicing things up just enough with its joke variations to keep things from becoming too stale. This doesn't happen in this show and each joke feels as bland as the last. There is no snowball effect taking place, nor are the character's personalities strong enough to carry the weight of the show. The comedic timing could also feel pretty off, and often at times jarring! The problem with the show is that it doesn't quite know if it wants to be a comedy, a drama or an edge-fest and combines them all together, with an end result that feels clunky to watch. It's not necessarily uncommon for anime to combine multiple genres together, but here there is hardly any downtime between any of the events, so in one moment they are laughing and joking, and in the immediate next, the main character is being tortured. There is no downtime between any of these events and thus it can feel really awkward and jarring while watching the show since the pacing for this show is strangely inconsistent, but is normally pumped up to eleven at all times. Again, for the sake of argument, Gintama is also an anime that features a lot of comedy intermixed with more serious and emotional moments, but, in that show, these two never feel all too intrusive on each other since there is a good amount of downtime between each one. Perhaps this is an unfair comparison considering the sheer difference in the lengths of both shows, but there are plenty of other shows that can achieve this, so why not this one?\\n\\n\r\nThis doesn't help when the music for the show is so badly implemented and placed at the worst of times. One of the worst examples comes from episode eight in which the main character is being continuously stabbed with a sharp object, while light and carefree music is being played over it, music that would fit right at home in children's shows. It just feels, yet again, jarring, and that's the best word I can use to describe this show: jarring.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters, they don't fare much better. The main character is as boring in personality as he is in visual design. He plays the typical main character lead; spiky hair, getting embarrassed when a girl gets close to him, and so on and so forth. He is a rather boring character, who is pushed into playing the straight man role for the group and nothing else beyond that. He responds with the typical reactions you'd expect from a character in his position and jumps in to save the day whenever he is needed to do so. He is not a bad character necessarily, just an extremely dull one. Akane has a little bit more going for her, in that we do actually learn her back-story, which does explain the reason behind her action and general personality, details I can appreciate, it's just that each scenario and joke she is in, always is about how she is a yandere, while, at the same time, pulling out weapons from her tits. While beautiful in her visual appearance, her character doesn't really have all too much in likeability nor does she receive all too much development as a person either, aside from her rebellion against her mother in the eighth episode of the show. Yuzu receives a little bit of exploration into her character and reasoning behind her love for Akane, while, at the same time having superpowers (which the show never actually explains why she has those now that I am thinking about it) but, again, it feels like I'm repeating myself here, needed more in the way of development in order for her character to be good. The only character I liked was Guri, mainly because I have a soft spot for his aloof idiot types of characters, but I generally found her to be kind of charming in her own little way. I liked her character design perhaps the most, and the various facial expressions she did were kind of funny in their own little way, although nothing remarkable as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing I can praise, it is the artwork and general look of the show. It is very colourful and pops pretty well, and, as I said, I liked the various faces and chibi-ness of some of the facial expressions too. I also liked the opening and ending tracks, especially the opening which is incredibly catchy. It's upbeat, lively and full of energy, which, the rest of the show should have been as well, which is a shame since it did have a few things going for it. Some of the comedic moments were alright and the initial set up was good, but unfortunately, the show was not funny in my eyes. \\n\\n\r\nBut this is where it becomes difficult, however. Comedy is something that is extremely subjective, and thus, I can imagine many people finding this show very funny to watch, which is completely fine. After all, many people consider the second season of Konosuba to be weaker than its prequel, yet I found it funny still, which is something I have to consider when talking about comedy. My sense of humour is pretty damn strange, and I find pleasure in absurd humour. On that end, I would like to recommend this show, on account that you personally may find it funny to watch, but, on the flip side, there are so many other comedy anime out there that take the time to write much more varied jokes that don't come across as forced or jarring when they switch to a more serious tone. It's unfortunate that I didn't enjoy this show, since, as I said in the opening paragraph, I really did want to like this show, but I just couldn't...\\n",

Given that it's a parody, expect some over-the-top humor displayed through unrealistic situations. It doesn't, by any means, take itself serious: This casual anime is simply one that contains some light-hearted humor. In addition, it contains yuri, yaoi fandom, and the yandere archetype, in case you're a fan of one of those three. (It has more yandere--and a super obvious form of it--than the other two.)\r\nI would have to say the production (story, art, sound, etc.) is pretty standard forbeing 2017. It's neither a piece of art nor is it sub-par in quality. We'll see if it continues to deliver as its story develops. If nothing else, Renai Boukun has the rare yandere archetype and is a parody of the most popular anime on MyAnimeList. (I mean, it really boggles my mind how no one has yet parodied Death Note since it's been out for over 10 years.) Renai Boukun got my interest.",

            "content": "*No spoiler review*\r\nTL;DR: A deconstructed school harem rom-com parody that is actually quite fun to watch if you are ready for a Love Octagon of epic proportion. The humour never dies, the seriousness never shines. The love comes and goes & the parody just flows. \r\n[Story: 5/10 , Characters: 7/10, Art: 7/10, Sound: 6/10, Enjoyment: 7/10]\r\nWhat do you get if you give the power of something serious as \"Kiss Note\" (similar to Death Note but kissing) to a clueless cupid who just wants to use it to make her wildest fantasies come true? You get a deconstructed rom-com parody that somehow keeps you watching formore. This show never takes itself seriously and frankly it's because of this that this show shines as a whole. In Renai Boukun aka Love Tyrant, a Kiss Note (parody of Death Note) is a powerful notebook that makes people who have their names written together instantly fall in love if they kiss each other, regardless of any circumstances. If they don't\u2026 they will remain a virgin forever and c'mon which person would want that? Enter Guri, a cupid clueless about Love, accidentally writes Seiji's (MC) name mistaking him for someone else. She shows up to his door, explains the concept to him, they kiss, and the problem begins from there. This whole show starts off from this tiny snowball of a problem that just keeps rolling down the hill and it gets just bigger and bigger. Quite a rollercoaster ride if you ask me. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I get into the plot, it's the characters that makes this show so enjoyable. You have Guri, a BL obsessed undere cupid who is clueless about love. Then, Akane, a psychotic beautiful yandere, that will kill anyone that touches her love. Cue in Yuzu, a tsundere wincestual stalker, in love with her step-sister. Next the cousin of Akane & Yuzu, Shikami, a sado-maso mayadere who gets off on pain, obsessed with stealing other's love. On the side, you have the MC's younger sister Akua, a kuudere with severe brother/sister complex hoping for her brother's love. Finally, you have the weak & pathetic yet kind MC, Seiji, who is \"not handsome, quick to anger, stubborn, insensitive and just a really boring guy\" wanting to find true love. Throw them all in one pot, thanks to the supernatural power of \"Kiss Note\", you have a chaotic mess that will deliver enough comedy to keep you watching for more. Seriously, the characters all feel unique and though the point isn't for viewers to identify themselves as one of the character in the show, you just can't help laughing at each of their hilarity. Even the Kami, aka God, and Maoh, aka Devil, are presented in such comedic manner that the only less outrageous character in this show is the MC himself. You really do start to pity him seeing the stuff he gets himself into. Despite all the chaos, each of the characters actually undergoes some form of character development to better their personality. Now that you have a better grasp of the characters and their \"goals\", let's dive into the plot. \\n\\n\r\nPlot wise, the story sort of follows a linear pattern as the show is supposed to showcase Guri's coming of age story as she becomes a better Cupid who will succeed Kami in the future by truly understanding the concept of love. However, this show isn't about reaching that destination, it's about enjoying the messed up journey these characters gets themselves into. At its essence, this is a parody that deconstructs the rom-com genre by showing how obscure the concept of school love is by portraying it through a comedic lense. Each episode is a two part episode where the characters find themselves in stereotypical harem/rom-com messy situations that gets resolved by the end after poking much needed fun at its obscurities. The constant juxtaposition of presenting different deretype characters really adds to its comedic value, plus the dialogues go from corny to cheesy to somewhat deep at times. It's almost as if the director snaps their fingers at the viewers to tell them, \"sssh, serious matters are being shown here\u2026 or so we think.\" Seriously, the best part about this show is that neither the plot nor the director takes the show seriously which allows for the \"quit pro quo\" comedic style to flourish so well. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the animation team behind Renai Boukun did a great job. Each of the major characters stand out from one another and they made the MC a very relatable looking character that is both bland yet unique looking. The use of bold vibrant primary colours really shines throughout the anime. It is able to contrast the deep satirical emotions of love with the outrageous comedic elements of chaos. Though scattered if observed individually but seems cohesive when seen together. The OP song is quirky & catchy and the ED song is nice but its the OST that really shines as it helps the anime flow well with the story by constantly aiding in the creation and diffusion of tension. Definitely worth a listen as a standalone. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Renai Boukun is a fun show to watch, not just on a whim. It's a good parody and it never takes itself seriously so the comedy never dies. I enjoyed watching it despite not being a fan of rom-com because it is a deconstructed parody of this genre. If you are debating whether or not you want to watch the show, just ask yourself this. Do you want to watch a show that is utter madness due to hilarious characters? Do you enjoy good comedy? Do you like a bit of fan service? Regardless of yes or no, you should watch this show. Simple as that... joking. Anyways, give it a watch and let me know later how you like it. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!\\n\r\nP.P.S. \"What is love? It's not about knowing what love is\u2026 being in love means whether you are happy or sad the heart always aches for that one special person\"",

            "content": "-- This review contains spoilers. Only read if you have finished the series. --\r\nStory:\r\nWhen thinking of this show, the word wacky comes to mind. We're introduced to characters that fit their \"niche,\" if you will, but with a slight spin on it. They are basically forced together with the end result of their shenanigans being rather bizarre at times. This comedy follows the job of a cupid and the troubles that go along with it. With that said, it may be repetitive here and there which brings the show down overall. However, one of my biggest problems with the show is that the story itselfquickly goes downhill somewhere midway when Guri is basically forced to find love for the sake of \"developing\" her character; the way it was brought about was rather sudden and obvious in intention. As if the romance wasn't stiff enough as it is. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, I do enjoy the ever-present theme of \"good vs. bad\" within the show; to be more precise, angels vs. demons. It really plays off the characters really well, and I think it was a great setup. For instance, our \"antiheroine\" Akane comes from an assassin family skilled with swords while her half-sister's family offers protection in the form of a shield, or rather, a barrier. Likewise, we can say the same thing towards Seiji's sister - being on the good side - and Shikimi - being on the bad side. Interestingly enough, Guri is a living and breathing oxymoron herself. She's an angel, yet she loves to stir up trouble every so often. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe exaggeration of the characters' actions brings home the idea that this anime should not be taken too seriously. It's really more for entertainment value, rather than being realistic. From the faces they make to the times they should have \"died,\" the art makes sure to convey a comedic tone to it. Much to my surprise, it does a decent job of balancing out the tone in critical points. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThis department was pretty lackluster, admittedly. While it fits the general atmosphere, it's not exactly something you would want to listen to by itself. It has a somewhat quirky feel and generally compliments the show. Overall, it definitely gets the job done when it needs to, even if it's half-heartedly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nProbably the most disappointing aspect of the show. It's a comedy, and I get that; they are funny in their own way. Although, that's not necessarily a good reason to cling to when they get so predictable early on. After a first impression or two, it's pretty obvious to see that Akane is a yandere, Guri is a carefree spirit, Seiji is clueless, Yuzu is obsessive, Shikimi is sadistic, and Akua is a tsundere. It's not exactly original. There may be some character development here and there - which is great - but then why does it go back to being redundant almost immediately afterwards? The change is definitely there, but it's just extremely hard to tell sometimes. More often than not, it's stagnant. While the characters did bring a smile to my face once in a while, I would not go so far to say that they have depth. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, it's an entertaining show. I would recommend it to anime fans that are looking for something... \"peculiar.\" Despite the things it does right, it's just not my cup of tea. From my perspective, there were more negatives that outweighed the positives. As a whole, I would say it's pretty unoriginal yet amusing at best. You can interpret that however you wish. \\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 3/10.",

            "content": "Love is weird.  On one hand, you can fall head over heels for your partner, but you could also want to dig your fingers into their throat because of how annoying they can be.  I hope not every relationship is like that, but it can and has happened.  Through it all, love can be hilarious due to how nonsensical the concept it can be when you put it in perspective.  So why does it matter anyway?  Well to Renai Boukun (aptly titled \u2018Love Tyrant\u2019), it means a lot.  \r\nStory: Aino Seiji is just your typical harem protagonist.  Niceto everyone, easygoing, and comes into contact with a plethora of very troublesome women through very unfortunate circumstances.  After coming into contact with a girl who presents him with a \u201cKiss Note\u201d (Yes, it\u2019s a death note reference.  Don\u2019t think too hard about it), he is brought into the realm of couple-making where he must help couples get together, all the while dealing with a small trail of women himself.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is in a word, rushed.  Smashing together about forty or so chapters of the original manga into a twelve-episode anime, the story for Renai Boukun follows the story of a hyperactive fujoshi, a shrill, incestuous stalker, a kukuri wielding yandere, and the main protagonist, as they come across various, loosely love-based scenarios that culminate into\u2026something.  When looking at it from face value, it\u2019s quite unclear to understand what it is the show wants to be.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from the overall theme of love and how love exists in various kinds of romantic relationships, the show zip zaps around from being one-off episode comedy plots, to one-two episode long drama plots involving one of the main characters.  Due to the rushed nature of trying to get to the end, the show suffers from poor comedic timing, as the necessary time to let the audience breathe from in-between jokes is absent and thus makes it very difficult for the audience to really get a full kick out of what we\u2019re supposed to laugh at.  Not only that, it doesn\u2019t help that the show relies mostly on repeated gags in order to try and be funny either.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is character development.  Due to the fact that the show attempts to squeeze so much in so little, any and all character development that the show tries to accomplish feels contrived and stiff.  Two of the main girls in particular get arcs dedicated to them, and it doesn\u2019t really feel like they accomplish much of anything in the end because we\u2019re given less than hour each of total focus to even give a crap.  The ending doesn\u2019t really help either cause things are more or less thrown back into the status quo of things, so I guess like some aspects of life, some things never change.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story of Renai Boukun is a mess of fragments broken off from an existing manga shoddily put back together to try to create some semblance of an anime.  A lot of the in-between details are missing and while the show does tell a story in the end, it doesn\u2019t really feel genuine or rewarding because the journey watching these characters feels so half-hearted.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  TERRIBLE pacing (Some episodes are one chapter.  Others are three-four.)\\n\r\n-  Poor comedic timing\\n\r\n-  Contrived character development\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  If I\u2019ll give the show anything, it\u2019s that its main cast is\u2026something.  It\u2019s something all right.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, we have Aino Seiji.  Now I don\u2019t know why this guy is our protagonist of all characters, but I safely say that he is as bland as they come.  Seiji is your typical \u2018nice\u2019 protagonist: respects women, nice to all, easygoing, and most of all, dense.  Maybe he\u2019s not that last one so much, but the rest for sure.  The most interesting part about his character I\u2019d say is how he at least acknowledges the affection he gets from the girls (At least one of them) and has the willingness to be a kind soul regardless of the situation.  Which honestly is something you have to give to the guy considering his harem is filled with absolutely terrible people, deals with haphazardly stupid situations daily, and he gets blamed for stupid shit when his involvement in things aren\u2019t always his fault anyway.  Beyond that, he\u2019s about as interesting as a saltine cracker.  \\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Guri.  I want to separate this one from the rest of the harem specifically because she is the cause of everyone\u2019s problems.  Noted previously as the \u2018hyperactive fujoshi\u2019 who likes to cosplay, Guri doesn\u2019t understand love, yet does whatever she wants because she\u2019s a free spirit and can\u2019t be held down by any form of convention so long as it\u2019s fun and whatnot.  This can be a good archetype, except the show makes her really, really annoying.  For the most part, she causes a lot of the series\u2019 conflicts (she\u2019s the one that jumpstarted the plot anyway), leaving Seiji in particular to try and fix some things.  She\u2019s just\u2026not a very good character, especially since the ending tries its best to get the audience to care about her when the show up until that point gives us very little reason to give a damn in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019re the two half-sisters, Yuzu and Akane.  Yuzu shares similar problems with Guri, with most of her gags and annoyances coming off as creepy yuri as she jealously tries to garner the attention of her \u2018onee-sama\u2019 when in reality Akane gives little shits about her half-sister\u2019s attention.  Yuzu\u2019s whole saga throughout the series is all over the place and lacks enough cohesion to warrant any form of sympathy or care from the audience.  As for Akane, she acts as the series\u2019 mediator while also being batshit crazy herself.  Carrying kukuri knives and comically threatening anyone who gets in the way of her and Seiji, Akane is surprisingly the most level-headed member of the entire female cast as she carries a lot of reasoning and understanding that most of the girls in this series lack.  Of course she does share her own fair share of problems (like having her arc be completely rushed to the point it didn\u2019t even really matter), but in comparison, she fares so much better than the other girls in the series.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond them, the sidecast involves various family members of the characters\u2019 families (who are also all crazy might I add) that add to some of the arcs in various ways with similarly varying degrees of success, a bunch of cast members who provide their own one-off love stories to help fill up the runtime and provide a different kind of romantic relationship, and the rapey penguin.  Yes, you read that right.  Why he\u2019s there, I don\u2019t know, but he has a surprisingly large part (by supporting cast standards) in this series so\u2026that\u2019s there, I guess.  (There\u2019s also the character \u2018Shikimi\u2019, but we don\u2019t talk about her and how much of a bitch she is.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Some level-headed characters\\n\r\n-  Most of the cast is crazy (and not the good kind)\\n\r\n-  Rapey penguin?  (Don\u2019t know if this is necessarily a bad thing, but I\u2019m adding it.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by EMT^2, Renai Boukun\u2019s art is what I would describe as lazy.  The colors are blindingly bright to the point that it looks uncomfortable to watch; background characters are usually just gray silhouettes, and the characters just look gaudy with how the colors used on them are.  \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not even just the art.  The animation for some scenes clearly show little effort is put into them, thus giving off this really cheap, cost-efficient look to the whole thing that looks very uninteresting to look at.  Not only that, but character designs have their own sets of problems.  Personally I find Yuzu\u2019s hair very irritating to look at.  The huge pigtails on her sides combined with the cheap looking animation make her look like an eyesore every time she came on-screen.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Lazy, cheap looking art\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The OP known as\u2026\"Koi? de Ai? de Boukun desu!\u201d (Lord that\u2019s a mouthful) is a poppy, upbeat song that actually fits well with the show\u2019s wacky and comedic story.  Sure it\u2019s just a pop idol girl song, but it has merit to it for having a unique beat to it so that it\u2019s not just some generic anime opening that sounds similar to heaps of other openings from other shows.\\n\\n\r\nIts ED, 'Suki' wo Oshiete\u2019 on the other hand isn\u2019t so fortunate.  Comparatively, it\u2019s not really all that unique and falls into a generic sounding song that while sounds good, doesn\u2019t really have much in the way of memorabilia so that you would want to listen to it again, and not so you have to loop it in the background so you can accurately come up with the words to describe it.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent tracks\\n\r\n-  Ed isn\u2019t really all that memorable\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  Having read the Renai Boukun manga, the adaptation disappointed me for not only not being on the same level as the original, but for rushing so much to get to a certain point in the story that it had to sacrifice so much just to get there.  As such, I had a really hard time finding many positives to say since not only was the plot not that stellar to begin with, it actually got worse because it was adapted into something with a limited time frame.  As such, my enjoyment with this series dipped down a bit, and I really wish it didn\u2019t.  Because I did kind of enjoy just being forced to go along with the flow of things sometimes cause like the MC, there\u2019s really no other way out of it.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?  \\n\\n\r\nThere were a few choice moments I\u2019m glad they animated.  Not only that, but I\u2019m glad Akane mostly stayed intact.  Despite her obsessive nature, she\u2019s the series\u2019 main voice of reason and maintains her sensibility (mostly) throughout the show despite the random shit going on around her. \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn\u2019t I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nAside from the obvious plot problems, the rest of the girls in the main group: Guri, Yuzu, (and Shikimi, technically) really irk me.  Their archetypes to me are actually really unlikeable because not only do they center around one thing, which is being annoying, they do it so persistently throughout the series that it never feels like they have any kind of growth to them that would warrant me to like them.  There\u2019s almost no change with their characters and it upsets me that in a harem series of all things, there are very few candidates for \u2018best girl\u2019.  (Not like any of them really are stellar choices.)\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nIf you are going to watch this, turn your brain off.  Your enjoyment will skyrocket if you do.  Beyond that, this really isn\u2019t something worth recommending.  Its plethora of problems with its pacing and characters combined with a really cheap looking animation style make Renai Boukun a really difficult watch.  Coupled with poor comedic timing and a newbie seiyuu for Yuzu whose voice grates the ears, I honestly have a hard time finding many redeeming merits for this show to watch.  I\u2019d say read the manga if anything, but even then it\u2019s best to turn the good ol\u2019 noggin off.",

            "content": "----------\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\nThe following review is completely spoiler-free, and is meant for users who are curious about whether to watch the show or not. While I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself!\r\n---------\r\nPositives\r\n---------\r\n- Ridiculous Fun\r\nRenai Boukun is the classic example of a show that doesn't try and take itself too seriously. Its parodic intro to the show (with the \"Love Note\" parody) is a fittingly silly,tongue-in-cheek, and completely not subtle icon that symbolizes the whole show. The concept is crazy, the characters are ridiculous, and the hijinks they get up to are top notch. Additionally, there are many references and parodic elements that keep the energy going in the right direction.\\n\\n\r\n- Support Structure Story\\n\r\nDirect romances and the underlying romantic story as a whole are not spectacular, but they also do not take away from the show in the slightest. They act as a nice underlying current that runs confidently beneath the shenanigans pushed to the forefront. There's no needlessly contrived plot points or backstory, just ones that are handled quickly. As if to say: \"Look, this isn't the focus of the show, but that doesn't mean we were going to slack off on it\".\\n\\n\r\n- Charming Characters\\n\r\nRenai Boukun's core production strength is its ability to recognize exactly what to emphasize. While I've already mentioned its ridiculous comedy, the conduit to this comedy (the characters and their interactions) is arguably even more important. The characters were varied, yet equally ridiculous and the MC, Seiji-kun, was a good straight man to the rest of the show's goofy ways. Each of the main/major side characters felt sufficiently fleshed out for a 12 episode season, without feeling burdened with unnecessary fluff that could take away from the show's core feeling.\\n\\n\r\n- Matching Art Style\\n\r\nThe artistic style of the show does a fantastic job of not only contributing to the over-the-top moments of the show, but also serves as a very nice visual in between those times. There is a clear emphasis on popping colours and shining characters, which is exactly what a show like this should be pushing to the front.\\n\\n\r\n- Excellent OP\\n\r\nThis OP hits all the right points for me. Catchy music, character introductions, and a perfect set-up for the show you're about to watch. Never skipped it once, and it always got me in a \"Renai Boukun\" sort of mood.\\n\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nNegatives\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\n- Good, Not Great\\n\r\nOne of the disadvantages of pushing a few themes to the very forefront is that you leave some other elements behind. Let me be clear: Renai Boukun's overall story, character backgrounds, and world building are far from bad. They are adequate. As I mentioned above, this is to keep the comedy and madness at a high for as long as possible, but if you're looking for deep lore, complex characters, or an uber compelling romance plot, you won't find it here.\\n\\n\r\n- Kissed Potential\\n\r\nThe show's introductory episode was brilliant, and its roots in parody-ing \"Death Note\" with its counterpart, the \"Kiss Note\", was incredibly compelling and a great tool to get the characters in a wealth of kooky conundrums. Where the show goes wrong is where it throws that concept aside about halfway through the season. It leads to a generally disjointed feeling to the arc, as it takes back seat to slightly more serious arcs for each of the main girls. I wish they could have incorporated more of this fun concept into the story.\\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nSome anime is meant to tug at your heartstrings. Some anime is meant to fill you with a \"Go Get 'Em!\" spirit. Some anime captivates its audience with deep, twisting plots that have you drooling for more. Renai Boukun is not any of those shows. It doesn't break new ground with confidence or ease. But what it does do is allow you to turn your brain off for a little bit and enjoy pure, unadulterated ridiculousness. It doesn't take itself to serious (even in its more serious moments), and neither should you.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no more perfect analogy for Renai Boukun than to describe it as \"junk food\" anime. It's not particularly good for you, and it won't quell a deep hunger in dire anime situations. However, it will provide a light, focused entertainment series. It knows its strong points, and focuses on them, providing you with a silly, romcom to keep you smiling in between heartier meals.\\n\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nFinal Rating\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nWhile it makes for nice averages and wonderful sorting, when it comes to reviews I personally do not like direct numbering systems. Instead, I am to answer the question: \"Would you recommend I watch this show?\". So,\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of romcoms and/or harems, Renai Boukun is a perfect(ly silly) addition to your collection.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy shutting your brain off and wondering just what crazy situation a set of characters will get themselves into this time, you'll be right at home.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, if you're hoping for a heartier look into the genre(s), I'd recommend choosing a more refined, deeper anime.",

            "content": "I am loving it so far, especially after the fourth episode, where it takes an amazing turn. When I first started watching it I thought, hey, a normal romantic comedy, quite enjoyable. But after the fourth episode, I fell completely into it. . I really hope this new girl is common in the anime, because she made it fantastic. \r\n-Art-\r\nThe art is pretty great too. Though sometimes it tends to get loose, the dialogue makes up for it. \r\n-Character-\r\nOkay, so first we have the yandere, Akane. Honestly, quite a shocker but I was glad she did turn out to be one, added some spice intoit. After episode 3, she doesn't seem as Yandere though, maybe accepting the harem a little bit? Guri, pretty standard character, but she enjoys yaoi, so she s pretty much a yaoi fangirl.... Akane's sister, I can say I don't find too annoying, since I usually hate sister types(such as Oreimo), but she doesn't seem to want to get in the way of anyone in the harem, so I don't mind her. She is quite sweet as well. Shikimi(watch episode 4), just.. damn. She turned the tables on this anime with her personality, and I completely fell head over heels for this character. The main character is quite enjoyable as well, with his gags and all. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story is fairly harem-type, but it is still quite enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\n--Add on since I've watched the whole series now.\\n\\n\r\nI don't understand why people compare it to death note, at the beginning it has that \"Kiss Note\" but honestly the rest of the anime is not even similar. I do wish that Shikimi got more screen time, since she only kinda got added to the harem in the last episode. That's the only thing I would change. I also liked how they all loved each other at the ending as well, which made it more of how it is supposed to be, they're all in a relationship with each other.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Spoiler free review\r\nI welcome feedback on my reviews\r\nDo you have trouble with women? Can't talk to your school crush? Always wanted to build your dream harem? Well, look no further, cause we have a product made just for you. Introducing the Kiss Note! No Kira calm down stop laughing like a maniac we said Kiss Note not Death Note. Ugh anyway... With this handy little book, you can write down your name along with the name of your preferred crush and viola. One kiss and you'll become an official couple. You can even put down several names at once! Why have only one girlfriend whenyou can date your entire school? (even that weird girl that sits in the back drawing summoning circles) So don't wait, don't delay! Buy your very own Kiss Note today for the low low low low low price of 1 million dollars.\\n\\n\r\nDisclaimer: Only a cupid can activate the powers of the Kiss Note, it's basically useless in the hands of a human. But buy it anyway I need to buy an Akane body pillow help a guy in need\\n\\n\r\nLove Tyrant is a parody harem. We got our own male MC Seiji Aino who meets Guri, a cupid that accidentally wrote Seiji's name into her Kiss Note and now has to get him to kiss someone or she will die cause gotta keep that Death Note reference alive. We progress from there with Seiji hooking up with his crush Akane Hiyama, triggering a series of events that turn Seiji's life upside down. It gets pretty insane as Seiji tries to get used to all the shenanigans that has now arrived due to Guri's interference. There's not much story besides the few arcs that throw in some drama to spice things up, but these can either take away the silly charm of the show with some temporary seriousness (give us back our craziness drama!) or be quite heartwarming as we all declare our love for each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy here is the main and best aspect of Love Tyrant. The interactions that the characters have with each other and the crazy situations (that range from running away from a horny demonic demon penguins to dying and meeting your omnipotent father in law) are all incredibly funny, throwing joke after joke to keep you laughing without end. It pokes fun at harems and deres, subtly pointing out the ridiculousness of these tropes that we have become so used to The pacing does start off a little rushed, but it just adds onto the comedy as it gives us more and more hilarious scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty great as well. Akane is the school idol that turns out to be a kukri-wielding yandere, Yuzu Kichougasaki is a barrier creating tsundere lesbian who's in love with her sister, and you can't forget Guri, our lovable otaku cupid that loves creating yaoi ships and causing trouble. Even Seiji, who acts as our slightly dumb Harem MC, has a certain charm to him with his attempts to keep his girlfriends under control so they don't end up causing too much damage. The rest of the characters (which consists of cupids, sadists, gods, angels, demons, super-powered assassins and bodyguards, the list goes on and on just like this sentence I should really stop) are just introduced to create more comedy or drama, but they get enough screen time across the show to let you see their own unique personalities and quirks\\n\\n\r\nRomance is handled quite nicely with the whole harem skit. There aren't any pussy men that can't handle being 10 metres around women. In fact, there are several dates and kisses shared across the harem as the anime progresses. Sure the show isn't really that romance heavy as we have Seiji trying to figure things out due to him keeping some generic harem mc traits, but the rest of the show is able to make up for it with its comedy and the occasional sweet moments that just makes your heart skip a little.\\n\\n\r\nLove Tyrant is definitely not for everyone. Due to it being a harem and comedy anime, there are many people will get turned off due to that fact that they either dislike the overused idea of several girls dating one guy or just don't enjoy the comedy the show has to offer. However, I highly recommend this show to everyone to at least try out for a few eps. If you dislike it, drop it. If you enjoy it, welcome to the club. We'll get Guri to write your name in the Kiss Note so you can join the harem.",

It has a promising start, setting up an interesting concept that\u2019s slightly different yet feels familiar at the same time! This is achieved in the following way, familiar cause it falls for the same corny ironies such as an MC who\u2019s both dense and uncertain about what he wants while at the same time the anime differs itself with its near perfect timing of comedy which is really the best type! Even though it starts off with an amazing pace, itends on an annoying and boring term because it can\u2019t help shake off all its clich\u00e9d tropes. The beginning part worked because the anime understood itself and accepted it without any regrets! What I mean is that the writers knew this show isn\u2019t for everybody so they didn\u2019t waste any time in pleasing everyone, instead they just throw you into this messy story and let you decide whether you want to stick with it or not! It made a point of mocking the Harem genre which worked for a while but later the joke turns on them itself! Comedy is the best thing here, hitting you with unexpected type of jokes which is always fun. But they pretty much bash your head with the same type of gags again and again until it becomes irritating. Towards the end, they jolted to focus more on their preposterous concept by reducing their Comedy which sucked out all the fun from the anime, making everything dull and the climax was pointlessly hastened. \\n\\n\r\nA cupid cosplaying as a demon named Guri is not very good with her job since she doesn\u2019t understand the concept of Love. Ironic, right? On top of that, she gets bored all the time cause she\u2019s freaking dense so she easily gets distracted from her task whenever something \u2018Fun\u2019 comes around! She crosses paths with the MC, Seiji who\u2019s your clich\u00e9d nice guy surrounded by pretty girls, and writes his name in the \u2018Kiss Note\u2019 which is a diary that makes people fall in love once their names are written in it. But in typical \u2018Death Note\u2019 fashion, if only 1 name is written then that person must find a partner quickly or remain a virgin for life! Seiji resolves to put Akane\u2019s name next to his cause he has a secret crush on her which\u2019s suitable because Akane\u2019s crazy about Seiji as well which is very fortunate for him. When I say crazy, I mean literally cause unfortunately she also happens to be a psychological Yandere character who gets effortlessly envious and resorts to extreme violence at once! Sadly, that\u2019s all she does, for the anime opts to replay that same joke over and over again where Akane gets mad and starts stabbing someone! Then Guri, in her nonsensical habit, adds her name into this relationship just cause she thinks it will be fun! Soon the follow up is Akane\u2019s half-sister, Yuzu, who also adds her name cause she\u2019s in love with Akane and this is where the plot starts to make no sense so you should just go along with it. Oh yeah, Yuzu is a clumsy girl who has this morbid fixation for Akane which was creepy to watch but since this is a Harem she also starts eliciting feelings for Seiji as well. Anyway, at one point all must help this lazy plus hyper cupid to do her job cause otherwise they all will end up in hell for some lame reason and that\u2019s how the show starts. Boy that was hard to explain! And what\u2019s worst is this plot rarely ever surfaces again! The story is weak throughout the series, the only difference is that it\u2019s commencement was buoyed with a riveting idea which is why it\u2019s tolerable at first. But due to the half ass effort, the anime later fails to hit the right points with its storytelling which is why it gives off a bitter and boring vibe when the show shifts its focus to more serious exposition! This is the reason why sub plots like the whole family drama between Akane and Yuzu or the backstory with Guri didn\u2019t land with the audience since it lacked any real depth to it. An attempt was made to flesh out their female characters but they were so rushed and poorly done, I couldn\u2019t help ask why even bother? Proper development is achieved by giving details and time to tell a well-fashioned tale which is never applied here, instead characters are one note with distinctive epitomes of other anime\u2019s.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork falls in with every other Harem anime with its bright colours and fan service but there was something with the character designs that caught my eyes for I could tell something was off but I can\u2019t seem to place it! It was slightly distracting! The animation met the standard outlooks despite some untraditional attempts with the camera angles. Even the sound effects used to play up the humour wasn\u2019t very notable but the Dubs here was great, nicely capturing the vibe for these whacky characters which the Subs failed to carry. Both OP/ED botched to leave any impression and shall be forgotten quickly though the video for OP was kinda nice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the first few episodes, thinking this might turn into a great Comedy anime for I didn\u2019t mind its chaotic setup or straightforward characters. And I did laugh at some jokes though this show needed more since it lacked fresh and self-aware humour, rather much of its Comedy comes from overused gags which becomes dull after a while. With nothing else going on except for clich\u00e9d characters and story that relies heavily on repeatable puns, it turned this \u2018could have fun show\u2019 to a predictable one that just can\u2019t be recommended to others! Instead I offer you to check out \u2018Kono Subarashi\u2019 that really nails the head with its Comedy, Story and Characters!",

            "content": "Plenty of rom-com series focuses on school life relationships these days between young teens. I can\u2019t say this enough but every season seems to have them in some way or form. Then, there\u2019s Renai Boukun which seems normal at first. But then, you add a thing called the \u201cKiss Note\u201d, a red headed yandere, a Shinigami, angels, and you get a show of bizarre shenanigans. \r\nAdapted by the manga of the same name, Renai Boukun is what I envision as a parody or perhaps deconstruction of the rom-com genre. The series starts off with Aino Seiji, a normal high student living his daily life asusual. That is, until one day\u2026he encounters Guri, a female Shinigami who shows him a Kiss Note. It\u2019s a supernatural notebook that makes anyone who has their name written together instantly fall in love if they kiss each other. Things take a weird twist when Seiji\u2019s name gets written into the book and he kisses his long time crush, Akane. See where this is going? A bizarre rom-com that adds in supernatural context to entertain the viewers. For me, I think it\u2019s some popcorn comedy that will easily draw some laughs.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing to mention, Renai Boukun excels at selling its humor. The show has romance but delivers it in such a way that you can\u2019t help but laugh at it. The comedy is played out that can feel ridiculous with characters such as Akane, the beautiful and popular yandere. In almost every scene they are together, she obsessively attaches herself to Seiji. Whenever she senses that Seiji may be \u201ccheating\u201d on her, she goes into full yandere mode in comedic fashion. On the other hand, there\u2019s Guri who seems rather oblivious to the concept of love. The first few episodes shows that she is a very playful girl with a childish personality. Akane doesn\u2019t get along with her as she sees Guri as a \u201clove rival\u201d. In essence, the show portrays their rivalry as a humorous gag rather than a serious drama story. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, that\u2019s not all. The show introduces more girls into Seiji\u2019s life that adds more humor into the show. Yuzu (half-sister of Akane) adds some subtle yuri context as she seems to be in love with Akane. Her relationship with Seiji is mixed as she sees him as an obstacle but also seems to falling for Seiji as the story progresses. Shikimi Shiramine (Yuzu and Akane\u2019s cousin) adds perhaps a more dramatic element of the show. She doesn\u2019t seem to get along with anyone and sees life like a game. Manipulative and cunning, she enjoys afflicting people and having fun with her games. The relationship she share with Seiji can get quite indecent at times. Unlike Akane, she doesn\u2019t seem to be actually in love with Seiji but often tries to seduce him for the fun of it. Her role in the show adds more drama than any others as some of her actions really influence the plot and characters. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the amount of humor injected into the show, there\u2019s also some genuine relationship building in particular with Seiji\u2019s sister, Aqua. As the tomboyish sister, Aqua seems to have a rocky relationship with Seiji and we\u2019re shown why through some background storytelling. The series takes a more realistic approach at developing that relationship after certain evens happen in the show. So in a way, not every relationship in this show is a comedy gag. Akane also faces emotional troubles of her own and the series brings that into more light in later episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAs most viewers can expect by now, Renai Boukun is pretty much saturated with comedy that doesn\u2019t even feel like rom-com. Some may can it at a harem given the male-female ratio of the cast. I would say that the show can be enjoyed if you watch it for humor. However, the storytelling itself isn\u2019t well written and in particular, I can\u2019t really connect with the plot from most of the episodes. Only a few episodes portrays itself in a more serious manner and even then, it brushes off in a quick fashion afterwards. The supernatural context can quickly grow dull once you\u2019ve seen it a dozen times. One other issue I find in this show is the presence of Yuzu. This girl has a personality that seems even more childish compared to Guri and I find her presence to be extremely annoying. Seiji himself isn\u2019t an interesting character either. In retrospect, the characters in this can easily be distracting to watch and despite their humorous roles, they don\u2019t stand out particularly much on their own.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, I have some rather mixed feelings. Characters such as Guri, Akane, and Shikimi stands out by their designs while others such as Seiji and Aqua looks too normal. Comedy is portrayed through character expressions that is effective to sell its comedy. However, it sometimes relies on it too much at times that feels uncanny. Oh and some characters just looks ridiculous. I mean, a demonic penguin? An angelic cat? Really? The character designs also has some distracting outlines around them that can be bothersome to look at.\\n\\n\r\nTo say the least, the soundtrack of Renai Boukun is just silly. The OP and ED theme songs parodies character relationships and puts little effort into the choreography. It\u2019s only catchy enough with its lyrics although on most parts, I find it to be absurd. However, I would add that character voice mannerism is memorable particularly with Akane\u2019s yandere tone and Shikimi\u2019s manipulative voice.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch Renai Boukun? Is it worth the time? Honestly, the answer to that is up to you because supernatural rom-coms like this is adapted to create laughter. By the end of the day, it hopes to make you laugh rather than getting you invested into the story. When I finished watching this show, I can\u2019t really look back and say \u201cI should have watched this sooner\u201d.\\n",

            "content": "A cosplaying angel descends to Earth with the goal of utilizing her magical Kiss Note to create couples (preferably yaoi ones) by writing their names down in it to make them fall in love with each other, and somehow manages to end up in a 4-way relationship between herself, a yandere, a lesbian siscon and a perfectly ordinary guy. Sounds ridiculous? Well, that's Renai Boukun in a nutshell for you.\r\nThis is a hilarious parody of your stereotypical romcom, Death Note and more. Renai Boukun does not take itself seriously whatsoever and is packed to the brim with light-hearted gags and references. It is utterly sillyin every sense of the word but doesn't pretend to be anything else, resulting in a plethora of shameless, unapologetic comedy. And oh boy is it fun to watch. When the mischievous angel Guri arrives in the average joe Seiji's life, she helps him finally being able to get together with the girl of his dreams\u2014Akane\u2014only for him to find out that she was actually a psychopathic yandere all along with madly possessive feelings of love for him. And when Akane's little sister Yuzu confesses that she in turn had always been in love with her own sister, things quickly become about as chaotic as it gets after all four of them are roped together into a twisted relationship thanks to the power of Guri's Kiss Note, which also gives them all immortality. Add to that a creepy dog-angel, a giant black rapist penguin of doom and you've got yourself one hell of a strange anime. The whole thing is all over the place, but it results in a ton of absurd slapstick comedy which is very well-executed in general.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Renai Boukun however is that it doesn't maintain the same quality for very long. The first four episodes are hilarious, but starting with episode five, Renai Boukun starts to drop off pretty fast. And it starts with the introduction of a new girl called Shikimi, who just so happens to be *another* psychopath, but unlike Akane, this girl is one of the most obnoxious characters I've ever seen. She is the epitome of being crazy for the sake of being crazy with little rhyme or reason attached to it. But her being annoying in person is not the main problem, but rather that she takes the role of the villain in the story and starts interfering with the main characters consistently for her own strange reasons, which results in the anime as a whole becoming significantly more serious as there's now an enemy they have to fight. Thus, the hilarious comedy/parody content almost disappears entirely to make room for it, which is an awful trade-off. It just leaves you wishing that the story would've kept doing what it was doing originally instead.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to the manga, Renai Boukun is technically a pretty rushed adaptation in terms of how much content is covered in every episode, but given the hysterical and hyperactive nature of the show, the faster pacing ends up working out alright anyway I think (kind of like with the Prison School adaptation). However, the genre-switch unsurprisingly bothered me just as much in the anime as it did in the manga, and that is the main downfall of Renai Boukun.\\n\\n\r\nNow that doesn't mean that the show isn't worth watching all of a sudden. The first few episodes are quite good and even later on it's still bearable, albeit not great. It's just one of those series which leaves you with a bad taste in the mouth solely because you know it could have been so much better still.",

            "content": "I honestly don't think it deserves that bad of a rating. Renai Boukun after all, is just mindless entertainment. It doesn't take itself seriously. When comparing it to other anime of the same caliber, then it's arguably one of the better ones.\r\nIt starts off making us laugh right off the bat with constant parodies like the kiss note (death note reference) and while it does go \"downhill\" after the first few episodes, it doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. Yes, you may not laugh as much as you used to but if you don't compare the episodes and judge them individually, it isn't that bad.\r\nThe characterswhom all have their own trope, use it to their advantage. They take it and use it to entertain us. They all have their own distinct trait that make them stand out from each other which can be pretty obvious because of the beautiful and clear animation. They aren't \"fleshed out\" but as since this is a character driven anime and the only purpose for them is to give us humor, then it's safe to say they did a good job.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, that doesn't make it an excuse to ignore the flaws of it. It did have lot's of potential wasted. It did go downhill to a certain extent. But in the end, it still made me laugh a ton and it would take more than 10 hands to count how many times i've smiled.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like harems, comedy, an actual decent harem protag, yandere, parodies, and overall mindless fun then this is your go-to anime. Definitely a must-watch. Trust me on this one.",

Guri, an angel with the absolute power to make people fall in love for the rest of their lives, has dedicated her life to randomly pairing men together for funsies! On nothing but her own whim and an inability to comprehend any level of responsibility,  she pairs random couples--who now have to spend their lives together\u2014forever. \r\nAt this point I feel that it\u2019s important to tell you that her power stems from a \u201cKiss Note\u201d that looks exactly like the Death Note. They make a joke aboutit. It\u2019s funny. They laugh. I\u2019m dead inside. \\n\r\nFor some reason or another, please don\u2019t ask the particulars of her incredible gift. I\u2019ve tried to determine the exact rules and all I know after 5 episodes is that there are no rules. None. Any rules that do get set in place are almost immediately broken or contradicted or both.  The more you watch, the more you realize you are actually in hell.\\n\r\nBut back to what is probably considered \u201cplot.\u201d Guri has now put herself in a relationship by writing her name, the main anime boy \u2122\u2019s name, his crush, and his crush\u2019s sister\u2019s name in the notebook and connecting them together. \\n\r\nThe little sister wants to bone the bigger sister, main anime boy\u2122 wants to bone the bigger sister, the bigger sister wants to kill fuck the main anime boy\u2122, and also the sisters have a cousin who just wants to plain kill all of them? And they\u2019re all forced to love Guri\u2014who thinks this is all hilarious and fun. And remember, they\u2019re together forever. \\n\r\nThey exist in a landscape built of psychological horror. \\n\r\nThey\u2019re not allowed to love anyone else. Ever. I mean, I think I\u2019d feel bad for them, but even the little sister loses sympathy points after she sneaks into her sister\u2019s changing room and takes naked pictures\u2014which Guri then promptly sends to the love\u2026pentagon?\\n\r\nSo this is the conclusion of my 2:30AM anime review of this PILE OF BURNING TRASH.  I watched this with my friend and we are both a little bit less human because of it. \\n\r\nTL;DR: This anime is hell and anyone who likes pink haired girl as a character should reevaluate themselves as a living being. Stalking is not cute.\\n\\n\r\n(This was edited by my dear friend so it is easier to read and conveys the point better)",

            "content": "Another excellent example of a great Harem RomCom, Renai Boukun leaves it's mark as one of the really good anime of its kind out there. And with good reason too.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story like most other harem, picks up the pace quickly at the start and slows down towards the middle. It was really hilarious to see how it turned out as the comic Death Note parody is featured almost everywhere throughout and it adds to the humor (especially if you've watched Death Note). The pace is slow like I mentioned before and helps familiarise with the characters. Though apart from the Death Note parody itbrought nothing new to the table, which in itself isn't much of a disadvantage but could've helped score higher.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was amazing. A special mention goes for the way the eyes were designed. It looked really beautiful to say the least. And another special place was the coloring. They coloring was very vibrant and bright and set it apart from most other anime too. EMT\u00b2 did a brilliant job here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was above average I could say. The VAs did a good job but the background music felt lacking and the OP/ED weren't that great either. I found myself listening to them maybe once or twice while watching and the rest of the time I skipped them. Other than that it was ok.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nYou can't expect much character development from a harem anime, and so the same was felt here albeit with the inclusion of a Yandere (Akane) which was very new and a really good idea.\\n\\n\r\nSeiji: Our Resident dense MC, Seiji isn't that dense you could say as he realised others' feelings maybe an episode or two faster than the average dense MC. Apart from that, it was nice to see him taking somewhat of an active role with the characters (especially because he started dating Akane from the first episode itself (so not a spoiler :P) which clears any existing faults within him.\\n\\n\r\nAkane: A textbook example of a well-done Yandere. Akane is everything you could ask for from an anime girl. Looks, personality, a bit of Yandere too if you may and there you have it! Nonetheless she was one of the strong points of the anime (pun intended) and not a second went by without my appreciation of her great character.\\n\\n\r\nGuri: Strangely it's tough to categorise Guri into an archetype, and I was happy with that as it showed that this anime did have something original to bring to the table too. Strangely even though she was a main character she didn't get the focus she needed until the final arc that spanned just two episodes. And let's just say it wasn't all that satisfying. The actual final anime ending was very memorable though, I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI had a lot of laughs with Renai Boukun. It's 'plain stupid' comedy approach was very well done and I found myself laughing at almost every situation. The same could be said of the romance, though not too fulfilling it made it's important mark too. A lot of the things appealed to me in Renai Boukun especially the fact that it wasn't just a story of love it was a story ABOUT love, which isn't something I see everyday.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.8\\n\\n\r\nRenai Boukun is one of the best examples you could give to someone who's new to Harem RomCom anime. It's got an almost perfect balance of all the three along with a sweet slice of life added to it. It's brilliant art style by EMT\u00b2 steals the show for me. The characters were applaudable too. One of the best Harem RomComs out there!\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Akane is best girl <3",

            "content": "Let me start by saying this, Love tyrant is an underrated show. That being said it isn't perfect and far from it, it's pretty sloppily made  and can seem very uninspired, which it might very well be, but if you are willing to go past that and stop expecting a \"normal\" show you will find that it is an extremely entertaining parody of the most clich\u00e9 tropes in anime. \r\nWhether it is on purpose or by accident, they reuse every tired anime trope but instead of adding something original, they crank it up to 11 which leads to everything the characters do being incoherentwith the story in an unprecedented clash that will instantly shatter any bit of immersion you may have had in the story. This contrast between what is expected and what you get turns out to be a very powerful tool of parody making the viewer realise the storytelling flaws of widely accepted anime conventions.\\n\\n\r\nOf course this premise would get tired very quickly were it not for the humor put forward by the show. I'm not going to praise it as being a work of genius or anything, the laughter comming mostly from simple shock humor and visual gags but let's be real, this is anime we are talking about, the bar is already set pretty low on what constitutes a funny bit. So as I was saying, the jokes are not all that great but the writers manage to keep it relatively fresh and though I wouldn't say I laughed at all the gags, not even most of them, but a couple moments managed to make me laugh out loud (something I rarely do) even if it was only at how jarring some parts are.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately it goes a bit downhill at the end when  the \"story\" took a turn to something more serious, in any capacity this thing has to be, and lost the one redeeming quality it had. You end up having to follow for 2 episodes these washed up jokes of characters trying desperately to have some development that would lead to a climax and doing so, threw out the window every bit of surprise or weird factor that it previously had. All of this strongly hinted at the fact that the writer did intend to write an actual story but nevertheless, I dont believe that the intent takes away anything.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, can I say that it was a good show? Not really, but it sure was entertaining to watch because in the end, even though I'm not exactly sure if I was laughing with or at it, I can tell you one thing, I was laughing. \\n",

            "content": "Real Score 6.75\\10\r\nLet's get this straight, Renai Boukun(Or Love Tyrant) is not a Death Note parody, it just takes the Death Note element but it's not trying to parody that show. Renai Boukun is a parody of the Harem genre: in a time where we had the Superhero\\Shonen Parodies, Adventure\\Fantasy Parodies and even Daily life parodies, we never actually had a fully developed parody of the Harem genre. Renai Boukun starts incredibly well, it takes some of the worst and best elements of the Harem genre and makes fun of them in a clever and funny way, the characters are walking parodies of typical Haremstereotypes: we have The Yandere, The Good guy everyone falls in love with, the Tsundere eccetera...\\n\r\nThe biggest problem lies in the rundown of the show, in fact the more we good deep in the show, the more we approach the end, the more the show falls in the same Clich\u00e9 abyss that it tries to make fun of, it never loses its identity but it loses a lot of steam and that entertainment shown in the first 3 episodes\\n\\n\r\nStory 6.25\\n\r\nThe story is simple and effective, and it should have stayed that way the entirety of the rundown, shows like these don't need a convoluted and serious story, however, during the end, the show  makes the enormous mistake  to take itself too seriously with a subplot that could have been easily avoided. The parody elements are quite funny, it takes a little bit of everything that we know or have seen and parodies them in a really fun way, just look at the Akane characters, she's a walking Yandere and Rias(HighScholl DxD) parody. Here everything is overly exaggerated  and approached in a humorous and, i have to say, kind of unique way: it's nothing new, but some of the directions of the story are pretty unexpected in their exaggeration\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6.5\\n\r\nThe characters are, by far, the most entertaining part of the Anime, Aino Seiji is your typical  stereotype of the genuine good guy that everyone fall in love with, but everyone that surrounds him is that damn good. Akane is your typical Yandere, but she's so exaggerated and she's put in so many incredible situations, all in order to show a different take of the Yandere character and, at the same way, parody the Yandere in general. Yuzu is your typical Tsundere, she's bipolar and could be annoying sometimes , but if you take her as a parody of all of the Tsunderes you know and, maybe, love, if you see her in a different light, you can actually see and get what the author tried to express trhough Yuzu, a good and charming parody of the Tsundere. Shikimi is the least developed and, to be honest, her character arc is nonexistant, she's just there for the sexy shots and for the sadist moments, not that good. But the best character also is  the incarnation of the theme of the Anime: i'm talking about Guri, she is the quintessential essence of the parody part of this Anime, she's funny, charming, she doesn't care about the story, spits references every 5 minutes(some really funny) and acts like she wants the story to follow the patterns of the genre, while at the same time parodying them. Too bad that Guri suffers from the same problem of all the characters and the story itself, her character arc is wasted and it takes itself too seriously, taking all of her magic and charm away\\n\\n\r\nSound 7\\n\r\nThe music perfectly gets the tone and, Satoshi Motoyama really did an incredible job capturing the themes and parody aspect of the show in his compositions. The Opening, done by Wake up Girls, also is perfect fpr the show, energetic, dynamic, exagerated and over the top. The soundtrack is energetic thourghout the entire  show, never goes beyond that, and it has not the need to do it, the music's fine as it is\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Direction 7\\n\r\nThe drawings and the art are pretty cool, the white and trasparent lines add that little bit of exaggeration needed to the characters. The frames look good but some of the drawings, especially in the background, are lackluster. The direction is standard, it's good but it suffers some problems, especially in the \"FanService\" shots, which become tiring really fast. The animation is solid and the bright colours fit the parody element really well\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7.5\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun with this Anime, even though i didn't like the serious tone that the final episodes take. Comedy can be subjective, i know that, but the parody elements and, knowing the Harem genre, the way the show parodies them, makes fun of them and basically spits in some of the most famous tropes. Quick mention to some of the reactions and faces of the characters, they're really cool and pretty amazing at times, they have that Gintama vibe that's always appreciated. I laughed at some of the references, there are a lot of them, and a pretty fun time overall, i really enjoyed the jokes and parody element, and Guri was always entertaining, until the end of course\\n\\n\r\nSo this was Renai Boukun, a really fun show, a really interesting parody of Harem  genre while, at the same time, being a funny take of some  of the most common characters in Anime industry. It could have been a really fun satire\\parody if it just didn't take itself too seriously at the end end if ti didn't add a characters who's just there for, i guess, sadistic purposes(I think). This, however, doesn't take that much away from what Renai Boukun really is: a nice, funny and amusing to spend your time, just turn your brain off for a little bit and enjoy this really fun ride that was \"Renai Boukun\". Thanks for reading this review, May our Sweet and Merciful Madoka be with you and with the power of The Kiss Note, you will all fall in love with Our Sweet Lady, who will enlighten you with Her Dear Kiss",

I am just going to give you a straight  review\r\nStory 5\\10\r\nFirst off, its a parody of death not and a slice of life\\comedy anime so not really looking for much.  The story is based off our MC meeting Guri an angel trying to make couples. This is done through the kiss note which is essential the death note but you write two peoples names and they fall in love. This anime follows that story for a bit than focuses on the charactersmore or less the second half of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7\\10\\n\r\nThe character are not linear and have backstories that are explained properly or given a good shot at least. The characters besides the MC make the show worth watching. Most of them have some generic tropes along with there own spice or something totally new and the show made me laugh quite a bit. For a while now most \"comedy anime\" has made  me cringe or sigh more than laugh so this anime was a nice pick up for this alone.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8\\10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is very nice with some cool art styles in the op and the anime. It was nice to see something new that worked so well. It was a real treat to look at.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7\\10\\n\r\nThis anime is a fairly good comedy done right with some problems sure but if your looking for a good parody\\comedy this is worth picking up. right now the chances of a second season are basically 0 since  the manga is not much further ahead than the anime along with popularity not being high but for what we have alone, its better than most comedys coming out today.\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nWhen I think about romantic love, simple thoughts come to mind: signs of affection, the giddiness, deeper connections, a feeling like nothing else in the world. Love takes on many different forms, and it means something different to everyone else, but love is lovely all the same.\r\nIn Renai Boukun, love attracts the not-so-normal, too. An angel-devil hybrid. A machete-wielding woman. A shield-creating girl. And a sadistic-happy psycho. For them, love also takes on multiple forms and multiple meanings \u2013 and with it all comes a lot of comedy to at least like along the way.\r\nSTORY\r\nRenaiBoukun reaches a boiling point right quick. Guri, the demon-cosplaying cupid, shows up out of nowhere at Seiji\u2019s doorstep. Not to share the Bible. Rather to inform him of his impending death lest he kiss someone soon. After she demonstrates the power of her angel tool called the Kiss Note (copyright laws be darned) and her subsequent meddling brings Akane and Yuzu into the mix, this recipe for comedic craziness prepares itself for further taste testing.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of flavoring, the anime seasons its content with almost entirely character-based escapades, delivering funny moments left and right as they act and speak out among the harem. For instance, in episode five, Guri tells Akane that kissing Seiji may bring him back from \u201cdeath,\u201d so she smooches the lifeless guy for a solid fifteen minutes to the point that his body shrivels up. In other episodes, Yuzu steals Akane\u2019s thrown-out tissues and bathes in her used bathwater in an attempt to wrap herself in her older half-sister\u2019s essence. As for Guri, her constant carefree attitude inherently creates opportunities for silly situations and sillier reactions.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the character comedy, the anime also leverages other avenues. It has running gags (in a figurative and literal sense) as Akane constantly chases Guri around whenever she gets too close to her beloved Seiji. It has hand-waving workarounds like the evil demon-penguin Stolas \u201ccommunicating\u201d with just his eyes. It has quips like Guri commenting on the fact that Seiji and herself have matching wounds after Akane\u2019s mother\u2019s words stab him in the head (in a fourth-wall-breaking maneuver).\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s more. Escalating jokes with Coraly the angel and his ever \u201cprettier\u201d forms. Subverting expectations with Guri\u2019s transformation into a school swimsuit instead of her fancy angel outfit. Joking in the background like Guri eating a dozen-scoop-stacked ice cream or police officers fearful of Akane. Reacting similarly several minutes later as a callback to an earlier scene, specifically Yuzu\u2019s reaction in episode three to the Kiss Note burning up.\\n\\n\r\nAs can be gleaned, Renai Boukun\u2019s comedy clearly takes on multiple forms much like love itself. Not wanting to tread down too much stagnation, it then attempts to space out its comedy with a smattering of drama here and there. However, the anime loses a bit of steam in the back half of its run when said drama takes higher precedence than the comedy that it touted.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially Guri\u2019s final conflict. Without too much fanfare and resolved rapidly, the extra backstory feels less important and more tacked on. The show also ditches the Kiss Note idea almost entirely in the last six episodes of the season, calling into question the show\u2019s general level of focus.\\n\\n\r\nThe even weaker premise overall also contributes to its decline. At a surface level, the show is about a guy and a bunch of girls in a love polygon. At a deeper level, it\u2019s about Guri and the gang realizing what love means. Unfortunately, the in-between levels do not have enough creativity to carry themselves all way to the finish line. Another way to view it is that there\u2019s a lot there, but there isn\u2019t a lot \u201cgoing on.\u201d As if the anime cares only about its characters rather than what is actually happening around them. All because these happenings are a tad too underwhelming in their delivery.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the jokes do what they can to derive from said premise. Case in point: Akane\u2019s actions. In most other anime, the yandere does not get to harm her beloved for fear of killing him. Yet, thanks to Guri\u2019s angelic powers, Akane is free to stab Seiji as many times as she so pleases. Or take Part B of episode six, a test of courage. Within a haunted section of the school, references to classic Western horror icons like Ghostbusters, Jigsaw, and Chucky pop up while showcasing a few romantic asides between Yuzu and Seiji.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the anime still has a few words about that aforementioned deeper level. Akane sees love as something that personally resonates. Yuzu sees love as something that cannot be tossed aside. Guri sees love as something that must be experienced rather than explained. Shikimi sees love as something that one desperately craves.\\n\\n\r\nThrough these forms, love seeps into almost every aspect of the anime: comedy, drama, or otherwise. Not to mention that the anime contains more standalone kisses than a public orgy. As such, the consistency here offsets some of the issues from the mishandled focus and misplaced premise, keeping the structure of the show in good graces.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nRenai Boukun takes advantage of its visual space to follow its genre quite well.\\n\\n\r\nKey among its artistic choices is the \u201cdegradation\u201d of the characters designs. On a regular basis, the anime reduces their integrity to strong effect. Akane\u2019s appearance becomes slightly rounder for a cuter chibi look. Seiji\u2019s head turns into a ball with three spikes jutting out the top. Guri practically morphs into a minimalist, avant-garde piece when she loses all details save for her ahoge and maybe some duck-like lips depending on the joke at hand.\\n\\n\r\nThis contrast works because normally the designs are either interesting or attractive. Colors capture: Seiji\u2019s light-blue hair sticks out even more than usual for such a plain protagonist, Shikimi\u2019s pink motif masks her vile personality. Akane\u2019s large bosom (which the opening track\u2019s visuals even hone in on) and Yuzu\u2019s cute demeanor are traits that immediately appeal. And Guri dons almost one new costume per episode, going so far as to have a complete redesign after becoming a devil.\\n\\n\r\nMovement likewise \u201cdegrades,\u201d skipping out on strict fluidity and replacing it instead with exaggerated motions for even more comedic opportunities. Yuzu is prone to such actions when she flails her arms in frustration or runs away in panic, but Guri can show it too when she runs with speed as Seiji holds onto her hand for dear life. The show even combines the degraded designs with the degraded movement such as when Akane cuts up a bunch of vegetables when making dinner while at Seiji\u2019s place (with everyone else, much to her chagrin).\\n\\n\r\nNot to say that the art and the animation defaults to degradation all the time. Guri\u2019s sweet scenes and Shikimi\u2019s attacks represent a couple of examples that highlight this statement well enough. Plus, the anime goes out of its way to add additional flair where possible. Out-of-screen speech bubbles. Camera shakes. Smaller details like hearts and sparkles.\\n\\n\r\nA lackluster setting does hold the anime back though; the city and the school do not represent a source of intrigue since they exist to provide little else beyond an area for the characters to run around in. However, the inclusion of goofy, starry, or otherwise imaginative backgrounds continue to aid the comedy in their one-off, supportive behavior.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Renai Boukun fit rather cleanly into tried-and-true roles.\\n\\n\r\nIt has the self-insert protagonist in Seiji. It has the yandere in Akane. It has the tsundere in Yuzu. It has the genki girl in Guri. It has the sadist in Shikimi. Such roles are not inherently a negative; it\u2019s simply an observation and an easy way to succinctly describe those in the show.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the characters rarely deviate from their associated actions. Akane threatens Seiji himself for \u201ccheating\u201d on her with other \u201chomewreckers.\u201d Yuzu acknowledges Seiji\u2019s kindness but qualifies most of her responses with a variation of the classic \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean I like you\u201d phrase. And so on and so forth. However, what they lack in uniqueness they make up for in their connectivity and individual focus.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the relationships within the harem, they have a level of interaction that brings out more comedy from them than otherwise possible. Akane does not like Guri, often calling her \u201cstupid monkey\u201d and conceding to the fact that the two are rivals in love. Yuzu is in love with Akane so hard that she melts into goo when the crazy woman simply kisses her (on the forehead) for the first time. Shikimi \u201ctoys\u201d with these two female cousins of hers. Guri sees the truth within Shikimi\u2019s soul and is arguably Yuzu\u2019s best friend.\\n\\n\r\nPer the harem and the roles they play, each girl also has an affinity for Seiji himself. Akane is madly (read: insanely) in love with the lad. Yuzu cannot help but fall for him as he almost always catches her when she literally falls. Guri adores his reactions and teases him regularly. Shikimi wishes to steal him away from Akane to hurt her as much as possible.\\n\\n\r\nSeiji himself does not get any notable information about him, letting the anime focus on the girls instead. He is nice and normal and therefore not that interesting, but he is still a likable dude nonetheless. If only because he approaches the situation he now finds himself in with a lot of relatability. Guri annoys him to no end. Akane scares him despite the crush he has on her. He chooses to go along with Yuzu\u2019s nonthreatening insults. He wants nothing to do with Shikimi whatsoever. So, while he takes a backseat with everyone else in the cast around, he does not go unnoticed.\\n\\n\r\nRelated to Seiji, their feelings and wants do not appear out of thin air. Renai Boukun makes sure to not let that happen when it actively takes the time to showcase more of the backstory, the reasoning behind the affection they carry.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Akane earns much of that time. Growing up, her mother instilled in her the need to suppress her emotions without reservation, training her instead in the ways of the blade rather than the ways of the heart. Boys would confess their love to Akane, but she turned them down since they only viewed her in a superficial sense.\\n\\n\r\nShe bumps into Seiji randomly one day in an alley where his cat has clawed his eyes shut (setting up an indirect joke in the moment). Without sight, he double checks that she is okay and remarks on her kindness towards him, valuing her as a beautiful person on the inside and winning her over indefinitely.\\n\\n\r\nHaving never expressed emotion and now finding her one true love, it makes sense then that this complete 180 in her thought process turns her into the yandere of today. Even when her mother forces her back home and prevents her from ever seeing Seiji again, she cannot discard the feelings she now holds. After Yuzu\u2019s words, Guri\u2019s actions, and a like-mother-like-daughter bit of exposition, Akane successfully pushes back against the naysayer, finding solace in the love she shares with her blue-haired boyfriend.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate, Renai Boukun investigates and expands on Akane\u2019s past the most out of the characters, meaning the others do not have the same depth. But they receive attention nevertheless. For example, Guri is God\u2019s daughter, but her (unknown) mother is a demon. Thus, her abilities as a cupid are not as fine-tuned as those in heaven, leading to her keen interest in love and what it means. Yuzu devotes herself to Akane after she saves her from falling in a fountain filled with vicious piranhas (pretty extreme but that\u2019s how Shikimi operates). As for Shikimi herself, her desire to obtain what she doesn\u2019t have and everyone else does stems from the flaunting nature of people and the need for attention that nobody gives her.\\n\\n\r\nLike Akane, they improve for the better, too. Guri returns to angel status when she realizes that the best part about love is having the person one loves love them back. Yuzu slowly but surely appreciates Seiji more and more. And Shikimi even seems to find a teeny, tiny bit of gratitude by the end of the season.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the writing involved hits any high notes, but it is still nice to see the anime go out of its way to bolster its crew even if the execution isn\u2019t all there. To that end, smaller side characters help to round out Renai Boukun. Tsuruoka, Yuzu\u2019s (unfortunate) butler, adds a few small comedic asides. Mari, the student (somewhat secretly) in love with her teacher, shows a different kind of love. And Coraly, Guri\u2019s heavenly guide, provides useful information now and again for the characters (and the audience).\\n\\n\r\nThe most intriguing side character, though, is Akua, Seiji\u2019s younger sister and therefore potential love interest. Not only does she garner attention but also she has what can only be described as tangible development. In a three-part act of sorts, her encounters with Stolas give her new insight and new chances of her own. In part one, Seiji saves her to let her know that he is the same brother he has always been despite the gaggle of girls who surround him. In part two, Akane saves her, batting away the penguin and earning some encouragement from the frustrated (soon-to-be) sister-in-law. And in part three, Akua saves herself, finally overcoming her longstanding fears.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, the cast is a net positive. The harem works, they play their roles well, they receive more attention beyond their base characteristics, and the extra side characters pepper in something different when and where they can. Not too shabby.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nStanding above the rest of the sound within Renai Boukun, the opening track forms fun and frivolity with its upright catchiness. The reserved and occasionally weird instrumentation in the first half gives the clapping, the lyrics (with its emphasis on \u201cdaisuki\u201d and \u201cbaby\u201d), and the harmonized vocals the room they require to invite the audience with the start of each episode. Eventually a more involved second half rolls in with grander sounds, different lyrical approaches (namely punctual, crescendo-like and back-and-forth styles), and even more harmonizing.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the rest of the music does not hold up.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track, \u201c\u2018Suku\u2019 wo Oshiete\u201d, has its heart in the right place, showcasing a softer piece with piano and xylophone. But the methodical pacing and the (low) emotional appeal of the song prevent it from reaching full strength alongside this fast-and-funny show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the original soundtrack, it too fades away without much to say let alone listen to. Save for a single track: Shikimi\u2019s theme. The heavy pipes, the grating background noise, and the male vocals ooze an ominous atmosphere to a scary degree.\\n\\n\r\nGoing in the opposite direction again, the voice acting performances deserve a sizable shoutout. Yoshino Aoyama as Guri infuses the air with a chipper cadence, and Manami Numakura as Akane creeps out the audience with her maniacal mannerisms and evil advances (e.g., \u201cThe only one who may hurt Seiji-kun\u2026is me\u201d line from episode two).\\n\\n\r\nMost of all, Yuki Nagano as Yuzu, in her first ever role, nails a proper, shy, and cute voice to make the kindhearted girl one of the funniest characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhat a darn fun anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost every character had me laughing on more than one occasion. Especially Akane, Guri, and Yuzu. Akane literally dying of shock at the mere envisioning of Seiji eloping and starting a family with another woman. Yuzu poking Seiji\u2019s eyes out twice: once for ogling at Akane\u2019s bikini and once more right after for giving Yuzu herself a compliment about her own swimsuit. Guri so happy-go-lucky about almost everything despite the slapstick abuse she experiences or must avoid. Alongside Seiji being at the expense and mercy of these three, I was consistently entertained throughout the show\u2019s season.\\n\\n\r\nMy only major gripe is Shikimi. I liked her at first given her rather (shall we say) in-your-face introduction. But afterwards, when she became much more annoying and infallible and lame, I often frowned upon her arrivals. Worse still that the ending implied that she would (someday) be officially accepted into the harem. Yes, I\u2019m supposed to dislike her, but that doesn\u2019t stop me from actually disliking her, too.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s about it. The anime doesn\u2019t have incredible moments, amazing writing, or nuanced, tangential details for me to praise or hate. It\u2019s simply a fun show that\u2019s at least worth the time invested. And sometimes \u2013 when we shift between the ultra horrendous and the utterly stupendous anime out there \u2013 we do not need to ask for much more.\\n\\n\r\nRenai Boukun may not have a huge presence within the medium, but it still has the execution present to push it a tad bit higher than the average. Quick jokes, a host of (in a positive sense) silly artistic choices, and a couple of notable music tracks argue in its favor even if the rest of its offerings do not invoke a ton of specialness. To put it differently, it brings to mind a more than passable form.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, a rom-com with a strong helping of comedic chops and several words on the meaning of love, hampered by weak drama and a weaker premise\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Good, from the contrasting \u201cdegraded\u201d designs to the exaggerated movements to the goofy additions, the visuals aim for comedy the whole way through\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Akane, Guri, Yuzu, and Shikimi work well together and on their own within the harem format, Seiji is a likable dude, and extra side characters like Akua round out the cast in their own way\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Fine, a forgettable ED and a lackluster OST hold back a catchy OP and strong VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, minus Shikimi, romance plus comedy equals a pretty fun time\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "Romantic comedies are one of the most used genres in all media due to the relative ease of writing one. This has led to all media having a large amount of these stories becoming so recurrent that they can lose the charm quickly. For that reason, in the anime, they often seek to be different by putting fantastic elements to distinguish themselves from the crowd. That's what brings us now with Renai Boukun, let's see if it manages to excel.\r\nWhat is Renai Boukun about?\r\nSeiji Aino is a teenager who gets a strange girl named Guri. She tells him that she accidentally wrote him down onher Kiss Note (\"wink wink\"), a notebook where if you write down the name of two people with an \"X\" in the middle, they have to kiss to fall in love because if they do not they will die Seiji is upset because he does not want to die and has to decide who will he write to kiss and fall in love with, so he chooses Akane Hiyama, the prettiest girl in his school. What was not expected is that Akane is obsessed with him and that Guri (who reveals to be a cupid) also wrote her name making the three become a couple, opening the way to many crazy situations.\\n\\n\r\nDo this offer something new?\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe plot will advance almost episodically at the beginning so that later it starts to have consistency. At first it will seem to be simple with the only mission of writing names on the Kiss Note so that Guri can fulfill his job as a cupid. That's fine because the main thing at the beginning of this series was the comedy, and the premise gave way to various situations to give laughter. With the progress of the chapters we see that the series begins to ambition a little more, using drama that consists of problems with the family and what is love. This is not strictly bad because it is good to see that the series aspires to be more than it shows, but leaves so aside what it showed at the beginning that one wonders if it was really necessary, there are chapters where Guri's work is not even mentioned and nobody seems to worry. Something curious is that at least the changes are warned with elements that are mentioned above, technically these are not things that come out of nowhere and that is to recognize, at least was interested a bit in having consistency (especially seeing that many others do not even try). It seems that in the end you end up watching a different anime, although the change is sudden, if the series had maintained its initial concepts to a lesser extent then there would not be so much trouble in this section.\\n\\n\r\nWith the characters we find a good though questionable diversity. On the one hand Seiji is the \"rational\" character in charge of being the \"finish off\" in the tsukkomi jokes, otherwise they do not tell us anything about him, being more than anything the character so that people are inserted by having a null personality or characterization. On the other hand we have Guri, who is a fujoshi, extroverted, silly and crazy girl who acts in a random way depending on the situation in which she finds herself or provokes. It is an empty character whose appeal is focused on characterization instead of development, her very madness and lack of brain avoid her possible depth. The funny thing is that the most \"interesting\" character is Akane, who has the distinction of being a yandere expert in combat with kukris, they manage to make her funny, at least for a few chapters. She was someone who could get a lot of potential in the comedy, but she only has a joke that is repeated constantly until her arc, where they give a little depth, beginning and ending, after that it seems that her attitude changed, I am grateful for not repeating the joke, but at the same time you feel that she gets completely out of character. To finish we have Yuzu, who is only known for obsessively loving Akane (her sister who is not her real sister), otherwise there is nothing special about that.\\n\\n\r\nThe others do not provide anything relevant so they are not worth remembering, they are just stuffed to give guidelines for some chapters or the main plot. There are even some who in the last chapter try to excel showing some kind of background, but it is so fast and hurried that you do not feel that they have told you something, apart, as they appeared until the end you can not give anything for them because probably you would not see them again The section of the characters would not be so negative if the series would not had ambition beyond being a comedy. When it introduced the drama it was when the characters fell because of how little built they were and that was what it threw everyone.\\n\\n\r\nIf the series had been kept only as a comedy with romance being a joke as it was then, there would be no problem. The jokes at various times are fun ... the first few times. This series makes the common mistake of repeating the same jokes, transforming them from funny to annoying in a short time, without forgetting that it uses the tsukkomi humor, which can quickly become unbearable. When it decides to leave aside the comedy, drama appears and this has several disadvantages. The first one was already mentioned and it is the little construction of the characters, avoiding the empathy that you feel towards them, the Akane arc is an example of that, you can not sympathize with her because her characterization was completely a joke and at the same time did not had nothing to do with those events feeling forced in their execution. Then we have the conflict with Guri, she tries to deal with a subject as big as \"what is love?\", But crashes, to treat it so superficially and never develop it.\\n\\n\r\nIt could be mentioned that it is not really drama and this is just another joke. If it's true, it's not a positive thing either, it's not funny because it really seems to want to be taken seriously. The only thing that could be considered a joke in those moments would be Guri, but, as she is, it is not a good reference either. It is impossible to take it as a drama because the tone and the constant use of ecchi avoid seeing it seriously and it would not be given the genre of comedy because it loses it with the advance of the episodes, in the end this anime has no place to fall dead.\\n\\n\r\nGeneric animation and music\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is standard, neither so good nor so bad. An interesting point is the expressive that Guri can be at different times with deformations that pull more comedy instead of bad animation or design, there are many moments and are appreciated. What can be considered a stain on these is the constant use of the \"funny\" form, its concept is understood, but neither is it so funny nor worth seeing it so many times. With the others they have a generic style that does not excel at all. Turning to animation in general there are no moments where you are surprised by what you see, the scenes of Akane using her weapons may look good, but they are a minority that can not be taken as something positive. Outside of that, resources will be used several times to present funny scenes where the characters become chibis or have fun movements. In a matter of animation and direction, it does not seek to go a step further, it remains standard and that is fine, up to a point.\\n\\n\r\nA similar case happens with music, which happens with more pain than glory. In many cases it will be, at best, audible. There are never any moments where you become prominent or complete for the setting, you could even see the anime without music and you would hardly notice the difference. Moving to the opening we can say that it does not come out of the generic to be a romantic comedy with elements of fantasy, the same with the ending that tries to be something more romantic, but it is still not outstanding. In the sound section you can not leave that to be desired if you never felt that you were there and that is sadder.\\n\\n\r\nYou can not disappoint if nobody expects anything from you\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe genre of romantic comedy is something so common that it could be considered clich\u00e9 by itself and this anime is proof of that. It does not contribute anything to the public, even in comedy, it seeks to be taken seriously when its very construction prevents us from doing it. Nor can be taken as a comedy for its shortcomings to be repetitive and handle a mood that many would not support, and nothing feels romantic because of the poor construction and superficial way that touches the issues on which the drama is based. It was almost inevitable that it was a series of the bunch, its only characteristic, the Kiss Note, that differentiated it was quickly put aside (it could even help develop the theme better) to put what we have always seen in these stories with harem, ecchi and love triangles. Only the first episodes are worth the jokes, although they would still be taking a risk.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal rating:\\n\\n\r\n3.5/10",

            "content": "Here I go, write a review on strange romcom anime. when Renai Boukun first airing, I was quite interested because of 'kiss note' joke, lol. But that curiosity is crushed immediately, watched 2 episode and I dropped this show. And that without a second thought. Why? because everything are joke at those point. Shallow characters representation, cliche and abnormal situation turn me off instantly. True, this anime supposed to be comedy,but I was hopping at least passable story to keep me interested. \r\nSo that's how is it before, but why would I give quite good score on this? Well it turns out that I giveup too early. Because of my friend recommendation, I tried to continue where I left out. And to my surprised, started from episode 3 onward, this anime getting more interesting. Warning a little spoiler here: When I watch episode 2, I thought that's all this show will be offered for entire series. The story will be about matching other couple and not about main character relationship itself, continue with stupid joke every episode. But my first impression is wrong, because their romantic relationship will be developed.. a lot. There is a backstory for every character's behavior, and the angel is not that boring(whose my first impression on her is just stupid joker). \\n\\n\r\nSo to make it short, this anime is romantic comedy that has gimmick and doesn't make sense at all, but behind that is decent story with good plot. Not the best, but enjoyable.",

            "content": "It\u2019s kinda weird, seeing these low reviews for such a stupid anime, but that\u2019s expected. I feel like this show shouldn't have gotten a below 7 score, but I guess too much stupidity really affects it all.\r\nI\u2019ll say it right now, this show is dumb. Like, really dumb. So dumb that it\u2019s one of my favourite anime\u2019s of the season.\r\nI have read the manga and I know the events that are coming out as they unfold, but seeing it animated is a beauty to see. Don\u2019t take this seriously. If you try to analyze and \r\ntry to criticize this anime, well, you will succeed. You\u2019llfind a lot of flaws with everything and find it easy to criticize it.\\n\\n\r\nThis over-the-top harem parody anime is somewhat a nice fresh of air as it\u2019s great to just sit down and laugh your ass off, because a comedy like this is quite hard to come by.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is already dumb, it\u2019s about a kiss note (clearly not a death note reference right?) which allows love to bloom once names have been written and those 2 people kiss. Guri, who is the \u201ccupid\u201d, has been put in charge of it. Seiji, our main character, has been pulled into a situation that any man would die for, but it is a living hell. \\n\\n\r\nSeiji\u2019s crush is Akane, a yandere who also has feelings for Seiji. Guri writes those 2 names, they kiss, and boom easy relationship. Things seem to coast along just fine, until more girls come in. We have run away Yuzu, as well as Best Girl Shikimi. Those names are all written into the harem. Apparently you become immortal once you\u2019re written into the book and gain powers, which is good cause if not for that trait, Seiji would\u2019ve died already.\\n\\n\r\nSo what happens when Seiji and Akane gets written into a book\u2026Oh, plus like 3 other girls including Guri? Well, you get the harem that you would always want, but looking at the anime, it would make yo have second thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nYou gotta feel bad for Seiji at least a little. He has the weirdest harem any man can hope to have, and he tries his best to treat them with kindness, despite the differences in their personality. But sometimes that kindness doesn't bode well with some of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nOf course this anime is not all comedy. There aren't certain points of the anime where it gets you thinking, and there are like tiny hints of drama in some parts. It takes on the topic with love most of the time, and coming to realize what love is and if you have feelings for someone. It\u2019s interesting to see how the characters interact with each other in terms of love, but you can clearly see some characters trying to decide who they really want, but some, they seem pretty open about it (like very open).\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith the comedy, the slight drama, and the romantic realizations, Renai Boukun was able to deliver these certain aspects that make the story more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nNow I was quite surprised to see the studio behind this, and they haven't done many anime\u2019s before. Some of their works are shorts, and some are just, not that good.\\n\\n\r\nI was kinda satisfied with their adaptation, although not \u201ccompletely\u201d faithful in terms of faithfulness, or just reorganization (which i\u2019m pretty ok with)\\n\\n\r\nThe art style really gives you a nickelodeon feel for some reason, the character design just feels cartoony it\u2019s so weird XD. But of course, I got used to it over the time. But It\u2019s pretty average and it stands out quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound track really fits all the scenes that it has. Not to mention the very catchy OP and ED. So I do like the soundtrack, but I wish there was more. I did hear some or lots of repeats, or maybe that\u2019s just me.\\n\\n\r\nWith Seiji and his harem, they need to solve conflicts together, and some characters have some thoughts on what their heart really desires.\\n\\n\r\nSo why should you watch Renai Boukun? \\n\r\nPretty great comedy with \u201cmany\u201d stupid facial expressions\\n\r\nGood deliverance with their story and how it\u2019s presented\\n\r\nA Yandere, and a Sadist Masochist in one anime\\n\r\nA Funny Parody of Death Note\\n\r\nCatchy OP, ED, and overall Soundtrack\\n\r\nTouches on the seriousness of Romance\\n\r\nGuri is basically a yaoi lover\\n\r\nA Pretty Good Harem Series\\n\r\nAn interesting cast of characters\\n\\n\r\nNow of course, this anime isn't the best, and it\u2019s pretty average for its case. However, this parody, harem, and comedic type of anime is sometimes a nice catch to come upon.\\n\\n\r\nIf you happen to like a nice parody, serious romance/comedic romance, harem, yanderes, sadists/masochists, funny faces, or very over-the top humour, then sit back, relax, and enjoy this cluster of madness.",

This show tends to take the piss out of the genre.\r\nI wouldn't be so quick to classify this as a harem series. While yes there is more than two love interesting wanting this dudes D for some reason. The show focuses on two love interest the most. Akane and Guri.\r\nAkane . With Akane she is a Nice, Pretty and the main love interest of the MC. As soon as she realizes that the MC had kissed another girl she legit tries to kill him. \r\nGuri . While being my favorite character shehas the less amount love interest and character development of the two. She is an angel who cosplay's as a wanna be demon. She also has the Kiss note ( Yes it's just as it sounds ) Honestly i feel she more time on screen. And for also being a character who cosplay's she gets very little of screen time of her changing outfits.\\n\\n\r\nWould love to see more of this. The MC does fall into the stereotype of anime MC. I also feel this anime gets more hate than it deserves. Not great but would recommend it.",

Even while watching it I thought it was a joke thinking \"why the hell am I still watching this?\" Well, it kind of is a joke, in the sense that it isn't meant to be taken seriously, with the over the top absurd comedy and the out of place plot twists, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The fact that I was expecting it to be a joke actually improved my enjoyment of the show because I was expecting stuff even stupider than the silly plot twists and overly dramatic jokes. And this unexpectedlyhilarious show was tied together very well with lessons taught about giving a receiving love, which as a hopeless romantic, resonated with me (obviously not as deeply as with more serious anime, but enough to still catch me off guard given the silliness of the show). This is a surprisingly good show that I was not expecting to be good and it makes me happy.",

            "content": "TL;DR Section at the end of the review. This review may or may not contain minor spoilers.\r\nRenai Boukun (also known as Love Tyrant) is practically a parody to the ever so popular Death Note but in the form of a RomCom. Oh boy. \r\nSeiji Aino meets Guri and is told she'll die if she doesn't kiss someone in 24 hours, he goes for the power play and kisses her. Which wasn't the right move. At all. From here on out, he's forced into an unreasonable relationship with the self-proclaimed angel and now they're on a mission to make couples.\r\nAlong the way, Seiji ends up pickingup Akane and Yuzu to add them to his harem of girls. All three girls are in relationship with him. Guri is a mischievous girl who wishes to ship yaoi couples. Yuzu is an earnest girl who wants the love of her sister, Akane, whom would kill for Seiji. Literally. With this cast of characters, a fun RomCom would be ensured, correct? \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is not the case.\\n\\n\r\nMany episodes are just filled with repetitive scenes of the same slapstick-esque gag humor that everybody seems to love. You can't go twenty seconds without Yuzu falling into Seiji's arms, Akane stabbing something, or Guri getting distracted to something she found interesting. The only time this isn't ensuing is when Seiji screws something up, so he gets monologued for about a minute by somebody (usually Yuzu) and then they set off to fix the problem. This in turn makes for a rather bland RomCom. Too much overused comedy, with the added fake and heavy romance they attempt to display is underwhelming. I guess it's worth mentioning that Shikimi, a girl who was surprisingly not added to the harem, was a major sadist. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Renai Boukun attempted to be a funny, wacky RomCom that strayed off the beaten path at times. With really simple characters, the humor isn't as impactful as it could've been. I wouldn't say the show isn't worth watching, but don't expect this to be the funniest show you'll ever watch.",

            "content": "Renai Bokuin\r\nI\u2019ve just finish watching this harem base anime, and some who had dropped it earlier did mention that it\u2019s an anime that can be compared to a chicken running around with its head cut off, and you know what? They\u2019re right, as do my ratings for this 12-episode anime:\r\nMediocre 5, Story: \r\nWell just like in any other anime with a harem genre, this was pretty much clich\u00e9 in fact if you guys out there have watched \u201cTo Love Ru, Darkness\u201d, you might say that the plot was taken from what could have been Momo\u2019s harem plan, where the angle /devil is this cupid gonebonkers with her job, that can be compared to that of another character from \u201cKaminomi\u201d but that\u2019s another story.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Art: \\n\\n\r\nOk, so there were no very good boob flashes from Guri, but Akane and Shikimi panchira moments did make up for this plot-less anime, and that\u2019s as good as it gets, cu\u2019z I don\u2019t give a fuck about everything else.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Sound:\\n\r\nScrew the seiyuu as to whom did who, the score is just for the opening theme, titled \"Koi? de Ai? de Boukun desu!\" by Wake Up, Girls!.\\n\\n\r\nDreadful 2, Character:\\n\\n\r\nOk, so what do we have, here was a poor mixture and choreographed way as to how the characters were suppose to act in order to be  funny, the problem was that in the set of the 5 main characters, they way they were presented and executed were too  much on the off side due to all that plot holes about them, the support characters were pretty much as chaotic in the way they were presented, that one would find hard as to how they fit in, like Guri, she maybe a half angel and half demon, but she still dresses like a demon despite of being a Cupid, also, here supposed romance with Seigi was more like a double standard, where at one point she loves Seigi but doesn't make any attempts to thwart Akane and Shikimi from falling for Seigi, Seigi on the other hand was a big \"I DON'T KNOW\" cu'z he seemly acts as this character who can't seem to make up his mind cu'z he is in a situation where he is a rock on a hard place, Akane, is at one point a wife material for Seigi, but oddly he is also this psycho girlfriend whom one would regret later, frankly she doesn't fit in that character and it would have been better if she would be tone down a bit when it come to her personality, Shikimi........well, she would have been a good 5th wheel if she isn't this devilish but the again she would have been better of if she is this devil that try's to undermined Guri's inheritance to being the head of hell, Now Yuzu, ok so she wasn't suppose to be in Seigi's school , so wtf did Mihoshi, Megane put her in such corny situation, also I kinda hate that she serves as this lesbian character where she competes for Akane's affection form Seigi.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Enjoyment:\\n\r\nWell, it might be a chicken with its head cut off kind of thing, but it was still funny enough to be enjoyed, especially when Seigi gets to have Guri back, Man, I\u2019d wish he dumps Akane so that if he does get killed, by her, he can be with Guri in Heaven, provided that Akane doesn\u2019t chases him there.\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3, Overall:\\n\r\nIt may be funny, but the problem was that studio EMT and Original Creator , Mihoshi Megane, rely heavily on the clich\u00e9s, with some parts being plagiarize from other anime/manga outfits, and frankly why have a season 2 when there\u2019s going to be another one of these with the same thing, so\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\\n\\n\r\nPres Trump OUT!!!!!!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Renai Boukun (\"Love Tyrant\") is a series that I first found out about when a Facebook post gave a clip of a scene from the first episode titled \"Yandere Simulator: The Anime.\" I decided to take a look at the series, and I liked the series. \r\nStory: 7/10 \r\nThe story involves a teenager named Seiji who is in love with a beautiful girl in his class named Akane. While he thinks that he'd find a way to ask her out, he gets a surprise: A girl named Guri shows up and starts to turn his life upside down. She explains how she's a cupid fromHeaven and how she needs to pair up people through \"ships\". She subsequently ships Seiji, herself and Akane together. The series basically follows them and their friends as they go along their lives trying to deal with this harem. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was decent. Not one of my favorites, but I enjoyed it. The character models and proportions were good and some of the models were interesting to see. An example is Korari, with his angel form and his earth form, which is him possessing Seiji's cat, Blue. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 \\n\r\nThe OP and ED were nice to listen to, with the OP having a crazy yet cheerful tune, and the ED having a more soothing and romantic tune. The VA for this series was well done, and I liked the VA especially of Seiji since I felt that it matched his personality and of Yuzu since I felt the voice for a typical Tsundere was done well with her. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters are good and all, but I felt they were too much of a stock character. Seiji is the male protagonist, being a good guy and level-headed, all while trying to please the women that surround his life. Guri is the Female Protagonist, who is a Cupid/Angel who is sent from heaven to make couples and to understand what is love (Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me... no more...). Akane is the \"Yandere\" of the series who develops feelings for Seiji when she realizes he likes her, and loves him very dearly, but she tends to pull out kukri knives to stop anyone who tries to steal Seiji, especially Guri or Shikimi. Yuzu is Akane's younger half-sister who is in love with Akane (both as a Sister and a Woman) and tends to be very clingy on her, but tends to be a literal \"Tsundere\" towards Seiji and gradually warms up to him. Shikimi is the sadistic and cruel cousin of Akane and Yuzu, who tends to flirt with Seiji only to do it on purpose to upset Akane. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThe series was pretty humorous and I smiled a lot throughout the series. For the most part, it had various slice-of-life aspects (such as a beach episode) and the plot ran smoothly enough to make me enjoy the show and to want more. There were times I would get upset at certain points, such as time where Shikimi did her cruel acts to get something from Seiji or Akane. Either way, I had a nice time watching the show and I came to enjoy the scenes and most of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nThe series felt pretty generic, but the idea of having a cupid/angel play as the \"magical girl\" was a nice touch and I was interested with how the series would play out. This isn't one of my favorite series, but it's a nice and cheerful one to enjoy. If you want a different thing out of rom-coms and harems, I would recommend this. Overall, I'd say this was an exact 7.0 in terms of rating.",

            "content": "Usually when I watch TV, it\u2019s a quiet affair. I rarely laugh out loud, or make any noises. Sometimes my little brother checks up on me because he thinks I fell asleep, I\u2019m that quiet. But this show had me in stitches almost every episode, and at times crying from laughing so hard.\r\nLovely Tyrant is just\u2026 brilliantly stupid. It is so self-aware it brushed right past the fourth wall so it could get closer to the fifth. There is literally something for everyone: incest, harems, angels and demons, yanderes, tsunderes, mild BDSM, and yuri just off the top of my head (and I\u2019m pretty surealmost all of that is in the first two episodes).\\n\\n\r\nBut what really gets me for this show is how it manages to talk about love in an open, honest way that is just breathtaking to someone who is used to the quiet, flighty feelings that run rampant in typical romance anime. Each of the girls get development, they address the fine line between lust and love, and all while putting a smile on my face from the sheer goofiness of it all. \\n\\n\r\nProbably my only problem is that while all the girls are memorable, the MC is not at all. Typical harem problem, I know, but for a show that seemed to be all about subverting your expectations of this genre I was hoping they would deliver a little more in that department as well. And I totally get why it\u2019s like this; they make the MC generic as all hell so that the audience can put themselves in that situation, but that comes at the cost of story. Oh well, maybe he gets more development in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re well-versed in anime culture, particularly romances, I think this would be something you\u2019d really enjoy. If you\u2019re looking for something funny it\u2019s got you covered there too. But not knowing a lot of these references might make it difficult for a newcomer to enjoy as much.\\n\\n\r\nMy MAL Score: 7/10",

            "content": "Renai Boukun - I started out rather disliking this show, thinking that the humor behind the frequently used joke \"Oh, we're like Death Note but not actually ha ha\" was poorly done and frankly annoying, to the point where I was prepared to drop this show after the first episode. This sort of humor drops off pretty quickly, and isn't indicative of the show.\r\nAs I kept watching, I found myself enjoying the show more and more. I stopped taking the (frankly repetitive) jokes so seriously and allowed myself to become more invested in the show. As an aside, there are five or six jokes thatshow up at least three times in each episode, if not more. The appeal for me was that it was a show that was, in some respects, truer to life in how it portrayed it's MC and his thought processes. He's level-headed, but still cares about his friends/lovers.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show that I thoroughly enjoyed, but could not recommend to personal friends. Renai Boukun has an issue with repeating the same jokes and some overly rushed personal growth, but I loved it all the same. It's a bit campy, and shouldn't be taken seriously for any stretch of time. It's fun, the characters grow on you, despite a lack of personal growth, and a opening theme so catchy I listened to it each time.",

Guri is a top tier, waifu,. if you like cute, comical dere-dere types. She's goofy, cute, not overt about her feelings and all in all made the show awesome to watch. \r\nNow as for the rest of the actual show, I feel like the parodies here were a complete riot not of keijo proportions, but close. There are several nods, references and gags for the more thorough through-and-through anime watchers and manga readers here to atleast get a chuckle or two off. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is a pretty linear school harem with a few supernatural aspects here and there and I can't really grade the harem segements that well as that's not a genre I watch much, but the supernatural and comedy pieces of it hit nicely for me. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I really deeply loved about this anime --besides Guri-- is that it really has that light-hearted feel that makes your day better. I looked forward to every episode and loved it till the end. \\n\\n\r\nI may actually read the manga for it since the show left a great impression on me. \\n\\n\r\nThings I didn't like were namely Yuzu's character, she was the typical overbearing, unrequited love character that gets super annoying half-way through and then just stays that way. It detracted from my enjoyment but not enough to dread every episode though I did cringe a few times when she came up during the theme song.",

Let's first take a second to analyze the school outfits, I tend to do this, because it's caveat to any anime that incorporates students. It's absolute garbo\r\nIt would seem they're going to go with the pattern that every character that's worth mentioning will have a particular tie, that matches their eye color?? Okay, but the design is plain and boring.\r\nI digress, being the Gintama fan that I am, because I'm a filthy dirty kink-shaming manwhore, I am inclined towards parodies. This show parodies, wellif you watched it you'd know it, Death Note, except the twist is Kiss Note. I can only fantasize the twisted games I would play if I had that power. I'd officially make Trump kiss Putin, but hey that's just me, hate me because I already hate you. \\n\\n\r\nAside from this, let's dive into the characters\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nMain dude: Looks like a weak version of Gohan that went Super Saiyan God Blue. He's alright, pretty plain looking but at least he's got a little sister, and the doujins write themselves\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about main chick: the main chick is the owner of this kiss note, she's got this Araragi hairdo. She's kind of cute, but in a down syndrome kind of way, until she changes into some single strand baldy looking tumor. She becomes it and it is disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nNext is that blonde chode-tail girl, well she's got an incesting trait to her, oops I mean interesting, oops I mean I digress\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nThere's a redhead, she's cray, dual blades knives like she was out of Gangsta... Man I miss that show, because it was garbage, I like garbage, I like you.\\n\\n\r\nNow the art. The art is colorful, that's nice, I like the spring colors that are vibrant with the spring season. However, this will likely decrease a little bit as the season progresses, money don't grow on trees bruh.\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention I hate you? \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the jokes in this show aren't too shabby, but they're not tears in my eyes laughing out loud, it's more of a subtle chuckle, a sensible one.\\n\\n\r\nMan this show sure does have some colorful ties\u2026 From now on I will trace every character throughout this season and choose best girl according to their tie.\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention I love you? Yamete \\n\\n\r\nIf you're wondering if you should watch this, my best advice to you would be \"meh, do you really have anything better to do?\" Rhetorical, you don't you're a slob, a hot mess, you'll watch this. Just do it.",

This is the arguably the most important part of a series, especially for viewers that don't follow the three episode rule.\r\nRenai Boukun starts off with a Death Note parody and a gimmick.\r\nIt's funny, it's self aware, and it's for people that are familiar with the tropes and character archetypes often seen in anime. But this parody is only there to draw the viewer in, so once the parody angle gets ditched in an early episode, the anime focuses much more on pokingfun at other tropes.\\n\\n\r\nBut this anime is mostly a fun, light-hearted stab at the harem genre. And IMO it does harem better than harem does harem.\\n\\n\r\nThe subs are absolutely fine for this anime, but I definitely feel that Austin Tindle really captured the straight man/oblivious dickhead that is Seiji Aino in his performance for the dub, and this lends itself very well to the comedic timing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters do fall into the usual archetypes but a few interesting backstories and some great writing having the characters play off one another makes Renai Boukun worth watching and rewatching. I've found myself looking for clips of moments I really enjoyed to chuckle at them again.\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely worth your time.\\n\\n",

            "content": "After the depressing trainwreck that was Nana, I really wanted a lighthearted comedy that stayed funny the entire series. Zombieland Saga was my first try, but while it had its moments it ultimately couldn't maintain its humor. Shinmai Maou no Testament was a worthy try, and while it has some pretty nice \"plot\" moments, it rapidly digressed into melodrama and I stopped being interested after five episodes. Would Renai Boukun do the trick and remind me of why I liked New Game so much?\r\nNo.\r\nThe first ten episodes were exactly what I needed to pull me out of Nana's forced malaise. It was cute, cheery, thecharacters all had great personalities, and there was just enough world building to give me the impression that it was a well-crafted comedy--while not subtracting at all from the gags and goofs. I know the nods, homages, and parodies really made some people salty, but I thought they all fit right in with the general cheery atmosphere. And besides, the production values here were high enough that it never felt like a rip off, only a good time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then episodes 11 and 12 happened and the show got cut off at the knees.\\n\\n\r\n\"Comedy? Nope, let's add in mopey moments with a shitty subplot that's both generic AF but also entirely out of place\" -the producers.\\n\\n\r\n\"Well fuck this series right into space\" -me\\n\\n\r\nI know I'm extra sensitive to tone shifts in my entertainment, but I refuse to accept that it's impossible to just allow comedies to be comedies and dramas to be dramas. Genre-melding is always a failed endeavor because it alienates both sides in a compromising middle ground that's way too familiar in real life. Is escapism really that lofty a goal?\\n\\n\r\nAnyway if you're willing to only watch the first ten episodes you'll probably enjoy this. I wish I'd done that. On to the next \"comedy\" that will probably succumb to the same problem.",

            "content": "(SPOILERS, GO TO LAST PARAGRAPH)\r\nRenai Boukun was one of the first anime I have ever watched, and I thank myself for that.\r\n When it came out on Cruncyroll, I saw an add for it and I thought \"Hey, this sounds interesting\". I'll go over the intro first. The intro gives the song a lot of personality and up to this day I had the intro and the OUTRO stuck in my head! Honestly, I've watched many more anime and I can say, usually outros suck. I think we can all agree on that. But the fact that one line from that outro had been stuckin my head for over 1 year tells me the sound is great.\\n\\n\r\n The story is OK-ish? The two things that brings it down was the introduction of a certain yangire and getting into depth on Akane's home life. Not the fact that Yuzu is her kind-of-half sister, but her mom's introduction. Also, the ending. Really? About everyone's parents (acceptation for Seiji's parents, that one's funny) are pure trash. It ruins the story, but what saves it is the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is perfect. All the light colors give a bouncy, playful personality to the show all in all. The attention to detail on Guri's ears and eyebrows distinguish her from any other anime girl. If I were to black her out and look at her silhouette, what would give her away is her ears. The only thing I would change would be to replace the chibis with The Ancient Magus' Bride's chibis.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great. They give off such personality and make jokes out of every trope. Akane and Seiji would be tied, Seiji being your everyday harem protagonist and says what we're all thinking when in that kind of situation. Akane's yandere-ism is took to the extent where it's like she's that one kid in a role-play wither their Mary Sue oc and has a tie between blood and love lust. The set of characters in their love (pentagon?) have such depth and personality, plus a funny overexaderation of tropes.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, being a beginner in anime, yet I warn you, MANY PANTY SHOTS, if you aren't interested in that.",

            "content": "At first glance Renai Boukon appears as a comedic harem with a decent story. \r\nUnfortunately the episodes became a dreary drudge to the end. It follows pretty much in suit of a \"typical harem\" anime, a bunch of zany archetypes, Yandere, Tsundere ect ect. It has the typical big plot turn in the last two episodes which most harem anime's some reason feel they need to include. The episodes aren't distinct, the content is pretty much filler and any actual advance of the Harem is practically non-existent. It's only saving grace is its parodical 'pisstake' at the deathnote style, and its occasional humorous moments, althoughnot in the laugh out loud kind of humour, more like the Big Bang Theory is on TV and you can't be arsed to find the remote. \\n\r\nOverall the story gets a disappointing 6, and really weighs down the overall enjoyment.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art style presents itself as rather good in the first few minutes, but seems to lack a personality too it. There are shining moments, but really its just like viewing an anime in 1080p rather than 720p. A very generous 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are decent, they are distinct at least. MC is a classic nice guy. 7\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment was a tough one, whilst there are some enjoyable moments, there is lots of downtime. The lack of any real events in the story leaves it as a 7.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7, yeah its worth watching if the entire harem category has been watched, and at least its dubbed.",

Well that's mostly what I can say for a short review since the comedy factor of this always catches you off guard. If you want a longer review, then continue reading. \r\nRenai Boukun or \"Love Tyrant\" as it is translated, is about a demon main character whose job is to make couples by writing their names using a \"Kiss Note\" and they would immediately fall in love. Well.. that doesn't seem like it's not directly parodying anything. So regarding thestory, it was an average plot that met my expectations but it didn't fully satisfy me because it seemed to be a little rushed. It's not that bad but it could've been better if it took its time with the character development. Over the course of watching it, I can happily say that some scenes cause you to burst in laughter because the comedy really knocks the story off course. I like how it does some parodies of certain things and since the main character has a straight attitude, it enhances the comedy factor. Overall, the anime has a lot of good points and you will enjoy it if you  like watching comedy.",

You know exactly what I am talking about.\r\nIt's not an empty feeling, more of there should be more of a climax and ending compared to this mediocre, cliche and predictable conclusion.\r\nIf that is the type of anime you are looking for, say no further as this is a great paradigm of what I described -- the epitome feeling of displeasure.\r\n\u203b STRENGTH \u203b\r\n- Kiss. An anime where characters actually kiss. I guess that is a strength amongst of countless harems where MC never kiss your favorite ship.\r\n- Concept. Death Note. Kiss Note.It was particularly interesting as I find many parody moments throughout the anime that would leave me chuckling for more. This is, however, a double-edged sword.\\n\\n\r\n- Funny. If you want a good laugh, this sure delivers. But it doesn't sound worth for 5+ hours of your life when you can be reading me_irl memes instead for that same pleasure.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u203b WEAKNESS \u203b\\n\\n\r\n- Concept. I personally think this anime had potential if they took the plot and idea more seriously. There are literally Death Note fanatics who breathe and aspire to be like L and Kira. To deviate from the narrative is one of the biggest mistakes. No. Not even a mistake. It's a sin.\\n\\n\r\n- Cliche characters. Clueless MC. Check. Popular girl who turns out to be a full-on yandere. Check. Loli tsundere ojou-sama character. Check. Full-on sadist that makes your brain and other brain very confused. Check. Oh can't forget the magical fantasy-type of girl who chose to partner with your classic MC for no legitimate reason. Check\\n\\n\r\n- Predictable. After few episodes in, it's just one of those shows that MC is going to win it all.\\n\\n\r\n- No progression. Whether it may be the story or the characters themselves. All began flat as a pancake and still is at the end.\\n\\n\r\n- Inconsistent. The character's action were contradictory and irregular. Example being sadist girl goes full crazy and later on somehow just casually joins in for a sleepover. Illogical lines were crossed multiple times.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I was quite disappointed, even when my standards were low because of a harem-type of anime.\\n\\n\r\nWould I rewatch? Hell no.\\n\r\nWould I recommend? Hell no.\\n\r\nWas this worth my time? Hell no.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was possibly one of the worst I witnessed in 2017, granting mixed feelings of frustration and irritation that just make you deeply ponder why you wasted time watching. If you want to feel some negative feelings, this might be the right cup of tea just for you.",

I did keep in mind its a parody thats why i was expecting more comedy then this.\r\nThey just overloded the harem element in the first episode itself that makes people sigh. The gags inbetween are totally tryhard. The dubbed version is specially mo~re shitty then the subbed one. The character design is not that great too.\r\nIt would have been great if they added the harem element slowly as the story progressed and not just plug it all in the 1st episode.\r\nThe later episodes are fine buti am pretty sure the viewers lose intrest and just drop it thinking its a complete trash. I would recommend new viewers to watch the subbed version if possible.",

I fell out of my computer chair more then once while watching andeven reading the manga. 100% recommended.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nNow having watched Death Note myself and Love Tyrant being a parody of it that was pretty much my only reason for watching it and there was actually some enjoyment to gain from it.\r\nThe story begins with Seiji Aino who is interrupted by a Cupid called Guri who need's him to kiss somebody in 24 hours before she dies, Keiji decides to chose Akane Hiyama a sweet, innocent girl who is really a Yandere however during the kissing process Guri added herself with them in her Kiss Note and now Seiji and Akane have to help her with her cupid business.\r\nIf there's onething that Love Tyrant doesn't do great is it's story as the whole cupid business that Guri, Akane and Seiji had to do is quickly swept aside before the halfway episode and basically becomes like a harem anime where some of the girls start fighting over Seiji for attention while also having some arcs where the girls have their own problems to deal with like Akane and Yuzu's family issues which also involved their mothers because they didn't support what was going on or the fact that Guri doesn't know anything about love so Seiji has to help her understand it though he doesn't do a great job and she ends up becoming a demon until he says the right things to her, yeah the story isn't done well and was a pretty bumpy ride although the story isn't really the strongest part of the anime anyway it relies more on the comedic actions of the characters and using references to other things I mean this is a parody.\\n\r\nIt was actually pretty funny seeing the gang doing ridiculous things that always ended up getting everyone hurt, yes for once it wasn't the MC that suffered and instead because of some peoples actions if pretty much affected everyone, although what the story did do right was it showed us an interesting viewpoint of what heaven and hell might look like which was pretty funny and how important the concept of love is to everyone and what it means to them which is what Guri and even Seiji has to learn.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were a pretty mixed bunch luckily I liked most of them and each of them definitely has their own level of weird and craziness.\\n\r\nSeiji Aino is the male MC and is pretty much like your usual Harem protagonist which consist's of a dense personality although he does see the feelings that some of the girls have for him except Guri since she is very random plus he also has a very short temper often shouting at Guri if she does something wrong or annoying or when it comes to Akane shivering in fear because of her extreme Yandere nature, however he isn't annoying just stupid sometimes as some problems happen because of his indecisive behaviour.\\n\r\nGuri is the female MC and is a Cupid who goes around with her Kiss Note creating random couples, she is a very active yet lazy person and does things by her own accord since she doesn't follow orders very well which is a huge hindrance to Seiji since she always ends up dragging him and the others into bad situations that they have to clean up however despite being a cupid she doesn't fully understand the concept of love so seeing her trying to get past these problems like heartache or jealousy was actually interesting to see.\\n\r\nAkane Hiyama is another female MC who is obsessively in love with Seiji as he was the only person who has made her feel love for anyone, however her love goes to the point of being a Yandere and she will pretty much kill anyone who tries to make a move on Seiji so being in a forced harem isn't really the best thing for her, her personality can change rapidly from being sweet, kind and protective to going into a bloodlust nature depending on who pisses her off which most of the time is Guri , though despite her Yandere nature she does have a troubled upbringing as her mother made her to be a cold person so seeing her overcome her mother's family traditions was actually pretty inspiring.\\n\r\nYuzu Kichougasaki is another female MC that got caught up in the harem except this time it was because of Akane instead of Seiji, Yuzu has feelings for Akane and joined because of her even though they are half-sister's however Akane only see's her as a good friend and always makes her love go unrequited, she can be pretty annoying sometimes mainly because she always goes into a fit if Seiji tries to do something with Akane though there are times where she can be a likeable character like her relationship with Guri which made them a pretty funny duo and other time she does actually start developing feelings for Seiji which does put her into a state of confusion.\\n\r\nShikimi Shiramine is both the cousin of Akane and Yuzu, she is an absolutely terrifying person who is an even worse Yandere than Akane mainly because Shikimi wanted to be noticed and loved by someone which she never got so instead she tries to steal things from everyone hence why she tries to mess with Seiji whenever she can get him alone because she enjoys messing with Akane's feelings too, she is very flirtatious and is very good at disguising herself well from anyone who isn't Seiji, Akane or Yuzu who recognise her instantly, she can also be very devious always luring her prey and slowly torturing them afterwards.\\n\r\nAkua Aino is the younger sister of Seiji and does appear from time to time in the series, she is a tomboy Tsundere and always ends up arguing with her brother mainly because of the predicament he's in and how it is affecting their relationship too though overtime she does start to grow more attached to the girls after they help her multiple times from being attacked by Stola's who is a demonic penguin yeah I'm not joking.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle is compared to some other anime's pretty smooth and some of the hairstyles on the characters like Yuzu and Seiji looked like play doh for some reason like I could touch it and it would just fall off of their heads, it was also interesting seeing the versions of heaven and hell in this anime, heaven just looked like what is usually portrayed in cartoons which is clouds and a bright sun while hell looked like a city with an incredibly gloomy atmosphere which is pretty much what it should be like.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was actually pretty good as Seiji did suffer quite a lot from the girls, but the girls also had their setbacks too as Akane and Guri were always fighting for being the dominant girl for Seiji while Yuzu always fought against Seiji so she could be with Akane and then Shikimi would just come in and destroy everyone, pretty much most of the time everyone is getting knocked around by someone or something.\\n\r\nWhile this is also a parody there are a lot of references to not just Death Note, but a lot of other things like in one episode where the gang went to the school at night there was a lot of horror references and even a Ghostbusters reference and there was even a point where the show took a stab at anime censorship like the beam of lights and convenient steam that would always block the private parts of a person.\\n\\n\r\n The Romance was pretty much a mess and I say that in a good way because even thought everyone is constantly fighting for someone in the group there are genuine moments where there is some sentiment like when Akane is trying to show her mother that being in love isn't a bad thing and Guri is trying to figure out how she feels for Seiji which she finds out the answer by the end of the series so amidst all of the fighting there are some nice moments although they do tend to get interrupted by someone.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was an ok series not great, but not bad either. I'm unsure whether I want to see a season 2 though I am interested where this group will go after the last episode and makes me wonder if they'll concentrate on other characters since Guri seems to have accomplished her goals, well we're just gonna have to wait.",

            "content": "If there is anything that one can take away from Love Tyrant (Renai Boukun), it would be that this anime sheds a more positive light on the yandere personality. It shows how passionate a yandere can be to her beloved. In addition to having an amusing take on the yandere, Love Tyrant\u2019s slapstick comedy also brings plenty of laughs which made the series interesting to watch. However, as the anime went on, it degraded into another regurgitation of a plot from other harem anime and disappoints people who were expecting something new from this series. The anime\u2019s story becomes bland and feels dragged and itsstatic characters ultimately become annoyances, making the anime a chore to watch. Although Love Tyrant gives good laughs and innovates the heroine roster by adding a yandere to it, the anime destroys its initial charm by introducing a bland story partway through the series.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, the plot of Love Tyrant seemed interesting with its parody of Death Note, but in a short while, it abandoned this concept. The Death Note parody should have been kept because using this concept, the anime was able to deliver many clever jokes and plenty of slapstick comedy that made the show funny and interesting to watch. But, after a couple of episodes, this idea was dropped in place for a melodramatic romantic series of events that usually happen in a typical harem anime. Thus, Love Tyrant turns into a bland story halfway through and this sudden shift in story introduces the audience to a whole different plot which in turn, confuses viewers and decreases any initial interest in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWith concern for its characters, Love Tyrant\u2019s static characters benefit the comedic aspect of the anime. The main characters, Guri and Aino Seiji, made an amusing jokester and straight man duo. Along with the yandere, Akane Hiyama, the tsundere character, Yuzu Kichougasaki, and a cast of other side characters, the anime creates an interesting heroine roster and seemingly produces a comedy-focused harem anime. But, after the story changed, these characters continue to be static which made the rest of the anime aggravating to watch. It bothers the viewer to the point where she wants to punch each character in the face because the characters themselves and their relationships with each other don't seem to change at all. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the art and music, the anime does have flashy animations that captures the charm of each heroine. The soundtrack also enhances the hilarity of comedic scenes and pulls on viewers\u2019 heart strings during romantic sequences.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Love Tyrant charms its audience with its unique heroines, clever comedy, and flashy animation, this anime is a satisfying watch to an extent. Because it abandoned its initial story in place with a plot with melodramatic romance, Love Tyrant destroyed the foundation that may have made it stand out from many harem series and conformed to other everyday harem anime. Love Tyrant is an anime that started off strong, but weakened as it progressed through with its story. Overall, the anime is a good watch for a good laugh, but leaves viewers unsatisfied and confused by the end. It may please people who are new to the harem genre, but disappoint those who were expecting something new from Love Tyrant.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about you? What do you think about Love Tyrant?\\n\r\nWhat did you like or dislike about it? \\n\\n\r\nAnd as always: Thanks For Reading!",

Guri is well the care free person of the anime playing games, going off on her own, doing pranks and overall dumb stuff others a pretty nice girl. Akane is the yandere of the girls and well her feeling for Aino are down to the point of her at one point and to kill herself and him so they'd be together so yup yandere but she is pretty cute and can be nice at times when you don't kiss or even get close to Aino otherwise watch out. Yuzu is the finally main of the anime and well she a profound love of Akane her sister she kinda does love Aino as time goes on (sorry for the Spoiler) otherwise she a pretty care for and well worries all the time for Akane.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Thing that i loved: i personally freaking loved this anime i haven't had a anime make be burst out laughing almost every episode in a good while and that anime did this for me the action is pretty good as well this anime is just freaking good all around. Thing that i didn't like: honestly nothing at all i can she that the characters be Cliche and that could turn people away but for real watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: it gets a 9 from me  honestly this anime hasn't made me burst out laughing out in some time this anime honestly had it for me freaking awesome comedy the action for what it was is good and also the fact that i personally loved all the characters in this anime is what made me give this a 9 just a freaking good anime watch this right away",

The show is pretty fast paced and the main character is slightly dull, but somewhat relatable.\r\nIf you are not a stickler to the manga (I have not read it, but seen the complains), expect this to be some monumental parody of deathnote, or have an aversion to fast-paced plot, then I believe you will enjoy this anime quite a bit.\r\nThis show openly mocks the harem genre and does it well in my opinion.  I haven't a lot to sayother than this anime is a good time if you don't go in thinking it will be some kind of masterpiece; that kind of outlook and expectation ruins almost any anime that isn't like 1 in 500 or 1 in a 1000.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a ridiculous plot, a fast-pace (which I like if coherent), enjoyable quips, and a pretty likable cast of characters.

The animation was honestly flawless and it was just great to look at. Didn't bother me once.\r\nSound/Music 8: The opening and Ending are awesome. The opening may be the best of the season IMO. The BGM was on point and just random moments with Guri playing music was hilarious.\r\nCharacter/VA 9: They were different which I thoroughly enjoyed. They were definitely Unique characters.\r\nEnjoyment 10:Probably my favorite anime of the season. It gave me everything I wanted.\\n\\n\r\nOverall View:\\n\r\nIf there's one thing I can say about Renai Boukun is that this anime was so well balanced. Between Fan Service, Action, and Comedy moments it was very well done. Even when it came to the fan service it was not over the top. The action though was on point at times but never went that extra step to get too serious. Even the Drama in the anime was very well done.\\n\r\nGuri was one of the funniest characters of the season in my eyes, she made me laugh literally every episode.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime with great balance and near perfect animation I would recommend Renai Boukun.",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Renai Boukun. This show is alright. Starts off fairly well, then changes about halfway through. Has an awesome cast of characters with a well done Yandere, of which I am partial.\r\nThe story might have been alright but it sort of falls apart about halfway through. The start of the show introduces a female angel who is working as a cupid. She accidentally writes down our MC's name in a notebook which is a parody of the DeathNote book. This sparks the start of our show with Cupid and the MC using the LoveNote to create couples. \r\nAbouthalfway through the show however the concept of coupling people together is no longer the focus. This was strange because they went to great lengths at the start of the show to make it the obvious premise. There was complex rules and penalties for not following them. However they decided to change it up and add a bit of drama. They introduced a new character who likes to ruin other peoples relationships. They also add in a heaven and hell based problem too which just adds to the drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nicely done. The opening song was catchy and the character soundtracks were pretty good too. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were lots of fun and where I think this show regains a lot of points. The main character was a typical average joe harem guy. The girls however were a bit new, or at least not used as often in the harem genre. You have the red headed yandere who is great. The Blonde haired girl loves the red headed yandere. The Cupid angel who is into yaoi and is very energetic. Then you have the pink haired girl who is supposed to be a temptress and sexy. They sound flat based on what I said here and depending on the person they might be. I however enjoyed the casts interaction with each other. If this show followed a more slice of life pace I'm sure they would have turned out a bit better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this anime enough to give it a higher score. The characters really sold it for me as I really hated the direction they took the story in the second half of the show. The shows biggest flaw is its lack of depth. They started with what seemed like an episodic slice of life show about love and relationships. However that doesn't get much time to develop, and we are thrown into character drama without much character development. This makes this part of the show feel shallow and poorly planned. Overall I liked it because I wanted to see how the relationship worked out between all the characters. I'm sure a lot of people wont like it though, so I would recommend watching the first episode and if you don't like It don't bother watching the rest.",

I was amazed with the humor and pulling in ideas from other shows. I thought this would be one of the greatest shows of the season. \r\nHowever that is where it ended. Instead I got a half assed show with boring, lame characters that never got developed. Sadly the only character that got developed was Guri. \r\nThe rest of them I could care less about. Renai Boukun went downhill fast after the first episode. With nothing but poorly executed episodes trying topush some bull shit of friendship, finding yourself, etc. \\n\r\nThis show slowly became a pain to watch. I dreaded having to watch the new episode since I knew it would only let me down. \\n\r\nI will say that it did add a new twist to the romcom. I just wish it was done better. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did not enjoy the show and I would not recommend it to others.",

Don't get me wrong the show is funny but the joke is still going when you are done laughing.  If you are notcoming from Death Note and are just trying to watch some of this will miss you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: it's really nothing special, not bad just it doesn't stand out from other shows.\\n\\n\r\nSound: also nothing too special. if you like the music and stuff okay but it really doesn't matter\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: for what the show has presented they have a lot of promise (i'm going to into detail because i want you to experience them first hand) they have unique personalities than i really like and you might also or hate them it depends on how seriously you take this anime going in it is a parody after all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy: it has it's ups and down but I'm excited to see where this goes i like the characters and premise i just hope they get more creative with the jokes later on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10 the writing could improve and if you don't love or even care for the characters the plot isn't enough to keep you engaged its fun but once again the writing doesn't give it justice. the show is really meh when you think about it but check it out yourself you never know you might love it.",

            "content": "Renai Boukun is a unique experience you've had a million times before, but it's not exactly same-garbage-different-day because if it was exactly the same thing on a different day of the week, at least you would expect nothing and you would not be disappointed. But Oh Boy does Love Tyrant have some disappointment in store for you, sitting right there on the top shelf behind the glass doors of the security case! It's on clearance, too; no refunds, no exchanges.\r\nNow surely it can't be as bad as I'm building it up to be, right? I must be way off, I just forgot to turn mybrain off and ended up taking it way too seriously when Love Tyrant didn't even bother taking itself seriously, so this is just me being a Salty Sandra, right?\\n\\n\r\nWell, you tell me.\\n\\n\r\nI've managed to narrow down exactly what Love Tyrant does wrong and why it ends up the Jonestown Massacre it is by asking three key questions:\\n\\n\r\n1: Why did they ignore the fundamentals?\\n\r\nIn every harem, there is always a main girl, and protocol is typically to place the first girl the MC meets in that role. This anime places the Second girl in that role. Is that bad? No! In fact it's nice to have the trope subverted. The problem lies with the type the second girl is: she's a yandere. She is not sweet, she is not kind, she's an obsessive, violent berserker with no regard for human life. That is the exact opposite of the kind of girl you need as a stable main when building a harem. Yanderes are bad enough on their own, but they don't work as part of a harem and as the main, the girl at the core of the harem, it's a relationship structure designed to implode on itself. \\n\\n\r\n2: What are characters?\\n\r\nNone of the respective girls' redeeming qualities actually outweigh their faults except the little sister: Yuzu's moments as a true friend and voice of reason never have much of an impact when her role is basically to be a loud, squeaky third wheel. The fact that Guri is the life of the party hardly makes up for the fact that the party is nonstop cat fighting, conflict and constructing gay relationships on the spot for her own amusement. Then there's Shikimi, who doesn't even care about Seiji but wants to be included in the Love Club and does horrible things to everybody because she's an irredeemable attention whore. And of course, Akane is a jealous murder hound with a generous amount of sand up her pussy who stabs everybody at the slightest provocation. Imouto Akua, meanwhile, is a basically normal little sister who kind of resents the fact that her brother doesn't pay as much attention to her as he used to...oh yeah and she's being chased by a demonic rapist penguin. Basic Japanese Girl Problems, right? But that aside, she's just your average tsundere imouto, which is a breath of fresh air in comparison to all the legal, non-blood related women in Seiji's life. And when all the choices are basically shit compared to your sister, that is how you know you've Had Gone Done Been Went and made a gosh derned mistake there, buckaroo!\\n\\n\r\n3: What is pacing?!\\n\r\nIt's an established practice with adaptations to change the order of events so that the adaptation can wrap up one way or another. I have not read the source material so I'm uncertain if this is the case with Love Tyrant, but one thing is for certain: the placement of events is terribly weak and the directors chose this order for a reason: they were aiming for the harem ending. I saw it coming when episode 8 finally gave Seiji and Akane's relationship the validity it needs to function, made Akane human and relatable, and this is the point where I nearly dropped the series. I should have, and I recommend you do if you decide to watch this abomination, because it was a decisive, moving plot arc that felt like a series finale. They could have ended the show on a high note by making episode 8 episode 12 instead of dropping it slap bang in the middle and pulling the worst pump and dump on a relationship I have ever seen. First they cracked Akane's shell and made me care about her and gave her so many Best Girl points it was practically no contest, and then immediately took them all back and left her as we met her: a god damned nutcase that'll slit your throat if another woman so much as brushes up against you by accident (comedy at it's finest, people!)\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, I guess it's not the absolute worst I've ever come across. The visuals are nice, I guess and it managed to keep me watching somehow. But good GOD, I'm gonna need a long shower to wash this one off me. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and what's a Kiss Note, you ask? A pile of ashes by the end of episode 3, don't fuckin' worry about it.",

            "content": "Trials and tribulations of the modern otaku redux\r\nLove Tyrant is one of those anime that\u2019s all over the place for me. On one hand it\u2019s a parody of all too familiar character tropes. That I loved because then the story had to be tight unify these ridiculous elements. And in those episodes I saw the appeal of the show and understood why it was made. It was funny, the action was intense, and the drama was tense. Not to mention sexy at times. On the other hand, it\u2019s a parody so it runs the clich\u00e9s pretty hard. And when it does the plot and storythat brought all these characters together goes out the window. Thus becoming the very thing it intends to mock. And when the story isn\u2019t moving it isn\u2019t interesting. And when it isn\u2019t interesting, I don\u2019t want to watch it. Even the shit with his sister and the penguin was funny and interesting. But it\u2019s yet another series that has action & comedy & sexy & drama & romance. Like Kill La Kill. Too much to not excel at one, but enough done well enough to justify recommending this series. And there it is, that\u2019s the paradox. Who do I recommend this to? I can\u2019t envision a target audience for this series. Teenage boys with a yandere fetish? If I were to ask me, \u201cShould I watch Love Tyrant; yes or no?\u201d I\u2019d be forced to answer, \u201cNo.\u201d It\u2019s okay and has it\u2019s moments, but you could get your kicks elsewhere and not be sorry for it. But if someone watched it and told me they liked/loved it, I would not be surprised. I was entertained MOST of the time.",

I mean, there's a lot of material here. An angel who only does yaoi shippings and ships randoms people. A tsundere who loves a yandere. This anime did try to make jokes about these things, but on the wrong place and on the wrong time. This anime tries to break the ice in serious situations, but it gets annoying when you're trying to convey the plot to the viewer while making them laugh at thesame time.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, don't get me started on the main characters. They're bland, boring, baffling, and some other bad insult that doesn't start with b. I want to talk about them, but considering that this is a non- spoiler review, I'll just say this: their jokes get old.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nHowever, even though the anime is shit, it's still somewhat enjoyable in the sense that you could watch it when you don't have anything else to do.
