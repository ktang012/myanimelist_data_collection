            "content": "Here's a show with an interesting theme\r\nAbout an otaku with a dream:\r\nTo create a new game\r\nThat puts all else to shame\r\nAnd produced by the girls from his team\r\nOne day he met a girl dressed in white\r\nIt was a case of love at first sight\r\nExcept instead of love\r\nIt was rather kind of\r\nLike he wanted her soul's copyright\r\nShe would model for the female lead\r\nFor the game; he made sure she agreed\r\nBut despite interests joint\r\nTo just get to that point\r\nThere was one more thing that they would need\r\nSo he then asked with all of his heart\r\nIf his tsundere friend could take part\r\nSince under a fake name\r\nShe'd gotten tonsof fame\\n\r\nFor her professional hentai art\\n\\n\r\nLastly the top student of his grade\\n\r\nWith the plotline, he asked for her aid\\n\r\nBut as he came to see\\n\r\nWhat she wrote up was the\\n\r\nMost ridiculous script ever made\\n\\n\r\nSo at last the circle was created\\n\r\nWhich made the protag oh so elated\\n\r\nHowever although he\\n\r\nDid not care 'bout 3D\\n\r\nAll the girls thought of him as their fated\\n\\n\r\nSo they did everything that they could\\n\r\nTo ensure that the game would be good\\n\r\nAnd when there was a chance\\n\r\nAt him they'd steal a glance\\n\r\nWhilst pretending to work as they should\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was touching and cute\\n\r\nBut there's more where that came from to boot\\n\r\nIf you thought that was it\\n\r\nPlease calm down for a bit\\n\r\nThat was still just the very first route!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is Saekano; quite possibly the most positively surprising show of the season.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all I would like to say that despite the ecchi tag; the fanservice in this show is very light (other than episode 00). In reality, Saekano is much more similar to shows like Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai, OreImo and Outbreak Company as it has a character cast mainly consisting of otakus, and it consistently parodies and makes fun of today's anime industry as well as the eroge market as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nIn case that wasn't clear, the story is about your typical high-school otaku named Tomoya who has a dream of creating \"the ultimate galge\" that can touch the hearts and souls of everyone playing it. In order to do so he seeks the help of his tsundere childhood friend Eriri who secretly works as a hentai doujinshi artist on her spare time, as well as the so-called \"smartest girl in school\" Utaha who is a famous romance light novel author. Together they form a doujin circle and seek to create a homemade galge in order to fulfill Tomoya's dream. As the icing on the cake however, Tomoya also recruits his completely plain and emotionless classmate Megumi to join the circle, with the intention of \"training\" her into becoming the model for the game's main heroine. It's a very silly concept that doesn't take itself seriously whatsoever, but as a result it's surprisingly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're well-versed in today's anime industry, along with all the moe and ecchi shows that come out these days, then you'll probably like this show a lot because the endless references and parodies of it are absolutely hilarious. If you also happen to play visual novels, then it'll be even better still. I familiarized myself a lot with this anime, and as a result it almost never failed to put a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nOver time, there are some moments when the show gets a bit more serious on the romance/drama front but it still keeps it fairly light and doesn't go past the point where it starts feeling clich\u00e9. This pleased me a lot, because Saekano is truly at its best when it's being non-serious, light-hearted and just plain fun.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, out of all the various comedies, harems and other simplistic shows of that nature from the Winter 2015 season, I'd definitely have to say this is the best one. This is mainly because a) it actually feels fresh and not overused by any means, and b) it's actually extremely funny.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like moe and/or ecchi shows, play visual novels or just like to have a good laugh, then I'd recommend giving Saekano a shot. You probably won't regret it.",

            "content": "Saekano is the most frustrating kind of bad show: the kind which could have been legitimately good if it tried.\r\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t hyped for Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata (Saekano for short) at the start of winter 2015. It\u2019s a shiny new adaptation of Fumiaki Maruto\u2019s light novel series \u2013 the same Fumiaki Maruto who wrote White Album 2, which got an anime around a year and a half ago. He also wrote Parfait and Sekai de Ichiban NG na Koi \u2013 both of which I\u2019ve seen glowing reviews of. Naturally, I\u2019d expect Saekano to be something close to his workin eroge.\\n\\n\r\nI probably should\u2019ve listened to the warning signs. Certain Maruto fans on Twitter had already panned the show and the LN for being self-gratifying otaku humor. People who have watched the first two episodes called the show obnoxious for having snarky commentary on its clich\u00e9s while also indulging in them.\\n\\n\r\nBut let\u2019s give credit where it\u2019s due: Saekano isn\u2019t complete trash. I would probably be more forgiving of the show if it were: it\u2019s easier to let go of a show that\u2019s a total failure than a show that flubbed with its great ideas. There are two things that Saekano did well in portraying: the relationship between consumer and creator, and the character of Katou Megumi. Let\u2019s start with the former.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 6 of Saekano is the first episode where I thought the show was being genuine. The episode frames Utaha as the creator and Tomoya the consumer, and the show asks: how far should an author go to in trying to please their readers? And I feel that the show gave a good answer to the question: fans want something that the creator wrote, not something that would go with their expectations. The framing of the scene was even reminiscent of White Album 2: two high school kids throwing their emotions at each other under the snow might be a clich\u00e9d scene, but if there\u2019s anyone who can make it work, it\u2019s Fumiaki Maruto.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 9 is another good episode that gave Eriri much-needed characterization past her generic tsundere shtick. This time, the show asks why a creator, well, creates works for fans \u2013 for whose sake are they putting out content? Again, the show frames this question with Tomoya as the consumer and Eriri as the creator: does Eriri draw so she can get better for her fans, or does she just draw to satisfy herself and stay where she is?  Eriri finds her foot forward when she decides to get better at drawing to win over Tomoya and satisfy her fans. The show doesn\u2019t give a complete answer, but it gave her character a push forward.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I think Saekano\u2019s best point was Katou Megumi\u2019s character: the deadpan non-otaku who joins the group as the \u201cmain heroine\u201d. There\u2019s no mistaking that the title\u2019s \u201cboring heroine\u201d refers to Katou: the show keeps referring to her as having \u201cno character\u201d and a \u201chalf-assed personality\u201d. On the contrary, her character doesn\u2019t conform to the show\u2019s pre-established archetypes: even though she doesn\u2019t stand out within the show, Katou is perhaps the most memorable character because she\u2019s not a generic archetype. And this is what I think the show was trying to accomplish with Katou: characters should be people, and not just generic archetypes. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately that's where the show\u2019s good points stop. The conversation between Eriri and Tomoya from the start of episode 5 exemplifies what exactly makes the show so frustrating:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cBut I just want to always be myself.\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Everyone has a secret side to them.\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 Katou doesn\u2019t, does she?\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a non-otaku, but even when mixed up with us otaku, she stayed exactly the same as she was, right?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIt's an insightful conversation, only to be cut short by Eriri acting like the stock tsundere archetype. Saekano knows that Katou stands out the most among the characters, and it knows that characters that follow archetypes like Eriri need to have more than their shallow character traits. The show demonstrates a degree of awareness of its clich\u00e9s \u2013 it knows that its characters are generic archetypes, and Katou serves as a direct contrast to them. But that\u2019s where it stops \u2013 it\u2019s satisfied at being aware of its clich\u00e9s, but never does anything to rise up above them. Even worse, the show\u2019s title and all of the show\u2019s characters want Katou to become one of them: a generic character who talks and responds to situations with nothing but stock phrases. It\u2019s hypocritical and obnoxious \u2013 in short, it\u2019s a show that gives advice and chooses not to follow it.\\n\\n\r\nBut I would\u2019ve been okay with the show if it had stopped there. Instead, Episode 10 onwards indulges in all the trashy tropes that it comments on. Episode 10 throws all subtlety out of the window and pours male gaze all over the show, not to mention indulging in classy humor such as flashing a girl. It\u2019s not even the more sensual kind of fanservice like episode 6\u2019s Utaha scene where she puts on her stockings. It\u2019s the point where the show stops trying and just revels in all the trashy LN tropes we all love and \u201ccleverly\u201d comments on all of them. This show is completely in love with itself and all of the trashy things that it comments on.\\n\\n\r\nThe bottom line: if you\u2019re watching this because you heard it was by White Album 2\u2019s author, don\u2019t bother. If you\u2019re watching this expecting a trashy, fanservice-y show, you\u2019re better off watching an actual trashy, fanservice-y show, because shows like those don\u2019t bother pretending that they\u2019re not trashy, fanservice-y crap. Saekano is obnoxious, hypocritical, and pretentious. Avoid it like the big, stinky turd that it is.\\n\\n\r\n(Full review with images here: https://oneofepisodes.wordpress.com/2015/04/17/saekano-how-to-write-a-stinking-pile-of-crap/)",

            "content": "Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata, or Saekano for reduce, is an anime where the protagonist is an otaku who wants to fulfill his dream of creating a galgame, after meeting his beautiful heroine in a captivating scene in which his hat flies downhill, stopping near of protagonist, who is shocked to see a girl with such beauty. To follow his dream of creating a game, he forms your harem... I mean, your team, with qualified people in various areas which are needed to create a game, but with unique personalities, which consequently develops a bit of humor on the series thanks to this factor, and thenfrom there the story begins to unfold. Obviously what will be written from here is my opinion on the series. I'm available to discuss the show with anyone who's interested, regardless of have or not agreed with the content of the review.\\n\\n\r\nTo be quite honest, the story isn't entirely creative, but so doesn't cease to be fun. The protagonist's idea do everything to chase his dream is very common, including in reality, to be exact. But the situations created in the course of the series are funny, somewhat pleasant, and usually force a smile of who is watching. Are jokes that fit well with the situation that is happening on moment. At certain times these jokes or funny moments, mix a little with fanservice, and to be honest, it doesn't bother me much, since the series doesn't use just this artifice in your episodes. In my opinion is a quantity dosed, if I may say so. Watch the reaction of the protagonist in these moments is funny, but at certain times he just exaggerating with screams and unique reactions. Anyway, to sum up, the story is quite normal, but the situations created at certain times are funny, which to my view, gives a positive point for the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe design in overall is very good. In this regard, the studio did a great job on show, because characters and scenary interact well, making the characters more interesting to observe, and in compensation the series becomes more enjoyable to watch. Those traits help the spectator to identify or admire some specific character. I don't have a lot to talk about this aspect of design, since, in my opinion, it's quite satisfactory. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime soundtrack is pretty interesting, because I really liked the music and sound effects produced in the series. About the dubbing of characters, most of the dubbers have adapted well to the characters, with the exception of the protagonist. I mean, it's not that don't fit well, because it was actually done an interesting job here, but in my opinion the \"Kirito's voice\" is already a bit saturated, appearing in many recent anime. Nothing against the dubber's work, only in my view, he could at the same trying to change the voice in different characters. I'm not saying that's easy, since I have no experience in the subject, but over time the viewers can get tired of it. The other characters, have gained many good voice, and in my view, fit well with their appearances and personalities. The Utaha's dubber helped to define your firm and unforgiving personality. The Eriri's dubber combined very well with the style of tsundere character, and the Katou's dubber, in my opinion, was perfect. I loved watching the anime and accompany the Katou expressing his style confused and distant in their various moments in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are unusual, because according to Katou, all three beyond are big figures in school where they study, once otakus, in several other stories tend to be despised. It is normal to think that the Eriri and Utaha are famous for their physical appearance and the way you act different with other people, I just don't really understand why the Tomoya is an important figure there inside. Since this isn't the focus, end up not being so important think much about it. Utaha is an interesting character, because in addition to having a beauty that highlights, has a job, or hobby, unusual to a student, and has a very interesting personality, what makes it endearing. Eriri is a typical tsundere of serie, and that prides itself (although she can't admit) be a childhood friend of Tomoya. Usually is the one that is paying attention on Tomoya, and gets annoyed with the jokes and approaches which Utaha makes to induce Tomoya, one since most of them are quite bold. Michiru appeared at the last moment, but ended up being really cool and provided funny moments, being the main, but not unique, base of the fanservice. Katou is the most interesting of all, in my opinion, because it can be one of the more normal characters I've ever seen in anime. Has weak presence and sometimes the other characters don't notice her in around. Your reactions are unexpectedly normal when it addresses an unknown subject or that it's not in your best interest, and it ends up becoming one of its charms. She's so normal that it's a very different character compared to several others. Tomoya is a standard otaku, with strong personality, which eventually can be annoying, but is the center of history and ensures the laughter in series, once your reactions towards the other girls are typical and funny.\\n\\n\r\nThe series itself in general is quite satisfactory, can please diverse audiences. Maybe just disappoint people hoping for a serious romance, since you shouldn't expect that in anime with the harem genre. Who likes a mild romcom, Saekano is a very interesting show to watch, because hours have comedies, dramas and pinches of fanservice. Has a common storyline, but enjoyable. Was well on several counts. It's a great entertainment and fun guaranteed.",

            "content": "What does it take to create a dating SIM which will cause people to laugh and cry, but also touch their hearts? This was a question our main character asked himself, which sparked the beginning of the roller-coaster of laughs we call Saekano. \r\nI\u2019m sure when we were younger you\u2019ve all had dreams and goals you wanted to achieve when you get older. The anime tells the epic adventure it took our MC, Tomoya Aki, to achieve his goal of creating a game, complete with all the girl problems, and sexual harassments he receives each day from his devious co-workers.\r\nWhile I was scrolling through thenotoriously long new anime section of an unnamed website \u201chow to raise a boring girlfriend\u201d caught my eye, then I thought to myself \u201cbetter take some notes.\u201d At first glance Saekano looks like an average rom-com anime, and being your normal rom-com lover I decided to give it a try, and let me tell you I was definitely in for a treat. Saekano is one of those anime\u2019s that you just can't get enough of, not a single episode has left me without tears rolling down my face from laughter.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]\\n\r\nThe story kicks off on a sunny spring day in which the wind blows the hat off of a fair maiden, which of course Tomoya was there to pick it up for her, and give it back. That event was what inspired Tomoya to make a dating SIM, he also envisioned that, that exact event would serve to be a flawless opening scene with the maiden as the main character. And as far as we know the  \u201cperfect girl\u201d  doesn\u2019t exist, because Tomoya later finds out that in reality the maiden wasn't very \u201cfair,\u201d in fact, apart from her beauty, she\u2019s just about the most ordinary girl ever. She was so ordinary that Tomoya didn't realize that she was in his class. The plot is centered on our protagonist Tomoya Aki and his associates, the busty, but intelligent Utaha senpai, the flat but ill-mannered Eriri Spencer, and of course the ordinary girl, Katou Megumi. Saekano takes a slow start, as it takes several episodes for Mr. Aki to convince his unwilling companions to aid him in making his game. But after that the pacing of the anime is quite steady. It\u2019s sad that this anime is limited only to 12 episodes, which for me is definite con, because there could\u2019ve been so much more character, and plot development. \\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\t\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely where the anime excels the most at. Each of the female protagonists, with the exception of Katou, have an ornate, and well developed backstory with Tomoya. Throughout the plot the author slowly elaborates more on the characters as if slowly giving us puzzle pieces to give us the better picture. But due to the anime only having 12 episodes, we never really get to see the full potential character development from all the characters. \\n\\n\r\n[Art]\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the A-1 pictures did a great job animating this anime. They used vibrant colors that really brought out carefree, and cheerful tone of the show. The animation style reminds me of Nisekoi another successful harem anime. The character designs to me were great, they followed the generic character designs of many harem, and romance animes.Don\u2019t really see much cons of this art style unless you dislike the uniqueness of the art style. One thing that stood out to me was the insanely stubby fingers the characters have sometimes, especially while Utaha is typing.  \\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\r\nThe show had a solid, and well-built soundtrack, with dramatic sounding dramatic scenes, and cheerful music for happy scenes. Not much I can say but the soundtracks were sufficient for the show. Great choices in the voice actor department, what could go wrong Ai Kayano, and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as 2 of your main characters? The OPs and EDs were lighthearted songs that complemented the show\u2019s tone. They were not especially stunning but definitely not crappy. \\n\\n\r\n[Negatives]\\n\r\nAs a mentioned before several times, my biggest problem with this anime is that it only has 12 episodes, and because of this, we didn\u2019t get to see the full potential of character development the show could\u2019ve given us. Nor get to see a more complete full picture. But with the anime leaving off like this I\u2019m sure that there would be second, or even a third season. \\n\\n\r\nThe second thing I had a problem while watching the anime was the pacing of the, which i mentioned before was a bit too slow in the beginning. But towards the end of the show the pacing sped up again.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment/ Overall]\\n\r\nQ-What would you happen if you added together an eccentric rich girl, a beautiful female writer, a hardcore otaku, his musically blessed cousin, and an ordinary girl?  \\n\\n\r\nA-You get Blessing Software, as well as one of the most well-made and hilarious rom-coms ever.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching Oregairu, I fell in love with the rom-com genre. But it\u2019s hard to find a well-made rom-com these days but this anime definitely didn\u2019t disappoint me. I enjoyed everything in this show from Eriri\u2019s hilarious tsundere personality to Utaha\u2019s constant sexual harassments. I know some people criticize this show\u2019s unrealistic plot, but honestly who watches an anime for its realism? Anime\u2019s aren\u2019t meant to be rated for its realistic elements but for its ability to entertain the viewer. And this is an anime that does exactly that. It\u2019s an anime that focuses in on its characters, I\u2019m definitely not saying that the plot is bad I\u2019m just saying that the characters of the anime are the focal point, and make it worth watching. But just remember if you plan to watch Saekano, as their game progresses, hilarity ensues not far behind.\\n\\n\r\nStory-7\\n\r\nArt-10\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\r\nCharacter-8\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9\\n\r\nOverall-8\\n\\n\\n\\n",

BEING SELF-AWARE DOES NOT MAKE YOU A GOOD PARODY OR SATIRE.\r\nYeah, Saekano is one of those. The kind of work that pokes at some over-used trope or clich\u00e9 and then loudly proclaims \"Isn't that totally a clich\u00e9, huh, guys?!\". Yeah, it is, but so what? Are you going to expand on that? Maybe in some way subvert that trope and bring about something new? You just poke at it. Okay.\r\nAnd that's the main problem with Saekano. It tries to be a parodysimply by being self-aware. It keeps saying that characters are \"Tsunderes\" and \"Yanderes\" without even trying to expand on them. It keeps saying how given situation is \"Totally out of some harem anime\" and then proceed to play it out exactly like that. Nothing is expanded upon or subverted, just acknowledged. \\n\r\nAnd that's the root of the problem. Well, that and the protagonist, who was made by combining all the annoying traits from other romance protagonists. He's oblivious, obnoxious, doesn't have any talents except \"HIS FORCE OF WILL!\", has only two voice settings (boring and YELLS RIGHT IN YOUR FACE) and for some reason all of \"The most popular girls in the school\" are hopelessly in love with him. \\n\r\nI'd say the only redeeming quality the show has is Megumi Katou, the \"Boring Girlfriend\". She is stated to be incredibly boring, bland and generic. And she is. She genuinely is, but precisely because of that she is the most interesting character in the entire show, because she manages to be original in the sea of over-used tropes and generic characters.\\n\r\nFor me Saekano is an example of great wasted potential. There were so many instances where I hoped it'd go to a different, more original direction and become something more. I was hoping Kato would get fed up with Aki's obnoxiousness after he forbade her to go out with her cousin, because majority of rational people would draw a line there.. I was hoping Eriri would accept other circle proposition, because it appreciated her talents, unlike Aki. I was hoping it would go deeper with Utaha's backstory to explain why would she fall in love with Aki to such a degree, that she was willing to compromise her career and artistic integrity for his sake. I was hoping it would expand more on girls' relationship with each other, probably even showing that they don't really need Aki to fulfill their own ambitions. But no. That didn't happen and all we got was some self-referential humor and a creepy camera operator who kept focusing on girls' different body parts for no reason during casual conversations.",

            "content": "(Reposting because apparently it fell foul of rules about previews :/ )\r\nHow to write a boring parody\r\nDon't you just love it when a show knows it's a show? When characters find themselves in a situation that only occurs in fiction & they know it? How pretty much every new series nominally set in the real world has someone say \u201cThis would only happen in manga\u201d or \u201cThis isn't anime\u201d at least once? Well I hope you do, because Saekano is basically an entire series made up of such oh so witty observations & self-referential jabs at the genre it is set in. Too bad itsucks.\\n\\n\r\nOur main character is one Tomoyo Aki, a super otaku with a popular blog & a reputation for being the nerdiest nerd in nerdom, which apparently is a good thing. Basically he's Keima Katsuragi from The World God Only Knows, except instead of finding himself tasked by a demon to put his otaku skills to use date raping his schoolmates, he instead has the type of only in fiction encounter with a mysterious girl that inspires him to create the greatest dating sim ever made.\\n\\n\r\nThere's just one problem with this plan, he can't write. Or draw. Or indeed do anything beyond feel inspired. Luckily for him, he knows the two most popular girls in the school, hot headed Eriri Spencer Sawamura & aloof Kasumigaoka Utaha have secret otaku identities as a mangaka & LN author respectively, & so he sets about convincing them to make his dream game come true. Even better, he soon encounters the mysterious girl whose chance encounter began this whole affair. However, unlike in his fantasy, she turns out to be the utterly unassuming Megumi Kato, & so not only does our MC set out to make the greatest game ever, but also shape the real miss Kato to be more like the heroine he thinks of her as. Cue hijinks.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to get straight to the point. I do not much care for Saekano. Tomoyo is a generic main character, oblivious to the feelings & emotions of everyone around him & yet feels compelled to do everything he can to, to use the unfortunate parlance of the genre, raise the flags of every girl he comes into contact with. With the exception of Kato, the rest of the cast are similarly cliche. Would you believe that Eriri & Kasumigaoka both have deeply held feelings for Tomoyo? Well no, you wouldn't, because he's an un-likeable brat of a person, & yet they most certainly do. Of course they can't just share those feelings with him (but they certainly can share them with the audience) because then there wouldn't be a show. Ho hum.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of being a brat, it's quite stunning just what a brat Tomoyo is. As seems to be the way for men in anime, he is incapable of expressing his emotions without shouting. He shouts a lot, usually at other people, usually telling them why what they're doing is wrong. Be it shouting at Megumi for being too boring or shouting at Kasumigaoka for not writing his story for him just the way he wants it, Tomoyo seems incapable of expressing himself any other way but loudly. & when he's not shouting, he's usually smugly proselyting about how great otaku culture is & by implication how great he is for being one. It's like if Madarame from Genshiken was giving his 2D girls speech for an entire series. Of course everyone puts up with it because this is a romance anime & tolerating the main character's foibles & failings, even seeing how they are in fact ultimately correct about everything, is what makes a good girlfriend.\\n\\n\r\nNow because this is apparently satire, one must assume that those parts which appear obviously cliche (ie the whole show) are intentionally so. By that logic, the characters go through the harem routines we've seen their character types go through a hundred times before precisely because it's what they're expected to do.The obnoxious fan service, & it really is at times, is so because\\n\r\nboob & crotch shots are so ubiquitous in this genre that it has to be so over the top just to stand out. Saekano isn't trying to change anything, merely point out how silly it is once you start to notice it, which it certainly does.\\n\\n\r\nHere's my problem with that. For one, I don't think there's a fan among harem viewers who isn't already aware that in every respect the harem story type is stupid & unrealistic. We already know it's dumb, so simply smugly pointing out how dumb it is while not offering any ways to change it for the better makes Saekano the equivalent of at best a comedy fandub & at worst an annoying guy sitting next to you while you try to watch, pointing out all the silly cliches & unrealistic situations but throwing up his hands & saying \"don't ask me\" when asked what he'd do better.\\n\\n\r\nFor another, a lot of the witty observations it makes have already been made, better, by other shows. Genshiken was joking about the power of childhood friendship over ten years ago, & it didn't feel the need to labour the point by repeating said joke every episode. Haganai had the female characters be the ones who got into male aimed dating sims, joking that while they might be porn games for girls they're also as close as they get to a friendship sim. Making your titillating fan service that extra bit more in your face might serve to illustrate how ubiquitous it is within the genre, but any point Saekano might be trying to make with it is pretty well hidden behind Utaha's stockings & Michiru's tits.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, all of the things Saekano apparently does differently are pointless because none of them have any effect on the overall story, which continues down the well trodden path of everyone ultimately working to achieve the main characters goals while the various relationships are kept in an stasis until the author decides they can't be bothered to keep writing & wraps everything up in the final book. Kato might be the nominally \"normal\" girl in the group, but for a normal girl she has an abnormal tolerance for Tomoe's bull & ultimately ends up wanting to be more involved in the group, even going as far as to find things for herself to do since Tomoe is too busy with his shenanigans with the other girls to notice.\\n\\n\r\nEriri has a big outburst & falling out with Tomoe, which briefly makes it look like Saekano might actually shake things up. But no, in the end all that happens is she shouts at him because she feel's he's not paying her enough attention, he shouts at her about how crap her latest doujin was, & instead of doing what you might expect, tell Tomoe where to stick his dating sim & go back to her more lucrative mangaka work, she declares that she'll make him notice her & everything goes back to normal. It ends up just like Hatako's outburst in Inou Battle, a last, desperate expression of rebellion before she falls back in line with how harem girls are meant to behave. The point is that despite ample opportunity, nothing stops the plot train from traveling to cliche harem town which renders Saekano's attempts at \"satire\" pointless, in my opinion; nothing more than self-satisfied jokes about how clever it is for noticing all these things.\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to be able to say that there's something beyond the main character that redeems Saekano, but there isn't. The notion making a dating sim on the whim of an otaku seems straight out of Welcome to the NHK, but Saekano lacks a character even remotely on the level of Yamazaki or Sato, nor does it seem interested in using its set-up for any kind of commentary or satire, instead just going through the motions of contriving situations that get the main character alone with each of the girls where they all learn something about each other that somehow makes the episode not feel like a complete waste of time. The art, in particular the character designs, are generic as you can get without falling into the realm of outright plagiarism. They also noticeably suffer from anime's push to remove any bone structure from characters faces. The animation is fine for the most part, although the use of CG for some character movements stands out like a sore thumb at times. Oh, & the music ranges from forgettable to I wish I could forget it.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Saekano is the worst kind of parody. It recognizes the clich\u00e9s, tropes etc. of what constitutes a bad harem romance, but instead of using that knowledge to make a good one it just contents itself with being bad but self aware. Maybe that's enough for some people, & it does have its moments, I'll grant it. However, to me there is a world of difference between being a good show about a bad one (Extras or Garth Marenghi's Darkplace\\n\r\ncome to mind) & a bad show that thinks repeatedly saying how bad it is makes up for it. It doesn't.",

            "content": "Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata is to me, a breathe of fresh air in anime. At first, I looked at it and said, \"Oh no, another harem anime, i'll wait a bit to watch it...\" Boy am I happy I gave it a chance. \r\nSaekano is the story of how Aki Tomoya finds his passion to create a new game after he meets a girl named Katou Megumi. He considers her to be his perfect \"heroine\" when trying to talk to his friends about her. However, when he actually gets a chance to talk to her, she is monotone, isn't actually interested in the things heis, and just seems plain boring. However, that is probably the greatest part about her character. Her being that way, actually makes her probably the most interesting characters in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nTomoya also has two other friends who help him on his journey to make his \"perfect\" game after convincing them. These two other characters are a lot more generic, but they also make the anime very enjoyable and fun to watch. In my opinion, it's kind of like Nisekoi where every girl can be considered \"best girl\" because they all are pretty awesome.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the story of the anime is very easy to follow and very enjoyable. There are a few fan service parts (especially episode 0), but it's not too often and often unnoticeable in later episodes. The art style is also something that I love in this anime, especially when it transitions into the style where it outlines everything into a certain color (i don't know how to explain it but you'll see :)).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Saekano is very enjoyable to watch, you have character development with unique stories to everyone, catchy op and ed and just an over all fun and likable story.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve never really been an A-1 Pictures fan, but it\u2019s like they used up all their goodwill with the people who do consider themselves a part of that fanbase after making Your Lie In April, because 2015 has been a bad bad BAD year for them. So bad in fact that prior to my decision to watch this, I have yet finish any of their output, and half of them have already been forgotten by the mainstream crowd as of this writing. From an Aldnoah Zero second half that failed to live up to the promise of its predecessor to some Spring anime that Ialready forgotten the names of to this, I think it\u2019s safe to say that \u201cA-1\u201d and \u201cquality\u201d will be antonyms for at least the remainder of this year and most likely many more to come. At least until they learn about a little business practice I\u2019d like to call quality control.\\n\\n\r\nBut let\u2019s not bash on A-1\u2019s retarded \u201clet\u2019s release five anime a season and hope that one of them will strike gold\u201d policies and focus on the actual anime, shall we? Some of you may recall that I didn\u2019t give the main series much of a chance during the season it aired because that prologue that supposedly takes place just before the first season\u2019s (and there will be a sequel apparently) conclusion had some of the worst usage of smug, fan-wanking meta-dialogue this side of Vampire Diaries, which might have been tolerable if the entire plot of said prologue didn\u2019t revolve around the dialogue entirely. However, a bunch of people assured me since that said prologue was a poor representation of the show and that the actual series was a genuinely heart-warming tale of friendship and anime fandom with no more irritating meta-dialogue giving me an aneurism. Although it turned out that there was a miscommunication regarding the latter (and the former too for that matter).\\n\\n\r\n\u201cNo more meta-dialogue, Mr. Flawfinder?\u201d they said after I downloaded the thing. \u201cOh I\u2019m sorry. I thought you said LOTS more meta-dialogue!\u201d Oh and just so you know, you can't prove anything, so don't even try calling the cops on me regarding some recent hospitalizations of known anime fans.\\n\\n\r\nSaekano\u2019s premise is basically a non-pornographic version of Eroge H Game wa Blablabla, in that it focuses on a group of four girls and one guy trying to make a quality visual novel/porn game without the women drawing art in their underwear 24/7 or practicing the sex moves they want to implement whilst wearing a gimp suit and rope. It also shares similarities in that it takes place in some shitty fantasy world where despite the characters being fully aware of these terrible tropes, it doesn\u2019t stop their entire characterizations being defined by said tropes right up to indulging in them willingly in order to get the right amount of detail into the final product. I mean a half-British blonde highschool girl who is considered an idol by many and yet happens to be a very popular underground doujin artist and childhood friends with the main lead? You\u2019d see less overstuffed details in a song lyric written by Train.\\n\\n\r\nOur main hero is Tomoya Aki, a stereotypical nerd who has a very similar name to Tomoya Okazaki from Clannad, looks like a polished version of Yamazaki from Welcome to the NHK, will also probably be voiced by Greg Ayres in the dub for this too, and is - to put it lightly - a massive fuck. He gets motivated to follow his dreams upon seeing a girl named Megumi Kato on a hill like in his visual novels, but once he finds out that she's in the same class as him, he ropes her into being his model for the project on the condition that she act exactly like the quiet pure maiden he imagined her to be before he actually got to know her - except she has to play video games like he does. What's that noise you ask? Why yes, that is the sexism train going over the speed limit, why do you ask?\\n\\n\r\nSince he's an untalented cock who talks big on dreams without actually putting much effort into realizing them himself, he needs someone to do the job of actually making the visual novel for him. Luckily, he happens to know two beautiful girls who have secret lives as a well-renowned ero artist and a best-selling light novel author and convinces them to join because they secretly crave untalented cock for breakfast. Fucking hell, this sexism train is nearly breaking the speed of light isn't it? You can talk about him being the director all you want, but the only directing he ever really does is make the girls sacrifice their personal lives to satisfy his own. Which is true to life, but I'm pretty sure Stanley Kubrick's desire for perfection didn't involve him getting humped by his own cousin.\\n\\n\r\nAs part of the show's insistence that being ironic equals being satire, the entire structure of Saekano is pretty reminiscent of your standard visual novel adaptation beats. The first few episodes are dedicated to introducing the girls and setting things up. The next few are spent on giving the girls individual focus and explaining why Tomoya is important to them whilst setting up their roles in events to come. The final few episodes introduces a completely new girl and sets up her role in all this...actually, it never really goes past the setup phase. Fuck all actually happens in this anime aside from establishing things, which isn't a story at all. It's a power point presentation with a poor sense of humor, not helped by the fact that the show desperately wants to ride on Monogatari's coattails with so many of the animation tricks being blatant rip-offs of Shaft's cost-cutting techniques whilst spouting dialogue that isn't the least bit as clever as it thinks it is, nor does it progress things in any significant way.\\n\\n\r\nNot that the show doesn't have moments of actual deliverance. They're just few and botched really badly to boot. There's one dramatic shout-fest between Tomoya and Eriri three-quarters of the way through the show regarding their badly damaged friendship back in their elementary days due to the former's refusal to stand down as an anime geek and the latter having outside pride to maintain. Good of you to know I was getting bored Saekano, but this was like inter-splicing the climax of Pride and Prejudice into Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill - and it doesn't help that the only thing resulting from said drama was more \"Jesus make it stop\"-setup.\\n\\n\r\nOh and do you want to know how much time is spent on actually making the goddamn visual novel? We never even get to see the tools they use. They just show results at convenient times, the most egregious being the final few minutes that try desperately to have some kind of closure to the whole mess by suddenly revealing the characters created one route without so much as a montage of them doing it. As far as I'm concerned, that's the equivalent of putting the celebration party in Return of the Jedi right after the final climax of The Empire Strikes Back.\\n\\n\r\nBut where Saekano fails the most for me is that there's no urgency to anything going on. The show loves to indulge Tomoya's constant rants regarding his dreams, but it never really gives me a reason regarding why I\u2019m supposed to care about 'em. To bring up Welcome to the NHK again, remember how the main thrust of that show was also about the leads wanting to make a visual novel because it turns out you can make money from it and Satou kinda needed it because he was a NEET that was in danger of being evicted? Aside from just being a huge anime geek since elementary school, Tomoya doesn\u2019t have any real reason for why this dream is important to life, let alone seem to have any personal problems related to it.\\n\\n\r\nIt never conflicts with his school stuff, he doesn\u2019t seem to be suffering any money problems, and the show barely focuses on its romantic aspects to begin with, so saying \u201cit\u2019s so he can be with the main heroine\u201d doesn\u2019t hold water even if you do try to utilize that weak excuse. And since the girls still get to live their secret lives consequence-free by helping him in their spare time, they aren't really sacrificing anything to help him either apart from the safeties on that sexism train, which stops just short of going so fast that it breaks into another dimension at this point in the article. As far as actual thrust goes, it has about as much conflict and tension as a gang leader forcing you at gunpoint to play Monopoly with him because his family is on vacation. And said gun is a Super Soaker with no water in it.\\n\\n\r\nStruggling to see the point of its existence beyond fan wank, I read the surprisingly large number of positive reviews for clarification and they didn't help one jot. A bunch of fans like the character dynamics, which is fine if you do, but you cannot base an entire show on interactions alone unless it's really really funny ala Seinfeld. And I didn't laugh once watching this, unless you count that time when I broke down after realizing the show was going to conclude on the personal problems of a girl that was thrown in at the last minute with little connection to the overarching story. Some people praise its relatability, but not only do I not see how I can possibly relate to these pricks, it's also completely contradictory to these same people praising that it's a meta-commentary on harem situations. Is it true to life or is it a satire of fictional life, guys? You can't be both.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if it's meant to be a satire that raises questions regarding the otaku lifestyle, the foregrounds and backgrounds of visual novels, and why these harem anime are everywhere, then why is it so unchallenging to the mind and creatively bankrupt, like a high-concept sci-fi premise by way of a self-indulgent Disney writer? Combine those problems with garbage animation and zero plot progression that focuses too much on the build-up at the expense of payoff, and Saekano ends up being nothing more than an irritating pile of gimmicks that leaves you with an empty feeling inside, poorly drawn females trying to arouse you, and a crappy cover of the Gurren Lagann opening that made me go from being indifferent to the song to absolutely hating it.",

By means of insistence and unconscious emotional manipulation, he has gathered a crew of contrastingly remarkable people to develop a dating sim. There\u2019s Utaha the prodigy writer who has written several acclaimed novels, the famed doujin artist Eriri, and Katou who\u2019s, uh, not particularly special save for being kind of cute and somehow managing to seduce our protagonist on first his first sight of her. \\n\\n\r\nHuh?

There needs be none, Saekano tries to tell us; love is a complex and illogical phenomenon which requires no extrinsic justification. Isn\u2019t the very engendering of this sensation, among the flames and naivet\u00e9 of youth, reason enough to love?\\n\\n\r\nSaekano is a self-aware and self-referencing work. It points out the flaws and implausibilities which often plague its genre, yet offers no alternative. Instead, it toys around with harem tropes subverts it its usual formula using Katou who acts completely normally to foil the others. There is an inherent absurdity in having one ordinary girl among a cast of characters who are necessarily quirky a la harem shows. Katou is paradoxically special simply because she's a normal girl among sexy prodigies. Though criticized for conforming to its genre without innovation, composing the rest of the cast with typical harem characters is essential in achieving what Saekano wants to do. While it does highlight the unrealistic characters and tropes of harems, it also serves to illustrate the irrationality of passion and infatuation, which is shown in Katou\u2019s and Tomaya\u2019s feelings for each other but reflective of the other characters as well. In contrast to most similar commentaries, Saekano simultaneously subverts and justifies the harem genre, without ever stepping out of its boundaries.\\n\\n\r\nBeing cast of game producers, the characters elucidate the conflicts of aestheticism behind the creation of such works. The team is aware of the flaws and tropes in their work, but artistic integrity has to be weighed against the harsh market. Even so, no creator wishes to make hollow trash like \u201ccritics\u201d so often may think. Behind these stories are genuine emotions, far more so than half-assed criticisms by blind followers of objectivism. The creators of Saekano, and the characters in Saekano, all put great effort into making human beings with deeply personal motivations despite their being in a necessarily trope-ridden show. Eririri\u2019s falling out with Tomoya isn\u2019t simply a release of her repressed exasperations or an expression of her individuality and desire for attention; she is a window through which we see the creators\u2019 wish to move their audience, as well as frustrations at the vessels of these emotions being ignored or enjoyed as \u201clow art\u201d.  \\n\\n\r\nA veritable work of its time, Saekano is an author\u2019s input on the contemporary attitude so critical of harems that they\u2019re often not given a chance at all. Yet, much of its commentary is perhaps too implicit and overshadowed by its overt remarks on the genre which may be brushed off as unsubstantial. For the actively dismissive (or consciously undiscerning, if I may) it will hardly make much of an impression other than being an ordinary harem with a cheap attempt at critiquing the harem genre. For others with willing ears and eyes to match, it can be a novel take on the values and motivations surrounding the genre. \\n",

            "content": "Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata is one of the best shows I've seen in a long time and let me tell you why. \r\n(Make sure you watch Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata: Ai to Seishun no Service Kai before watching the series. Keep in mind that when you do, the episode is literally titled \"The fanservice episode of love and youth\", so the episode is not a representation of the amount of fanservice in the actual show (which is almost none))\r\nStory: 9/10 \r\nThe title of the show translates roughly to \"How to Raise a Boring Heroine\", and that's effectively what the show is about. Aki Tomoya, ahardcore otaku and our protagonist, one day comes face to face with his destiny. He encounters a spectacular girl, and this inspires him to make a galge or romantic visual novel based on this encounter. \\n\r\nHe manages to convince Kasumigaoka Utaha, his senpai and a well renowned light novel author who is an ideal image of a moe character, black hair, big breasts, and black stockings, as well as Sawamura Spencer Eriri, his childhood friend and ero-doujin artist with blonde twintails and knee socks, another moe heroine archetype, to join him on his crusade to create the galge of his dreams. \\n\r\nHowever, as it turns out, the girl in question, Megumi Katou, the subject of Tomoya's enounter, is entirely lacking in individuality and minimal notable character traits. \\n\r\nThe story was refreshing and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is where Saekano stands out exceptionally. Through the concept of making Megumi Katou a more interesting heroine in the game, you get to know her character and chances are that by the end of the show, she will be your favourite heroine. However, none of her boring character is compromised in doing this. Rather than changing the minimal heroine into an archetype that you love, Saekano makes you love the lack of individuality in the main heroine, which his far more impressive. This show truly raises the boring heroine. \\n\r\nAlthough I stated that Katou will likely be your favourite heroine by the end of the show, this is not to speak against the other heroines, for they too are beautifully done. \\n\r\nEach of the other heroines, in great contrast against Katou, the boring heroine, embodies a prominent moe heroine archetype, and is far from lacking in presence. You have the black haired senpai with large breasts and black stockings, the tsundere childhood friend with blonde twintails, the younger girl who refers to the protagonist as \"Onii-chan\" (as you do), and the busty sporty character who is into music. Saekano takes all of these common archetypes, which all contrast against the boring character, then, puts its own unique spin on those archetypes you've all seen so many times, making you love them so much. \\n\r\nThe character development in Saekano is exceptional, and it is enforced greatly by several subtle touches. A great example of this would be the cafe scene in episode 2 when Megumi is never the focus of the shot, enforcing her minimal character nicely. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art of Saekano was nice, and worked well with the refreshing mood of the show. Although it's nothing exceptional, it was still good to look at, and did nothing to undermine the quality. Like a lot of other aspects of the show, it contained a few subtle touches which were really nice to see. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nHonestly, I took no notice of the OST the first time I watched Saekano, and only really payed it mind when I rewatched it. It was nothing exceptional, but it did a good job of enforcing the mood of various scenes, and the op and ed were great. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 \\n\r\nI loved the show, and I found myself frequently getting excited over small details that I noticed when I watched it. I would happily watch it again, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who has seen a good amount of anime or enjoys shows without much action. However, it might not be the best show for people who are only just getting into anime as it is riddled with references and puts its own unique twists on cliches, which would be less fun if you didn't get the cliches to begin with.",

            "content": "Rest in Peace : the fourth wall.\r\nNormally you would have a 'dense' male character in some harem anime but Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata (Saekano for short) is an anime that is ironic to itself so much that you can call this whole show 'dense'. \r\nIt is original and yet clich\u00e9 and I felt that this show had more potential if it wasn't rushed. I thoroughly enjoyed this show and I was watching it while it was airing. Every week I was excited for another episode of Saekano and I was staffed with every episode.\r\nStory:8/10\r\nThis anime's story is realistic, light yet humorous. I liked thefact that they make reference to other shows but in moderation so the show does not feel like a Parody anime, it made me feel like that somewhere, in Japan, the event is happening as I am watching it. It all seemed achievable.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, we then have the clich\u00e9 side of Saekano, the one where at the beginning of the episode you can already guess the end kind, the paper cut-out character personalities and the dense yet loved protagonist.But this is where it shines, as you see, Saekano is about a group of otakus and fujoshis trying to make the 'best game ever'. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this is when they starts to break the fourth wall, shatter it, crush it, destroy it, mash it and completely decimate it. \\n\\n\r\nThis show makes a lot of reference to itself and the otaku culture in real life whilst not being aware of themselves falling in to the same category (The blond, twin-tailed, tsundere; the cool and composed senpai or The love rivalry from the protagonist's childhood friend.)  as it seems at first. But the developers intended to make reference to itself with it not being aware to create this sense of humour, this sense of realism and make the show relatable. Ask yourself, 'How many times have you think of your own life and think that it is very clich\u00e9?'\\n\\n\r\nNone?\\n\\n\r\nOkay...Anyway, this anime turned out to be an anime about a group of otakus making references to other anime whilst being in an anime themselves. It is very cleverly approached and I would love to have more episodes of this fourth-wall goodness.\\n\\n\r\nBut as always, a show always have to come to an end (unless you are called One Piece) and Saekano's ending was very rushed or brief. It did not give us a decent conclusion of the story and left me surprised that the last episode was already gone. \\n\\n\r\nWhich made me happy about the coming of second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\\n\r\nApart from the realism that the story tries to give, this anime also sets it apart from our mundane world by using the more anime-looking art style instead of taking a more realistic approach. This is to tell the watchers that although the story may seem realistic, at the end of the day, this is still just an anime. Which is good as if the anime was overly detailed and made realistic, I would probably go watch some Japanese television series instead. \\n\\n\r\nThe graphics are well rendered and I personally did not see any flaws in animation when I was watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7/10\\n\\n\r\nSaekano's sound is not unique or catching to me. It adds to the 'Clich\u00e9' feel of a romance comedy to the anime instead. And just as I was saying, I believe it is enough for the story to become realistic, there is no need for any other aspect to try and compete for originality.This isn't to say that the sound is bad though, as I have certainly seen worse and I wouldn't mind if they made a second season with the same style of music as this season.\\n\\n\r\nThe background track blends in well with the dialogue and the V.As are definitely giving their best here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nHow funny that an anime about making the 'best game' have characters that is so clich\u00e9 that I would use this show as a guideline to tell people how different type of characters would act. But we have a more realistic side to the character, the one that cannot be found anywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nI am going to split the character into clich\u00e9 and original so you can see what I mean by them having 'another side' to them:\\n\\n\r\nMain male protagonist: Tomoya Aki\\n\\n\r\nClich\u00e9:\\n\r\n He is a harem protagonist so he is dense about his surroundings.\\n\r\n Had a 'fateful encounter'\\n\\n\r\nOriginal:\\n\r\n He is an otaku who appears to have a dream of creating  the 'best game' and he does not like 3D girls,in oppose to many other harem protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nUtaha Kasumigaoka\\n\\n\r\nClich\u00e9:\\n\r\n She's is the mature,cool and perfect senpai kind.\\n\\n\r\nOriginal:\\n\r\n She is a famous light-novel writer and Tomoya is a great fan of her novels. \\n\\n\r\nEriri Spencer Sawamura\\n\\n\r\nClich\u00e9:\\n\r\n Blonde, twin-tail, tsundere, childhood friend, half Japanese, half British,genius.\\n\\n\r\nOriginal:\\n\r\n She's is secretly a doujinshi artist and often shows the fujoshi side of her.\\n\\n\r\nClich\u00e9? Definitely. Original? Most certainly. It is a puzzle how the maker of Saekano manages to balance these all at once, but it did work and we were given the character of Saekano to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this show to any people who have decent knowledge of the otaku culture as this show breaks all expectations as otakus meanwhile keeping them as generic cardboard characters.",

            "content": "Creating something is an act that a lot of people take pride in.  A good piece of work in a world such as ours doesn't go unnoticed all too often and at the very least, gets some recognition.  With successful shows like Shirobako and Bakuman explaining and detailing the basis of how anime and manga are made perspectively, what about things like Doujinshi or games?  Well, thankfully we have Saenai Heroine no Sodetekata, or \"How to raise a boring girlfriend\" to remedy that debacle.  Let's begin.  \r\nStory (7.45/10): The story of Saenai Heroine or Saekano as the shorter version is,begins on one single faithful day.  Tomoya Aki is our main protagonist, a proud Otaku who appreciates the finer things of Otaku creation.  One day when returning back home, with the cherry blossoms blowing through the wind, Tomoya on top of a hill, meets a girl who stands on top of the hill behind him, creating that signature galge moment of the characters meeting their \"fated\" one.  It is here that he meets a girl named Kato Megumi, the girl that he chooses to be the star of a game that he, in the spur of the moment, wants to make.  And soon, his journey of starting a doujin game circle begins.\\n\\n\r\nSaekano is one of those anime that utilizes a very underused way of storytelling, genre parodying, being an anime that utilizes generic scenes that are featured in the genre that it's affiliated with (in this case, harem), and pokes fun at it by having characters or situations similar to what they were based off, but with a slight twist that makes it more comedic and overall more enjoyable.  Because of this, the show differs from a general harem, making it a more different than what one would normally expect from a show tagged \"Harem.\"  \\n\\n\r\nAs for actual story, the show follows the progress of how to make a Visual Novel as the characters featured in this show progress through episode to episode, making more progress with the game that they are developing.  At least, that's one part of it.  In addition to that, the show also develops the characters alongside the game, giving us, the audience, raised flags with the girls featured in the series, each with their own \"route\" that usually ends with some degree of hilarity.  It is with this that Saenai Heroine distinguishes itself from a lot of other harem, providing a different and more enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are a couple flaws that I find with the story.  Some...bugs, if you may.  One of the biggest problems I have with Saekano is the fact that the series doesn't really end on what I would consider to be a satisfying end.  The show doesn't necessarily finish the game that the characters are developing, meaning that there is most likely more material after the show's 12 episode runtime.  In addition, the buildup towards the actual gamemaking was extremely slow.  A good chunk of the show itself was simply just the characters bantering over whether making a game was a good idea or not really felt like a hinderance because not a lot really happened during the slow beginning and without the character banter, it probably wouldn't have been as enjoyable as it was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, Saekano had a very interesting story idea as its basis.  It played off of the idea of harem without truly having a genuine harem, the show was funny on account of it poking fun at the harem genre, and it brought in the process of serious doujinshi making, something that I don't think before this has been done in animated form.  While it did have a slow start and has an unfinished story, the show by itself is enjoyable and well worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Pokes fun at the harem genre\\n\r\n+ Talks about a different medium of otaku culture\\n\r\n-  Slow buildup for main plot\\n\r\n-  Unsatisfying ending\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.21/10): Similar to the story, Saekano manages to do the same degree of genre parodying, with practically every character being a parody version of the character troupe that they were based off of.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, we have Tomoya Aki, the main protagonist of Saekano.  As a character played by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, channeling more of a Sora/Arata sort of character, Tomoya is a character who is very focused and passionate about his tastes.  As an Otaku, any form of work that he sees that appeals to him is something that he will defend with his night.  Over the course of the series, we see Tomoya as a character driving towards his goal of creating a game, putting in time and effort, even helping his circle members with their other projects, just so he can create the game that he wants to bring to the world based on a 3-D girl that he wants to turn into a heroine.  As far as development goes, Tomoya more or less gets his from the experience as a circle leader, but personality-wise, he doesn't really change all that much.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the two main girls in the series.  First, we have Eriri Spencer Sawamura, the blond twin-tailed girl who represents the tsundere childhood friend troupe.  Contributing to the group as the artist (as well as being an 18+ doujin author whose works belong on Fakku), Eriri is a girl that sort of breaks the troupe by really not being all that tsundere while turning her twintail hairstyle into two very effective whips.  And then, there's Utaha Kasumigaoka, the LN author who is the girl who serves as the long, black haired senpai with a cool, levelheaded attitude who speaks in a harsher manner while also possessing slight yandere undertones when jealous.  Over the course of the series, you get to understand a little more about these two characters, thus providing their development and some explanation as to why they associate themselves with someone like Tomoya.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have who I think by far is the most interesting character in this series, Megumi Kato.  As the girl that Tomoya wishes to base his game off of, Kato is a girl that is rather interesting in anime period.  Compared to the rest of the girls in this series, and female characters overall, Kato's personality comes off as rather plain, passive, easily accepting, and albeit somewhat boring.  She doesn't have a defined character troupe to tie her to, and I think that's what makes her such an interesting character.  By breaking the bounds of character archtypes and having Kato be a character who is like her, the show really draws in this idea because of the sheer irony of her being the \"main heroine\" while not having any sort of heroine qualities that make up any given romcom.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile the main cast of characters really do shine in their own right as far as the show goes, the side cast of Saekano really leaves something to be desired.  More importantly are the characters Izumi and Michiru, characters representing the little sister and cousin troupes.  What really bugs me about these characters is the fact that the show makes them out to be more important than they actually are.  By featuring them on the same level as the other girls, one can assume that their character importance would be near or at the same level, correct?  Wrong.  The show doesn't really utilize these last two members of the so-called \"harem\" (since Saekano really doesn't capitalize on that idea.) and are really just booted to the last couple episodes with Michiru getting a similar treatment to Eriri and Utaha via a condensed version.  It kinda bugs me more on the fact that the conversations that go on between these characters really are golden moments in this show, and having more players to the mix really would've made this show a little bit better.  \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there are also other side characters in this show that really play little to no importance.  Because for the most part you'll be watching the ones listed above, there really isn't much to say about the side cast.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Interesting troupe-breaking characters\\n\r\n+  Good development for main characters\\n\r\n-   Side cast really isn't interesting or used much\\n\r\n-   Some characters could've been handled better\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.45/10): The art for this Saekano is a very...interesting pick for A-1.  The art is very light colored and bright, giving off a sort of slice of life feel to anyone who is watching it.  That being said though, it looks to me that several other animation studios seemed to influence the animation, which I find somewhat odd.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to just general animation, the show hosts a very odd form of visual imagery, utilizing a colored sheen over a character or body.  In addition, the show also uses odd angles and closeups on certain areas which for some reason reminds me of Akiyuki Shinbou's work (no head tilts though).  While this isn't bad per say, it's just something I wanted to mention because I didn't expect something like that to come out from this show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for flaws though, the animation does have a couple choice moments and things that don't sit well with me.  For one thing, the designs of the girls.  Similar to the girls in La Fruit de grisaia, every female in this anime features a red highlight around their eyelashes, thus giving them a strange rash look.  This is really more of a personal complaint because I just find it odd to see a random red line around a girl's eyes.  In addition, there's one specific scene that doesn't sit well with me, which is mostly due to the fact that Tomoya's hair isn't colored in, leaving him with white hair for about a minute.  Yeah, that's not normal.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, the music for the anime isn't really something that I would call incredible.  The OP and ED are good tracks and can become memorable as they feature a happy-go-lucky tune to them, but I can't in good conscience say that they deserve more credit than what I give them.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good art\\n\r\n+  Decent music stylings\\n\r\n-   Couple mistakes with the art  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (8.39/10): While Saekano wasn't as stellar as it could've been, it was still a great show nonetheless.  With its use of genre parodying and storyline, the show managed to keep me hooked in week after week with laughter spent at the characters own point outs on any given cliche scenario.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat did I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nFor one thing, I liked the characters of this series a lot.  They were all likable in their own way, and their interactions with one another were something that I enjoyed seeing with every passing minute.  In addition, the fact that they played off on the troupes that they were based off of was funny enough for me to enjoy laughing along with whatever was going on.  The story while wasn't complete, did give insight into doujinshi and Comiket (for those who didn't know), and overall, made the show an enjoyable experience.  They also reference other anime in it in Tomoya's soom such as SAO figmas, an Amaburi LN, and an Oreimo poster just to name a few.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe slow start in conjunction with some underused characters really put me in a bit of a sour mood.  A lot of good could've come from just having the characters come in a little earlier and a little bit faster beginning few episodes because quite a few areas in the later parts of the series felt rushed, leading to a very glaring art issue.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a casual watch that pokes fun at harem, watch either this, or Noucome.  If you don't want fanservice, then just watch this.  Saekano is an enjoyable series that doesn't really takes itself too too seriously, diving headfirst into the world of doujinshi whilst making fun of the harem genre altogether.  It really is an enjoyable experience because not a lot of anime poke fun at the cliches and troupes that do exist in anime, so personally, I feel like anything that's like this really deserves to be watched.  Plus, you get to see awesome characters banter with each other, what's not to love?\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.49/10",

            "content": "Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata is a nice surprise of the Winter season. It is one of these anime that always made me lose my patience when an episode finishes its airing. It is something that I want more. So far, I could not find a translated manga or light novel source, so it remains a mystery after the anime unless I bought its non-translated ones and find a translator.\r\nThe anime has its \u2018special\u2019 episode aired a week before the anime series started airing. It contains fan-service galore, so if you do not want to ruin your experience in watching, I suggest you watch it afterthe anime. But if you do not mind, watch it before, both works for different people.\\n\\n\r\nWe all have dreams that we want to pursue. At least, that is how the protagonist Tomoya wants to. He is a typical high-school otaku who works part-time jobs to pay for anime merchandises. One day, he gazed at a beautiful \u2018heroine\u2019 on top of a hill. He realised that she was actually a classmate in his class, Katou, but from then on he wants to achieve something - making a visual novel with Katou being as the heroine. He had several connections such as childhood friend Eriri, who secretly makes H-doujins and Utaha, who writes well-sold novels. They formed up a doujin circle for the purpose of making this light novel Tomoya wanted.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this is not an ordinary anime where you will see a group of people making progress, and in the end they finished it and sell it in the event they chose. No, that is too boring to watch. I would say that the developing of the visual novel is not the main focus in anime, but rather how Tomoya is going to get his own circle to work without any conflicts. From time to time, there is a situation that a character gets quite emotional and Tomoya approaches to be with her for a while. Indeed, one episode by another, the visual novel is being developed but it is not direct to show the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the anime interesting is the funny comedy. Generally, the anime plays a number of tropes from the Japanese pop culture like visual novels and manga. They were never forced as the comedy coming from the characters\u2019 interactions flow by. At least, the anime knows how to separate funny and emotional moments. Yes, sometimes there are a few emotional moments which are not rushed at all.\\n\\n\r\nI do not really spot any problems in the story, but the ending towards the anime is too open, making the story quite incomplete. Overall, the story has nice pacing and development without any hiccups. It is relatively easy to understand the story and characters, since the story has not pull \u2018deep symbolisms\u2019 behind, so it is a good story for everyone of different interests to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, despite having similar characteristics from your everyday harem anime, are interesting to look at after a while. For starters, they do not really force themselves to act like the counterparts. There are times when they feel differently of their personalities as well. So far, we got the tsundere Eriri who was a childhood friend with Tomoya for quite a long time, a cold-headed Utaha who just speaks so maturely in front of him, and a plain Katou that has no outstanding qualities yet win the hearts of a large part of the audience. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some character development in most of them, generally on the times when Tomoya is with a certain character. Even Tomoya has some as he learns more about the girls. But eventually, I would love to see more since the ending was too open. The story also shows the characters\u2019 pasts and how they are being influenced into their personalities now. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation has been quite a charm in this anime. It may sure seem normal to you, but there is a finer detail that the studio has given to make the anime more real and beautiful. The sceneries are nice-looking and great for settling the mood. I love the vibrant colourful palette they use to show a bright and happy feeling. There is one place that I like to mention which is Tomoya\u2019s room, where there are a lot of real references through posters, novels and figurines. The character designs are very gorgeous, like they stand out a lot from the rest of this anime season. Quite a number of details have been added to the designs to make it real. Also, the facial expressions are well-done, whether on comic relief or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe fan-service is classy. For once, I do not think that it was not forced to ruin the story. I had started to realise that there were more of it towards the second half of the anime, but I must say that the scenes are perfectly done and have made a lot of the audience feel happy.\\n\\n\r\nYet again this anime has proven to have awesome songs. I definitely loved the opening and ending songs which are one of my favourites this season. Luna Haruna sings Kimiiro Signal in the opening to portray a more cheerful feeling the anime has, while Miku Sawai sings Colorful. that has a more emotional but positive mindset. They have a meaning behind, I swear. The background music is great, I like how different varieties of tracks are used to bring effect of the mood in the scenes. Voice acting is well-done, since I love how they try to match the characters\u2019 personalities well.\\n\\n\r\nSaekano is one anime that everyone should totally watch because it is has a great story, great characters and nice animation. I have certainly enjoyed the anime from start to end, and I really hope there is a second season.",

            "content": "Saekano, at first glance, may seem like a typical harem/fanservice filled series where the main otaku character can flourish himself in. However, it honestly took me by surprise and vastly exceeded my expectations, especially how the show knows how to subtly and implicitly convey its awareness of the current anime industry and its current clich\u00e9d trends. \r\nThe characters of the show is one of its most entertaining aspects. In a mere 12 episodes, the show is able to characterise its characters and develop them to a satisfactory extent, In particular the girls, and their distinct personalities are the foundation of the show itself. There isEriri, the hotblooded tsundere blonde twin-tailed girl who manifests the clich\u00e9d childhood friend troupe. She is the doujinshi artist of the group, and can't let her pride lose. Then there is the seductive (potential fanservice ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)) girl who is considered a master at scenario/story writing called Utaha. Michiru, the purple-haired tomboy musician-like girl who also is mainly there to aid fanservice, is also another childhood friend of Tomoya...since birth. Its ironic because she only did really appear in the final few episodes (lol~). There is also the unique monotonous cute girl, Kato, who is just so clueless a lot of the time, but in a hilarious and original way. Her voice acting is also worth noting as it is one of the best monotoned voices for a female character in recent times, and its not boring in anyway, but compelling. She may have trouble being expressive, but she is one of the girls who understands Tomoya well, the main central protagonist. Finally, you have Tomoya, the otaku with a strong enthusiastic personality and passion for producing his dating sim with his circle of friends (haremm). His drive to successfully produce a dating sim allows the story to progress and its his determination to create a great one that makes him entertaining to be with. All the voice acting for the characters undoubtedly aid the characters personalities and their traits, and make them not only a great interacted cast, but one with synergy. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is definitely, a great addition to the show's substance and makes it visually pleasing to look at in contrast to most shows of the similar genre. A-1 without a doubt made Saekano a hit, rather than a miss with the stellar, standing-out artwork and visuals. The character designs as well is a major plus as the females of the show all look different from one another, and are ineffably, just nice to look at. The near-shaft level art carries the show if you don't really enjoy the characters, but as the cast is so diverse with each unique girl, you probably will have one \"best girl\" (team kato??? team utaha? no? no?).\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't really that unique or stellar, its just there to suit appropriate scenes and juxtapose the silence. The OP song however, I found it quite suiting visually as it depicts each character in the works, and the song itself 'Kimiiro Signal' by Luna Haruna sounds pretty nice and is addicting for me personally. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata was without a doubt, a very fascinating and entertaining show to sit down, and watch. Although the story wasn't anything spectacular or original, the melange of characters with their varied personalities is what makes the show truly enjoyable, and along with their thrive to successfully construct a dating sim, the audience is able to connect to the cast and feel their ecstasies, and struggles. The fanservice is not the main focus, the characters are, and if you can get past that major intervening obstacle, you will certainly enjoy this show for what it is.\\n",

            "content": "A series like Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata (Saekano) doesn\u2019t really need much of an explanation judging by the cover content. There are at least four girls and a guy in the far background. Anime logic dictates that the show is more or less a harem. And if you\u2019ve come to that conclusion, you\u2019re not wrong. The series is indeed a harem with some generic romance tropes thrown in. However, there are some clever angles to approach the series as more of a social commentary. What I mean is that the show has far more dialogues than skin showing and indeed, it strives to accomplish thatwith its set premise \u2013 to create a visual novel based on a girl that our main protagonist met during Spring vacation.\\n\\n\r\nBased off a light novel of the same name, the show has a rather dexterous title. Translated as \u2018How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend\u2019, the series plays around with itself quite a bit. With its many jokes in multilayer form and never ending generic tropes, initial impression of the series could be a downer. Indeed, my expectations weren\u2019t very high especially after the lascivious prequel that debuted before the main series.  Although the series follows a lot of the trends with typical harem series with no specialty, Saekano does pull out a few tricks out of its hat that can be exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the show is actually pretty straightforward. We have this normal guy named Tomoya who is a self-proclaimed otaku complete with the nerdy glasses and average looks. During a Spring vacation, he encounters a beautiful girl named Megumi who he later realizes is his classmate. With a mindset goal set to create a visual novel based on her, he creates a doujin (look this up on Google if you don\u2019t know what it is) circle called \u2018Blessing Software\u2019. Essentially, the series introduces our main male protagonist Tomoya and his room gives viewers the impression that he is quite a hardcore otaku. Just look at his room! He\u2019s got anime posters from popular anime TV series, collectible figures, and stashes on top of stashes of manga/light novel laying around the room. It gives us enough judgement to see that he is unpopular with his classmates, a sharp contrast to his childhood friend Eriri Spencer Sawamura. As a Japanese/British student, she joins Tomoya as an illustrator. Then, there\u2019s ice beauty Utaha Kasumigaoka who also becomes part of Blessing Software. Viewed as an intelligent and haughty girl, we have this weird combination of characters mixed together to craft this piece of artistic work. And who can forget Megumi? Without her, their project would be dead because she is literally their model and mascot. Unlike Eriri or Utaha, she is easily a normal girl who hardly stands out in class. Not so different from Tomoya right? Later on, we also get an athletic girl with a music talent joining the series named Michiru. Because without music, their project would also be deaf to ears. \\n\\n\r\nNow that we have a general mindset of the characters, there\u2019s an understanding that probably formulated in your mind. The collective cast of our characters are from the oldest tricks in the book. We have Eriri, the twin-tailed tsundere, the cold collective beauty Utaha, the average all around (except for looks) Megumi, and music talent Michiru. This is the pretty much the basic ingredients to make a harem. But fortunately, the show also has an intention to make a visual novel based on a \u2018boring girlfriend\u2019. It mixes humor and peril in almost a same category as some scenes become dangerously absurd while others can be surprisingly funny. Regardless, the show adapts the concept of visual novel making and actually makes this the main part of the story. While romance becomes involved as well, most of it is subtle where Tomoya remains oblivious to the girls\u2019 advances. For the story itself, a large part comes from the members\u2019 roles. Eriri is the illustrator of their project so she is in charge of the artwork. Several episode shows her as a dedicated worker who really does embrace her role as an artist. Some of her flashbacks with Tomoya also shows their relationship as the classic childhood type where they seem to be on good terms. Except for one thing, she is prone to emotional outbursts in the present. One particular episode focuses on her and Tomoya\u2019s rebuilding of their relationship where she promises to make Tomoya see the good side of her. While this relationship focus is important, it also becomes catering to watch with how much the show goes into diehard mode to flesh out her personality. This doesn\u2019t strive far with Utaha either as her relationship with Tomoya also gets insightful focus in some particular episodes. Playing the role of a writer, she is in charge of the scripts which is pivotal for their project\u2019s storyline. Unfortunately, her role sells mostly as an attractive girl with some insecurities similar to Eriri. Unlike her though, she is more confident in her abilities and looks as she has sometimes tries to seduce Tomoya passively.  What does this all mean? Literally, she is more like the classic Yamato Nadeshiko but with a more aggressive personality. It doesn\u2019t help with the fact that Tomoya seems constantly distracted by her sex appeal or her own \u201cstrategies\u201d. (See this cell phone picture for a general idea: http://imgur.com/0qvIvl7)\\n\\n\r\nNow, here\u2019s a roadblock to Tomoya\u2019s relationship: Megumi. She is portrayed as a normal girl with a straightforward personality but very kind to her friends. Unlike the rest of their group, she doesn\u2019t have knowledge of the otaku world until Tomoya influences her with his eroge game collection. While the series often plays around with the generic tropes, Megumi and Tomoya\u2019s relationship has a surprisingly amount of delicate connection. Both of them doesn\u2019t stand out much in class but they seem to relate to each other as the series goes on. As a dialogue heavy show like this with a lot of talk, she also fleshes out Tomoya\u2019s character the most. This is demonstrated during their date in one particular episode as well as how Tomoya uses her as a model for their game. It shows a more honest side of the series with her in because she is also the most normal, someone that others can relate to. Furthermore, she evokes jealousy with other girls in the case of Eriri or Utaha where we see that they aren\u2019t perfect as their classmates are disillusioned by. Unfortunately, the show has a pacing problem being a 1 cour. I honestly believe a series like this would be more suitable for a 2-cour (22 episodes). This is because Michiru, our music-athlete hybrid isn\u2019t present until much later in the series. Although she is heavily advertised in the promotional videos, key visuals, and prologue, there\u2019s little room for her part until the very end. At one point, I\u2019m sure that some people may question if she will even appear at all. To put it simply, the way the show is directed to fit her role is both underwhelming and almost in a way, irrelevant. Thankfully, she does bring out a more different side of the series as well with her tomboyish personality. \\n\\n\r\nWith our characters, the story is something I describe as less dynamic compared to the focus of our characters. Occupied by the task to complete their project, every episode depends strictly on characters\u2019 roles with their actions. Comedy seems to play a decent amount of time throughout the series as well although it can feel like simple guilty pleasure; especially in one episode with allusions to heavy sexual metaphors. There may also seem to be a displeasure with some of the rivalry throughout the series as Tomoya faces later on. It honestly feels cringe worthy with the setup as the series even chooses to focus on a minor character with little influence. Taking that aside, this show\u2019s originality isn\u2019t exactly something new. Others with otaku-based characters have been portrayed in the anime industry such as the TWGOK franchise. And unfortunately, I have to say once again that the story\u2019s pacing feels dreadful at times. It will definitely divert viewers but with deflated themes that people may have seem over and over. Even some references later on can be bothersome to indulge while the amusing self-awareness of the prologue is largely absent.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork visuals plays some key roles in the show as one of our main characters is an inspiring artist herself. However, A-1 Pictures doesn\u2019t exactly carry the show\u2019s visual quality to their fullest potential with the character designs. With some CGI-like style animation and muggy backgrounds, the show doesn\u2019t relieve a strong impression on the surface. However, character designs does have some credibility that holds in queue with our characters\u2019 personalities. For fan service, the series fleshes out more and more of it; in particular in some of the final episodes. When portrayed, it\u2019s mostly suggestive camera angles rather than going full commando. But largely coming off as average, this show\u2019s visual quality is hardly anything to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack actually has a less of an important role but does have its key moments in some episodes. This is inspired by the character interactions with a variety of emotions that can only be made possible through the effective timing of its OST. Fortunately, it does pull it off despite how average it sounds. The OP and ED songs also has an upbeat and noticeable amount of creativity with its coordination. Michiru, the music talent of the group also demonstrates her ability in the music department with a fluid degree. The key part of the show is still character voices as that hits the ace in the hole. Every main female character plays their role with solid motivations and truthful to the show\u2019s intentions. Perhaps sometimes, it\u2019s almost too evident by their interactions with Tomoya. Unfortunately, there\u2019s nothing really good to comment on Tomoya\u2019s voice. He\u2019s the typical otaku with a dull voice mannerism that I think people would find hard to make friends with.\\n\\n\r\nSo what else to say? The show isn\u2019t by anything special although does have some clever ways to entertain its audience. Whether it\u2019s the character relationships or their storyline project, Saekano is still a harem show with the usual generics. Despite this though, there\u2019s a sense of creativity when we see characters\u2019 role play out throughout the show that is hard to take eyes off of. With the amount of jokes, references, and almost never ending comedy, the show is a mixed bag. And that's just the first route.\\n",

Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata gives a really refreshing new and unique plot that keeps its viewers wanting more at the end of every episode.\r\nThe name of the anime \"Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata\" itself means how to train a girl to be a herione. Right away you would see that Saenai has a really unique plot which very little anime can relate to out there. The story starts of with Tomoya Aki, a high schoolteenage boy who is a major otaku/shut-in ,who doesn't know much besides video games and dating sims. On one faithful day he meets the girl of his dreams. He later finds out that the girl goes to the same school as him. With the help of his childhood friend Sawamura Eriri Spencer and his senpai Kasumigaoka Utaha. He decides to make a dating sim based off of the girl he met that day.\\n\\n\r\nAlright first of all i want to give mad props to A-1 Pictures for the amazing art in the anime. There was never a part in the anime where the art was lacking, everything in this anime was drawn beautifully, the colors to represent the mood, the special details for different characters , simply amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending soundtrack are also amazing , it sets the tone for the anime and it is just right. A big thing worth mentioning , Matsuoka Yoshitsugu and Kayano Ai are 2 of the voice actors in the anime. They're one of the best ones around imo and you might remember the duo in other animes such as Sakurasou and no game no life where they were both also voicing the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are all made quite well.Every character fills their role perfectly and are all unique in their own way. The girls in the anime can melt your heart away making you want fall in love with them. The only problem i had with the characters is that there wasn't enough character development, Which is understandable considering the fact that it was a 12 episode series\\n\\n\r\nThis anime overall is very good and it was made exceptionally well, the only thing that i did not like was the fact that it was only a 12 episode series, but other then that this anime was very refreshing with its interesting plot and unique characters.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Alright here is my second attempt at a review for an Anime.\r\nOne day, our main protagonist happens to lay his eyes on a girl that just steals his otaku heart. He decides to make her the magnificent heroine in his game and proceeds to gather the necessary people. However, unbeknownst to him, everyone who decides to help him have their own reasons for being there.\r\n7:Story\r\nThe story is not anything new. Here you'll see a group of friends try to make a dream come true in the form of a game and learn the hardships of going through such a process. Is it a bad story?No, but it won't make you go \"WOW\" either.\\n\\n\r\n8:Art\\n\r\nThe art is fine. I think the coloring might be overly bright during the anime. There also seems to be a mini-blush on almost on the girls and I found it unnecessary to their facial expressions more than half the time. Overall, I wouldn't expect anything less from this kind of art style in this kind of time.\\n\\n\r\n7:Sound\\n\r\nThe music isn't amazing but it isn't entirely bad either. I only happen to be really into one the insert songs. You shouldn't expect to be hyped or have any emotions elicited from just the music.\\n\\n\r\n9:Char\\n\r\nThe characters are done pretty well in my opinion. I enjoy the tantrums thrown by the main character because they don't seem whiney. I also enjoy oblivious people. You can expect something good from the girls too but at their core follow a generic formula. Overall, it is the relationships and banter between the character that really shine here. What they do for one another or with one another is what I believe makes the core of this show.\\n\\n\r\n7:Enjoyment\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show but I felt there was very little build up in the first season. Even with a nice pacing I felt the series could've done a lot more than just that. I skipped the OP and EDs very often because I found them boring to listen to after 3-4 times. I was also expecting a sort of romance but that element isn't very serious in this show.\\n\\n\r\n7: Overall (7.6)\\n\r\nThe show deserves a second season and really needs a second season. I felt that the entire series was an pleasant introduction to everything the show was going to offer. This first season will leave you wanting more and I would certainly recommend it to the average anime watcher.",

The storyline had the potential to be a really good anime and would really connect with the viewers who would obviously share the same interests conveyed in the characters such as anime, manga and so on. \r\nHowever the title of \"How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend\" soon became known to me as \"How to Make a Boring Anime.\" At times, I found the show to be very dialogue heavy, which I usually don't mind however it was often just waffling on. I was always waiting for something to happen when i watched the newly released episodeeach week, but I always felt like there wasn't too much development, and if there was, it was too predictable. \\n\\n\r\nWatching this anime series quickly became a chore rather than for my own enjoyment, as I was really trying hard to like this anime but couldn't. I would sometimes become so bored during the episodes towards the end of the series that I actually skipped through scenes as I found them to be excruciatingly long. Of course, I went back to re-watch the episodes, just to ensure that I felt the same as when i first watched it, and my view has not changed.\\n\\n\r\nI feel bad that i didn't like this anime as I've seen many great reviews and many of my friends have said they enjoyed the series but, alas, I found the series was lacking and I was overall disappointed with this series. I'm not a massive fan of Harem anime to begin with but i don't feel my dislike of Harem skewed my view of the anime, because even I felt like the Harem in this anime could have been done a whole lot better.\\n\\n\r\nI could go into further detail about what I don't like about this anime but I just wanted to cover the main points.\\n\\n\r\nAs for what i did like, even though she was labelled as \"The Boring Girlfriend\", Megumi was my favourite character and I liked the connection she and Tomoya had. (Although i wish it did focus a little more on them)\\n\\n\r\nIf you've watched the anime and you feel the same as me, or at least have a similar view, please let me know, as i feel like the only one who didn't enjoy Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata.",

            "content": "Saekano is easily one of the best harem romcom anime that i've watched in years. From the creator of the very good White Album 2 (which also needs a second season badly), this is one of those shows that keeps on surprising you with every episode. Even now that i've finished it, i still feel that i didn't give it enough credit. Almost as if the show is begging me to rewatch it because it has some hidden layers that i ended up missing on my first watch. It's kinda hard to explain, but i always get the feeling that Saekano manipulates the viewer intoliking it more than what you expected to. \\n\\n\r\nIn a way the show is a lot like its main heroine - paradoxical as it may be, there's an innocent, almost childlike attempt at manipulating the viewer, almost as if it's hiding its true nature, teasing and baiting us to make wrong assumptions about it. You know how kids cry to make us do what they want? I feel the same way towards this series. It's actually a very puzzling yet interesting feeling.\\n\\n\r\nIt's very meta, with lots of otaku references and humor. Even in the way the plot progresses, there's always a huge awareness regarding romcom tropes and even the haremettes (aside from the main heroine, which is truly something else, something that i have never seen in this genre yet, that's how special she is) start off as complete (at least apparently) walking tropes. Hell, even without watching you can tell the own premise is meta as f*ck. But it really works here because the writer is completely aware of all that! The thing is, Saekano really knows how to work through what is clich\u00e9 and formulaic. And what's really great about the show is that it is able to transform said tropes/clich\u00e9s into something rather good and almost unique. The pacing is also very good for a LN adaptation and both the direction and animation is also excellent, with a lot of attention put into little details that make the series all the more enjoyable. I must say that A-1 did a really good job here.\\n\\n\r\nThe bottomline is, it's actually easy to dismiss this as just one more silly harem anime that you see in every season, especially if you take the first episode (which was full of fanservice and generic harem antics) at face value. But it's certainly not that kind of show, and of that i assure you. Or better yet, it is that kind of show without not actually being that kind of show. Confusing, right? \\n\\n\r\nBut it will definitely make sense by the time you finish watching it. Moreover, it must also be said that Saekano, in its usual 4th wall-breaking scenes, often drops some very important, plot-related bombs, so once again, with that bizarre, feigned innocence of his, almost as if it's asking you not to take it too seriously, ends up surprising you and urging you to pay attention to the tiniest pieces of dialogue, mainly because amidst all the silliness, there's always a clear intention or hidden seriousness that you probably won't even notice if you let the show fool you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a clever harem romcom, with lots of great humor and genuinely likable cast and plot, this show is for you.",

In reality, Saekano is much more similar to shows like Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai, OreImo and Outbreak Company as it has a character cast mainly consisting of otakus, and it consistently parodies and makes fun of today's anime industry as well as the eroge market as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nIn case that wasn't clear, the story is about your typical high-school otaku named Tomoya who has a dream of creating \"the ultimate galge\" that can touch the hearts and souls of everyone playing it. In order to do so he seeks the help of his tsundere childhood friend Eriri who secretly works as a hentai doujinshi artist on her spare time, as well as the so-called \"smartest girl in school\" Utaha who is a famous romance light novel author. Together they form a doujin circle and seek to create a homemade galge in order to fulfill Tomoya's dream. As the icing on the cake however, Tomoya also recruits his completely plain and emotionless classmate Megumi to join the circle, with the intention of \"training\" her into becoming the model for the game's main heroine. It's a very silly concept that doesn't take itself seriously whatsoever, but as a result it's surprisingly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're well-versed in today's anime industry, along with all the moe and ecchi shows that come out these days, then you'll probably like this show a lot because the endless references and parodies of it are absolutely hilarious. If you also happen to play visual novels, then it'll be even better still. I familiarized myself a lot with this anime, and as a result it almost never failed to put a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nOver time, there are some moments when the show gets a bit more serious on the romance/drama front but it still keeps it fairly light and doesn't go past the point where it starts feeling clich\u00e9. This pleased me a lot, because Saekano is truly at its best when it's being non-serious, light-hearted and just plain fun.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, out of all the various comedies, harems and other simplistic shows of that nature from the Winter 2015 season, I'd definitely have to say this is the best one. This is mainly because a) it actually feels fresh and not overused by any means, and b) it's actually extremely funny.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like moe and/or ecchi shows, play visual novels or just like to have a good laugh, then I'd recommend giving Saekano a shot. You probably won't regret it.",

            "content": "Saekano is the most frustrating kind of bad show: the kind which could have been legitimately good if it tried.\r\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t hyped for Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata (Saekano for short) at the start of winter 2015. It\u2019s a shiny new adaptation of Fumiaki Maruto\u2019s light novel series \u2013 the same Fumiaki Maruto who wrote White Album 2, which got an anime around a year and a half ago. He also wrote Parfait and Sekai de Ichiban NG na Koi \u2013 both of which I\u2019ve seen glowing reviews of. Naturally, I\u2019d expect Saekano to be something close to his workin eroge.\\n\\n\r\nI probably should\u2019ve listened to the warning signs. Certain Maruto fans on Twitter had already panned the show and the LN for being self-gratifying otaku humor. People who have watched the first two episodes called the show obnoxious for having snarky commentary on its clich\u00e9s while also indulging in them.\\n\\n\r\nBut let\u2019s give credit where it\u2019s due: Saekano isn\u2019t complete trash. I would probably be more forgiving of the show if it were: it\u2019s easier to let go of a show that\u2019s a total failure than a show that flubbed with its great ideas. There are two things that Saekano did well in portraying: the relationship between consumer and creator, and the character of Katou Megumi. Let\u2019s start with the former.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 6 of Saekano is the first episode where I thought the show was being genuine. The episode frames Utaha as the creator and Tomoya the consumer, and the show asks: how far should an author go to in trying to please their readers? And I feel that the show gave a good answer to the question: fans want something that the creator wrote, not something that would go with their expectations. The framing of the scene was even reminiscent of White Album 2: two high school kids throwing their emotions at each other under the snow might be a clich\u00e9d scene, but if there\u2019s anyone who can make it work, it\u2019s Fumiaki Maruto.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 9 is another good episode that gave Eriri much-needed characterization past her generic tsundere shtick. This time, the show asks why a creator, well, creates works for fans \u2013 for whose sake are they putting out content? Again, the show frames this question with Tomoya as the consumer and Eriri as the creator: does Eriri draw so she can get better for her fans, or does she just draw to satisfy herself and stay where she is?  Eriri finds her foot forward when she decides to get better at drawing to win over Tomoya and satisfy her fans. The show doesn\u2019t give a complete answer, but it gave her character a push forward.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I think Saekano\u2019s best point was Katou Megumi\u2019s character: the deadpan non-otaku who joins the group as the \u201cmain heroine\u201d. There\u2019s no mistaking that the title\u2019s \u201cboring heroine\u201d refers to Katou: the show keeps referring to her as having \u201cno character\u201d and a \u201chalf-assed personality\u201d. On the contrary, her character doesn\u2019t conform to the show\u2019s pre-established archetypes: even though she doesn\u2019t stand out within the show, Katou is perhaps the most memorable character because she\u2019s not a generic archetype. And this is what I think the show was trying to accomplish with Katou: characters should be people, and not just generic archetypes. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately that's where the show\u2019s good points stop. The conversation between Eriri and Tomoya from the start of episode 5 exemplifies what exactly makes the show so frustrating:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cBut I just want to always be myself.\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Everyone has a secret side to them.\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 Katou doesn\u2019t, does she?\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a non-otaku, but even when mixed up with us otaku, she stayed exactly the same as she was, right?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIt's an insightful conversation, only to be cut short by Eriri acting like the stock tsundere archetype. Saekano knows that Katou stands out the most among the characters, and it knows that characters that follow archetypes like Eriri need to have more than their shallow character traits. The show demonstrates a degree of awareness of its clich\u00e9s \u2013 it knows that its characters are generic archetypes, and Katou serves as a direct contrast to them. But that\u2019s where it stops \u2013 it\u2019s satisfied at being aware of its clich\u00e9s, but never does anything to rise up above them. Even worse, the show\u2019s title and all of the show\u2019s characters want Katou to become one of them: a generic character who talks and responds to situations with nothing but stock phrases. It\u2019s hypocritical and obnoxious \u2013 in short, it\u2019s a show that gives advice and chooses not to follow it.\\n\\n\r\nBut I would\u2019ve been okay with the show if it had stopped there. Instead, Episode 10 onwards indulges in all the trashy tropes that it comments on. Episode 10 throws all subtlety out of the window and pours male gaze all over the show, not to mention indulging in classy humor such as flashing a girl. It\u2019s not even the more sensual kind of fanservice like episode 6\u2019s Utaha scene where she puts on her stockings. It\u2019s the point where the show stops trying and just revels in all the trashy LN tropes we all love and \u201ccleverly\u201d comments on all of them. This show is completely in love with itself and all of the trashy things that it comments on.\\n\\n\r\nThe bottom line: if you\u2019re watching this because you heard it was by White Album 2\u2019s author, don\u2019t bother. If you\u2019re watching this expecting a trashy, fanservice-y show, you\u2019re better off watching an actual trashy, fanservice-y show, because shows like those don\u2019t bother pretending that they\u2019re not trashy, fanservice-y crap. Saekano is obnoxious, hypocritical, and pretentious. Avoid it like the big, stinky turd that it is.\\n\\n\r\n(Full review with images here: https://oneofepisodes.wordpress.com/2015/04/17/saekano-how-to-write-a-stinking-pile-of-crap/)",

            "content": "Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata, or Saekano for reduce, is an anime where the protagonist is an otaku who wants to fulfill his dream of creating a galgame, after meeting his beautiful heroine in a captivating scene in which his hat flies downhill, stopping near of protagonist, who is shocked to see a girl with such beauty. To follow his dream of creating a game, he forms your harem... I mean, your team, with qualified people in various areas which are needed to create a game, but with unique personalities, which consequently develops a bit of humor on the series thanks to this factor, and thenfrom there the story begins to unfold. Obviously what will be written from here is my opinion on the series. I'm available to discuss the show with anyone who's interested, regardless of have or not agreed with the content of the review.\\n\\n\r\nTo be quite honest, the story isn't entirely creative, but so doesn't cease to be fun. The protagonist's idea do everything to chase his dream is very common, including in reality, to be exact. But the situations created in the course of the series are funny, somewhat pleasant, and usually force a smile of who is watching. Are jokes that fit well with the situation that is happening on moment. At certain times these jokes or funny moments, mix a little with fanservice, and to be honest, it doesn't bother me much, since the series doesn't use just this artifice in your episodes. In my opinion is a quantity dosed, if I may say so. Watch the reaction of the protagonist in these moments is funny, but at certain times he just exaggerating with screams and unique reactions. Anyway, to sum up, the story is quite normal, but the situations created at certain times are funny, which to my view, gives a positive point for the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe design in overall is very good. In this regard, the studio did a great job on show, because characters and scenary interact well, making the characters more interesting to observe, and in compensation the series becomes more enjoyable to watch. Those traits help the spectator to identify or admire some specific character. I don't have a lot to talk about this aspect of design, since, in my opinion, it's quite satisfactory. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime soundtrack is pretty interesting, because I really liked the music and sound effects produced in the series. About the dubbing of characters, most of the dubbers have adapted well to the characters, with the exception of the protagonist. I mean, it's not that don't fit well, because it was actually done an interesting job here, but in my opinion the \"Kirito's voice\" is already a bit saturated, appearing in many recent anime. Nothing against the dubber's work, only in my view, he could at the same trying to change the voice in different characters. I'm not saying that's easy, since I have no experience in the subject, but over time the viewers can get tired of it. The other characters, have gained many good voice, and in my view, fit well with their appearances and personalities. The Utaha's dubber helped to define your firm and unforgiving personality. The Eriri's dubber combined very well with the style of tsundere character, and the Katou's dubber, in my opinion, was perfect. I loved watching the anime and accompany the Katou expressing his style confused and distant in their various moments in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are unusual, because according to Katou, all three beyond are big figures in school where they study, once otakus, in several other stories tend to be despised. It is normal to think that the Eriri and Utaha are famous for their physical appearance and the way you act different with other people, I just don't really understand why the Tomoya is an important figure there inside. Since this isn't the focus, end up not being so important think much about it. Utaha is an interesting character, because in addition to having a beauty that highlights, has a job, or hobby, unusual to a student, and has a very interesting personality, what makes it endearing. Eriri is a typical tsundere of serie, and that prides itself (although she can't admit) be a childhood friend of Tomoya. Usually is the one that is paying attention on Tomoya, and gets annoyed with the jokes and approaches which Utaha makes to induce Tomoya, one since most of them are quite bold. Michiru appeared at the last moment, but ended up being really cool and provided funny moments, being the main, but not unique, base of the fanservice. Katou is the most interesting of all, in my opinion, because it can be one of the more normal characters I've ever seen in anime. Has weak presence and sometimes the other characters don't notice her in around. Your reactions are unexpectedly normal when it addresses an unknown subject or that it's not in your best interest, and it ends up becoming one of its charms. She's so normal that it's a very different character compared to several others. Tomoya is a standard otaku, with strong personality, which eventually can be annoying, but is the center of history and ensures the laughter in series, once your reactions towards the other girls are typical and funny.\\n\\n\r\nThe series itself in general is quite satisfactory, can please diverse audiences. Maybe just disappoint people hoping for a serious romance, since you shouldn't expect that in anime with the harem genre. Who likes a mild romcom, Saekano is a very interesting show to watch, because hours have comedies, dramas and pinches of fanservice. Has a common storyline, but enjoyable. Was well on several counts. It's a great entertainment and fun guaranteed.",

            "content": "What does it take to create a dating SIM which will cause people to laugh and cry, but also touch their hearts? This was a question our main character asked himself, which sparked the beginning of the roller-coaster of laughs we call Saekano. \r\nI\u2019m sure when we were younger you\u2019ve all had dreams and goals you wanted to achieve when you get older. The anime tells the epic adventure it took our MC, Tomoya Aki, to achieve his goal of creating a game, complete with all the girl problems, and sexual harassments he receives each day from his devious co-workers.\r\nWhile I was scrolling through thenotoriously long new anime section of an unnamed website \u201chow to raise a boring girlfriend\u201d caught my eye, then I thought to myself \u201cbetter take some notes.\u201d At first glance Saekano looks like an average rom-com anime, and being your normal rom-com lover I decided to give it a try, and let me tell you I was definitely in for a treat. Saekano is one of those anime\u2019s that you just can't get enough of, not a single episode has left me without tears rolling down my face from laughter.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]\\n\r\nThe story kicks off on a sunny spring day in which the wind blows the hat off of a fair maiden, which of course Tomoya was there to pick it up for her, and give it back. That event was what inspired Tomoya to make a dating SIM, he also envisioned that, that exact event would serve to be a flawless opening scene with the maiden as the main character. And as far as we know the  \u201cperfect girl\u201d  doesn\u2019t exist, because Tomoya later finds out that in reality the maiden wasn't very \u201cfair,\u201d in fact, apart from her beauty, she\u2019s just about the most ordinary girl ever. She was so ordinary that Tomoya didn't realize that she was in his class. The plot is centered on our protagonist Tomoya Aki and his associates, the busty, but intelligent Utaha senpai, the flat but ill-mannered Eriri Spencer, and of course the ordinary girl, Katou Megumi. Saekano takes a slow start, as it takes several episodes for Mr. Aki to convince his unwilling companions to aid him in making his game. But after that the pacing of the anime is quite steady. It\u2019s sad that this anime is limited only to 12 episodes, which for me is definite con, because there could\u2019ve been so much more character, and plot development. \\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\t\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely where the anime excels the most at. Each of the female protagonists, with the exception of Katou, have an ornate, and well developed backstory with Tomoya. Throughout the plot the author slowly elaborates more on the characters as if slowly giving us puzzle pieces to give us the better picture. But due to the anime only having 12 episodes, we never really get to see the full potential character development from all the characters. \\n\\n\r\n[Art]\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the A-1 pictures did a great job animating this anime. They used vibrant colors that really brought out carefree, and cheerful tone of the show. The animation style reminds me of Nisekoi another successful harem anime. The character designs to me were great, they followed the generic character designs of many harem, and romance animes.Don\u2019t really see much cons of this art style unless you dislike the uniqueness of the art style. One thing that stood out to me was the insanely stubby fingers the characters have sometimes, especially while Utaha is typing.  \\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\r\nThe show had a solid, and well-built soundtrack, with dramatic sounding dramatic scenes, and cheerful music for happy scenes. Not much I can say but the soundtracks were sufficient for the show. Great choices in the voice actor department, what could go wrong Ai Kayano, and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as 2 of your main characters? The OPs and EDs were lighthearted songs that complemented the show\u2019s tone. They were not especially stunning but definitely not crappy. \\n\\n\r\n[Negatives]\\n\r\nAs a mentioned before several times, my biggest problem with this anime is that it only has 12 episodes, and because of this, we didn\u2019t get to see the full potential of character development the show could\u2019ve given us. Nor get to see a more complete full picture. But with the anime leaving off like this I\u2019m sure that there would be second, or even a third season. \\n\\n\r\nThe second thing I had a problem while watching the anime was the pacing of the, which i mentioned before was a bit too slow in the beginning. But towards the end of the show the pacing sped up again.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment/ Overall]\\n\r\nQ-What would you happen if you added together an eccentric rich girl, a beautiful female writer, a hardcore otaku, his musically blessed cousin, and an ordinary girl?  \\n\\n\r\nA-You get Blessing Software, as well as one of the most well-made and hilarious rom-coms ever.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching Oregairu, I fell in love with the rom-com genre. But it\u2019s hard to find a well-made rom-com these days but this anime definitely didn\u2019t disappoint me. I enjoyed everything in this show from Eriri\u2019s hilarious tsundere personality to Utaha\u2019s constant sexual harassments. I know some people criticize this show\u2019s unrealistic plot, but honestly who watches an anime for its realism? Anime\u2019s aren\u2019t meant to be rated for its realistic elements but for its ability to entertain the viewer. And this is an anime that does exactly that. It\u2019s an anime that focuses in on its characters, I\u2019m definitely not saying that the plot is bad I\u2019m just saying that the characters of the anime are the focal point, and make it worth watching. But just remember if you plan to watch Saekano, as their game progresses, hilarity ensues not far behind.\\n\\n\r\nStory-7\\n\r\nArt-10\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\r\nCharacter-8\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9\\n\r\nOverall-8\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "It's kinda difficult to express my dislike for Saakeno, without sounding like a total snob, but I will try. So, here it comes. BEING SELF-AWARE DOES NOT MAKE YOU A GOOD PARODY OR SATIRE.\r\nYeah, Saekano is one of those. The kind of work that pokes at some over-used trope or clich\u00e9 and then loudly proclaims \"Isn't that totally a clich\u00e9, huh, guys?!\". Yeah, it is, but so what? Are you going to expand on that? Maybe in some way subvert that trope and bring about something new? You just poke at it. Okay.\r\nAnd that's the main problem with Saekano. It tries to be a parodysimply by being self-aware. It keeps saying that characters are \"Tsunderes\" and \"Yanderes\" without even trying to expand on them. It keeps saying how given situation is \"Totally out of some harem anime\" and then proceed to play it out exactly like that. Nothing is expanded upon or subverted, just acknowledged. \\n\r\nAnd that's the root of the problem. Well, that and the protagonist, who was made by combining all the annoying traits from other romance protagonists. He's oblivious, obnoxious, doesn't have any talents except \"HIS FORCE OF WILL!\", has only two voice settings (boring and YELLS RIGHT IN YOUR FACE) and for some reason all of \"The most popular girls in the school\" are hopelessly in love with him. \\n\r\nI'd say the only redeeming quality the show has is Megumi Katou, the \"Boring Girlfriend\". She is stated to be incredibly boring, bland and generic. And she is. She genuinely is, but precisely because of that she is the most interesting character in the entire show, because she manages to be original in the sea of over-used tropes and generic characters.\\n\r\nFor me Saekano is an example of great wasted potential. There were so many instances where I hoped it'd go to a different, more original direction and become something more. I was hoping Kato would get fed up with Aki's obnoxiousness after he forbade her to go out with her cousin, because majority of rational people would draw a line there.. I was hoping Eriri would accept other circle proposition, because it appreciated her talents, unlike Aki. I was hoping it would go deeper with Utaha's backstory to explain why would she fall in love with Aki to such a degree, that she was willing to compromise her career and artistic integrity for his sake. I was hoping it would expand more on girls' relationship with each other, probably even showing that they don't really need Aki to fulfill their own ambitions. But no. That didn't happen and all we got was some self-referential humor and a creepy camera operator who kept focusing on girls' different body parts for no reason during casual conversations.",

            "content": "(Reposting because apparently it fell foul of rules about previews :/ )\r\nHow to write a boring parody\r\nDon't you just love it when a show knows it's a show? When characters find themselves in a situation that only occurs in fiction & they know it? How pretty much every new series nominally set in the real world has someone say \u201cThis would only happen in manga\u201d or \u201cThis isn't anime\u201d at least once? Well I hope you do, because Saekano is basically an entire series made up of such oh so witty observations & self-referential jabs at the genre it is set in. Too bad itsucks.\\n\\n\r\nOur main character is one Tomoyo Aki, a super otaku with a popular blog & a reputation for being the nerdiest nerd in nerdom, which apparently is a good thing. Basically he's Keima Katsuragi from The World God Only Knows, except instead of finding himself tasked by a demon to put his otaku skills to use date raping his schoolmates, he instead has the type of only in fiction encounter with a mysterious girl that inspires him to create the greatest dating sim ever made.\\n\\n\r\nThere's just one problem with this plan, he can't write. Or draw. Or indeed do anything beyond feel inspired. Luckily for him, he knows the two most popular girls in the school, hot headed Eriri Spencer Sawamura & aloof Kasumigaoka Utaha have secret otaku identities as a mangaka & LN author respectively, & so he sets about convincing them to make his dream game come true. Even better, he soon encounters the mysterious girl whose chance encounter began this whole affair. However, unlike in his fantasy, she turns out to be the utterly unassuming Megumi Kato, & so not only does our MC set out to make the greatest game ever, but also shape the real miss Kato to be more like the heroine he thinks of her as. Cue hijinks.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to get straight to the point. I do not much care for Saekano. Tomoyo is a generic main character, oblivious to the feelings & emotions of everyone around him & yet feels compelled to do everything he can to, to use the unfortunate parlance of the genre, raise the flags of every girl he comes into contact with. With the exception of Kato, the rest of the cast are similarly cliche. Would you believe that Eriri & Kasumigaoka both have deeply held feelings for Tomoyo? Well no, you wouldn't, because he's an un-likeable brat of a person, & yet they most certainly do. Of course they can't just share those feelings with him (but they certainly can share them with the audience) because then there wouldn't be a show. Ho hum.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of being a brat, it's quite stunning just what a brat Tomoyo is. As seems to be the way for men in anime, he is incapable of expressing his emotions without shouting. He shouts a lot, usually at other people, usually telling them why what they're doing is wrong. Be it shouting at Megumi for being too boring or shouting at Kasumigaoka for not writing his story for him just the way he wants it, Tomoyo seems incapable of expressing himself any other way but loudly. & when he's not shouting, he's usually smugly proselyting about how great otaku culture is & by implication how great he is for being one. It's like if Madarame from Genshiken was giving his 2D girls speech for an entire series. Of course everyone puts up with it because this is a romance anime & tolerating the main character's foibles & failings, even seeing how they are in fact ultimately correct about everything, is what makes a good girlfriend.\\n\\n\r\nNow because this is apparently satire, one must assume that those parts which appear obviously cliche (ie the whole show) are intentionally so. By that logic, the characters go through the harem routines we've seen their character types go through a hundred times before precisely because it's what they're expected to do.The obnoxious fan service, & it really is at times, is so because\\n\r\nboob & crotch shots are so ubiquitous in this genre that it has to be so over the top just to stand out. Saekano isn't trying to change anything, merely point out how silly it is once you start to notice it, which it certainly does.\\n\\n\r\nHere's my problem with that. For one, I don't think there's a fan among harem viewers who isn't already aware that in every respect the harem story type is stupid & unrealistic. We already know it's dumb, so simply smugly pointing out how dumb it is while not offering any ways to change it for the better makes Saekano the equivalent of at best a comedy fandub & at worst an annoying guy sitting next to you while you try to watch, pointing out all the silly cliches & unrealistic situations but throwing up his hands & saying \"don't ask me\" when asked what he'd do better.\\n\\n\r\nFor another, a lot of the witty observations it makes have already been made, better, by other shows. Genshiken was joking about the power of childhood friendship over ten years ago, & it didn't feel the need to labour the point by repeating said joke every episode. Haganai had the female characters be the ones who got into male aimed dating sims, joking that while they might be porn games for girls they're also as close as they get to a friendship sim. Making your titillating fan service that extra bit more in your face might serve to illustrate how ubiquitous it is within the genre, but any point Saekano might be trying to make with it is pretty well hidden behind Utaha's stockings & Michiru's tits.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, all of the things Saekano apparently does differently are pointless because none of them have any effect on the overall story, which continues down the well trodden path of everyone ultimately working to achieve the main characters goals while the various relationships are kept in an stasis until the author decides they can't be bothered to keep writing & wraps everything up in the final book. Kato might be the nominally \"normal\" girl in the group, but for a normal girl she has an abnormal tolerance for Tomoe's bull & ultimately ends up wanting to be more involved in the group, even going as far as to find things for herself to do since Tomoe is too busy with his shenanigans with the other girls to notice.\\n\\n\r\nEriri has a big outburst & falling out with Tomoe, which briefly makes it look like Saekano might actually shake things up. But no, in the end all that happens is she shouts at him because she feel's he's not paying her enough attention, he shouts at her about how crap her latest doujin was, & instead of doing what you might expect, tell Tomoe where to stick his dating sim & go back to her more lucrative mangaka work, she declares that she'll make him notice her & everything goes back to normal. It ends up just like Hatako's outburst in Inou Battle, a last, desperate expression of rebellion before she falls back in line with how harem girls are meant to behave. The point is that despite ample opportunity, nothing stops the plot train from traveling to cliche harem town which renders Saekano's attempts at \"satire\" pointless, in my opinion; nothing more than self-satisfied jokes about how clever it is for noticing all these things.\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to be able to say that there's something beyond the main character that redeems Saekano, but there isn't. The notion making a dating sim on the whim of an otaku seems straight out of Welcome to the NHK, but Saekano lacks a character even remotely on the level of Yamazaki or Sato, nor does it seem interested in using its set-up for any kind of commentary or satire, instead just going through the motions of contriving situations that get the main character alone with each of the girls where they all learn something about each other that somehow makes the episode not feel like a complete waste of time. The art, in particular the character designs, are generic as you can get without falling into the realm of outright plagiarism. They also noticeably suffer from anime's push to remove any bone structure from characters faces. The animation is fine for the most part, although the use of CG for some character movements stands out like a sore thumb at times. Oh, & the music ranges from forgettable to I wish I could forget it.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Saekano is the worst kind of parody. It recognizes the clich\u00e9s, tropes etc. of what constitutes a bad harem romance, but instead of using that knowledge to make a good one it just contents itself with being bad but self aware. Maybe that's enough for some people, & it does have its moments, I'll grant it. However, to me there is a world of difference between being a good show about a bad one (Extras or Garth Marenghi's Darkplace\\n\r\ncome to mind) & a bad show that thinks repeatedly saying how bad it is makes up for it. It doesn't.",

            "content": "Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata is to me, a breathe of fresh air in anime. At first, I looked at it and said, \"Oh no, another harem anime, i'll wait a bit to watch it...\" Boy am I happy I gave it a chance. \r\nSaekano is the story of how Aki Tomoya finds his passion to create a new game after he meets a girl named Katou Megumi. He considers her to be his perfect \"heroine\" when trying to talk to his friends about her. However, when he actually gets a chance to talk to her, she is monotone, isn't actually interested in the things heis, and just seems plain boring. However, that is probably the greatest part about her character. Her being that way, actually makes her probably the most interesting characters in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nTomoya also has two other friends who help him on his journey to make his \"perfect\" game after convincing them. These two other characters are a lot more generic, but they also make the anime very enjoyable and fun to watch. In my opinion, it's kind of like Nisekoi where every girl can be considered \"best girl\" because they all are pretty awesome.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the story of the anime is very easy to follow and very enjoyable. There are a few fan service parts (especially episode 0), but it's not too often and often unnoticeable in later episodes. The art style is also something that I love in this anime, especially when it transitions into the style where it outlines everything into a certain color (i don't know how to explain it but you'll see :)).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Saekano is very enjoyable to watch, you have character development with unique stories to everyone, catchy op and ed and just an over all fun and likable story.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve never really been an A-1 Pictures fan, but it\u2019s like they used up all their goodwill with the people who do consider themselves a part of that fanbase after making Your Lie In April, because 2015 has been a bad bad BAD year for them. So bad in fact that prior to my decision to watch this, I have yet finish any of their output, and half of them have already been forgotten by the mainstream crowd as of this writing. From an Aldnoah Zero second half that failed to live up to the promise of its predecessor to some Spring anime that Ialready forgotten the names of to this, I think it\u2019s safe to say that \u201cA-1\u201d and \u201cquality\u201d will be antonyms for at least the remainder of this year and most likely many more to come. At least until they learn about a little business practice I\u2019d like to call quality control.\\n\\n\r\nBut let\u2019s not bash on A-1\u2019s retarded \u201clet\u2019s release five anime a season and hope that one of them will strike gold\u201d policies and focus on the actual anime, shall we? Some of you may recall that I didn\u2019t give the main series much of a chance during the season it aired because that prologue that supposedly takes place just before the first season\u2019s (and there will be a sequel apparently) conclusion had some of the worst usage of smug, fan-wanking meta-dialogue this side of Vampire Diaries, which might have been tolerable if the entire plot of said prologue didn\u2019t revolve around the dialogue entirely. However, a bunch of people assured me since that said prologue was a poor representation of the show and that the actual series was a genuinely heart-warming tale of friendship and anime fandom with no more irritating meta-dialogue giving me an aneurism. Although it turned out that there was a miscommunication regarding the latter (and the former too for that matter).\\n\\n\r\n\u201cNo more meta-dialogue, Mr. Flawfinder?\u201d they said after I downloaded the thing. \u201cOh I\u2019m sorry. I thought you said LOTS more meta-dialogue!\u201d Oh and just so you know, you can't prove anything, so don't even try calling the cops on me regarding some recent hospitalizations of known anime fans.\\n\\n\r\nSaekano\u2019s premise is basically a non-pornographic version of Eroge H Game wa Blablabla, in that it focuses on a group of four girls and one guy trying to make a quality visual novel/porn game without the women drawing art in their underwear 24/7 or practicing the sex moves they want to implement whilst wearing a gimp suit and rope. It also shares similarities in that it takes place in some shitty fantasy world where despite the characters being fully aware of these terrible tropes, it doesn\u2019t stop their entire characterizations being defined by said tropes right up to indulging in them willingly in order to get the right amount of detail into the final product. I mean a half-British blonde highschool girl who is considered an idol by many and yet happens to be a very popular underground doujin artist and childhood friends with the main lead? You\u2019d see less overstuffed details in a song lyric written by Train.\\n\\n\r\nOur main hero is Tomoya Aki, a stereotypical nerd who has a very similar name to Tomoya Okazaki from Clannad, looks like a polished version of Yamazaki from Welcome to the NHK, will also probably be voiced by Greg Ayres in the dub for this too, and is - to put it lightly - a massive fuck. He gets motivated to follow his dreams upon seeing a girl named Megumi Kato on a hill like in his visual novels, but once he finds out that she's in the same class as him, he ropes her into being his model for the project on the condition that she act exactly like the quiet pure maiden he imagined her to be before he actually got to know her - except she has to play video games like he does. What's that noise you ask? Why yes, that is the sexism train going over the speed limit, why do you ask?\\n\\n\r\nSince he's an untalented cock who talks big on dreams without actually putting much effort into realizing them himself, he needs someone to do the job of actually making the visual novel for him. Luckily, he happens to know two beautiful girls who have secret lives as a well-renowned ero artist and a best-selling light novel author and convinces them to join because they secretly crave untalented cock for breakfast. Fucking hell, this sexism train is nearly breaking the speed of light isn't it? You can talk about him being the director all you want, but the only directing he ever really does is make the girls sacrifice their personal lives to satisfy his own. Which is true to life, but I'm pretty sure Stanley Kubrick's desire for perfection didn't involve him getting humped by his own cousin.\\n\\n\r\nAs part of the show's insistence that being ironic equals being satire, the entire structure of Saekano is pretty reminiscent of your standard visual novel adaptation beats. The first few episodes are dedicated to introducing the girls and setting things up. The next few are spent on giving the girls individual focus and explaining why Tomoya is important to them whilst setting up their roles in events to come. The final few episodes introduces a completely new girl and sets up her role in all this...actually, it never really goes past the setup phase. Fuck all actually happens in this anime aside from establishing things, which isn't a story at all. It's a power point presentation with a poor sense of humor, not helped by the fact that the show desperately wants to ride on Monogatari's coattails with so many of the animation tricks being blatant rip-offs of Shaft's cost-cutting techniques whilst spouting dialogue that isn't the least bit as clever as it thinks it is, nor does it progress things in any significant way.\\n\\n\r\nNot that the show doesn't have moments of actual deliverance. They're just few and botched really badly to boot. There's one dramatic shout-fest between Tomoya and Eriri three-quarters of the way through the show regarding their badly damaged friendship back in their elementary days due to the former's refusal to stand down as an anime geek and the latter having outside pride to maintain. Good of you to know I was getting bored Saekano, but this was like inter-splicing the climax of Pride and Prejudice into Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill - and it doesn't help that the only thing resulting from said drama was more \"Jesus make it stop\"-setup.\\n\\n\r\nOh and do you want to know how much time is spent on actually making the goddamn visual novel? We never even get to see the tools they use. They just show results at convenient times, the most egregious being the final few minutes that try desperately to have some kind of closure to the whole mess by suddenly revealing the characters created one route without so much as a montage of them doing it. As far as I'm concerned, that's the equivalent of putting the celebration party in Return of the Jedi right after the final climax of The Empire Strikes Back.\\n\\n\r\nBut where Saekano fails the most for me is that there's no urgency to anything going on. The show loves to indulge Tomoya's constant rants regarding his dreams, but it never really gives me a reason regarding why I\u2019m supposed to care about 'em. To bring up Welcome to the NHK again, remember how the main thrust of that show was also about the leads wanting to make a visual novel because it turns out you can make money from it and Satou kinda needed it because he was a NEET that was in danger of being evicted? Aside from just being a huge anime geek since elementary school, Tomoya doesn\u2019t have any real reason for why this dream is important to life, let alone seem to have any personal problems related to it.\\n\\n\r\nIt never conflicts with his school stuff, he doesn\u2019t seem to be suffering any money problems, and the show barely focuses on its romantic aspects to begin with, so saying \u201cit\u2019s so he can be with the main heroine\u201d doesn\u2019t hold water even if you do try to utilize that weak excuse. And since the girls still get to live their secret lives consequence-free by helping him in their spare time, they aren't really sacrificing anything to help him either apart from the safeties on that sexism train, which stops just short of going so fast that it breaks into another dimension at this point in the article. As far as actual thrust goes, it has about as much conflict and tension as a gang leader forcing you at gunpoint to play Monopoly with him because his family is on vacation. And said gun is a Super Soaker with no water in it.\\n\\n\r\nStruggling to see the point of its existence beyond fan wank, I read the surprisingly large number of positive reviews for clarification and they didn't help one jot. A bunch of fans like the character dynamics, which is fine if you do, but you cannot base an entire show on interactions alone unless it's really really funny ala Seinfeld. And I didn't laugh once watching this, unless you count that time when I broke down after realizing the show was going to conclude on the personal problems of a girl that was thrown in at the last minute with little connection to the overarching story. Some people praise its relatability, but not only do I not see how I can possibly relate to these pricks, it's also completely contradictory to these same people praising that it's a meta-commentary on harem situations. Is it true to life or is it a satire of fictional life, guys? You can't be both.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if it's meant to be a satire that raises questions regarding the otaku lifestyle, the foregrounds and backgrounds of visual novels, and why these harem anime are everywhere, then why is it so unchallenging to the mind and creatively bankrupt, like a high-concept sci-fi premise by way of a self-indulgent Disney writer? Combine those problems with garbage animation and zero plot progression that focuses too much on the build-up at the expense of payoff, and Saekano ends up being nothing more than an irritating pile of gimmicks that leaves you with an empty feeling inside, poorly drawn females trying to arouse you, and a crappy cover of the Gurren Lagann opening that made me go from being indifferent to the song to absolutely hating it.",

            "content": "Harem-ridden and trope-driven as anime nowadays is, many a disillusioned fan don\u2019t hesitate to call out the medium as fallen. Indeed, though Miyazaki may not actually have uttered the words \u201canime was a mistake.\u201d (only not in public, mind you) the wide circulation of the phrase is nonetheless a reflection of the sentiments of our oh-so-critical generation. Along comes Saekano, or How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend, the latest entry of the harem genre\u2019s self-critique and introspection. \r\nTomoya is, well, your ordinary harem lead who is seemingly unremarkable but whose charm is so irresistible yet so subtle, that the girls around him cannot but fallfor him, much to the frustration of some viewers who cannot see any logic to these affections (as they\u2019ve surely through logic and reasoning discerned the inner workings of love, but I digress). By means of insistence and unconscious emotional manipulation, he has gathered a crew of contrastingly remarkable people to develop a dating sim. There\u2019s Utaha the prodigy writer who has written several acclaimed novels, the famed doujin artist Eriri, and Katou who\u2019s, uh, not particularly special save for being kind of cute and somehow managing to seduce our protagonist on first his first sight of her. \\n\\n\r\nHuh? But she\u2019s a perfectly normal person no matter which way you look at it; where are the special traits or encounters which should precede such an affection? There needs be none, Saekano tries to tell us; love is a complex and illogical phenomenon which requires no extrinsic justification. Isn\u2019t the very engendering of this sensation, among the flames and naivet\u00e9 of youth, reason enough to love?\\n\\n\r\nSaekano is a self-aware and self-referencing work. It points out the flaws and implausibilities which often plague its genre, yet offers no alternative. Instead, it toys around with harem tropes subverts it its usual formula using Katou who acts completely normally to foil the others. There is an inherent absurdity in having one ordinary girl among a cast of characters who are necessarily quirky a la harem shows. Katou is paradoxically special simply because she's a normal girl among sexy prodigies. Though criticized for conforming to its genre without innovation, composing the rest of the cast with typical harem characters is essential in achieving what Saekano wants to do. While it does highlight the unrealistic characters and tropes of harems, it also serves to illustrate the irrationality of passion and infatuation, which is shown in Katou\u2019s and Tomaya\u2019s feelings for each other but reflective of the other characters as well. In contrast to most similar commentaries, Saekano simultaneously subverts and justifies the harem genre, without ever stepping out of its boundaries.\\n\\n\r\nBeing cast of game producers, the characters elucidate the conflicts of aestheticism behind the creation of such works. The team is aware of the flaws and tropes in their work, but artistic integrity has to be weighed against the harsh market. Even so, no creator wishes to make hollow trash like \u201ccritics\u201d so often may think. Behind these stories are genuine emotions, far more so than half-assed criticisms by blind followers of objectivism. The creators of Saekano, and the characters in Saekano, all put great effort into making human beings with deeply personal motivations despite their being in a necessarily trope-ridden show. Eririri\u2019s falling out with Tomoya isn\u2019t simply a release of her repressed exasperations or an expression of her individuality and desire for attention; she is a window through which we see the creators\u2019 wish to move their audience, as well as frustrations at the vessels of these emotions being ignored or enjoyed as \u201clow art\u201d.  \\n\\n\r\nA veritable work of its time, Saekano is an author\u2019s input on the contemporary attitude so critical of harems that they\u2019re often not given a chance at all. Yet, much of its commentary is perhaps too implicit and overshadowed by its overt remarks on the genre which may be brushed off as unsubstantial. For the actively dismissive (or consciously undiscerning, if I may) it will hardly make much of an impression other than being an ordinary harem with a cheap attempt at critiquing the harem genre. For others with willing ears and eyes to match, it can be a novel take on the values and motivations surrounding the genre. \\n",

            "content": "Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata is one of the best shows I've seen in a long time and let me tell you why. \r\n(Make sure you watch Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata: Ai to Seishun no Service Kai before watching the series. Keep in mind that when you do, the episode is literally titled \"The fanservice episode of love and youth\", so the episode is not a representation of the amount of fanservice in the actual show (which is almost none))\r\nStory: 9/10 \r\nThe title of the show translates roughly to \"How to Raise a Boring Heroine\", and that's effectively what the show is about. Aki Tomoya, ahardcore otaku and our protagonist, one day comes face to face with his destiny. He encounters a spectacular girl, and this inspires him to make a galge or romantic visual novel based on this encounter. \\n\r\nHe manages to convince Kasumigaoka Utaha, his senpai and a well renowned light novel author who is an ideal image of a moe character, black hair, big breasts, and black stockings, as well as Sawamura Spencer Eriri, his childhood friend and ero-doujin artist with blonde twintails and knee socks, another moe heroine archetype, to join him on his crusade to create the galge of his dreams. \\n\r\nHowever, as it turns out, the girl in question, Megumi Katou, the subject of Tomoya's enounter, is entirely lacking in individuality and minimal notable character traits. \\n\r\nThe story was refreshing and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is where Saekano stands out exceptionally. Through the concept of making Megumi Katou a more interesting heroine in the game, you get to know her character and chances are that by the end of the show, she will be your favourite heroine. However, none of her boring character is compromised in doing this. Rather than changing the minimal heroine into an archetype that you love, Saekano makes you love the lack of individuality in the main heroine, which his far more impressive. This show truly raises the boring heroine. \\n\r\nAlthough I stated that Katou will likely be your favourite heroine by the end of the show, this is not to speak against the other heroines, for they too are beautifully done. \\n\r\nEach of the other heroines, in great contrast against Katou, the boring heroine, embodies a prominent moe heroine archetype, and is far from lacking in presence. You have the black haired senpai with large breasts and black stockings, the tsundere childhood friend with blonde twintails, the younger girl who refers to the protagonist as \"Onii-chan\" (as you do), and the busty sporty character who is into music. Saekano takes all of these common archetypes, which all contrast against the boring character, then, puts its own unique spin on those archetypes you've all seen so many times, making you love them so much. \\n\r\nThe character development in Saekano is exceptional, and it is enforced greatly by several subtle touches. A great example of this would be the cafe scene in episode 2 when Megumi is never the focus of the shot, enforcing her minimal character nicely. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art of Saekano was nice, and worked well with the refreshing mood of the show. Although it's nothing exceptional, it was still good to look at, and did nothing to undermine the quality. Like a lot of other aspects of the show, it contained a few subtle touches which were really nice to see. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nHonestly, I took no notice of the OST the first time I watched Saekano, and only really payed it mind when I rewatched it. It was nothing exceptional, but it did a good job of enforcing the mood of various scenes, and the op and ed were great. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 \\n\r\nI loved the show, and I found myself frequently getting excited over small details that I noticed when I watched it. I would happily watch it again, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who has seen a good amount of anime or enjoys shows without much action. However, it might not be the best show for people who are only just getting into anime as it is riddled with references and puts its own unique twists on cliches, which would be less fun if you didn't get the cliches to begin with.",

            "content": "Rest in Peace : the fourth wall.\r\nNormally you would have a 'dense' male character in some harem anime but Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata (Saekano for short) is an anime that is ironic to itself so much that you can call this whole show 'dense'. \r\nIt is original and yet clich\u00e9 and I felt that this show had more potential if it wasn't rushed. I thoroughly enjoyed this show and I was watching it while it was airing. Every week I was excited for another episode of Saekano and I was staffed with every episode.\r\nStory:8/10\r\nThis anime's story is realistic, light yet humorous. I liked thefact that they make reference to other shows but in moderation so the show does not feel like a Parody anime, it made me feel like that somewhere, in Japan, the event is happening as I am watching it. It all seemed achievable.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, we then have the clich\u00e9 side of Saekano, the one where at the beginning of the episode you can already guess the end kind, the paper cut-out character personalities and the dense yet loved protagonist.But this is where it shines, as you see, Saekano is about a group of otakus and fujoshis trying to make the 'best game ever'. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this is when they starts to break the fourth wall, shatter it, crush it, destroy it, mash it and completely decimate it. \\n\\n\r\nThis show makes a lot of reference to itself and the otaku culture in real life whilst not being aware of themselves falling in to the same category (The blond, twin-tailed, tsundere; the cool and composed senpai or The love rivalry from the protagonist's childhood friend.)  as it seems at first. But the developers intended to make reference to itself with it not being aware to create this sense of humour, this sense of realism and make the show relatable. Ask yourself, 'How many times have you think of your own life and think that it is very clich\u00e9?'\\n\\n\r\nNone?\\n\\n\r\nOkay...Anyway, this anime turned out to be an anime about a group of otakus making references to other anime whilst being in an anime themselves. It is very cleverly approached and I would love to have more episodes of this fourth-wall goodness.\\n\\n\r\nBut as always, a show always have to come to an end (unless you are called One Piece) and Saekano's ending was very rushed or brief. It did not give us a decent conclusion of the story and left me surprised that the last episode was already gone. \\n\\n\r\nWhich made me happy about the coming of second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\\n\r\nApart from the realism that the story tries to give, this anime also sets it apart from our mundane world by using the more anime-looking art style instead of taking a more realistic approach. This is to tell the watchers that although the story may seem realistic, at the end of the day, this is still just an anime. Which is good as if the anime was overly detailed and made realistic, I would probably go watch some Japanese television series instead. \\n\\n\r\nThe graphics are well rendered and I personally did not see any flaws in animation when I was watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7/10\\n\\n\r\nSaekano's sound is not unique or catching to me. It adds to the 'Clich\u00e9' feel of a romance comedy to the anime instead. And just as I was saying, I believe it is enough for the story to become realistic, there is no need for any other aspect to try and compete for originality.This isn't to say that the sound is bad though, as I have certainly seen worse and I wouldn't mind if they made a second season with the same style of music as this season.\\n\\n\r\nThe background track blends in well with the dialogue and the V.As are definitely giving their best here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nHow funny that an anime about making the 'best game' have characters that is so clich\u00e9 that I would use this show as a guideline to tell people how different type of characters would act. But we have a more realistic side to the character, the one that cannot be found anywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nI am going to split the character into clich\u00e9 and original so you can see what I mean by them having 'another side' to them:\\n\\n\r\nMain male protagonist: Tomoya Aki\\n\\n\r\nClich\u00e9:\\n\r\n He is a harem protagonist so he is dense about his surroundings.\\n\r\n Had a 'fateful encounter'\\n\\n\r\nOriginal:\\n\r\n He is an otaku who appears to have a dream of creating  the 'best game' and he does not like 3D girls,in oppose to many other harem protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nUtaha Kasumigaoka\\n\\n\r\nClich\u00e9:\\n\r\n She's is the mature,cool and perfect senpai kind.\\n\\n\r\nOriginal:\\n\r\n She is a famous light-novel writer and Tomoya is a great fan of her novels. \\n\\n\r\nEriri Spencer Sawamura\\n\\n\r\nClich\u00e9:\\n\r\n Blonde, twin-tail, tsundere, childhood friend, half Japanese, half British,genius.\\n\\n\r\nOriginal:\\n\r\n She's is secretly a doujinshi artist and often shows the fujoshi side of her.\\n\\n\r\nClich\u00e9? Definitely. Original? Most certainly. It is a puzzle how the maker of Saekano manages to balance these all at once, but it did work and we were given the character of Saekano to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this show to any people who have decent knowledge of the otaku culture as this show breaks all expectations as otakus meanwhile keeping them as generic cardboard characters.",

            "content": "Creating something is an act that a lot of people take pride in.  A good piece of work in a world such as ours doesn't go unnoticed all too often and at the very least, gets some recognition.  With successful shows like Shirobako and Bakuman explaining and detailing the basis of how anime and manga are made perspectively, what about things like Doujinshi or games?  Well, thankfully we have Saenai Heroine no Sodetekata, or \"How to raise a boring girlfriend\" to remedy that debacle.  Let's begin.  \r\nStory (7.45/10): The story of Saenai Heroine or Saekano as the shorter version is,begins on one single faithful day.  Tomoya Aki is our main protagonist, a proud Otaku who appreciates the finer things of Otaku creation.  One day when returning back home, with the cherry blossoms blowing through the wind, Tomoya on top of a hill, meets a girl who stands on top of the hill behind him, creating that signature galge moment of the characters meeting their \"fated\" one.  It is here that he meets a girl named Kato Megumi, the girl that he chooses to be the star of a game that he, in the spur of the moment, wants to make.  And soon, his journey of starting a doujin game circle begins.\\n\\n\r\nSaekano is one of those anime that utilizes a very underused way of storytelling, genre parodying, being an anime that utilizes generic scenes that are featured in the genre that it's affiliated with (in this case, harem), and pokes fun at it by having characters or situations similar to what they were based off, but with a slight twist that makes it more comedic and overall more enjoyable.  Because of this, the show differs from a general harem, making it a more different than what one would normally expect from a show tagged \"Harem.\"  \\n\\n\r\nAs for actual story, the show follows the progress of how to make a Visual Novel as the characters featured in this show progress through episode to episode, making more progress with the game that they are developing.  At least, that's one part of it.  In addition to that, the show also develops the characters alongside the game, giving us, the audience, raised flags with the girls featured in the series, each with their own \"route\" that usually ends with some degree of hilarity.  It is with this that Saenai Heroine distinguishes itself from a lot of other harem, providing a different and more enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are a couple flaws that I find with the story.  Some...bugs, if you may.  One of the biggest problems I have with Saekano is the fact that the series doesn't really end on what I would consider to be a satisfying end.  The show doesn't necessarily finish the game that the characters are developing, meaning that there is most likely more material after the show's 12 episode runtime.  In addition, the buildup towards the actual gamemaking was extremely slow.  A good chunk of the show itself was simply just the characters bantering over whether making a game was a good idea or not really felt like a hinderance because not a lot really happened during the slow beginning and without the character banter, it probably wouldn't have been as enjoyable as it was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, Saekano had a very interesting story idea as its basis.  It played off of the idea of harem without truly having a genuine harem, the show was funny on account of it poking fun at the harem genre, and it brought in the process of serious doujinshi making, something that I don't think before this has been done in animated form.  While it did have a slow start and has an unfinished story, the show by itself is enjoyable and well worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Pokes fun at the harem genre\\n\r\n+ Talks about a different medium of otaku culture\\n\r\n-  Slow buildup for main plot\\n\r\n-  Unsatisfying ending\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.21/10): Similar to the story, Saekano manages to do the same degree of genre parodying, with practically every character being a parody version of the character troupe that they were based off of.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, we have Tomoya Aki, the main protagonist of Saekano.  As a character played by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, channeling more of a Sora/Arata sort of character, Tomoya is a character who is very focused and passionate about his tastes.  As an Otaku, any form of work that he sees that appeals to him is something that he will defend with his night.  Over the course of the series, we see Tomoya as a character driving towards his goal of creating a game, putting in time and effort, even helping his circle members with their other projects, just so he can create the game that he wants to bring to the world based on a 3-D girl that he wants to turn into a heroine.  As far as development goes, Tomoya more or less gets his from the experience as a circle leader, but personality-wise, he doesn't really change all that much.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the two main girls in the series.  First, we have Eriri Spencer Sawamura, the blond twin-tailed girl who represents the tsundere childhood friend troupe.  Contributing to the group as the artist (as well as being an 18+ doujin author whose works belong on Fakku), Eriri is a girl that sort of breaks the troupe by really not being all that tsundere while turning her twintail hairstyle into two very effective whips.  And then, there's Utaha Kasumigaoka, the LN author who is the girl who serves as the long, black haired senpai with a cool, levelheaded attitude who speaks in a harsher manner while also possessing slight yandere undertones when jealous.  Over the course of the series, you get to understand a little more about these two characters, thus providing their development and some explanation as to why they associate themselves with someone like Tomoya.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have who I think by far is the most interesting character in this series, Megumi Kato.  As the girl that Tomoya wishes to base his game off of, Kato is a girl that is rather interesting in anime period.  Compared to the rest of the girls in this series, and female characters overall, Kato's personality comes off as rather plain, passive, easily accepting, and albeit somewhat boring.  She doesn't have a defined character troupe to tie her to, and I think that's what makes her such an interesting character.  By breaking the bounds of character archtypes and having Kato be a character who is like her, the show really draws in this idea because of the sheer irony of her being the \"main heroine\" while not having any sort of heroine qualities that make up any given romcom.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile the main cast of characters really do shine in their own right as far as the show goes, the side cast of Saekano really leaves something to be desired.  More importantly are the characters Izumi and Michiru, characters representing the little sister and cousin troupes.  What really bugs me about these characters is the fact that the show makes them out to be more important than they actually are.  By featuring them on the same level as the other girls, one can assume that their character importance would be near or at the same level, correct?  Wrong.  The show doesn't really utilize these last two members of the so-called \"harem\" (since Saekano really doesn't capitalize on that idea.) and are really just booted to the last couple episodes with Michiru getting a similar treatment to Eriri and Utaha via a condensed version.  It kinda bugs me more on the fact that the conversations that go on between these characters really are golden moments in this show, and having more players to the mix really would've made this show a little bit better.  \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there are also other side characters in this show that really play little to no importance.  Because for the most part you'll be watching the ones listed above, there really isn't much to say about the side cast.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Interesting troupe-breaking characters\\n\r\n+  Good development for main characters\\n\r\n-   Side cast really isn't interesting or used much\\n\r\n-   Some characters could've been handled better\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.45/10): The art for this Saekano is a very...interesting pick for A-1.  The art is very light colored and bright, giving off a sort of slice of life feel to anyone who is watching it.  That being said though, it looks to me that several other animation studios seemed to influence the animation, which I find somewhat odd.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to just general animation, the show hosts a very odd form of visual imagery, utilizing a colored sheen over a character or body.  In addition, the show also uses odd angles and closeups on certain areas which for some reason reminds me of Akiyuki Shinbou's work (no head tilts though).  While this isn't bad per say, it's just something I wanted to mention because I didn't expect something like that to come out from this show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for flaws though, the animation does have a couple choice moments and things that don't sit well with me.  For one thing, the designs of the girls.  Similar to the girls in La Fruit de grisaia, every female in this anime features a red highlight around their eyelashes, thus giving them a strange rash look.  This is really more of a personal complaint because I just find it odd to see a random red line around a girl's eyes.  In addition, there's one specific scene that doesn't sit well with me, which is mostly due to the fact that Tomoya's hair isn't colored in, leaving him with white hair for about a minute.  Yeah, that's not normal.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, the music for the anime isn't really something that I would call incredible.  The OP and ED are good tracks and can become memorable as they feature a happy-go-lucky tune to them, but I can't in good conscience say that they deserve more credit than what I give them.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good art\\n\r\n+  Decent music stylings\\n\r\n-   Couple mistakes with the art  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (8.39/10): While Saekano wasn't as stellar as it could've been, it was still a great show nonetheless.  With its use of genre parodying and storyline, the show managed to keep me hooked in week after week with laughter spent at the characters own point outs on any given cliche scenario.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat did I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nFor one thing, I liked the characters of this series a lot.  They were all likable in their own way, and their interactions with one another were something that I enjoyed seeing with every passing minute.  In addition, the fact that they played off on the troupes that they were based off of was funny enough for me to enjoy laughing along with whatever was going on.  The story while wasn't complete, did give insight into doujinshi and Comiket (for those who didn't know), and overall, made the show an enjoyable experience.  They also reference other anime in it in Tomoya's soom such as SAO figmas, an Amaburi LN, and an Oreimo poster just to name a few.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe slow start in conjunction with some underused characters really put me in a bit of a sour mood.  A lot of good could've come from just having the characters come in a little earlier and a little bit faster beginning few episodes because quite a few areas in the later parts of the series felt rushed, leading to a very glaring art issue.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a casual watch that pokes fun at harem, watch either this, or Noucome.  If you don't want fanservice, then just watch this.  Saekano is an enjoyable series that doesn't really takes itself too too seriously, diving headfirst into the world of doujinshi whilst making fun of the harem genre altogether.  It really is an enjoyable experience because not a lot of anime poke fun at the cliches and troupes that do exist in anime, so personally, I feel like anything that's like this really deserves to be watched.  Plus, you get to see awesome characters banter with each other, what's not to love?\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.49/10",

            "content": "Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata is a nice surprise of the Winter season. It is one of these anime that always made me lose my patience when an episode finishes its airing. It is something that I want more. So far, I could not find a translated manga or light novel source, so it remains a mystery after the anime unless I bought its non-translated ones and find a translator.\r\nThe anime has its \u2018special\u2019 episode aired a week before the anime series started airing. It contains fan-service galore, so if you do not want to ruin your experience in watching, I suggest you watch it afterthe anime. But if you do not mind, watch it before, both works for different people.\\n\\n\r\nWe all have dreams that we want to pursue. At least, that is how the protagonist Tomoya wants to. He is a typical high-school otaku who works part-time jobs to pay for anime merchandises. One day, he gazed at a beautiful \u2018heroine\u2019 on top of a hill. He realised that she was actually a classmate in his class, Katou, but from then on he wants to achieve something - making a visual novel with Katou being as the heroine. He had several connections such as childhood friend Eriri, who secretly makes H-doujins and Utaha, who writes well-sold novels. They formed up a doujin circle for the purpose of making this light novel Tomoya wanted.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this is not an ordinary anime where you will see a group of people making progress, and in the end they finished it and sell it in the event they chose. No, that is too boring to watch. I would say that the developing of the visual novel is not the main focus in anime, but rather how Tomoya is going to get his own circle to work without any conflicts. From time to time, there is a situation that a character gets quite emotional and Tomoya approaches to be with her for a while. Indeed, one episode by another, the visual novel is being developed but it is not direct to show the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the anime interesting is the funny comedy. Generally, the anime plays a number of tropes from the Japanese pop culture like visual novels and manga. They were never forced as the comedy coming from the characters\u2019 interactions flow by. At least, the anime knows how to separate funny and emotional moments. Yes, sometimes there are a few emotional moments which are not rushed at all.\\n\\n\r\nI do not really spot any problems in the story, but the ending towards the anime is too open, making the story quite incomplete. Overall, the story has nice pacing and development without any hiccups. It is relatively easy to understand the story and characters, since the story has not pull \u2018deep symbolisms\u2019 behind, so it is a good story for everyone of different interests to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, despite having similar characteristics from your everyday harem anime, are interesting to look at after a while. For starters, they do not really force themselves to act like the counterparts. There are times when they feel differently of their personalities as well. So far, we got the tsundere Eriri who was a childhood friend with Tomoya for quite a long time, a cold-headed Utaha who just speaks so maturely in front of him, and a plain Katou that has no outstanding qualities yet win the hearts of a large part of the audience. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some character development in most of them, generally on the times when Tomoya is with a certain character. Even Tomoya has some as he learns more about the girls. But eventually, I would love to see more since the ending was too open. The story also shows the characters\u2019 pasts and how they are being influenced into their personalities now. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation has been quite a charm in this anime. It may sure seem normal to you, but there is a finer detail that the studio has given to make the anime more real and beautiful. The sceneries are nice-looking and great for settling the mood. I love the vibrant colourful palette they use to show a bright and happy feeling. There is one place that I like to mention which is Tomoya\u2019s room, where there are a lot of real references through posters, novels and figurines. The character designs are very gorgeous, like they stand out a lot from the rest of this anime season. Quite a number of details have been added to the designs to make it real. Also, the facial expressions are well-done, whether on comic relief or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe fan-service is classy. For once, I do not think that it was not forced to ruin the story. I had started to realise that there were more of it towards the second half of the anime, but I must say that the scenes are perfectly done and have made a lot of the audience feel happy.\\n\\n\r\nYet again this anime has proven to have awesome songs. I definitely loved the opening and ending songs which are one of my favourites this season. Luna Haruna sings Kimiiro Signal in the opening to portray a more cheerful feeling the anime has, while Miku Sawai sings Colorful. that has a more emotional but positive mindset. They have a meaning behind, I swear. The background music is great, I like how different varieties of tracks are used to bring effect of the mood in the scenes. Voice acting is well-done, since I love how they try to match the characters\u2019 personalities well.\\n\\n\r\nSaekano is one anime that everyone should totally watch because it is has a great story, great characters and nice animation. I have certainly enjoyed the anime from start to end, and I really hope there is a second season.",

            "content": "Saekano, at first glance, may seem like a typical harem/fanservice filled series where the main otaku character can flourish himself in. However, it honestly took me by surprise and vastly exceeded my expectations, especially how the show knows how to subtly and implicitly convey its awareness of the current anime industry and its current clich\u00e9d trends. \r\nThe characters of the show is one of its most entertaining aspects. In a mere 12 episodes, the show is able to characterise its characters and develop them to a satisfactory extent, In particular the girls, and their distinct personalities are the foundation of the show itself. There isEriri, the hotblooded tsundere blonde twin-tailed girl who manifests the clich\u00e9d childhood friend troupe. She is the doujinshi artist of the group, and can't let her pride lose. Then there is the seductive (potential fanservice ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)) girl who is considered a master at scenario/story writing called Utaha. Michiru, the purple-haired tomboy musician-like girl who also is mainly there to aid fanservice, is also another childhood friend of Tomoya...since birth. Its ironic because she only did really appear in the final few episodes (lol~). There is also the unique monotonous cute girl, Kato, who is just so clueless a lot of the time, but in a hilarious and original way. Her voice acting is also worth noting as it is one of the best monotoned voices for a female character in recent times, and its not boring in anyway, but compelling. She may have trouble being expressive, but she is one of the girls who understands Tomoya well, the main central protagonist. Finally, you have Tomoya, the otaku with a strong enthusiastic personality and passion for producing his dating sim with his circle of friends (haremm). His drive to successfully produce a dating sim allows the story to progress and its his determination to create a great one that makes him entertaining to be with. All the voice acting for the characters undoubtedly aid the characters personalities and their traits, and make them not only a great interacted cast, but one with synergy. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is definitely, a great addition to the show's substance and makes it visually pleasing to look at in contrast to most shows of the similar genre. A-1 without a doubt made Saekano a hit, rather than a miss with the stellar, standing-out artwork and visuals. The character designs as well is a major plus as the females of the show all look different from one another, and are ineffably, just nice to look at. The near-shaft level art carries the show if you don't really enjoy the characters, but as the cast is so diverse with each unique girl, you probably will have one \"best girl\" (team kato??? team utaha? no? no?).\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't really that unique or stellar, its just there to suit appropriate scenes and juxtapose the silence. The OP song however, I found it quite suiting visually as it depicts each character in the works, and the song itself 'Kimiiro Signal' by Luna Haruna sounds pretty nice and is addicting for me personally. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata was without a doubt, a very fascinating and entertaining show to sit down, and watch. Although the story wasn't anything spectacular or original, the melange of characters with their varied personalities is what makes the show truly enjoyable, and along with their thrive to successfully construct a dating sim, the audience is able to connect to the cast and feel their ecstasies, and struggles. The fanservice is not the main focus, the characters are, and if you can get past that major intervening obstacle, you will certainly enjoy this show for what it is.\\n",

            "content": "A series like Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata (Saekano) doesn\u2019t really need much of an explanation judging by the cover content. There are at least four girls and a guy in the far background. Anime logic dictates that the show is more or less a harem. And if you\u2019ve come to that conclusion, you\u2019re not wrong. The series is indeed a harem with some generic romance tropes thrown in. However, there are some clever angles to approach the series as more of a social commentary. What I mean is that the show has far more dialogues than skin showing and indeed, it strives to accomplish thatwith its set premise \u2013 to create a visual novel based on a girl that our main protagonist met during Spring vacation.\\n\\n\r\nBased off a light novel of the same name, the show has a rather dexterous title. Translated as \u2018How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend\u2019, the series plays around with itself quite a bit. With its many jokes in multilayer form and never ending generic tropes, initial impression of the series could be a downer. Indeed, my expectations weren\u2019t very high especially after the lascivious prequel that debuted before the main series.  Although the series follows a lot of the trends with typical harem series with no specialty, Saekano does pull out a few tricks out of its hat that can be exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the show is actually pretty straightforward. We have this normal guy named Tomoya who is a self-proclaimed otaku complete with the nerdy glasses and average looks. During a Spring vacation, he encounters a beautiful girl named Megumi who he later realizes is his classmate. With a mindset goal set to create a visual novel based on her, he creates a doujin (look this up on Google if you don\u2019t know what it is) circle called \u2018Blessing Software\u2019. Essentially, the series introduces our main male protagonist Tomoya and his room gives viewers the impression that he is quite a hardcore otaku. Just look at his room! He\u2019s got anime posters from popular anime TV series, collectible figures, and stashes on top of stashes of manga/light novel laying around the room. It gives us enough judgement to see that he is unpopular with his classmates, a sharp contrast to his childhood friend Eriri Spencer Sawamura. As a Japanese/British student, she joins Tomoya as an illustrator. Then, there\u2019s ice beauty Utaha Kasumigaoka who also becomes part of Blessing Software. Viewed as an intelligent and haughty girl, we have this weird combination of characters mixed together to craft this piece of artistic work. And who can forget Megumi? Without her, their project would be dead because she is literally their model and mascot. Unlike Eriri or Utaha, she is easily a normal girl who hardly stands out in class. Not so different from Tomoya right? Later on, we also get an athletic girl with a music talent joining the series named Michiru. Because without music, their project would also be deaf to ears. \\n\\n\r\nNow that we have a general mindset of the characters, there\u2019s an understanding that probably formulated in your mind. The collective cast of our characters are from the oldest tricks in the book. We have Eriri, the twin-tailed tsundere, the cold collective beauty Utaha, the average all around (except for looks) Megumi, and music talent Michiru. This is the pretty much the basic ingredients to make a harem. But fortunately, the show also has an intention to make a visual novel based on a \u2018boring girlfriend\u2019. It mixes humor and peril in almost a same category as some scenes become dangerously absurd while others can be surprisingly funny. Regardless, the show adapts the concept of visual novel making and actually makes this the main part of the story. While romance becomes involved as well, most of it is subtle where Tomoya remains oblivious to the girls\u2019 advances. For the story itself, a large part comes from the members\u2019 roles. Eriri is the illustrator of their project so she is in charge of the artwork. Several episode shows her as a dedicated worker who really does embrace her role as an artist. Some of her flashbacks with Tomoya also shows their relationship as the classic childhood type where they seem to be on good terms. Except for one thing, she is prone to emotional outbursts in the present. One particular episode focuses on her and Tomoya\u2019s rebuilding of their relationship where she promises to make Tomoya see the good side of her. While this relationship focus is important, it also becomes catering to watch with how much the show goes into diehard mode to flesh out her personality. This doesn\u2019t strive far with Utaha either as her relationship with Tomoya also gets insightful focus in some particular episodes. Playing the role of a writer, she is in charge of the scripts which is pivotal for their project\u2019s storyline. Unfortunately, her role sells mostly as an attractive girl with some insecurities similar to Eriri. Unlike her though, she is more confident in her abilities and looks as she has sometimes tries to seduce Tomoya passively.  What does this all mean? Literally, she is more like the classic Yamato Nadeshiko but with a more aggressive personality. It doesn\u2019t help with the fact that Tomoya seems constantly distracted by her sex appeal or her own \u201cstrategies\u201d. (See this cell phone picture for a general idea: http://imgur.com/0qvIvl7)\\n\\n\r\nNow, here\u2019s a roadblock to Tomoya\u2019s relationship: Megumi. She is portrayed as a normal girl with a straightforward personality but very kind to her friends. Unlike the rest of their group, she doesn\u2019t have knowledge of the otaku world until Tomoya influences her with his eroge game collection. While the series often plays around with the generic tropes, Megumi and Tomoya\u2019s relationship has a surprisingly amount of delicate connection. Both of them doesn\u2019t stand out much in class but they seem to relate to each other as the series goes on. As a dialogue heavy show like this with a lot of talk, she also fleshes out Tomoya\u2019s character the most. This is demonstrated during their date in one particular episode as well as how Tomoya uses her as a model for their game. It shows a more honest side of the series with her in because she is also the most normal, someone that others can relate to. Furthermore, she evokes jealousy with other girls in the case of Eriri or Utaha where we see that they aren\u2019t perfect as their classmates are disillusioned by. Unfortunately, the show has a pacing problem being a 1 cour. I honestly believe a series like this would be more suitable for a 2-cour (22 episodes). This is because Michiru, our music-athlete hybrid isn\u2019t present until much later in the series. Although she is heavily advertised in the promotional videos, key visuals, and prologue, there\u2019s little room for her part until the very end. At one point, I\u2019m sure that some people may question if she will even appear at all. To put it simply, the way the show is directed to fit her role is both underwhelming and almost in a way, irrelevant. Thankfully, she does bring out a more different side of the series as well with her tomboyish personality. \\n\\n\r\nWith our characters, the story is something I describe as less dynamic compared to the focus of our characters. Occupied by the task to complete their project, every episode depends strictly on characters\u2019 roles with their actions. Comedy seems to play a decent amount of time throughout the series as well although it can feel like simple guilty pleasure; especially in one episode with allusions to heavy sexual metaphors. There may also seem to be a displeasure with some of the rivalry throughout the series as Tomoya faces later on. It honestly feels cringe worthy with the setup as the series even chooses to focus on a minor character with little influence. Taking that aside, this show\u2019s originality isn\u2019t exactly something new. Others with otaku-based characters have been portrayed in the anime industry such as the TWGOK franchise. And unfortunately, I have to say once again that the story\u2019s pacing feels dreadful at times. It will definitely divert viewers but with deflated themes that people may have seem over and over. Even some references later on can be bothersome to indulge while the amusing self-awareness of the prologue is largely absent.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork visuals plays some key roles in the show as one of our main characters is an inspiring artist herself. However, A-1 Pictures doesn\u2019t exactly carry the show\u2019s visual quality to their fullest potential with the character designs. With some CGI-like style animation and muggy backgrounds, the show doesn\u2019t relieve a strong impression on the surface. However, character designs does have some credibility that holds in queue with our characters\u2019 personalities. For fan service, the series fleshes out more and more of it; in particular in some of the final episodes. When portrayed, it\u2019s mostly suggestive camera angles rather than going full commando. But largely coming off as average, this show\u2019s visual quality is hardly anything to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack actually has a less of an important role but does have its key moments in some episodes. This is inspired by the character interactions with a variety of emotions that can only be made possible through the effective timing of its OST. Fortunately, it does pull it off despite how average it sounds. The OP and ED songs also has an upbeat and noticeable amount of creativity with its coordination. Michiru, the music talent of the group also demonstrates her ability in the music department with a fluid degree. The key part of the show is still character voices as that hits the ace in the hole. Every main female character plays their role with solid motivations and truthful to the show\u2019s intentions. Perhaps sometimes, it\u2019s almost too evident by their interactions with Tomoya. Unfortunately, there\u2019s nothing really good to comment on Tomoya\u2019s voice. He\u2019s the typical otaku with a dull voice mannerism that I think people would find hard to make friends with.\\n\\n\r\nSo what else to say? The show isn\u2019t by anything special although does have some clever ways to entertain its audience. Whether it\u2019s the character relationships or their storyline project, Saekano is still a harem show with the usual generics. Despite this though, there\u2019s a sense of creativity when we see characters\u2019 role play out throughout the show that is hard to take eyes off of. With the amount of jokes, references, and almost never ending comedy, the show is a mixed bag. And that's just the first route.\\n",

            "content": "When i first started watching this anime ,i really didn't know what to expect from it and it surprised me at first. Saenai is not like your average romance comedy anime. Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata gives a really refreshing new and unique plot that keeps its viewers wanting more at the end of every episode.\r\nThe name of the anime \"Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata\" itself means how to train a girl to be a herione. Right away you would see that Saenai has a really unique plot which very little anime can relate to out there. The story starts of with Tomoya Aki, a high schoolteenage boy who is a major otaku/shut-in ,who doesn't know much besides video games and dating sims. On one faithful day he meets the girl of his dreams. He later finds out that the girl goes to the same school as him. With the help of his childhood friend Sawamura Eriri Spencer and his senpai Kasumigaoka Utaha. He decides to make a dating sim based off of the girl he met that day.\\n\\n\r\nAlright first of all i want to give mad props to A-1 Pictures for the amazing art in the anime. There was never a part in the anime where the art was lacking, everything in this anime was drawn beautifully, the colors to represent the mood, the special details for different characters , simply amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending soundtrack are also amazing , it sets the tone for the anime and it is just right. A big thing worth mentioning , Matsuoka Yoshitsugu and Kayano Ai are 2 of the voice actors in the anime. They're one of the best ones around imo and you might remember the duo in other animes such as Sakurasou and no game no life where they were both also voicing the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are all made quite well.Every character fills their role perfectly and are all unique in their own way. The girls in the anime can melt your heart away making you want fall in love with them. The only problem i had with the characters is that there wasn't enough character development, Which is understandable considering the fact that it was a 12 episode series\\n\\n\r\nThis anime overall is very good and it was made exceptionally well, the only thing that i did not like was the fact that it was only a 12 episode series, but other then that this anime was very refreshing with its interesting plot and unique characters.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Alright here is my second attempt at a review for an Anime.\r\nOne day, our main protagonist happens to lay his eyes on a girl that just steals his otaku heart. He decides to make her the magnificent heroine in his game and proceeds to gather the necessary people. However, unbeknownst to him, everyone who decides to help him have their own reasons for being there.\r\n7:Story\r\nThe story is not anything new. Here you'll see a group of friends try to make a dream come true in the form of a game and learn the hardships of going through such a process. Is it a bad story?No, but it won't make you go \"WOW\" either.\\n\\n\r\n8:Art\\n\r\nThe art is fine. I think the coloring might be overly bright during the anime. There also seems to be a mini-blush on almost on the girls and I found it unnecessary to their facial expressions more than half the time. Overall, I wouldn't expect anything less from this kind of art style in this kind of time.\\n\\n\r\n7:Sound\\n\r\nThe music isn't amazing but it isn't entirely bad either. I only happen to be really into one the insert songs. You shouldn't expect to be hyped or have any emotions elicited from just the music.\\n\\n\r\n9:Char\\n\r\nThe characters are done pretty well in my opinion. I enjoy the tantrums thrown by the main character because they don't seem whiney. I also enjoy oblivious people. You can expect something good from the girls too but at their core follow a generic formula. Overall, it is the relationships and banter between the character that really shine here. What they do for one another or with one another is what I believe makes the core of this show.\\n\\n\r\n7:Enjoyment\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show but I felt there was very little build up in the first season. Even with a nice pacing I felt the series could've done a lot more than just that. I skipped the OP and EDs very often because I found them boring to listen to after 3-4 times. I was also expecting a sort of romance but that element isn't very serious in this show.\\n\\n\r\n7: Overall (7.6)\\n\r\nThe show deserves a second season and really needs a second season. I felt that the entire series was an pleasant introduction to everything the show was going to offer. This first season will leave you wanting more and I would certainly recommend it to the average anime watcher.",

The storyline had the potential to be a really good anime and would really connect with the viewers who would obviously share the same interests conveyed in the characters such as anime, manga and so on. \r\nHowever the title of \"How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend\" soon became known to me as \"How to Make a Boring Anime.\" At times, I found the show to be very dialogue heavy, which I usually don't mind however it was often just waffling on. I was always waiting for something to happen when i watched the newly released episodeeach week, but I always felt like there wasn't too much development, and if there was, it was too predictable. \\n\\n\r\nWatching this anime series quickly became a chore rather than for my own enjoyment, as I was really trying hard to like this anime but couldn't. I would sometimes become so bored during the episodes towards the end of the series that I actually skipped through scenes as I found them to be excruciatingly long. Of course, I went back to re-watch the episodes, just to ensure that I felt the same as when i first watched it, and my view has not changed.\\n\\n\r\nI feel bad that i didn't like this anime as I've seen many great reviews and many of my friends have said they enjoyed the series but, alas, I found the series was lacking and I was overall disappointed with this series. I'm not a massive fan of Harem anime to begin with but i don't feel my dislike of Harem skewed my view of the anime, because even I felt like the Harem in this anime could have been done a whole lot better.\\n\\n\r\nI could go into further detail about what I don't like about this anime but I just wanted to cover the main points.\\n\\n\r\nAs for what i did like, even though she was labelled as \"The Boring Girlfriend\", Megumi was my favourite character and I liked the connection she and Tomoya had.

            "content": "Saekano is easily one of the best harem romcom anime that i've watched in years. From the creator of the very good White Album 2 (which also needs a second season badly), this is one of those shows that keeps on surprising you with every episode. Even now that i've finished it, i still feel that i didn't give it enough credit. Almost as if the show is begging me to rewatch it because it has some hidden layers that i ended up missing on my first watch. It's kinda hard to explain, but i always get the feeling that Saekano manipulates the viewer intoliking it more than what you expected to. \\n\\n\r\nIn a way the show is a lot like its main heroine - paradoxical as it may be, there's an innocent, almost childlike attempt at manipulating the viewer, almost as if it's hiding its true nature, teasing and baiting us to make wrong assumptions about it. You know how kids cry to make us do what they want? I feel the same way towards this series. It's actually a very puzzling yet interesting feeling.\\n\\n\r\nIt's very meta, with lots of otaku references and humor. Even in the way the plot progresses, there's always a huge awareness regarding romcom tropes and even the haremettes (aside from the main heroine, which is truly something else, something that i have never seen in this genre yet, that's how special she is) start off as complete (at least apparently) walking tropes. Hell, even without watching you can tell the own premise is meta as f*ck. But it really works here because the writer is completely aware of all that! The thing is, Saekano really knows how to work through what is clich\u00e9 and formulaic. And what's really great about the show is that it is able to transform said tropes/clich\u00e9s into something rather good and almost unique. The pacing is also very good for a LN adaptation and both the direction and animation is also excellent, with a lot of attention put into little details that make the series all the more enjoyable. I must say that A-1 did a really good job here.\\n\\n\r\nThe bottomline is, it's actually easy to dismiss this as just one more silly harem anime that you see in every season, especially if you take the first episode (which was full of fanservice and generic harem antics) at face value. But it's certainly not that kind of show, and of that i assure you. Or better yet, it is that kind of show without not actually being that kind of show. Confusing, right? \\n\\n\r\nBut it will definitely make sense by the time you finish watching it. Moreover, it must also be said that Saekano, in its usual 4th wall-breaking scenes, often drops some very important, plot-related bombs, so once again, with that bizarre, feigned innocence of his, almost as if it's asking you not to take it too seriously, ends up surprising you and urging you to pay attention to the tiniest pieces of dialogue, mainly because amidst all the silliness, there's always a clear intention or hidden seriousness that you probably won't even notice if you let the show fool you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a clever harem romcom, with lots of great humor and genuinely likable cast and plot, this show is for you.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nCreating content is an interesting notion. Someone sets aside time to mold, craft, or piece together objects in an attempt to have their cohesion bring about a finalized product. And these objects take on a variety of forms. For instance, this very review is content, where the objects are words and the product is a review. Architects work with wood, chefs work with ingredients, and painters work with paints. Visual novels, too, are a type of content. They require a plot, artwork, music, and coding, all working in unison, to make a game that is worthyof being played. But as Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata shows, sometimes it isn't the objects that are difficult to work with but the people behind them that are.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nSaekano (as it will be known from here on out) stars Tomoya Aki, a completely average high school guy. While at the bottom of a steep hill, he sees atop it the figure of a girl. Just then, his imagination sparks and the idea for creating the greatest visual novel of all-time has begun.\\n\\n\r\nOne absolutely cannot talk about Saekano without first discussing its meta level. It sounds ridiculous, but the phrase \"that's so meta\" doesn't do this anime justice. The show revels in this fact, and refuses to leave any form of meta-ness untouched. Besides just being self-referential, the show: has dialogue that \"unintentionally\" matches the current shot, contains fourth-wall breaking moments, and cliche events that all standard romances follow. But Saekano doesn't stop there, either. For it also parodies the tropes that these romances (and harems) capitalize on. For example, the leader of the harem has every girl clamoring for him yet he shows literally zero interest towards them; each of the girls is stereotypical yet simultaneously not (Utaha is a \"kuudere\" but secretly a \"yandere,\" Eriri is a \"tsundere\" but a childhood friend, etc.); and the problems that surface are not just one-way streets -- they personally involve both Tomoya and the girl of choice. In this way, the show is capable of poking fun or heading in a multitude of directions that at first glance seem quite tired but later turn out to be surprisingly refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nBut where Saekano begins to dip somewhat is precisely with those aforementioned problems. The show is essentially split into the \"girl of the week\" arc format; in other words, the anime revolves around getting each of the girls to join Tomoya's circle in order to create his soon-to-be masterpiece. But as has already been talked about, Saekano is a master of the meta. That is its element. So when it goes outside of its comfort zone, when it diverges away from what it does so well, it starts to falter. The emotions that ensue with any of the girls -- be it Utaha, Eriri, or Hyoudou -- can't match up with its foundation. Utaha's ethical dilemma, Eriri's impassioned guilt, and Hyoudou's personal acceptance are supposed to feel dramatic or endearing, but their existence only aids in making the experience more \"well-rounded.\" And the meta aspect of the show isn't the only obstacle that prevents these more serious events from being meaningful. The show is rampant in sexualization of the girls and various types of humor. The meta-ness supports these facets, so when the show moves away from its meta roots, the sex and comedy is lost, too.\\n\\n\r\nJumping off of this idea, the thematic presence of Saekano is often lacking as well. What the show attempts to get across is the notion of \"facing reality.\" In essence, there are certain facts that people need to come to terms with before they can truly begin to move forward in their lives. For Tomoya and Kato, this kind of thinking isn't present: they know what kind of person they are and aren't afraid to act in such a way. The haremettes, however, see such messages. Utaha learns not to be held down by her past, Eriri understands that she isn't the best, and Hyoudou realizes her true self. But again, such themes are clouded by everything else the show tries to be, namely a meta, sexy, and funny harem. Furthermore, each of these resolutions comes about rather quickly -- especially in the form of tiny flashbacks -- so their overall meaning is generally lost. Especially so when the show reverts back into its original mode.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the anime is generally quite pleasing to see. It mostly sticks to Tomoya's room, certain classrooms, or regularly-used locations, but it isn't afraid to branch out from time to time. Anime conventions are visited, as are parks, clubs, and malls, each of which contains a relative amount of detail. Like most shows, though, the art isn't wholly captivating or special, but serves its purpose. Also of note are the semi-rare occurrences of multi-colored shots for stylistic effect, and the often employed camera work. This usually involved panning motions -- to \"check out\" the girls in different positions -- or close-ups of the chest, face, and butt -- to \"accentuate\" a girl's features -- both of which were used to nice effect.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are good as well. Utaha's red, captivating eyes, Eriri's yellow twin-tails in the morning but tomboy look at night, and Hyoudou's all purple, all sexy design came off as rather pleasing to see. And given that the girls are usually the focus, this was definitely a plus in its favor.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, actual animation hovered somewhere above average. Besides bouncy bosoms and benign bucking, the show would incorporate minute facial twinges, hair flow, and other normal movements. At times, the characters would remain static, but this was mostly during prolonged talking segments. The previously mentioned camera work would help to alleviate these moments, and thus the animation always seemed to be \"going.\"\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to harems, there is always quite the cast to talk about. Here, attention is given to the most relevant three: Eriri, Utaha, and Kato.\\n\\n\r\nEriri, anonymously famous for her work as an \"h-doujinshi\" artist, is classified as a \"tsundere:\" she's harsh but her inner kindness comes through at certain points. She's prideful, jealous, and quite emotional; in short, she's entirely childish and acts accordingly. This makes sense, too, given her childhood friend status. And as Tomoya lays out clearly for her, she isn't as good as she thinks she is, both as an artist and as a friend. Her constant clashing and arrogant attitude made her into a girl who was entirely intolerable. But following her prince and princess moonlit escape, she softens slightly, becoming more respectful towards her longstanding rival and friendlier towards her newfound coworker. While she still doesn't like to be one-upped by those around her, she no longer takes it out on others but instead uses it on herself to drive her to be that much greater of a person.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly famous but a lot sleepier, Utaha embraces two separate archetypes: the \"kuudere\" and the \"yandere,\" that which is cool and that which is insane, respectively. She's generally composed, yet isn't afraid to be flirtatious or crass. Known to call the boy of her affection \"Mr. Ethical,\" why the nickname exists comes to fruition: his rejecting of her literary \"advances.\" It's this sentiment that she latches on to. She went from zero to hero in the writing world thanks to Tomoya, and thus her life since has nearly always been about him. From her works to her feelings, she had him on her mind. And therefore it is only appropriate that through him she comes to balance the life she's led. She learns to acknowledge the past, not let it control you; enjoy the present and what it offers; and move onward to a future that makes not only makes yourself but also everyone around you happy. Again, like Eriri, her development doesn't fully quash her former behavior; Utaha still pines after her crush and flips between her personalities. But now, she isn't so distant. Rather, she begins to include others, from Eriri to Kato to Hyoudou and to even herself, in the activities that surround her.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most important cast member is actually the one \"seen\" the least. And that is Kato, the average, normal, everyday girl that coincidentally stumbles onto the scene. When thinking about her character, there isn't anything else to her than what has already been said; she's nice and quiet. That's it. But that's the point. She isn't meant to be some grandiose figure whose personality overshadows everyone else. She isn't designated to have some tragic backstory or hidden feature. This is to fall in line with the meta that the anime boasts. In other words, in an anime like Saekano, the main love interest is as dull and as real a person can be. Utaha, Eriri, and Hyoudou are (obviously) the complete opposite. They're vibrant, both in personality and demeanor. They're talented in the ways of writing, art, and music, respectively (Kato has nothing, and even more than that she's learning to program, a relatively boring job). And they're each actively vying for Tomoya's gaze. Kato has none of these aspects to her, contrasting heavily with the rest of the harem goers. But it's precisely for this reason that she has the most in common with Tomoya, an equally passive, nonchalant, and regular guy.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, she does do something worthwhile. And that is act in that outsider role, the supporter, for everyone else. While she may seem to be in hiding, her influence is apparent everywhere. With Utaha, she ends her date with Tomoya; with Eriri, she gives Tomoya the idea of using visual novel \"flags;\" and with Hyoudou she unearths for Tomoya his cousin's unknown indoctrination. Meaning, when taking a step back and looking at the entire picture, the entire circle, nobody has had a greater effect on it, from initial conception to final formation, than the unremarkable Kato.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is alright. The beat can be somewhat generic and the singer at times can be rather grating on the ears. However, following the middle of the piece, the one-two-three lyrics help to make it a bit catchier, and the background singers also support the main vocalist well enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED, on the other hand, is quite good. The \"popping,\" the all-over-the-place pacing in the singing, and super catchy lyrics make it quite pleasant to listen to, both in and out of the show. The random assortment of sound effects throughout also make it that much more fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack is, more or less, fine, teetering on bad. The tracks themselves fit the anime, but aren't particularly impressive in terms of sound or composition. Some are jokey, with their dainty instruments and tone -- used during those similarly comedic times. Others try to be more emotional, with heavier emphasis on piano. All seem to lack a certain level of attention.\\n\\n\r\nGetting back on track, though, the voice-acting is way above average for many of the cast. Special shout-outs are in order for: Ai Kayano as Utaha for her collected way of speaking, Saori Oonishi as Eriri for her pronunciation of Utaha's name, and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Tomoya for his usual screaming.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nOut of everything airing this season, this one was able to make me laugh the most. The nicely timed jokes, the fun characters, and the girls' \"romance\" -- the blushing, the yearning, and the quips between each other -- always had me chuckling during an episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when I wasn't smiling, I was treated to some rather well-done fan-service. Many of the girls are given stunning physiques, and the anime lets you see as many sides to them as possible. Nakedness, sexual innuendos, and lewdness are the norm, and I enjoyed watching it all.\\n\\n\r\nSaenai Heroine no Sodatekata may be mired in meta, but it's a tad bit more than that. With nice animation, a good cast of characters, and enough sexiness to satiate any palate, this harem offers more than just a well-done visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, master of meta, lame issues, clouds its own theme\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, nice art style, good character designs, above-average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Utaha and Eriri are good, Kato is great, and the rest are okay\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, great VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, lots of laughs, fun \"romance,\" and sexy fan-service\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata began as a series of light novels by Maruto Fumiaki. It's also had multiple manga and, in 2015, A-1 Pictures decided to do an anime version. It's a harem comedy series, like Love Hina, OreImo, Sekirei and some of the other series I've been asked to review and really disliked. Will this be the first harem series I do a full review of that gets a decent score, or will that wait until someone asks me to look at Ranma \u00bd? Let's find out. \r\nStory: \r\nWe open with our protagonist, Blandon, picking up a girl's beret after it blows away. Thisinspires Blandon. You see, Blandon is an otaku who's only interested in 2-d girls. As such, this scene straight out of a bad romantic comedy anime inspires him to begin work on a galge. He decides that his heroine will be the girl he saw on the hill that day. His writer will be a light novelist he knows and the artwork will be done by his childhood friend who draws pornographic doujinshi. By sheer coincidence they all happen to be attractive girls and interested in him in spite of his lack of redeeming personality traits and plain looks. Can Blandon convince the three Blandas to join him in making his galge?\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the problems with the series. The biggest one is that it's extremely clich\u00e9d. The series likes to lampshade this fact with dialogue that points out just how trite the plot points and characterisation they're using are. Blandon even asks what's wrong with clich\u00e9s at one point, as if to challenge the audience to come up with something. Okay. I'll play your little game, Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata. \\n\\n\r\nSo, what is wrong with clich\u00e9s? Well, when you have something well written and clever with a unique style, nothing. In fact, it's impossible to write without using some. There are clich\u00e9s in Good Omens, Watchmen, Dune, Gail Simone's Secret Six and every other brilliant work. The problem is when you have a lazy, derivative series that strings together clich\u00e9s with no originality and without doing anything surprising with any of them. A series like this one, for instance. When that happens, you get a painfully dull series where every event is predictable. Every character is bland and there's no reason to care about it. You get a series that's aiming for mediocrity and nothing more. \\n\\n\r\nThe other issue I have with the series is the way the ending conflict gets resolved. It's contrived, rushed and hackneyed. The series itself does lampshade this fact because Maruto seems to think that if you lampshade how trite or stupid your developments are that that somehow makes it better. It doesn't. Not unless you actually have some subversion or some twist on the elements to make them unique. Neither of which is anywhere to be found in this series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast in this isn't bad. The biggest problem with them is that they're bland. We've got the harsh senpai, the tsundere childhood friend, the dull protagonist and some other basic tropes that don't involve any complexity. To the series credit, there's only one character who's actively annoying. In this case, it's Blandon's cousin, Blanda number five, who shows up towards the end and acts as the happy go lucky love interest type, constantly pressing herself against him in sexual ways. And to think, before that point I thought that this series might not have an incestuous love interest in the group. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs in this are pretty standard. With most of them being so generic that they look like characters I've seen elsewhere. The series also does the same eye highlighting thing as Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, resulting in the cast looking like they're wearing thick eye-liner. I will give the series credit for having some strong background details and I do like the background effects they do for the childhood flashback scenes, making everything in the background look like a child's painting and really illustrating that sense of nostalgia. The series has some problems with fan-service, featuring several scenes where one of the Blandas slowly puts her clothes on or where the focus goes to her bosom/bum while she's in a state of undress. In one particularly egregious incident, one of them decides to go into full bad 90s superhero comic mode and contorts so that you can see both at once. Her poor, poor spine. I also really hate the colour filters in this series. There are a bunch of scenes where the visuals are all tinted red or blue or some other colour for no good reason and it looks terrible. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty mediocre. To be fair to the actors, the cast is so dull and under-developed that I doubt anyone could take their dialogue and give strong performances. The worst is Yasuno Kiyono who sounds like she just doesn't care, but her character is also supposed to be boring, in a cast that's entirely made up of boring characters. So, chances are pretty high that she was directed to sound like that. Then again, I haven't heard her in anything else, except Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge which had horrendous acting. So, maybe she always sounds completely uninvested. The music is okay. Hyakkoku Hajime does just fine with it. It's certainly not on par with his work on K-on, but it's decent.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't any in this series. It would only detract from the completely boring and uninteresting dynamics between the various Blandas and Blandon. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nIn all fairness, Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata is not among the worst harem series I've ever reviewed. It's a series that aims for mediocrity through embracing clich\u00e9s and it comes close to succeeding at that. It's boring, not even remotely compelling and just tedious. However, there are a few things that do bring it down.  Primarily the ending and no, I don't care that they lamp-shaded how bad it is, & the cousin character. Which aren't enough to make the series bad, but they do weaken it. If you're looking for a completely standard harem series, you might like it. If you want something with originality, I can't recommend it. Overall, I give it a 4/10. Next week I'll take a look at El Hazard: The Magnificent World.",

            "content": "Welcome to another Robert's Too Late Review! Today we are going to be covering both Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata and Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata flat as they share what I would consider a single plotline. Read the synopsis, beware spoilers, and if you want to go in blind, I saw give it a few episodes and decide if the humor is there for you, so recommended with reservations. Will the circle make the RTRL wall (and a geometric mess?) Read on!\r\nStory: 6\r\nThis is the story of a hardcore nerd guy wanting to make the ultimate dating sim. In his attempts to do this, he recruitsa very popular up and coming author (who also happens to be from his school) a top notch artist (also a classmate) and, according to him, fate brings him together with the perfect heroine on the street one day (who also happens to be a classmate, one that he doesn't even remember) and with him as director, Blessing Software is formed. Later his cousin, the musician is brought in and the circle is complete. They work hard, make a great game, and deal with the aftermath of what they should do next. I wanted to give the story so much higher of a score, like an 8, because it does many elements well. Yet at the same time, it throws in overblown to the point of being silly rivals and hints repeatedly at romances that never occur. The nerdy is spot on, the main guy's reactions are all humorous if over the top, but so many missed marks cause me to score the story lower. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe series looks good, and I found no flaws in the animation or colors save one: Eriri's 'vampire' tooth. Part of the time she has a single tooth hanging down and that's fine, but other times its flesh colored and just irks me to no end. However I do like the eyes, with the double circles in them, and the lines are all clean and the animation flows smoothly. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nI don't find much music of any kind I don't enjoy, but none of the openings or endings for this series did it for me. They just are boring and not ear catching whatsoever. The main guy, while being a otaku, does far too much yelling for my tastes. However I do praise Megumi's voice actress because she seems utterly unflappable, never once overreacting to anything. Not deadpan, not uninterested, just very bland, which fits her character perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nAnother section I wanted to score much higher than I did. There was a lot of potential to be had, and little to none used. For a harem-styled show, the girls spend more time fighting each other than trying to out-woo the male. Both old childhood friend Eriri and new friend Utaha seem to be intensely interested in a romantic relationship, but for the most part ignore the main man in favor of trading barbs with each other. Every blue moon there are movements where one of the two might be making moves on the guy but it always turns out to completely game related and not romantic at all. I don't even think the guy would know what to do if romance was thrown his way!\\n\\n\r\nThere is even a female musician brought in at the end of the first season that is very voluptuous and even seems to have a thing for our main man, but nothing comes of it. In fact at one point he asks her will she do it with him (meaning score the game) and she thinks he's asking for sex, weighs the pros and cons, and agrees! That's about as close to actual harem type antic we get. She never really moves on him much like that again. \\n\\n\r\nThe best female character is the 'boring' one who besides being the model for main heroine, doesn't seem to have much purpose in the circle at all. She later does learn some scripting and helps some, but for the most part she just takes up space. Yet with her unflappable demeanor she's a bit of a comedic foil to everyone else and their zany personalities. It is hinted that the main guy and her might develop a romantic relationship in seriousness, but that thread is never followed either. \\n\\n\r\nThe guy is so otaku he hurts, to the point of being embarrassing. He does have his moments when he shines, but he has just as many cringeworthy fanboy moments as well. A more measured take of the passions of otakus or the like could have been a real benefit. \\n\\n\r\nThe two bickering girls appear to have an arc at the end, but don't. The rival appears to be against our main, but end in the end isnt. It's very paint by numbers. I've said before knowing the end doesn't have to be a bad thing if you enjoy getting there. I could have enjoyed it so much more if not for so many fumbles. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment and Overall scores might seem a bit high, but I did have a good time watching the guy nerd out, as I'm a nerd myself. Your mileage might vary. I applaud they decided to do a harem without insane over the top sex references (looking at you Akeno with your finger sucking) but they left out enough to make it kind of pointless. I kept wanting the relationships to develop more, but instead we get a single flat note. Yet the humor between the nerd and the non-nerds was funny, and I will admit to laughing here and there. \\n\\n\r\nSo try a few episodes before deciding. If your nerd game is strong, you might enjoy the antics presented. If you don't understand things like buying special editions of games or why figurines are so cool (touch my Saber figure and I *will* cut you!) then you likely won't get this show. Otherwise, geek out my friends. Reserved thumbs up. Sadly no RTRL wall entries for this one.",

Anime goods and character songs will not shine if the character themselves are not enjoyable.\r\nHowever, cliches are scary things.\r\nNo matter how adorable tsunderes are, no matter how adorable megaderes are, if anything are overused, it turns into a cliche, and the more repetitive the cliche becomes, the weaker its effects become.\r\nAfter being introduced to a multitude of characters, ranging from tsundere childhood friends with blonde twintails,tongue-sharp seniors with black stockings, overly mature middle-school girls listening to whatever the main characters say and siblings/cousins with a little-too-strong attachments to the main characters, I have grown numb of the 'moeness' of characters and began to freeze my heart on the sights of heroines.\\n\\n\r\n\"And, that day, I met with destiny.\"\\n\r\n-Aki Tomoya\\n\\n\r\nSaenai Kanojo (Heroine) no Sodatekata or saekano, as will be called from this point on, is a light-novel based animation done by A-1 Pictures with the original creator as the script writer and the original illustrator as the original character designer. I have not read the light novel or the manga based on the light novel, and thus I only know the anime adaptation part of the saekano media.\\n\\n\r\nThere are absolutely no spoilers in this review, but some terms I use may indirectly suggest minor plot events.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe story centers around the main character, Aki Tomoya, on his attempt to create a game after his inspirations of meeting the girl of his dreams. Having gathered the genius writer, Kasumigaoka Utaha, and the best illustrator he knows, Sawamura Spencer Eriri, Tomoya attempts to produce the best game revolving around the meeting of the main character and the girl of his dreams.\\n\r\nAnd SHE appears! (dum-dum-dum!)\\n\\n\r\nSaekano's story itself is a mediocre one, using the cliches used in other anime to tolerable level, not introducing an unnecessarily huge plot twist to captivate the readers, which actually tends to turn them away, or capture the viewers' attention through numerous fan services, which also tends to turn them away. It does not stagger in any point of the story and follows through the general theme quite well, as a semi-harem semi-love story with a plot to create a successful game.\\n\\n\r\nThat is not to say that there are no misgivings in the story as saekano has its own downs as well. The appearance of two new characters (especially Hyodo Michiru, who appeared at episode 9) and unnecessarily excessive fan services at few episodes made the story segment of saekano to not stand out as an outstanding anime.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, considering that the anime was only twelve episodes long (excluding episode 0, which was more of an ova than a prequel) and also considering the fact that saekano covered for its late introduction of characters by giving them enough screen time when they appeared and covered for excessive fan service by progressing with the story and character development whilst also showing fan services, thereby catching two birds in one stone, the story deserves quite a praise.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nAs usual, A-1 Pictures showed how much they excelled at creating love comedies.\\n\r\nThe overall quality of animation was very good, with episode 0, 1, 2 and 3 showing enough quality to make the viewers wonder whether they were sponsored to create saekano. The character designs were flawless as Kasumigaoka Utaha's signature black stockings were animated to a worrisome level, Kato's numerous outfits were designed almost two for every episode and the illustrations shown from time to time in the game and Eriri's drawings in quality beyond expectations.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime progressed, however, the anime quality dropped significantly, with Tomoya's hair not being colored at the last episode. All the quality drops are expected to be fixed at bluray releases, but based on the tv animation that aired, the quality of episodes 4, 7 and 8 were almost questionable.\\n\\n\r\nThese were compensated, of course, by pushing the anime budget to important episodes, such as episode 3, 6 and 12, but it is difficult to give the art dimension of saekano any more than a 7.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the story and art weren't the strong point of saekano.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nKato Megumi is the most well-made, yet the most unused character I have had the chance to meet in my otaku life.\\n\\n\r\nShe has the most unique character, which is quite similar to that of a real girl's. She is not honest but not tsundere, she is fun but not a gag character, she is quiet but not emotionless, Ayanami Rei character, and she is normal but does not follow any cliche of a normal character.\\n\r\nHowever, she is, for some reason, very attachable.\\n\r\nBorrowing the line of the anime, she is adorable at times when she does things that are unlike her, but in the next line she returns to her normal, semi-invisible self who is void of what otaku culture call 'moe'.\\n\r\nShe is probably the most human-like character I have ever met.\\n\r\nThat is not to say that other characters are not lovely. Kasumigaoka Utaha shows her character as the sharp-tongued senior, Sawamura Spencer Eriri shows her tsundere qualities, but if Kato was not in this anime with the character that she has, I would have never succumbed to like this show as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not even a question. The character section deserves a 12.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nOP/ED: 5\\n\r\nPutting my personal feelings into this, since I cannot judge the opening and ending songs without putting aside my personal feelings for them, I feel like Haruna Luna, the singer for the opening and one of my favorite singers, is not particularly good at singing bright-felt songs. Her voice and excellent mood bringer is more suited for minor keys such as \"Sora wa Takaku Kaze wa Utau\" from Fate/Zero. She has been progressing in her skill at singing major keys over the years with \"Snowdrop\" and \"Ai wo Utae\" from Monogatari Series: Second Season being a hit overseas and in Oricon charts. However, her singing at the opening, \"Kimiiro Signal\" was a little less than unbearable to hear. Perhaps it was because her pitch was off at times that I felt a cringe in my eyes from time to time, but I felt like this opening was, put simply, not the best song Haruna Luna has sung.\\n\r\nThe ending was very neat and bright-felt as well, but in here, I was a little taken back at the lyricism. Since I am not Japanese and understand Japanese language very little, I do not mind the lyrics that much at any time, but the lyrics were too repetitive that I again cringe my eyes.\\n\r\nBut the songs were not the worst I've heard, and both of them were not unbearable. I didn't mind listening through it while watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOST & Insert Songs: 9\\n\r\nThe sound part of saekano actually shines at the OST and insert song, including character songs. The OST's were, as expected of a love comedy, very cheerful and simple. However, they were very wisely used that even with a simple tune of violin or some background music of a xylophone, the mood was severely affected, and thankfully in a good way.\\n\r\nInsert songs are, simply put, a good surprise. I have never been a fan of character songs, but when the character songs were used as insert songs, with their lyrics accurately portraying the moods of each heroines, I felt refreshed and liked the music. Even the songs themselves are enjoyable to hear as they have been written quite well. Kato Megumi's character song, Mb, is a song that is currently on my playlist, and I enjoy listening to the music without the accompaniment of the anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 8\\n\r\nThe heroines were cast wonderfully, and I have no comment to make about any of them. Yasuno Kiyono made a perfect portrayal of Kato Megumi as she acted by...not acting, Ai Kayano made a perfect voice for Kasumigaoka Utaha as she voiced her in the cool, calm way that she usually spoke at times, and spoke in upbeat or irritated tone when she lost her cool, and Ooishi Saori made a perfect voice for our tsundere childhood friend, Sawamura Spencer Eriri.\\n\r\nThe problem, or rather, the voice actor that I would have liked to see an improvement from was Matsuoka Yoshitsugu as Aki Tomoya.\\n\r\nHe made a great portrayal of an otaku male protagonist as he voiced passionately while talking about anime with hints of crying in his voice, while enraging at people who saw anime in a bad light and while being calm at times. However, although this was the purpose, I found his continuous gags quite irritating and found his switch from funny to serious quite unnatural. Personally, I would have liked someone with a more comical voice and yet with a more serious tone at times, such as Miyano Mamoru as he portrayed Okabe Rintarou from Steins;Gate flawlessly.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, I gave the whole sound portion a flat seven.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI have not waited a week for an anime this much ever since.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be a lie, of course, if I say that I loved every moment of every time of the anime, but it is certainly true that I have not liked a love comedy harem anime this much ever since I saw my first anime.\\n\\n\r\nI have not liked a character this much either, and I am quite surprised by how much I like Kato Megumi myself.\\n\\n\r\nQuite simply, it was a pleasurable experience. The comedies were good, the story was good, the character development and the characters themselves were fun to watch, and I have realized that this anime is worth much more attention.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't go and say this is the best anime of 2015, or even just this cour, because it is not.\\n\r\nHowever, it most definitely is the best love comedy I have watched ever since I started watching anime.\\n\r\nI guarantee that you will not be disappointed by watching this, whether you are a girl or you are a boy, whether you watch anime for story or watch it for characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt is, every bit worth watching for.",

            "content": "Dating Sims are usually a joke topic in the anime industry, in anime they're not used that in much, famous in Japan, but not outside of it. We have a show that focuses on that topic. It isn't anything original and dosen't have any tricks up its sleeve. Its just some normal harem thats fun to watch. Saekano at first seems like something filled to the brim with fanservice judging from the prologue (Episode 0), but it isn't really that. The actual show is well, okay. Its really something lighthearted and filled with dialouge'o'plenty.\r\nThe story is, normal. I don't really have to go in detailor praise or any of that shit. A guy wants to make a game, gets a bunch of female-friends to help. Sometimes the story does try to make the other characters seem, 'realistic'. When in reality all of these people are really just normal High-school students yet one is a profesional writer, one is a porn doujin artist, one is your average waifu material and one which comes in way later on in the show is someone who hates otakus and is in a band. High-school student much? The show could have made the characters at least in college, but nah, thats too original.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, are pretty average, no detail for them too, hell, they're painfully average. You have Tomo, the guy who wants to make a game and inspires people but yet is surrounded by women (no sexist statements). Utaha, the sexy yet cold writer who does the scenarios yet does semi-naughty things to the MC. Eriri, the typical tsundre who's into perverted stuff yet secretly is in love with the MC. Megumi, the typical average girl who's pretty much waifu material at best yet grows close with the MC and is probably the only one who deserves the D. Michiru, the one who hates the otaku industry yet still helps out and is somehow blind in the music she makes. I guess thats all I really need to say about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good, it gets the mood right and really sets the tune for the show and what its about. The music is pretty darn good, The OP and ED are both really well done, and skipping either does really feel bad, if you skip either then you probably have a shit taste in music (if you took that seriously you're a dumbass). The OSTs are really good and the voice acting is well done even though the MC is the voice actor of Kirito from SAO.....but either way its solid.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is fun to watch, filled with refrences, tropes and some cliches here and there. For a show mainly focused on dialouge, its really intriguing and you really can't wait week after week to see what happens. No words here too.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 7.5\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nSaekano is an intriguing show, it fits 22 episodes instead of 12, hopefully it gets a second season, if not, it should probably be with shows such as No Game No life and Btoom which are waiting for a S2. To end this review I shall quote cause why not?\\n\r\nThe show is okay and fun to watch. Its really just a lighthearted otaku comedy with its tropes.",

            "content": "\u3010 The following is a review of : Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata and Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata\u266d\u3011\r\nSaekano is a bland sauce series about a bland girl that gets chosen to be a visual novel protagonist, due to the Kirito voiced, spastic protagonist that sees Megumi from afar and has an epiphany about a VN he wants to make. It\u2019s like the creepy painter that claims that seeing a pretty girl nude will somehow burgeon a magnum opus. \r\n\t\u2022 Kirito invites Megumi to be his lead heroine. He also has an artist and a writer friend who go to the same school and just happen tobe insanely talented. Why DO they help him with his project when he has no other talents aside from being an otaku? My only answer to this is that this show is a fucking harem, so bullshit plots are almost required. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Similar to all of Nisiosin\u2019s works, every option except for the normal girl (Megumi), are beautiful prodigies within their craft. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just normal in Japan or what. I thought that after the first season, the second might go somewhere, but is ultimately very forgettable. This show primarily focuses on the appeal of pretty girls, rather than giving you a series of substance. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Much like Sword Art Online\u2019s Kirito this Kirito MK II is even blander and more of a self-insert character. Unlike SAO\u2019s Kirito, this one isn\u2019t talented at anything except for inciting useless drama and having zero usefulness to the story, except making pretty girls fight over him, while Kirito had his talent at\u2026 gaming?\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 There\u2019s the typical tsundere character and the witty Senjougahara copy-paste that has stockings and is obviously the foot fetish character. The most interesting thing for me in the series, was their strife to get their dream recognized, since I\u2019m a sucker for those kind of things and have a major passion for visual novels. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Most of the strife just links back to the tired, prevailing narrative of catty drama reminiscent of the Tenchi Muyo spats, so the struggle seems pathetic. Saekano is pretty to look at, but it\u2019s as deep as a puddle. If you have watched the anime: Nisekoi, then you\u2019ll understand how the vapidity of these two series are comparable. I give the first season on Saekano a 4/10 and the second season a 3/10.",

While not being able to find the \"perfect\" ejaculation, you often find the one that's AMAZING but when you check MyFapList the people don't agree with you and only deem the serie- I mean masturbatory session an 7-8/10? That is what SaeKano is to me. That fap session you want to say is perfect but is afraid of criticism.\r\nNow I'm the type of guy who would give Fairy Tale sh*t for having such a generic story line, but only being fun. To behonest, I'm pretty sure there are TONS of anime about an otaku male protagonist who wants to fulfill his dream of making a dojin game and accomplishes so with his harem, but the way Saekano executes said story in such a way that just has me dying with laughter. Of course, objective humor doesn't exist now does it? If this anime isn't funny to you the characters and the back stories might turn you on then (aaand we're back to fapping).\\n\\n\r\nI am convinced that every girl in this show is best girl. All of the girls usually have clear motives and everyone's end goal is usually in sync (the girls anyway). The only girl I wasn't terribly fond of was the tsundere Eriri Spencer. She seemed VERY copy and paste, but Kato made up for that. Hell, if anything just watch for Kato. People who finished this series know that specific scene that most people will fall in love with Kato.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an A-1 Pictures anime. This has A-1 Pictures quality animation. Not that top notch animation matters much in this type of show, as niche as it already is, but as A-1 usually does, produces great animation and visually stimulating backgrounds (masturbation again)\\n\\n\r\nI fell in love with the soundtrack of the show. The opening theme is meh, but holy sh*t is Aki's VA amazing. His VA is mostly known for voicing Kirito from Sword Art Online. I don't know if it's my fascination with Yukino from OreGairu or something, but I think Utaha's voice fits her character too well. Also, the second to last song played in this show, I thought it was lazy at first when I spoiled (fuck you reddit comments). This is because girls in anime aren't exactly the best singer, unless you're Hanazawa Kana or someone who voiced in Idolm@ster. However, immediately as that crowd popped I saw cheering with them holy shit my nostalgia boner was raised high.\\n\\n\r\nSaenai Heroine no Sodatekata definitely deserves a watch if you are a fan of shows like OreGairu and Inou Battle. I was left in tears of laughter after finishing this show. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT : 9/10",

The story pacing goes with the flow and it does not rush to conclusion unlike some other animes or leaving it hang. Eventhough the character developments are slow, it manages to introduce all in 12 eps. The ending was a great way to close of season 1.\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nThe art is unique and the animations were fluid through outthe season. It's basically A-1's studio work. Well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\r\nMost of the voice actors match the characters traits, for example Tomoyo who was voiced by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, his voice match perfectly to the MC. The background musics are welcome to my ears and the OSTs were great. By chance the OP and ED songs were very nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nMost characters in Saekano are well rounded and they have their own abilities. The MC grew confidence that he could debut his game for the comiket. Supporting characters are also well rounded, at least they aren't antagonists. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nIn my opinion, i enjoyed watching this anime since it aired on 16 January,  because this anime has everything what i needed. The best part is, it surprised us by giving two episode in one day. Kudos to A-1 and the director of Saekano. I opt to rewatch this anime again since it was really interesting. Hopes for season 2, we may not know yet. Well i can recommend this anime for those who have the romance, harem and comedy genre. Might as well try to watch this, if you're willing to watch \\n\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude i gave an overall of:\\n\r\n9/10",

            "content": "Saekano, when I looked at it first in the anime charts, I put it in my list as a romcom harem anime to watch for winter 2015. Romcom harems have always been fun to watch. They have splendid artwork, nice comedy, some eye candy and some good ships. Anyway, Saekano is nothing less. It's a good romcom harem anime with plenty eye candy and an amazing set of characters.\r\nStory 7/10:\r\nThe story of Aki who wants to make a dating sim. In his circle, he tries to add Kasumigaoka Utaha, a senpai who is a master at writing scenarios; Eirir Spencer, his foreign childhood friend whois a master of artwork; Mitchiru, his cousins who loves music and last but not least, the heroine Megumi Kato who he meets accidentally.\\n\r\nThe anime isn't much focussed on how the game is made, rather it focusses on Aki's relation with the girls. The series divides into parts with a few episodes dedicated to a specific girl. That's how it goes. \\n\r\nBut it does well to include all the characters in each episode and gives the atmosphere a harem anime should. \\n\r\nSo, if you're going to watch this anime, watch it as a romcom harem anime, not as an anime about friends making a game since the game part only comes to serve as a catalyst for the romance to take place.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nThis anime has definitely done a massive impressive job in the artwork. Each and every character is amazingly designed. The backgrounds are impressive as well as the characters themselves. It's not a design that can be seen in many other anime(if I remember correctly, this bears a slight resemblance to Grisaia no Kajitsu). Anyway, it's animation and art quality are really impressive.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\r\nThe opening \"Kimiiro Signal\" is really nice. And the opening video is also impressive. The song is good enough to download and listen to.\\n\r\nThe ending is \"Colorful\" is also nice but not as good as the opening.\\n\r\nBut everyone's tastes are different. Maybe you'll love both of them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\r\nThe series revolves around the otaku circle of Aki, Kato, Utaha, Eriri and Mitchiru with some of them coming later in the series. Other characters, like middle school kouhais and old friends show up in the series and then disappear. Some characters you think would play an important role don't get much screen time.\\n\r\nUtaha, Eriri and Aki have the most screen time since they are the ones doing the most work in the series and also the ones with the most romance problems.\\n\r\nAki is an otaku, who isn't embarrassed by his hobby. He wants to make a mark in the anime industry. He is already quite famous on the internet for writing reviews and these anime hobbies of him cause him to meet the other girls.\\n\r\nUtaha is a yandere sort of character and Eririr is the tsundere. Kato seems to be the only sane person of the circle, a little too sane if you ask me but all of them are interesting to watch and their characters are the charm of the series.\\n\r\nThere is not much progression in the romance aspect of the characters, though the comedy comes and goes with each episode. \\n\r\nThe past relations of the girls with Aki are explained in dedicated episodes which is always a good thing but it doesn't stray from the actual purpose of the anime which is romcom.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:\\n\r\nIt was enjoyable, really enjoyable. If you're looking for a romcom harem anime with beautiful characters and some eye candy, this is the one for you. Episodes are a laugh and the personalities of the characters makes it all the better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm glad I decided to watch this series. It is mostly for enjoyment and there is not much focus on the gaming aspect. But as a romcom harem, it is a perfect example.",

            "content": "When you think of a normal romcom, you get a blonde twin-tailed tsundere, an assertive  kuudere, an overly joyous touchy-feely sister character, or maybe a yandere. Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata brings you all that, and with a friendly, \"you have to watch this anime\" hook. \r\nI'll start with the characters: All perked my interest, none held it at all though, seeing as no character had any feature that really put them ahead of any other in a way as to appeal to the differences in people's likes. While the characters all had their own development with the MC, none had any development without him.\\n\\n\r\nAs anime art goes, it was really impressive. I enjoyed watching the fluent transitions without the need for the exaggerated, 3-D motions that are used in  a lot of animes these days, which I have nothing against, actually all for, but seeing an anime that was recently realesed not use it and have it done well impressed me a lot. Now it has a bad habit of transitioning its filter to that similar to No Game No Life, pallet and animation wise, which was weird and not very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was amazing. I think they chose their voice actors very well, as each character had an emotional feel to their voices as they spoke, no matter how sarcastic or brutal their lines were. Even the \"boring, no moe\" character felt real! The music they used was actually really cool and well used. Many a times my anime friend and I would stop and just listen to the music because we actually enjoyed it. Normally jumping between upbeat and slow songs between episodes doesn't sound very good or give a good mood to an anime but I feel that using the kind they did, when they did it, was pretty cool. The intro was on another level as far as romcoms go. I didn't skip it even once. \\n\\n\r\nJumping into the story, it was rather weak, or maybe just bland. The opening hook had me captivated within the first 10 minutes of the anime, but by episode 6, my mind was wondering and focusing became hard as the story really wasn't making any progress or any new developments. Even the \"relationship development\" that was going on during those episodes was weak and rather uninteresting. Around episode 8, I got my interest back since the story took a large leap and the characters finally felt like they were making an impact on the MC's personality.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was a good anime. It just had many issues holding my attention, and really only kept it with the random fan service. Enjoying the characters was definitely easy as they all had their interesting points and all the heroines were most definitely eye candy. As I said earlier in this review, The hook was phenomenal and had me locked. The intriguing idea that he had to make a game based off a girl he just looked at, and then more enthralling as he wanted to form this \"unfished girl\" into a perfect otaku, moe, model girl. It was a good anime as a start but I think it needed more in its middle. Overall, a good anime, but I think it could use work.",

            "content": "It-----It's not like I do this review for your sake or anything. Someone just forced me to do this review.\r\nAnyway, I was very surprised that this anime came out in Winter 2015. If you couldn't tell that was my tsundere impression. This anime was directed by Kanta Kamei and produced by A-1 pictures. This anime is based on a light novel that was illustrated by Misaki Kurehito who did some illustrations such as Ushinawareta Wa Mirai Motomete.\r\nSTORY (8):\r\nThe story follows Tomoya Aki, a high school student, who is working part-time to fund his otaku lifestyle. He is planning to come up with a dating simgame, so he forms a circle that consists of Kasumiga Utaha, Eriri Sawamura & Megumi Kato. Kasumiga Utaha as the scriptwriter, Eriri Sawamura as the illustrator & Megumi Kato as the ideal heroine.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was surprisingly the only anime I enjoyed in the Winter 2015. I know I am just saying nonsense, but it's true. I did like the way how this anime took the time to develop characters especially to let audience know that making a dating sim game takes a lot of effort and understanding towards the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime has some comedic and light-hearted moments like when Eriri slaps Tomoya with her twintails, that one I didn't see it coming. \\n\\n\r\nMy problem is that some parts are boring and especially the bathroom scene with Tomoya & his cousin Michiru. It bothers me the most. As I have said I am tired of comedic misunderstandings. They are not funny anymore. Like a guy accidently walk into the bathroom, and didn't know there was a girl in shower. Nevertheless, I thought that the story was handled well.\\n\\n\r\nART (9):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is beautiful. Using vivid colours.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (9):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening was addictive and the ending was ok. The voice acting at least did a good job. I also did love the music sang by Michiru's band \"Sorairu Days\", a theme song from Gurren Laggan.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (8):\\n\\n\r\nI have no problem with any of the characters. I like all of them.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi Kato, was a good character. I thought her character was handled well. Not to mention, she is cute. \\n\\n\r\nEriri Sawamura, with her tsundere personality was fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nUtaha Kasumigaoka reminded me so much of Yukinoshita with her cool and serious manner, she sometimes shows a scary look.\\n\\n\r\nI did like the way how they co-operate to produce a great visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nMichiru Hyoudo only shows up in the later episodes where Tomoya tries to convince her to produce some music in the dating game. Michiru didn't have much material to work with. I just wish that she has more scenes. Nevertheless I still enjoyed her character.\\n\\n\r\nTomoya Aki, was determined to work hard no matter what the cost. However, he can sometimes be annoying.\\n\\n\r\nIzumi Hashima didn't have much material to work with. I also thought Izumi was an interesting character, however she didn't get enough screen time compared to Tomoya, Utaha, Eriri & Megumi.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the relationships are handled well.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (8):\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime although it didn't manage to keep me on the edge of my seat. If you enjoy a slice-of-life that focuses on dating sims, you might enjoy this anime. It was a treat to see interesting characters like these characters and learn more about these characters. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not like I give this anime a 8 out of 10. This anime sucks. Just joking! \\n\\n",

Guy meets a girl then have a vision of what he what he wants to. But the story is not that boring it keep me wanting more every week.\r\nThe art style of the anime was done brilliant and beautiful but sometimes the character would sometimes have derp faces or their eyes is sometimes misplace but was hardly notice. The beautiful colors of the scenery, characterseyes and character outfit\\n\\n\r\nThe really like the opening and ending because before each opening and ending happen something funny happens before it starts. The voice of Kirito was in other anime and wanted somebody different but later on I started to be okay with it. The other characters was done well especially Kato her voice was cute.\\n\\n\r\nEach character had a episode or two for character development. They are normal people but actually hard core otaku and each time .a girl get development the tides turn on who is the best girl and you will have a girl you will like no doubt. Kato is usually the forgotten one because she doesn't get that much attention while the other character get a lot Uta senpai was the smart and intelligent one and most funniest when her mood changes and your typical Tsundere Eriri the childhood friend of the MC. The last girl was little bit rush for development and they just put her there.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of the show was average but was excited for every episode and my thursday won't be the same and kept me wanting more. And hopefully make a season 2\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is 8/10",

            "content": "After being shoved fanservice in your face during the \"0st\" Episode of Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata, you might wonder if this Harem RomCom is worth a shot at all. Saekano for short does offer a lot of humor that rises from unusual situations, but will that already make for a good stay?\r\nSaekano's plot isn't outstanding, but makes enough room for the characters and interesting events. Protagonist Tomoya finds his personal \"heroine\" and is suddenly motivated to create the best dating sim in the world and needs the help of two very unusally behaving ladies, Eriri and Utaha. This is where the show gets its amusementfrom: Many references to \"otaku culture\" clich\u00e9s related to exactly those characters. Furthermore, this gets amplified by Katou, the heroine, who has a very uninteresting, close to stealthy personality and joins the conversation now and then. \\n\r\nHere, it's also rather interesting how the show talks about the Japanese \"Doujin Scene\" rather often - it makes for a bit more refreshing talk.\\n\\n\r\nEven in 12 episodes, Saekano manages to let some characters develop quite a bit. The personalities might be a bit plain at first, but that is part of the reason why the show is as enjoyable as it is. The biggest problem the show has, is the way the events unfold. While Eriri and Utaha are interesting at first, they get too much screen time in relation to their in-existent development. Their behaviour doesn't really change, as one would expect for a short stay of 12 episodes like Sakaeno, whereas Katou's and Tomoya's personalities are way more interesting in that aspect. Their actions and reasons are the ones we get a real insight on. Balancing out the different girls' screentime might have been a mistake, because the time focused on Eriri and Utaha seems to have no real purpose other than comedy (and unfortuantely fanservice). Nevertheless, the time Katou and Tomoya get was definitely more interesting, and the show was funny and amusing at any point whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nAs with any harem show, while never realistic, everything feels quite natural, except for the fanservice. Maybe it's because I have gotten used to it, but I believe the quantity wasn't unbearable. With the maint aspect being the dialogue, I am sure one can ignore it while watching. Not to mention the whole serious is far from keeping the image \"Episode 0\" might give you.\\n\\n\r\nNow, with those aspects of the setting and plot, what's left is Art and Sound. While not outstanding either, Saekano does succeed in supporting it's Comedy with both these things. The art was up-to-date, nice to look at and even if there were already better anime in that aspect, Aniplex did a good job. Sometimes the artstyle shifted a little bit, closely resembling the Monogatari-seriesi, which made it a bit more interesting but was not much of an enrichment.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was only decent, too. It never posed a problem, but it didn't impress me, either. It always gives off the right atmosphere, but is overshadowed by the good voice acting. Specifically Katou always said things the way you would imagine. Towards the end, this changes a bit for the better, because of plot reasons, one might say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata was a quite likable show. It didn't bring an entirely new story, but it was a Harem RomCom with little mistakes and a likable cast. The way the show makes fun of \"otaku\" and Doujin culture is also rather enjoyable.\\n\r\nIf you can get over fanservice and be amused by characters that do indeed stay a bit shallow, then this will be a nice stay for you.\\n\r\nI personally look forward to hearing of a second season, myself.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "That english title though: Saekano - how to raise a boring girlfriend. Now whenever we come across long anime titles, can it accurately convey the show's plot points and give us a decent understanding of what the show is going to be about? Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon? Yeah, that was uncalled for but seriously these titles should tone down a bit. \r\nStopping that rant there, I will transition into the story of Saekano. Our main protagonist is Tomoya Aki and he has an experience which changes his life so much that he wants to recreate that experienceinto a form of a 2D game. With the help of some maniacal girl 'friends', we get to witness the process of making a romantic game. Not an original story but the show does execute well by delving deep into the process of creation and showing us what our characters have to do in order to create this game. The show focuses a lot on the relationships between the characters which is to give some backbone to the purpose of the show. Not a show to take seriously because character interactions are mainly misunderstandings and comedic tropes.\\n\\n\r\nGetting into the characters, you got your cookie cutter main protagonist Tomoya, whose role is to keep the story going really. He is one of those nice guys who has to make everyone happy before himself. A one dimensional character set on a goal to finish his project, by any means necessary.\\n\r\nEreri Spencer, Michiru, and Utaha are more cookie cutter characters, being your typical tsunderes and yanderes. Nothing to write home about them. \\n\r\nBut here we have the highlight character of the show, Kato Megumi, an innocent, nice girl that pretty much has no idea what our other characters are doing. An interesting take on the non-otaku character and how hanging around these anime/manga crazed fans can change one's perception of life. I found her to be one of those \"wife it\" characters; everyone just needs a Kato Megumi in their life. Being the test subject and our main heroine, she is forced to partake in this game creation. Her character is well done: to be boring, but that's what makes her fresh and enjoyable to watch as she starts developing into a heroine from scratch basically.\\n\r\nCharacter interactions were a big part of this show and this is one of the more funnier shows out there, including jokes, misunderstandings etc etc. Nothing new but better executed than some other rom/coms I've seen. The show knows  that it's a parody, so the trend of keeping the tropes/cliche's going is justified and done well I should say.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation is done well, no complaints. Vivid colors, interesting character features, nice backgrounds and interesting angles for characters. It has a Bakemonogatari feel to it. Complaint about it is the fanservice. I don't mind fanservice but just showing us legs and other \"erotic\" places while characters are JUST talking is pretty over the top and not necessary. Perfect for the people out there that have stocking/sock/leg fetishes.\\n\\n\r\nSound is very relaxing and made me feel positive from listening to it. Opening and ending are average. 1 or 2 standout tracks from the OST; good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, this show really hit it off with me and I enjoyed the f*** out of this show. It is one of those guilty pleasures that we come across every once in a blue moon. Despite my love for the show, critically it is just another generic show with a goody 2 shoes main protagonist, cookie cutter females, and basic story. I won't let my bias get in the way of critical reviews, but its worth a watch depending on your tastes. Setting is explored well and there are some touching moments in the show. I recommend not to take the show seriously at all or you'll be disappointed. This is the pinnacle of a generic show.\\n\\n\r\nKato is wife material though.\\n",

            "content": "Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.\r\n-Friedrich Nietzsche\r\nSaenai Heroine no Sodatekata is an anime full of promise. It is directed by Kanta Kamei, the mind behind \"Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru\" and \"Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin\". At first glance, Saekano seems like your run-of-the-mill harem high school romcom. However, once delving into the pilot episode it is made clear that this is not the case. \r\nSaekano is an attempt at a satirical comedy romance show inthe vein of Seitokai Yakuindomo and Oreimo, one that pokes fun of all of the harem and romance tropes found in most of the moeshit we see floating around the market these days. It is chock-full of references to these tropes and most of the humor revolves around the industry and culture of otaku. \\n\\n\r\nIt is an interesting premise, and one that definitely promises to deliver a solid, humorous 12-episode romantic romp. But did it deliver?\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, let's start with the backbone of a show like Saekano: the characters. And my, do we have such a colorful assortment of unique, creative, non-cliche characters to choose from (insert sarcasm here). Since this is of course a satire of harem anime, Tomoya needs to have his own harem. Within this harem, Mr. Protagonist over here has a veritable buffet of delicious honeys that are as cookie-cutter as they come:\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Eriri Spencer Sawamura, the tsundere childhood friend. On the outside she's one of the most popular girls in school. Rich, cute, and seemingly-innocent. However, get to know her and you'll see that she's a secret otaku, famous for writing Fakku-worthy doujins that sell like hotcakes. She's feisty, jealous, and short-tempered. She is the dream, loli tsundere complete with an inferiority complex about her breasts. Christ, she even has twintails and anime girl fangs.\\n\\n\r\nSecond we have Utaha Kasumigaoka, the sexy, curvaceous tsunshun of the group. Utaha is the other popular girl in school. She's a cold, sexy-ass queen bitch, walking around in boots made for walking. Blessed with an ample chest and ample confidence, Utaha is the smartest girl in school and is the unapproachable hottie. Get to know her though, and you'll find out that she is also a closet otaku, a light novel writer whose books (surprise, surprise) sell like hotcakes. She's cold, bitchy, and just overall beyotch to Tomoya. However, she is actually insecure and jealous (of course), and uses her tsunshun attitude as a shell to get closer to him.\\n\\n\r\nThirdly we have Michiru Hyodo, the lewd, totally comfortable to dry hump you  cousin. She's (surprise, surprise) sexy af, with a (more surprise) ample chest and utterly curvaceous body, which she is not shy to let Tomoya see. She's...not really anything else, to be honest. She's presented as someone who is almost Tomoya's sister because of how long they've known each other, but other than that we just know that she loves music and doesn't really like anime. Hm. This is probably because she was introduced near the end of the show due to the pacing. Whatever.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, we have the central character of the harem, and the girl who actually isn't a cliched character. Megumi Kato. She doesn't stand out at all. She's an average girl with average looks, but Tomoya sees within her the potential beauty of a main heroine. She's flat and dry with the way she says things and has the awesome ninja ability of slipping away without anybody noticing. She is the girl who MAKES the show. Her dry commentary of how cliche every other character is saves the show from becoming a generic harem romp. Without her, it is impossible to view this show as something different from any other show within the genre it represents. \\n\\n\r\nStill, regardless of how cliche they are, I truly did enjoy some of their scenes, however only if Megumi was there with them. When it was only Tomoya and any other girl by themselves, it seriously felt like a generic romcom scene with nothing to bring to the table. Megumi is the savior of every scene involving romance between Tomoya and his harem, and every scene that doesn't have her to pitch in her two cents, then the quality of just about everything drops.\\n\\n\r\nWith the characters settled, let's get to the story. The story chronicles the tale of Tomoya Aki and his \"circle\" of friends in their quest to create a visual novel by that year's Winter Comiket. To be frank, it isn't much of a story.  It is a set-up for an episode structure that allows lee-way for the main protagonist to get involved with the women of his harem in misadventures as they strive for their goal. \\n\\n\r\nOr that's what I thought it would be. What I saw quite frankly surprised me, because the story was paced very well. It presented every harem member *cough* excuse me, character, in a cliche manner, but almost each one is dedicated at least an episode for us to get to know them. This sounds like a genre trope again, yes, but shows sometimes must follow tropes or else it wouldn't be part of that genre. That being said, Saekano accomplishes this trope pretty well, fleshing out these cookie-cutter characters in ways that I never would have thought possible. The motives to their actions were laid out very plainly, and their feelings propelled them and their interactions in a way that was very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as Michael Bay has proven time and time again, entertaining does not necessarily mean good. Moving away from the character-driven plot, the story's seriousness and brevity never really takes full effect because of the lack of respect the show has for its female characters. Yes, you know what I'm talking about. Fanservice. Dear mother of Primus, it seemed as if with every episode, the amount of fanservice mounted higher and higher. It got the point where dialogue that developed the plot and/or characters was said over compromising slow pans over the characters' bodies. It distracted and undermined the seriousness of the entire anime, and fell into yet another trope of this genre. \\n\\n\r\nPulling back to the pacing, I was worried here once again, because knowing every other 12-episode harem romcom anime with this structure, I was scared that it would spend too much time focusing on a few characters' development, and introduce the last member with lightning-quick development, making them not much of a character at all. Unfortunately, no matter how good this anime's pacing was, it could not save dear Michiru, who was introduced and developed within the span of two last episodes. Other than Michiru, though, the pacing was quite good, although it did fall yet again into the trope of this harem genre.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, you can see why I quoted Nietzsche. This anime's story attempted to satirize and poke fun at harem romcoms, yet because of this, it fell into those tropes that it was making fun of. It's a classic example of an anime trying to be utterly meta, but tried so hard that it became beta (sorry, Psycho-Pass, I'm looking at you). The fanservice, the quick pacing, the unresolved plot threads, the needless drama, the \"gag\" scenes (that aren't really funny unless you understand genre tropes), it all just made Saekano an average harem anime. The story was nothing special at all. \\n\\n\r\nSo was anything else special?\\n\\n\r\nWell, let's hit the sound. \\n\\n\r\nTo be curt, no. The voice actors fulfilled their roles. Tsundere, monotone, tsunshun, tomboy, it's all been done before. When a scene called for emotion, they pulled through. When a scene called for hentaiesque moaning, they definitely pulled through. Mmmm, yes. They did. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of music, I have to say that this was one of the drawbacks. Nothing new at all (other than the disco track, ayyhay). Generic opening and generic ending by the girl who did the SAO ending, I assume. The soundtrack is one that after three episodes, you know which track is gonna play over which scene, like somebody is waiting in a booth behind the scenes somewhere waiting to press number 1 or number 5 in specific settings. It gets pretty repetitive, thus falling once again into the harem trope. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, I have to say they really accentuated certain...areas that I...enjoyed immensely. The characters were animated flawlessly, with great detail in their motions. I especially liked the certain few frames where everything would turn a certain color. However, I don't see the metaphorical significance of this. I assume it was just there to look meta, which is another  example of this anime being too tryhard. \\n\\n\r\nBut aside from the great character animation and backgrounds, the static background character animations really detracted from my experience. Now I'm not a Miyazaki-elitist or some shit, but I love hand-drawn anime, and I appreciate it if studios would not be damn lazy and only hand-draw the characters. I don't mind CG, because I understand budget constraints, but Saekano seriously pissed me off sometimes in its animation department. The CG was terrible. There. I said it. It was fucking gross. The background pedestrians were CG Mega Blocks that walked around like robots, which made me question if I was watching something set in a future where everyone other than our MC's is a cyborg. The cars were all Initial D copypasta. And the thing that really pissed me off was when things turned CG for no damn reason, like when a character is fucking just typing something, or drawing, or something else that easily could be hand-drawn. But no, they used CG. Because of these little details, my experience was very detracted. \\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it. Saekano, an attempt to be a satirical romance anime about the harem genre. Did it accomplish its goal? Sure, you could say that. Despite its glaring flaws and plummets into genre tropes and flat characterizations, I enjoyed this anime. It wasn't terrible, but it's an example of how an anime can make fun of what's killing the industry whilst partake in killing the industry with its subject matter. It's sad, vicious cycle really, but it's what it is.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, with everything that I said was wrong, you must be asking why I enjoyed this anime. Well, like I said, lots of bad things are entertaining. However, that's not the main reason why I enjoyed this. The main reason is the character that the anime revolves around: Megumi Kato, the main heroine. She was a jewel, a damn gem in this anime, and a gem that saved it from certain genre-trope doom. I just wish there was more screen time with this generic common girl, because she really was the main heroine of this anime, and my heart. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\\n\r\nAnime trying to be meta becomes beta. Waifu=Megumi Kato.",

You know when you bump into an anime, just run along some gif on Tumblr, and you're led to something extraordinary, and you think to yourself, I got lucky this time? I've had run-ins like this before with School Rumble, and Nisekoi, but I never expected it to come from this series. In fact, I went into this series with little to no clue of what it was even about. But let me tell you, is something special. This anime, the characters, the uniqueness, is unlike any other bland-ime out there. \r\nYou might as well save the time thatyou are reading this review and just watch it. I'm only 3 episodes in, and I am hooked. I can tell this anime will be perfect, and I have absolutely no complaints. Even if it ends as meh as School Rumble, it will still be as good as School Rumble, and as unique. The characters and voice acting is really what sells it for me though. It's a unique and unrealistic story situation, but it's fun, and interesting as well, and the main character makes up for all of the unrealistic story points with a more realistic balance. The unrealistic-ness often doesn't matter, because it's an anime, and I'm not watching an anime for a documentary of love life. Yeah, it's a harem, and it's a great one. You'll probably connect to at least one of the characters, so get ready for that.\\n\\n\r\nSo here's to a new great, in the leagues of my previous mentions, and let's hope for a season 2 which is currently TBA.",

But I believe Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata is a great high school/romance/comedy/ecchi/harem anime.\r\nDespite saying all that the story is a 7 for me. It's good, nothing substantial, but not bad. Nothing wrong with wanting to revolutionize the dating sim industry, many of us have dreams of our own. However, discounting all the convenientconnections that this Tomoya Aki has, not much (plot-wise) really stands out aside from our \"main heroine\" and her role in his dream. Even though I say that, the episodes are enjoyable, the humour is on point, and the story flows.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound get one paragraph because I've given them the same score: 9/10. The art is spectacular, not in SHAFT's abstract sense or Kyoto Animation's detail but the fact that it does what it is supposed to do, and it does it extremely well. I'm sure most if not all fans of Utaha will agree with me on this. Not only that, the colours are vibrant, the animation is fluid, and the alternate art style where things are outlined in a different colour is a nice shift that is not jarring at all. The backgrounds are solid, the character designs are good, and I think it's safe to say every pose and movement is what you came for. One thing I might question is the use of CG in some scenes like when a character is typing on a laptop. I find it unnecessary but it isn\u2019t as pervasive as it could have been. As far as sound goes, the songs with vocals are very good (I personally love the opening and ending), and the background music is fitting and does its job. This is not to say that the voice actors/actresses aren't doing a wonderful job with their characters though, they're great and are worthy of praise for bringing out the character\u2019s personalities, emotions, and other nuances.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are on par with the story itself as I rate them 7/10. Here is where most of my criticism lies with the series. I've said what I think about the story, but in terms of the characters, they suffer much of the same. They're nothing substantial. They are great in their own respects, don't get me wrong, but they're tropes and clich\u00e9s. So why do I still give them a 7 which is \"good\" in terms of scoring? Because they know what they are, we know what they are, and the author certainly wrote them as what they are. But they are done well. I think at least in this instance, you can only go so far on tropes and clich\u00e9s, but this anime does a very good job of bringing out their qualities and allowing the viewer to enjoy them. The development is another point in regards to the story and characters that is worth mentioning because there isn't that much. By far the most notable character development lies with Katou and Aki for obvious reasons, but the other heroines as well as the main character get an arc of their own which is not bad at all. The development may be nothing ground-breaking, but it's still pleasant with its own charm.\\n\\n\r\nAs of writing this review, I've given the anime an 8 both overall and as the score for my enjoyment. I think it is an anime that knows what it is trying to be and where it is trying to go, and it succeeds as a possibly shining example of a high school/comedy/romance/ecchi/harem anime.",

And now, I think this anime is the best anime in the 2015 winter season. It also become one of the animes I like. \r\nAnd I guess this anime is kinda underrated, so I think it deserve a review.\r\nStory (8)\r\nA really simple and straight forward story.

Then he recruit his talented friends to help him reach his dream. That's it. It's simple and not confusing, complex, or anything. But the story is delivered right, the pace of the story is good, no filler episode. Oh, yeah it's harem too, the one like every heroines love the hero kind. Not too heavy though.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9)\\n\r\nThe background and the character is not too detail. However it is a really colorful and it is a good thing. No complain in the animation too for me.

            "content": "Saekano is s story about an otaku who is trying to make his dream of creating a dating sim come true. Throughout the show he builds of members of his circle in order to create the ultimate dating sim.\r\nThe story is okay, it isn't anything to write home about, but it sets the stage for the humor and the girl wars.\r\n7/10\r\nThe show itself is very beautiful and well animated.\r\n9/10\r\nThe music in the show is also really good and the voice acting is well done.\r\n8/10\r\nThe characters are were the show shines. \r\n     The main character Tomoya is an otaku who loves tohelp others and make their dounjin shine. Once he finally gets his own chance to make his dream come true he goes all out in order to make it come true.\\n\r\n    Kato is the character that Tomoya is training to make into the heroine for his game. She is mostly emotionless and is mostly a boring person from the beginning, but as the show goes on she becomes more outgoing and is just absolutely hilarious.\\n\r\n   Eriri is the artist of the group and is Tomoya's childhood friend. She starts off being just a ordinary tsundere but has quite a bit of development in her own episode. \\n\r\n   Utaha is the writer for the story. She breaks the 4th wall and fights with Eriri over who is better for Tomoya.\\n\r\n   Michiru is introduced way too late into the show to really judge. I will say that her character is very lewd.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved this show and I am sad to see it end. I laughed every single week and it has easily become one of my favorite shows. The show makes fun of tropes, other shows, and even itself sometimes. It has some fanservice moments thrown in, but there it really isn't that bad except in episode 0. Sometimes it is even used as a humor element itself.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give the show a 9/10. It is absolutely hilarious and a must watch in my opinion.\\n",

            "content": "For this review, I will be trying a simple pros and cons, instead of my regular ratings of the different aspects in detail.\r\nSaekano is definitely an interesting anime.  You could say that this show is just a generic harem ecchi show who stars an otaku setting.  I would accept that description.  Nevertheless, Saekano is enjoyable.  I find this anime very difficult to review because it is very close from a 7 to an 8.  I think it shines in certain aspects; however,  there are a few weaknesses in its plot and pacing that have hampered my experience a bit.\r\nPros:\r\n-Great comedy: Otaku comedy works really well on me, and if you are a big fan of it, they do a solid job at it.  There is plenty of references at anime tropes, which have made me laugh pretty hard.\\n\\n\r\n-Pretty good characters: The cast is well-rounded and everyone is likeable.  Utaha, the black haired senpai, is funny and her design makes me nosebleed LOL.  The main girl, Kato, has an unique personality, which creates interesting interactions with our MC, Tomoya.  There is also a textbook tsundere, who has pretty pigtails.  She may be the least likeable of those three though.\\n\\n\r\n-Good art: The art looks vivid and crisp.  Being from the same studio who made Shigatsu, it has similar intriguing color usage.\\n\\n\r\n-References: There are some random references of other animes explicitly shown throughout the show.  I find the activity of searching for them, a fun thing to do, while watching through the anime.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyable OP and ED\\n\\n\r\nNeutral:\\n\r\nFanservice:  Some of the fanservice works really well in the episodes.  I find this aspect of the anime very hit or miss.  Certain shots of legs and bust feel unnecessary and forced, whereas, other scenes have their *ahem* charm.\\n\\n\r\nProtagonist: The main character is alright and doesn't make me dislike him.  He has the passionate otaku personality.\\n\\n\r\nStory: There is not a moment of pure boredom present in Saekano, but during some parts, I have found myself slightly losing interest in watching it.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nDrama: The slight bits of drama/tension are not enjoyable imo.  Saekano works best as a comedy anime, and the small setback makes me enjoy the anime less in the process.\\n\\n\r\nAnnoying plothole: The writer says near the beginning, that they need 1 mil yen and Tomoya will be working many jobs.  However, the viewers never see him do jobs, as he is dedicated to the programming and other otaku projects full-time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter pacing:  The appearance of a certain girl should have been sooner than what happens.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10",

            "content": "Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata, or Saekano for short, is a refreshing look at the otaku culture, and more specifically, the dating sim game genre that is forever so popular in Japan.  There has been many anime before Saekano that uses the otaku culture as backdrop, from anime to manga to doujinshi to games.  Each anime has its own level of success.  Saekano, in essence, is just another anime added to that collection.  But it is done with enough wit to makes it entertaining and quickly becomes one of my favourite anime of 2015.\r\nThis is a story of a young man's (TomoyaAki) dream to create what he thinks would be the best dating sim the world has ever seen.  In my opinion, though, he is just creating yet another run of the mill dating sim that graze the Japanese gaming scene.  But enough about the game he wants to create and more about the anime about a boy who wants to create a game.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot encapsulates the otaku scene, where Tomoya believes 2D girls are more desirable than 3D girls.  As he meets his plain looking, deadpan classmate Megumi during a chance meeting, he decides to make a dating sim that will touch every gamer's heart and soul.\\n\\n\r\nAs his endeavour takes shape, he recruits his childhood friend Eriri Spencer Sawamura who works as a hentai doujinshi artist and Utaha Kasumigaoka, a popular romance novelist who happens to be the 'smartest girl in school'.  Before long, he takes it upon himself to 'train' his plain looking classmate Megumi Katou into the heroine of his game.\\n\\n\r\nSaekano never intends to take itself seriously.  For those who are well verse in the otaku culture will feel right at home.  You can feel the sweat, energy and enthusiasm of all the characters as they work together (or not) towards creating their game.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are well developed.  We have the eccentric Utaha who is somewhat the de facto mentor of the group, guiding Tomoya on every step of the way.  She is arrogant yet caring, beautiful yet jealous.  It is this mix of personality that makes her stands out among the casts.\\n\\n\r\nEriri the illustrator is the almost opposite of Utaha.  While Utaha is a renowned novelist, Eriri makes every effort to hide the other side of her, that of a hentai doujinshi artist.  Being a childhood friend of Tomoya and openly professes her interest in him, she is often being made fun of by Utaha who, unlike Eriri, hide her interest in Tomoya.\\n\\n\r\nThe honour of 'boring girlfriend' is bestowed upon Megumi Katou, the plain looking, deadpan classmate of Tomoya.  She is so ordinary that Tomoya does not even know she exists until the day he takes notice of her.  Unlike the rest of the circle, Megumi is clueless to the whole otaku culture.  Seeing Tomoya makes Megumi pulls an all-nighter on multiple dating sim (which looks suspiciously like a game that I have played before, in real life) is amusing to watch.  But looks can be deceiving as there is more about Megumi than meet the eye.  She is my personal favourite through her witty comments and her monotone delivery of dialogues.  She has her way of talking down at people without offending the other party.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Michiru Hyodou, Tomoya's cousin and the circle's musical director.  Unfortunately for her, her introduction into the series comes fairly late.  It does not leave much time for her character to develop like the rest of the crew.  But for the little time that we get to know her, we witness her transformation from rejecting the otaku culture to embracing it as her way of expressing herself through music.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, we have Tomoya Aki, the young man whose dream it is to create a dating game that will set the (otaku) world on fire.  He is oblivious to the love interest shown by the girls, as his energy is fully concentrated on making the game.  He is very enthusiastic and determined to get his game created.  The only problem I find is that he tries to mould his game into something that has already been done before.  He tries to conform Megumi into an archetypical heroine seen in thousands of dating sim.  In other words, he tries to make a game that does not really stand out.  Why would someone buy your game when there are literally hundreds of others that looks just like yours?\\n\\n\r\nThe rivalry between Eriri and Utaha makes a regular appearance in Saekano.  And to a lesser extent, Megumi as well (even though she picks her fight in her own subtle way).  All three girls have, more or less, some feelings towards Tomoya which he is oblivious to, given his preference of 2D girls over 3D.  Whether or not the girls succeed in professing their love is unimportant, the main point is despite their differences, they are willing to work with each other to realise Tomoya's dream.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, Saekano even break the fourth wall casually.  The characters say it so out of hand as if it is a regular occurrence.\\n\\n\r\nFor those looking for fan service, you will certainly find them here.  But it might come as a surprise that this harem anime has less than the usual amount of suggestive pose.  Whatever fan service there is, it is tastefully done.  I can't believe I just said that about a harem anime.  There are some suggestive scenes, but they are not overly done.\\n\\n\r\nGraphically, Saekano is visually stimulating.  Each of the girls can be seen dressed in different outfits.  Camera angles are different from other anime that results in a refreshing look to the series.  Vibrant colours are used throughout the series.  The character design fits the personality quite well.  Background is done impressively well, especially Tomoya's room.  If you pay close attention, you might recognise the many posters, novels and figurines that litter the room.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is upbeat, full of energy and charming, while the ED is cheerfully typical of anime songs.  I personally like both of them and often find myself humming to the tunes.  BGM is atypical of harem anime, nothing outstanding, but definitely nothing out of place.\\n\\n\r\nSaekano is certainly not a guide on how to make your own dating sim game, but what is on offer is charming, light-hearted and humorous.  The characters are well developed, the plot is enjoyable and the humour hits all the right spots.  There is just the right amount of fan service to keep your eyes peeled.  Overall, it is a well-executed anime that will appeal to both visual novel gamers and non-gamers alike.  There might be just one heroine in Tomoya's game, but there are plenty of heroines in the anime that Tomoya stars in.\\n",

            "content": "Writing this review might be a little weird because I came into this expecting what the genres said that they were: Comedy, Ecchi, Harem, Romance and School. Instead what I took away was: Comedy and School. \r\nWatching this anime made me relive all of the previous anime that I have either watched. Whether it be the trash romance, trash ecchi or whatever, it was nice to recollect what the majority of people say on shows. Either mentioning the overused protagonists making fun the show itself or the anime industry as a whole. I felt as if this show did a great job delivering that. Inshort, I would only recommend this show to those who have watched a good amount of anime and heres why. \\n\\n\r\nThe story and the characters are not that bad. Its about a guy trying to create the best romance game that he can but I felt as if the plot was moving way too slow. However, I do admit that each of the characters were unique in the sense of their personalities, not their looks. For some reason Eriri reminded me of Taiga from Toradora and Utaha looked like Yukinoshita. Maybe I'm just being too critical here but this kind of let me down a little bit because their personalities were spot on. Regarding the comedy that this show had, I think that was by far the best part of this show. I was literally laughing at some parts of the show and the part where they played the theme song from that specific show (see episode 12) was awesome. Also not to mention that Megumi was a really nice main character as well. Purposely done plain, I thought that she was the best main character out of all of them. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and the sound were honestly just up to par with everything. I didn't notice anything that was really bad but I didn't notice anything that was jaw-dropping. However, like I said before the amount of enjoyment that I got out of Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata was a decent amount. It was almost to the point where I felt the HUGE amount of potential that this one had. The only flaw that this anime had is that its not really for newcomers. Newcomers to anime can't really watch this because they won't even understand some of the jokes. I think that as you start to watch more and more anime, you start to see that there are certain things that happen in sports anime, or in romance anime. There might even be some that are in every single anime. However, once you start to understand some of these similarities between the animes, the comedy in this anime is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nIn short: I recommend this anime to those who have already watched a decent amount of anime already, as if you do, the experience will be a lot better. :)\\n",

For Tomoya(protag), only thing in the universe that matter is himself and his interests, all else is secondary. I fell genuinely sickened by him as character, and the idea that I should relate to him is staggering.\r\nA few crowning moments of his behavior: Telling a member of harem to cut ties with a bloodrelative because he's of the opposite gender, while Tomoya himself is nose-deep in his cousins boobs. When a member of harem seriously is pondering her future plans, Tomoyas first instinct is to ensure she stays where she is most convenient for him, without a single thought of the affects on her future.\\n\\n\r\nTo add insult to injury, the anime insists that this boy is just the thing every popular girl could want, and they will keep coming for him no matter how much abuse and manipulation he dishes out.\\n\\n\r\nLNs' translated to anime often are hamstrung by not being able to show character development in the short time they have, but I cannot imagine how something as despicable as Tomoya could ever grow on me.\\n",

A great illustrator, a great novelist, a great musician and a great-- inspiration.

The music that they use is very appropriate and it does not stop singing in my head. I enjoy all the characters. Whether they are otaku or not, they unite each other and make a great circle.

            "content": "Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata\r\n~~~~Warning spoilers ahead~~\r\nMain plot\r\nSaenai Heroine no Sodatekata is a romantic, comedy, harem anime about the otaku Tomoya Aki and the three heroines Kato Megumi, Utaha Kasumigaoka and Eriri Spencer Sawamura, gathering together in circle to chase Tomoyas dream, which is to create the ultimate dating sim that will move people to tears.\r\nCharacters\r\nAs told above there is four main characters including the main protagonist (Tomoya). Those three other main characters are:\r\nKato Megumi\r\nUtaha Kasumigaoka\r\nEriri Spencer Sawamura\r\nBoth Utaha and Eriri excel at their own special way, with Utaha in writhing and Eriri in art. Utaha is a professional novel writher, and Eriri is a highlevel 18+ doushinji manga artist. It is clear that both these girls have feeling for Tomoya, but they express them differently. Eriri\\n\\n\r\nKato on the other hand is a very average girl that doesn\u2019t excel at anything, as Tomoya said: \u201cshe curves in where she should curve in, and curves out where she should. Overall she is cute.\u201d Later in the series she develops a slight interest in Tomoya but doesn\u2019t say anything.\\n\\n\r\nTomoyas motivation to make the dating sim consisted of two main reasons\\n\\n\r\nHe wanted to make the best dating sim ever made\\n\r\nHe wanted to share the feeling to fall in love, after he himself fell in love with the girl that lost her hat down the hill outside Tokoyas house, it is later reviled that the girl is Kato\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nAnimation itself is nice and fluid accompanied by a not so fluid 3d animation at some places. The art on the other hand is undetailed and looks in some places very bad, but lets face it this isn\u2019t UBW work so we cant expext any good balance between animation, detail and art.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\\n\r\nThe sound track wasn\u2019t half bad, piano where is should be and guitar where it belongs. But its not the best out there nor is it the worst out there.\\n\\n\r\noverall\\n\\n\r\nthe anime is unfinished and end with a cliffhanger, so i cant say that i am satisfied with the results. So i will give it a 7/10 because the comedy was there and was funny.",

            "content": "I wasn't quite sure at first, but pretty quickly this series sucked me into it's grasp. It's almost a double-take where there are two \"plotlines\" going on at one time. There's the basic \"were gonna make a dating sim\" plotline, however there's also the overarching meta commentary on the industry and tropes as a whole. I hate the word \"deconstruction\" and I don't think it applies here either. Rather, I think this series is one long joke about the nature of fans, otaku culture, and the hardships of small publishers who have to take what they can get to make their dream project come true.\r\nThecharacters all fit standard tropes (with the exception of the main heroin), yet are also subverted often which is a running theme of the show. More and more childhood friends show up to be misleading, tsundere tropes almost never actually work, yandere vibes are played to be literally creepy, and the most boring character actually comes to be the one who's close to groundbreaking.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to write something that implies you need to be \"smart\" to watch this. It wears all of its jokes and commentary on its sleeve. However, it presented it in such a fascinating and often downright hilarious way that I couldn't help but enjoy it. From awkward fourth-wall breaking to snapshots that intentionally look straight out of a dating sim, this show definitely knew the tone it was trying to set.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for some story with tons of \"meaning\" and \"progression\" you probably will want to avoid this. There's a bit of movement, but nothing really major from this first season as far as I can tell. Yet if you're looking for something that's pure fun, fanservice, and interesting dialogue, it's worth the pickup.\\n\\n\r\nI can't wait to watch and write a review for Season 2, and I hope it doesn't disappoint.",

            "content": "REVIEW: Saenai Heroine no Sodakekata\r\nStory (7/10): Aki, Tomoya, an average high school boy who has a hobby, that of being an otaku. One day as he rides his bike down the hill delivering newspapers, a girl's beret flies by catching Aki's attention. As he picks up the beret, a gushing wind of sakura blooms petals blows by his face. As he looks up onto the hill where the beret was blown from, Aki finds a girl standing on top of a hill. Aki is fascinated of her, and as an otaku himself, he randomly comes up with the brilliant idea to make a 'dating sim'as he suddenly inspired to make one. In order to make the dream of making a dating sim come true, he gathers a harem *ahem* his classmates which happen to be coincidentally ALL FEMALE. (The story may sound forced, but is it quite fresh and refreshing to watch a interesting plot unfold.)\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10): It's art is similar that of Shirobako and Nagi no Asukara, where all the character designs look nearly the same from its counterparts. You're probably questioning, \"That's how the artist designs are attended to be. You can't help it.\" Well, if you just add a different style of hair and a use different colors, they look different, right? (I'm sorry to insert my own personal opinion, I, as the viewer find that to be generic as in return bland and dull). But, compared to those anime I mentioned above, their character designs aren't as bad since all of them had distinguishable traits to recognize them by. Their personalities however, that what makes up the characters in general, which you will read in my character section. For the background however, it is what you expect from a modern-day anime. However, something to mention is that I think in either Episode 8 or 9, there were some scenes were Aki and his childhood friend Eriri, were reminiscing over their childhood memories. When they were reminiscing, the scenes were visually creative to look at. Just to keep that note in mind.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10): Whilst of writing of this review and watching the last episode yesterday, I find myself repeating the OP over and over again. It was indeed catchy. But for the ED and OST, I forgot the songs in it's entirely unfortunately. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10): The characters are what you can expect from your typical harem anime. But there are some characters in particular that you may like as the series progress on. Therefore, I will mention three characters that I found that I liked, that you make like as well throughout the whole anime.\\n\\n\r\nAki, Tomoya: Odd is one word it comes to mind when it comes to this character. But at the same time, very amusing. He's that character that can make brighten one's day, even though's he is bizarre one. Fortunately, this isn't your genetic and dull main character when it usually comes to a harem anime. He has an intriguing personality and is inspired to do whatever means possible to reach his dream.\\n\\n\r\nKasumigaoka, Utaha: When it comes to her characteristics, it fits one piece of a puzzle harem clich\u00e9. One of the most beautiful girls in school, has long black hair, has big *ahem* oppai, and you know the rest. When it comes to her personality however, she has two sides of a coin. One side seductive. One side perverted. But, most of the time she is calm, collected and has a reserved character. Her personality may be another anime clich\u00e9 unfortunately. Despite that, that what makes her a likable character.\\n\\n\r\nKatou, Megumi: Easily one of the favorite characters throughout the whole entire anime in my opinion. To see her character come into play, is quite exicitng and refreshing. A character that usually doesn't play into the harem clich\u00e9 and instead be herself. Innocent and genuine. Most importantly, anyone could relate to her. As she is probably the most 'realistic' character which can be applied to reality itself. You may find her dull and boring, but as a character has a uniqueness to appeal to the viewers. #TeamKato, you'll know what this mean when you finish this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): It was fairly satisfying considering how fresh the plot was. Even so, I sometimes found myself laughing at the screen at times. Sometimes reacting painfully to awkward moments even though they were humorous. The enjoyment of this anime was quite refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: You may be confused when going in into Episode 0, as you do not know where the story has progressed, unless you had read the light novel. What I recommend is to watch Episodes 1-12 then go into Episode 0. But overall, expect to pause a couple of times as the dialogue paces too fast in some cases, unless you know how to read and comprehend fast. But don't let that ruin your enjoyment of the anime. The plot is something to look forward to, as well as new refreshing new  art, sound, and characters! It's worth you time! Expect lots of fan-service by the way, which is my advice to you. But, anyways enjoy!\\n\\n\r\nRAW SCORE:\\n\\n\r\n7.81/8.00\\n\\n\r\nROUNDED UP SCORE:\\n\\n\r\n8.00/10.00",

            "content": "Story & Writing:\r\nRight off the bat this thing follows that shitty trope where every cute girl in the vicinity inexplicably wants to suck the protagonist's dick. While this was tolerable at first, it gradually became nigh insufferable due to how immature and passive-aggressive its cast of characters handle the situation. The \"conflicts\" and \"problems\" faced by these characters are actually very insubstantial and extremely easy to solve. Why? Because the cause of these conflicts are obscene to begin with. Characters will get mad at one another for just about any reason, and screaming at each other or having a crying party is usually the bestresolution that this braindead show can come up with.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, it irks me that the main selling point of this show - the creative process behind a game - is mostly kicked to the curb in favor of drama, angst, and rom-com antics. If you came here for the game-making then haha fuck you. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I don't usually include an entire section for the \"characters\" in my reviews because I think the characters are a part of the story and writing, and it's better to talk about the characters along with the story. However, Saekano's characters are special and warrant an entire section. Why? Because to understand why Saekano is so bad, we'll have to examine the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nUp first is the protagonist, Tomoya, an oh-so-popular otaku and a prime medium for neckbeards to self-insert. He's also a popular blogger and one of the most popular kids at school, and I just cringed out of my fucking skin writing these two sentences. He is not the best of the cast nor the worst either. To me, he's just barely tolerable as a protagonist because he drives the plot forward to some extent and has a somewhat amusing personality. However, the way he treats Katou, the way he undermines her lifestyle and personality and tries to \"mold\" her into something that is more to his liking, feels extremely bizarre at best and slimy at worst. I don't understand this character dynamic. What is going on? What kind of person is the \"right\" person? The kind that you can jerk your little ding dong to as opposed to the kind that provides enjoyable companionship and emotionally fulfills you as a human being? \\n\\n\r\nKatou was the only saving grace for this anime. She's the definition of chill and does not give a single fuck. I never get bored of watching her deadpan reactions to Tomoya's antics in her monotone voice. There's something so inherently amusing and soothing about her personality. She was a genuinely fun and interesting character who could have made this an enjoyable series but unfortunately, she can't negate the damage done by all the other characters, who are just fucking obnoxious cunts whose only purpose is to stew up some dogshit melodrama and angst. \\n\\n\r\nTake Eriri for example: she's a whiny and narcisstic bitch who brags and bluffs to protect her laughable self-esteem but whines and cries whenever things don't go her way. She gets mad at the protagonist for extremely unreasonable things and is always the shit-talker. Her thought process and behavior verge on complete sociopathy, and in my honest opinion this bitch needs professional help more than she needs the protagonist's dick. This misstep in character writing came back to bite Saekano in its ass when Eriri's character arc inevitably comes around, and I am left sitting in front the screen swearing and fuming at how the show still expects me to take this dumb bitch seriously. Utaha is another stupid bitch who holds a grudge against the protagonist for not preemptively reading her work...? For not doing what she wants him to do because it goes against his personal ethics? These two bimbos constantly act as if they hate the protagonist, but the moment he announces that he's going on a date with Katou they become extremely passive-aggressive and obsessive, which is extremely childish at best and absolutely retarded at worst. Man you bitches need Jesus. And by Jesus I mean Tomoya's dick and some Xanax.\\n\\n\r\nThere is more to talk about here, but I don't feel like sitting here and typing up two or three more paragraphs for the remaining members of Tomoya's harem. I don't wanna spare the effort for Saekano when it clearly can't spare the effort for its audience.\\n\\n\r\ntldr: most of the characters are extremely unlikable and they have about as much chemistry with one another as a catholic nun has chemistry with a pimp.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nMediocre and uninspired. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNothing too memorable. Once again, the picture of mediocrity. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n6/10 The rom-com antics were  somewhat fun while they lasted - before the show decided to shove its head up its own asshole pretending that it's something it's not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\n5/10 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Who actually cares about what's inside since it's going to be another run-of-the-mill harem romcoms, right?\r\nWell, that's where I was wrong and why I'm here to tell you why you're kinda wrong as well. Sit back and grab some popcorn coz if you're reading this, this'll be a long ass ride. \r\nNow, let's get this straight. I find harem romcoms to be utter shit in most cases butSaekano is kinda different. When I watched this show, I gave it a 3 episode trial and was honestly immersed. In a rare occasion, I actually managed to finish a harem show without puking my guts out in boredom and annoyance. Why is that? What is different w/ saekano that most harem romcoms fail to have?\\n\\n\r\nSimple. It has proper pacing and development.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a plot. No, I don't mean big boobs and flat justice, though it really does have those in various sizes *wink* *wink*, but this show actually has its proper story set in place. In this show, the main character dreams of making his very own galge (or hentai games for the uninitiated) and he gathers up multiple stereotypes *ahem* I mean characters to aide him in his plight. \\n\\n\r\nNow, normally a harem romcom's story is forgotten amidst the swirling pile of boob shots and ass shots in the show, and while some of 'em actually do travel along the story's goal, it goes by it so subtly that by the time you realize they defeated the demon king, you'll just be like \"Err... what happened? last I noticed, there were boobs... and boobs... an ass shot, and more boobs\" which basically meant that they weren't paced well at all. Why is that? Because harem romcoms are focused more on characters rather than story. You can basically set the story into any theme and a harem romcom would still work given that your characters are the same kind of stereotype.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where I commend this show(although I should likely commend the light novel writer for making something that actually moves in decent consistency). In a span of 12 episodes, the MC managed to recruit a good artist, a good scenario writer, a good music composer, and a good heroine. That shows that the plot, or original purpose of the show, was never forgotten. While some of the scenes and episodes may seem unrelated, it will still show that they are working on the game they're doing, either blatantly pointing it out or saying it in a subtle way. That shows that there's actual story progression, and you don't have to wait 1 billion episodes before this series comes to a conclusion, which likely would be as rushed as flash when his gf says \"parents not home\".\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing this show does well compared to most harem romcoms is development. When I say development, I mean character development, and not only MC to heroines but heroine to heroine development as well. One thing I despise about harem romcoms, and which makes me have a stigma against the genre in general, is that they half-ass character development all the time. And that's the rule to it. In harem romcoms, the MC should always have equal standings between all heroines just to balance the playing field (or give everyone a fighting chance for a flexible ending). Basically, it means that when the MC is doing something special with a certain heroine, you should expect that there would be a fallback. Either that the event blows up in a comedic fashion, rendering the character development null, or that all the girls will have a similar character development scene just so everyone is on an equal standing. And you know what I think about that? Dogshit stupid. That basically renders the effort of a heroine to nothing considering either it becomes nothing or everyone gets something, and when everyone is special then no one is.\\n\\n\r\nLet's get back to saekano. I mentioned MC to heroine development earlier, and like a normal run-of-the-mill harem, this show gives an episode dedicated character development to all the heroines. But there's a twist. There's a wildcard in the fray. What is it? It's-- nevermind, I won't say names. Anyway saekano's actually doing a good ol jedi mindfck technique. Yes, sure, every girl is getting an episode dedicated to character development, but the director is subtly hinting the viewers to someone else. They're making sure that a certain heroine has a huge advantage, which shows dedication. This show makes it solid that \"this girl will win, stop fighting for best grills\" and in doing so also makes it sure that every character development scene was put into a different use, either it'd be a set up to an emotional standoff or to strengthen character relationships (to a certain degree). Another thing is, this show doesn't only have MC to heroine progress. There's heroine to heroine progress, which is important because it shows that the heroines are not completely useless without their fcking boyfriend. Stole that line from gigguk lol. Jokes aside, character development in normal romcoms are so heavily dependent on MC to X-heroine that they don't normally interact with each other. That's not the case in saekano, and the show even shortens the gap between certain heroines, just to show that they're not stereotypes to fawn over but actual real characters that were given proper thought and idea.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, that's the main points I wanted to cover. Music is good (catchy OP and ED and holy shit the sorairo days cover on the last ep was legit), art is good (boner popped multiple times courtesy of Utaha tights and Michiru hopes and dreams~), and honestly, the show is really enjoyable. It has its own flair that can make you immersed and feel like you're not just watching a set of stereotypes bumbling around in a story created purely for cashgrab reasons, but with actual characters you can care about and see their growth as a... well... character. And that's the deal I have with most harem romcoms. Everything is so forgettable and generic that you can't even be bothered to care. It exists just for wankers who want cute grills. In the sea of boobs and ass out there, saekano stands out as its own brand of bread and butter doing its own thing and this is why you should give it a try.",

            "content": "If I could describe Saenai Heroine in as few words as possible I would say it's an average well-written should that follows many tropes and cliches while never retreating from it's original goal for easy fanservice.\r\nThe story centers around a known otaku who is very ambitious in his dream of making a dating sim but he has lots to learn before he makes a seriously good game, lucky for him he has the two beauties of the school at his side both who happen to be in love with him. Too bad Tomoya is only interested in one 3D girl named Megumi who matches hisideal heroine at first...\\n\\n\r\nThe series talks mostly about Tomoya goal of creating the prefect visual novel with Megumi, his childhood friend and artist Eriri, Utaha a writer who he is fond of, and later his musician cousin Michiru. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are clearly flushed out and may come off as shallow as first (especially Izumi), but more is revealed about them as Eriri and Utaha have a unique past with Tomoya that they eventually get over developing them into better people. Megumi doesn't have a connection with Tomoya but after getting involved with his project tries to get more invested in her enviroment as the game's \"heroine\".\\n\\n\r\nSometimes the art is great but only comes off as try hard especially with certain scenes that focus on particular colors palattes. I got used to it after a while but I always think that intended for something completely different.\\n\\n\r\nThe show tend to make fun of the harem and dating genre indirectly and directly as possible in a fun way, there are two misleading fanservice written to make the audience think intercourse is going on. Yes there is other types of fanservice played straight as this is a harem, but the main point of the show to me me was the comedy and drama.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a good show to watch, nothing masterful and definitely nothing to bad, I wish I could rank it higher but it's average anime that manages to bring you back for something if your seriously looking for it.",

            "content": "I was pretty bored recently so I figured I\u2019d randomly write an anime review of a show I hadn\u2019t seen before. I ended up marathoning both seasons of How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend. I didn\u2019t go in with many expectations, nor did I have any idea what it was about, nor who was involved. I must say, though, I was pleasantly surprised.\r\nBefore we start, keep in mind that I am not a professional anime analyst, I\u2019m a casual viewer with casual opinions. Form your own after watching.\r\nStory\r\nThe concept isn\u2019t entirely original but interesting nonetheless. The plot isn't anything intricate or complex, but it's alsonot what the show is centered around. It's more about the interactions between the characters, but we'll get to that soon enough. I enjoyed the story for what it was as it is something most of us are bound to be interested in: video games, cute girls and lewd jokes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nAs with all harem shows, there\u2019s expected to be a multitude of cute girls of varying shapes and sizes. The problem is that most of the time they\u2019re just reiterations of the same stereotypes. This show manages to really flesh out most of the characters by the end of the first season. Okay, maybe I\u2019m giving the show a bit too much credit here. There\u2019s definitely still a certain usage of stereotypes, like the obligatory tsundere, yandere, and whatever other dere\u2019s there are. It can get a bit annoying at times to see characters act in a way that\u2019s dictated solely by the stereotype they are based on, however, these events are few and far between.\\n\r\nMost of the show is centered on the interactions between the different characters. That\u2019s right! Not just between the male MC and the different girls, but they actually interact with each other as well. I\u2019m reluctant to use the term \u2018deconstruction\u2019 but credit is given where credit is due; the show almost mocks the harem genre at certain times, calling out characters on their stereotypical behaviour in an enjoyable way. \\n\r\nThe other, let\u2019s say, 20% of the show is spent on showing the characters in very detailed, sexual positions. Sometimes it feels out of place, but in the main show (not the OVAs), most of the time the fanservice is kept under control fairly well. It\u2019s not always near naked girls on screen, there\u2019s plenty of half-naked poses as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt & animation\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t figure out that this show was produced by A-1 Pictures until after I researched it. This means that the art style deviates somewhat from their usual copy-paste method of designing faces. The overall quality of the animation is quite high, as expected of A-1 Pictures, however it is noticeable that they cut corners in some places, like this shot in a mall for example where every sign uses comic sans. \\n\r\nSince it\u2019s a character and dialogue heavy show, not much action takes place. Because of this, almost all of the shots have an incredible amount of detail to them to make up for them being stills. Some of the shots feel extremely atmospheric and remind me of the scenery in Garden of Words, specifically the railway crossing. It just looks so verdant and comfy, and compliments the relaxed nature of the show quite well. \\n\r\nThere are few instances of CG being used in this show, and they usually fit quite well. There is however one scene with a huge crowd that I distinctly remember being incredibly obvious and off putting. In general, though it looks good.\\n\r\nThe show also has a habit of panning over the girls\u2019 legs/feet/breasts during conversations, which tends to be a little distracting at times, but I personally don\u2019t really mind.\\n\r\nI\u2019ll put the segment of character design under the art section as well, even though it probably shouldn\u2019t be, fight me. Pretty much all of the main girls are extremely cute, there\u2019s not much more to be said. The MC\u2019s design doesn\u2019t go further than bowl cut & glasses high school kid.\\n\r\nOther than that there are a lot of unique outfits and styles in general for the different characters. Every single character looks and feels unique and distinguished from the rest of the cast. Also, Utaha best girl. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI don\u2019t speak Japanese, so I can\u2019t really judge the voice acting that well, but none of the voices felt out of place. They all suit the characters very well. \\n\r\nAs for the openings and endings, they were good. Especially the opening of the first season is extremely catchy, and I actually watched it multiple times while I normally always skip them. The visuals were cute and well animated, too.\\n\r\nNone of the other tracks really stood out to me, although there are a couple of episodes where a certain character plays the guitar and it sounds quite nice.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nSaekano is a show with a not so original concept, but great execution. A combination of the crude humour, self-awareness and very entertaining character interactions makes this show work. The MC isn\u2019t an insufferable moron which is always a plus. It also has a habit of breaking the fourth wall, which is hilarious. I found the humour to start dwindling a bit towards the end of the first season. The OVAs, however, are extremely funny and are focused mainly on 'plot'. The second season picks up where the OVAs left off and starts off light-hearted as the first season did, however towards the end the drama starts ramping up exponentially, though it\u2019s all believable and grounded in reality.\\n\r\nAll in all, I\u2019d recommend anyone who\u2019s a fan of the harem and/or high school romance trope to give this show a shot. It\u2019s one of the better shows in the genre that\u2019s come out in recent years. If you\u2019re not really into the whole harem thing, I\u2019d still say: watch the first episode and decide for yourself. I\u2019m honestly not a big fan of the genre either, as I get bored with them rather easily. This show, however, starts off with an extremely strong first episode, with some of the best jokes in anime that I know of, which pull you in immediately. I watched the whole show in less than 24 hours. Yes I do have a problem. No I do not need any help.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Saekano has been one of my favorite series i had watched in my life...\r\nits not as obnoxious as other harem series but the dude it still a dense idiot and sometimes i want to punch him for being such a innocent jerk (he is insensitive without knowing).\r\nDon't ge tme wrong... The main character is really not a Jerk, but he is an idiot otaku that can only focus on one thing and think lineal that he indirectly becomes insensitive and hurts the girls accidentally and he is dense enough to not realize it, even if he gets hit for it. He only can see onething and that's it.\\n\\n\r\nI started this with the manga not the novel...\\n\r\nand Honestly I thought Utaha was the main heroine since she was the first to show up (and normally the first girl to show up is the main heroine)\\n\\n\r\nBut Megumi is the main girl and I felt kind of disappointed... mostly i became fan of utaha, but megumi comes a second. (Fortunately, Utaha has her own alternate universe series which she IS the main heroine)\\n\r\nI feel bad for Eriri though... she gets the short end of the stick all the way without a pone thrown at her...  (She didnt even get her own series)\\n\\n\r\nthis is one of the reasons I do not like harem stories that much... because too many girls get hurt by that insensitive guy and many broken hearts goes around and I hate that... I hate when girls are used for just drama and comedy relief and end up with broken hearts... (Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru being a sample of this).\\n\\n\r\nis it worth using all those girls just for the sake of drama and profit?\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the story centers around an otaku who wants to make a visual novels. He is best friends with a famous novelist (Utaha) who is her senior in school and childhood friend art and illustrator (Eriri); he tries to convince them to join him to make a game and brought many proposals but they always refused.\\n\\n\r\nThen one day he has a \"fateful encounter\" with a girl coming back to his house and he got enchanted by her... thinking on one of his otaku fantasies. And he thought... \"This is a heroine of a game...\"\\n\\n\r\nTurns out the girl goes to the same school and class as him but she is just a \"background character\" that no one noticed.\\n\r\nTomoya (the main character) then got dissapointed because Megumi (the heroine) its just your ordinary plain Japanese girl with almost to not personality at all and she just \"blends in the background\"\\n\r\nNo heroine material... still he chose her so he tries to convince her to be his heroine for his game and drags her in... saying \"I will turn you into my perfect heroine for this game\".\\n\r\nMegumi just went along with it because \"Why not?\"\\n\r\nNow with a heroine, Tomoya proposes his game again to Utaha and Eriri... and out of jealousy and the presence of a new girl they accept to form the circle.\\n\\n\r\nSo the story goes how Tomoya fights hard to make this game a reality, while the girls (minus Megumi since she just 'meh, what ever') fight hard to gain his attention and approval.\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nI must say that this is one fine love comedy, and its well executed and not obnoxious. I enjoyed the first season when it first came out very much and planning to see the second once it finishes and is available.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is excellent and the conflict and drama within them and how to solve it and the pains of past memories were well made which bring us to feel sympathy for these girls. Why they continue on pursuit to this dense otaku idiot? I dont know... (but in reality is the author and editors' fault).\\n\\n\r\nHonestly speaking... Megumi is a dilemma... her character intrigues me.\\n\r\nThis girl can become a professional poker player with ease.\\n\r\nShe constantly has a neutral expression as if she doesn't care what happens with the world and rarely shows emotion.\\n\r\nHow ever she is indeed a good friend and the one who tries to keep everyone together with a clear mind.\\n\r\nFunny thing though... her poker face is the strongest when she sees Tomoya in a lucky-pervert situation... but I can see it in her eyes... the annoyance.\\n\r\nIt seems that deep down she does have feelings for Tomoya but she controls them really well and doesn't let emotions get the better of her like Utaha and Eriri.\\n\r\nAnd also she has been the voice of conscience to the group many times over even if she goes around with a \"Meh, what ever\" attitude.\\n\\n\r\nI also tried to real the original source, the novels, but they are not fully translated unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Saekano has been a fun ride and I enjoyed it very well. It is one of those series that I do not mind watching again.\\n\r\nSo i do recommend it.",

The story line is basic but the character are great and the music is very appealing. However, along with breaking the 4th wall, they do make alot of references to other animes instead of making it up or parodying a known anime which is not neccessarily bad, its just a differentapproach. Overall, aside from the typical harem ecchi anime moments, this show does have its uniqueness and is very enjoyable nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8",

            "content": "When you find a show that is so good that it manages to completely subvert the genre, it can be great. What often goes unmentioned but is perhaps equally as interesting, is a show that manges to be totally new and different within the confines of the genre in question.Whilst not being anything of a breakthrough, I felt that Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata was well on the way to being the latter of those. \r\nStory: The story was pretty serviceable, interesting enough to keep me interested, not so interesting that my mind was blown. I don't think the story is the real subject of thisshow however, so I'm willing to let this slide. It's also worth noting that as this is only the first season we're not necessarily going to get THAT much key plot developments, i personally think it's nice to see a show take it's time with it. \\n\\n\r\n Art: I'm not so experienced in anime that i can tell too much about the art, what I do know is that if it's enough to make me think 'wow that's some pretty good art' it must be ok. That's about all I have to say on that.\\n\\n\r\nSounds: Opening track is pretty good, OST was somewhat forgettable. The sound never really added to the show but never took away either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters for me we're the most interesting part of the show. The main female lead is quite an interesting take on the traditional heroine, although it's not been done before (See The World God Only Knows). The show really plays this to its strength and the juxtaposition between Megumi on the one hand and the exaggerated archetypes of Eriri and Utaha is a lot of fun to watch. The characters also play off of each other in a comedic way really well. This show is a lot smarter than it really deserves to be with some of the gags. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This show is a lot of fun, it brings laughs and the occasional funny feeling. You don't hate any of the characters and no-ones really annoying enough at any point to grate on the nerves. It's light, it's harmless, it's probably fluff, but isn't there a certain charm to that?\\n\\n\r\nOveral: Really enjoyed it, looking forward to season 2. It's difficult to really judge when not placed in the context of what comes after it but I think if this show keeps pushing the same kind of buttons and further developing the characters, we could be in for a fun ride. A solid, but not totally exceptional 8/10",

            "content": "(Mainly focused on the last 5 episodes in order to give people ideas about what they can expect.)\r\nWhen this show is good, it's really, really good, but it goes ice-cold for long stretches.\r\nCharacterization: When he's going over the top for the sake of \u201ccomedy\u201d, the main male character is obnoxious. I won't bother with his name. I can't remember his name. He's a generic main male character. Dark-haired with glasses, not completely social adept, it's a little hypocritical of me, but I stand by my assessment. Whether that's meant to be relatable or not, I still suffered from secondhand cringe when watching him in motion.Sawamura (the blonde) is excellent if a bit clich\u00e9,  and Kasumigaoka (the long, dark-haired one) is fun enough to watch in action. Kato (the bland, sweet one) is serviceable. Honestly, the main male character should have jettisoned, his desire to make a game given to Kato, and then the story worked from there. It's like they waffled between harem anime and cute-girl anime, so they decided to split the difference and they fell right into a chasm of boredom.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Terrible Soundtrack. This show has one of the worst soundtracks I have ever heard with only the credits song even vaguely sticking in my head. At one point, I was struggling to remember if it even played music. There was no engagement to keep the viewer hooked until the last few episodes when the musician finally showed up. A good soundtrack is like a good offensive line in football, everybody overlooks it, but it's going to be very hard for a show to be engaging and entertaining without it. I, personally, place a premium on a good soundtrack. It's why I give more slack towards a show like Guilty Crown. Even when it tries to use music effectively, like in the opening 30 seconds to Episode 9, the track chosen just reminds me of Bakemonogatari or Nisemonogatari. Said attempt is then shot in the ass with a scene transition and attempted meta so jarring that if it were a pair of knees, it would have torn both ACLs.  What's even more jarring in regards to the soundtrack is that it spends part of Episode 10 discussing how important a good soundtrack is. \u2026.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are passable, as they are quite technically sound. When A-1 isn't shoving references to its other works in your face. It's like they decided to save the visual budget by plastering posters of their other works all over the place. SEE OUR OTHER WORK! SEE OUR OTHER WORK! Quick advertisement, and we can save animation time. It does make the world feel realistic, but marketing campaigns are not be-all, end-all. There's no action sequences so the animation can focus on minuscule details in the frames to bring it all together. There are some artistic colorization choices in certain still frames that tell the viewer in that \u201cThis is supposed to be a key psychological moment in the story\u201d but my investment in the main male character is usually so honestly negative that I barely cared. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the more anime you've seen before, especially in these genres (harem, high-school, slice-of-life, etc.), the less likely you are to enjoy it. A veteran won't be missing anything, but somebody looking to explore the genre can easily find reasons to watch. It doesn't fully commit the meta aspect, but haphazardly throws it in. Though I do recommend watching a different anime in Gurren Lagann beforehand, (unlike me).",

I have been doing the latter part of that sentence for the past month or so, trying out all types of genres. I can finally say that I found one that was enjoyable at last.\r\nThe story progressed slowly at the beginning, but then was expedited near the end and felt somewhat rushed. There were a few parts of the story that I didn't like, but everyone has their own reasons for criticism. Anyways, if the pace ofthe story was more consistent, I would have rated the story higher than a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part of the anime was the art. It had semblances to Your Lie in April and the Bakemonogatari series. I rated it a 9/10. I enjoy the art styles used throughout the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was well fitting. I especially liked some of the music choices at the end of the anime, I won't get into it, because somehow that might be considered a spoiler. I rated this aspect an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development through the story could have been better, but it was definitely not something I, or anyone else for that matter, should complain about. I really liked seeing the progression of Meguri throughout the anime. There were, of course, the general characters such as the 'deres, but come on, each anime needs a few of those. For all of this, 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated in the first section, I really did enjoy the anime. It was captivating in its own way, and I really liked that. There were a few points that made me actually laugh out loud, like when they, I don't know if this accurately describes it, but, broke the 4th wall. It happened a few times, and every time made me chuckle. 8/10 on the enjoyment scale.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to write a long section on the overall. I stated everything I believe needed to be stated in the above sections, so this should be short. I think anyone who appreciates manga/doujin/games would appreciate this show. I am definitely excited to see the second season and if you chose to watch this, I hope you enjoy it as well. Overall, I rate it at a 7/10.",

            "content": "It is without question that the harem genre is slowly becoming worse and worse. This is mainly because since roughly around 2011, the anime industry hasn't tried at all to create brand new tropes and ideas and instead use the generic blueprints derived from their predecessors. In this regard, Saekano is the metaphorical parasite of the harem genre. \r\nPLOT\r\nLet's go off on a tangent for a bit and talk about a little show I call OreShura. In my opinion, I consider OreShura to be one of the few harem shows that a fan of the genre must watch simply because it stands out from thethousands of other harem shows. This is because what OreShura does that many harems refuse to do is generate a unique plot and expand on the typical tropes found in the genre with brand new ideas and interactions between characters.\\n\\n\r\nSo how does this apply to Saekano? Well, the director of OreShura, Kamei Kanta, also known for his works on a little show called Usagi Drop, was tasked with creating Saekano. Because of this, we can expect a unique perspective of the harem genre, right? Wrong.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance Saekano may seem to be another typical harem story. However, Saekano is, as most people would describe, a meta-comedy. To give you uneducated skank niblets an idea about what I'm talking about here, a meta-comedy is a show that constantly insults itself. Something that's very interesting about reviewing meta-comedy anime is that if you're reviewing it from a negative standpoint, you come across as a stupid and incompetent dillweed. This is because most of these reviewers point out the major cliches and stereotypes shown in the anime as if it's still a negative aspect of the show. Unfortunately for them, in the case of meta-comedy, they PURPOSELY insert these negativities as a joke to laugh about. So tell me: would you give an anime a 3/10 just because you didn't like the humor in the show? Again, this is a large reason that Saekano is regarded as one of the best shows of the year simply because nobody's brave enough to look like an absolute nincompoop. Yeah, you didn't expect to see nincompoop in a review, did you? Well, f**k you, this is Saekano\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAhh, the characters. In a show such as Saekano, the characters and many different personalities are arguably the most important aspect of the show. I'll briefly speak about the assortment of buffoons inside Saekano and how they affect the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, let's begin with Rinri-kun, also known as Mr. Ethical. Aki Tomoya is the main protagonist of Saekano and, like most rom-coms, is a male. Not only that, but he's a massive otaku. It's because of these features that many viewers of Saekano found themselves relating to this character and realizing:\\n\\n\r\n\"Hey, since Tomoya is a male and otaku, I can basically pretend that he's me!\"\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to my point that Saekano might be a great show, but the amount of fans that it can appeal to is limited and, to put simply, requires a previously aquired taste.\\n\\n\r\n90% of the cliches portrayed in this anime (which is a lot) can be found inside the personalities of Eriri Sawamura Spencer and Kasumigaoka Utaha. From the blonde Tsundere pigtails and snaggletooth to the long flowing black hair accompanied with a calm and cool attitude, these two are what keeps Sakano going. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Kanmei wasn't stupid enough to just fill their characters with the same bland broth we always taste; he made sure to add some special seasoning of his own. For example, though Eriri is the walking definition of a Tsundere, it's shown that she fakes this personality fearing that if she shows her true otaku self, she may not fit in and find friends. Oh, did I also forget to mention that she's an otaku? Also, Utaha may be that cool and calm girl, but her backstory reveals an interesting previous love interest with Tomoya. Additionally, she has an incredibly pervy side when drunk.\\n\\n\r\nThe staple girl of Saekano is known as Megumi Kato. Tomoya first encounters her on a hill as the wind blows off her beret. This scene is what influences Tomoya to creste a video game with Megumi as the main character.\\n\\n\r\nPersonality-wise, Megumi doesn't stand out that much. However, it's precisely because she doesn't stand out that she's the most memorable character in the entire series. Unlike the many other characters in Saekano, Megumi doesn't fall under any specific archetype. In fact, to this day, it's still a debate of confirming what type of dere she falls under.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi Kato is considered by many as the best character out of the entire cast of Saekano, and I don't blame them. With harem animes creating the same story over and over again with different characters and such, it's nice to know that some anime are still trying to break boundaries.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, onto Michiru. To be honest, Michiru is the worst girl in the entire series. She isn't needed in the show other than the fact that they needed someone to work in music. Eriri and Utaha have that constant rivalry and Megumi is there to make humorous retorts about the two as well as the relationship between her and Tomoya. In the 3 final episodes that Michiru was actually included in, she was a walking fan service bomb, which is the largest aspect people point out when listing negativities of Saekano. Oh, she provides a perspective from a non-otaku point of view? Nice try, we already have Megumi. With the second season of Saekano in the works, I'm predicting a large portion will be focused on Michiru in order to make it appear as if she's important for the show. However, first season-wise, she's less noticeable than Megumi.\\n\\n\r\nSOUNDTRACK\\n\\n\r\nThough Saekano is revolutionary in the comedy and harem genre, the soundtrack behind the show is painfully generic and would be what you'd expect from a rom-com sort of anime.\\n\\n\r\nNot much can be said about the opening and ending other than the female vocals were above average and that the lyrics were a good choice for the opening for Saekano. It's also worth mentioning that both the opening, ending, and entire soundtrack follow a sort of techno-pop sound, which is good considering the anime is about making a video game.\\n\\n\r\nSomething interesting Saekano does is provide a cover of the Gurren Lagann theme. Referencing other anime music doesn't happen often in other animes\u2014in fact, the only anime I recall doing so was Wake Up Girls. Scenes like this leave a large impression to remember that specific scene, especially if you've seen the anime referenced.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION/ARTWORK\\n\\n\r\nNow for my favorite aspect of Saekano: the animation as well as artwork. In a large amounts of scenes, especially in the beginning of the series, Saekano isn't stingy when providing well-detailed frames. This results with many scenes in Saekano very realistic and enjoyable to watch. Art-wise, A1-Pictures does a fantastic job, especially with the eyes, a large influence whether people watch a show or not. Additionally, viewers may notice occasional palette changes to characters in certain scenes. For those who've seen Ef, this isn't new. Directors may choose to do this in order to display what a character is feeling, or what sort of emotions a scene should evoke. Personally, I consider this technique creative, as a large amount of anime today choose to stay unexplorative and remain with prior techniques. Saekano, on the other hand, chooses to expand the boundaries of what anime should be and take chances. \\n\\n\r\nThough the animation and artwork excel is Saekano, I cannot fathom what Kanmei was planning to do in episode 10 where he doesn't even bother to color Tomoya's hair in a large portion throughout the episode. I'm unsure if it was intentional, or the animators were just too lazy to finish their work. Regardless, it was... Different.\\n\\n\r\nTHE BADS\\n\\n\r\nSaekano is an exceptional anime. However, no anime can be perfect and comes with a few flaws, if any. First of all, the audience of Saekano is extremely limited. The jokes are directed towards the anime \"otaku\" which have seen hundreds of anime and understand the many references that Saekano makes. Though these fans will thoroughly enjoy this, a large amount of the fanbase won't appreciate what Saekano strives to achieve, which leads to their opinions of the show to be drastically different than that of the prior segment.\\n\\n\r\nA large flaw, as mentioned before, that's criticized a lot during reviews is the fan service of Saekano. While I acknowledge that the fan service is certainly there, especially with Michiru, it shows how foolish you are when you include the fan service shown in episode 0 with your review. People don't usually include the specials, movies, and OVAs when reviewing an anime, so why would you include it in Saekano? Episode 0 is nothing more than a pre-OVA. \\n\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI know that Kato defies every expectation of a harem anime ever, but I can still say proudly that Eriri is  best girl, if you haven't realized it already. Other than Eriri, I enjoyed Saekano from the animation, many otaku jokes, the animation, the subtle anime references in Tomoya's room, the animation, watching the characters chat over Skype, and maybe the animation. This is why I hold Saekano on such high regard and consider it one of the best new anime this year.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nSaekano is an anime creates purely for anime fans and thanks them for watching with many humors and much laughs to be had. Though it cannot avoid showing many aspects that comes with the harem package, the wonderful director of OreShura and Dimension W next season did a magnificent job in offering the harem genre in a new pair of Air Jordan shoes. I look forward to speaking more about this anime when season 2 eventually airs, you guys are awesome for reading this review, Eriri is best girl, we out.",

            "content": "For a spoken review, click the link to my video review of this show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVKn113W_Q8\r\nAh, February. The month of love. What better way to spend the month dedicated to relationships other that watching 2D girls on my TV, and better yet, scantally clad 2D girls at that. So I've decided to dedicate an entire month the a genre known as ecchi. Welcome to the first video of ecchi month on my channel, as each Saturday in the month of February, I will review an ecchi show for your amusement. For the first review of ecchi month, we are going to be reviewing Saekano- How toRaise a Boring Girlfriend. I can honestly say this will probably be the best, and least ecchi show I will be reviewing this month. So without further adue, lets get into the start of ecchi month with a very enjoyable and surprising show, Saekano.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nSaekano is about the journey of Tomoya Aki, a high school otaku working part time to support his BD hoarding, as he prepares to kickstart his dream of being a dating-sim game creator. With remarkable luck, he bumps head-first into Megumi Kato-the most beautiful girl he has ever seen. Naturally, the meeting twists his life into a complicated torrent of relationships. Eriri Spencer Sawamura, his half-foreigner childhood friend who's always valued her relationship with MC. Kasumigaoka Utaha, a cold, composed renowned literary genius who shoves everyone aside from our protagonist. This show is the tale of a small not quite doujin circle, but not quite indie studio's journey through the tough territory of comiket and beyond. Now I believe that, for a series that focuses on mainly slice of life comedy, it's not right to hold it to the same criteria of shows of different genres. This show, as a whole, doesn't have an interesting concept at first glance, but this show has one interesting dynamic that made all the difference to me, and that is the character known as Kato Megumi. The way the show handles her character is the real highlight of the show, and the best example of how this show takes an average concept and turns it into something more. Kato's character is Tomoya's dream main protagonist of his game when he has a perfect encounter on a hill in the spring, but he comes to find out his dream heroine is just an average, unnoticeable, simple girl with no presence or any traits befitting of the main heroine he envisioned. The show's sense of direction revolving around Megumi makes her one of my favorite female characters of all time because the show does an amazing job of portraying her character, adding more to her interesting dynamic. The show uses off-focus camera angles, and many other ways to make even the watcher forget Kato is there. In terms of the show's execution, the real value of shows like these is the character interactions, and the scenarios that are set up, as opposed to incredibly compelling narratives and complex story devices. In this regard, the show does an amazing job of setting up scenarios that make use of all the characters interesting character tropes to always keep the show interesting. It takes a slow pace at first, starting off by taking a few episodes to accumulate all the members of the game-making circle, but afterwards becomes quite steady. In terms of the comedy aspect, this show uses a variety of references from the anime and otaku industry. If you are well versed in these, you will find this show incredibly enjoyable because of the subject matter of the comedy. Further on down the line, Saekano takes a detour through a more romantic/drama route, but doesn't veer off course enough to become to clich\u00e9, or to lose focus by keeping it fairly light. For the story, this show has a fairly simple concept, but has enough interesting story elements, and dramatic tension to keep you on your toes. The true appeal in this show is its style of comedy, focusing on anime tropes and otaku culture, and if that interests you this show is right down your alley because it does it exceptionally well. Also, despite this being ecchi month, the ecchi was INCREDIBLY toned down, almost to the point of nonexistancy, until episode 10. This is honestly a plus side for me, given I\u2019m not a huge fan of ecchi, but a downside given that this is ecchi month and it\u2019s kinda the theme of the whole thing xD. Episode 0, however, is full of ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOut of all the places this anime excels, the characters are the best example. At first glance most of these characters seem like standard anime character archetypes, but they are all given discerning traits that make them different and lovable in their own way, and honestly by the time the show was over I was sad to see them go. Aki Tomoya is described as an otaku and prefers reading comics and light novels, watching anime, and playing visual novels above anything else. After a chance encounter on a hill, he decides to recruit members for a circle to follow his dream of making a dating sim game that will win the hearts of all who play it. He's just one of those harem protagonists who somehow finds a way to have it in with the 2, arguably 3, most beautiful girls in school, despite his personality. As a character, Aki is one of the shallowest, not really having much to him aside from the fact he is an extreme otaku. We are given some insight as to what makes him tick, as well as his personality and outlook, but other than that he's pretty standard. The next character is Eriri Spencer Sawamura. Eriri is one of the most beautiful girls to attend to Toyogasaki High School. Her family is very affluent. Her father is an English diplomat and she lives in a mansion up in the hills. She is the secret illustrator for an over doujinshi circle called: ''Egoistic Lily'' under the alias Eri Kashiwagi when she participates in doujin activities. Eriri on the surface seems like a standard tsundere, but is given some interesting troupes that keep her from being TOO generic, and is also given some very good characterization through backstory and development. At first, I thought she was going to be just your standard tsundere, but she really is given enough to individualize herself beyond her archetype. The next character is Utaha Kasumigaoka. Utaha is a hardworking girl. Her usual disinterested expression strikes others as an unapproachable person. When she is alone with Tomoya's circle, she reverts to her disdainful self who enjoys making sarcastic remarks. She seems to be calm and quiet, but she actually has a sharp tongue, and can be a little aggressive. She is another example of taking a standard archetype and giving them something to individualize them. She may seem like the emotionless type, but is also given a good amount of backstory and characterization. Also, both of these character's (Eriri and Utaha) backstory and development give us insight into the mind of creators, why they create, and who they create for. This really gives them purpose in the show, especially given the context. These two characters showcase perfectly one thing this show excels at: portraying the relationship between consumer and creator. The next character, and the worst in the show is Michiru Hyodo. Michiru currently attends to a girl\u2019s high school and used to be part of all kinds of clubs on campus but recently started an indie band called Icy tail. She is preparing for her live performances every day. Michiru composes the music in the game by Blessing Software. Michiru\u2019s character is the worst in the show for the sole reason that she makes her appearance in episode 10. THAT\u2019S 2 EPISODES FOR ANY AND ALL CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Anything related to her felt forced, and while she was a fun character, given her limited screen time, she felt so empty. Now we move on th the final character, the best character in the show, and the holder of best girl, Megumi Kato. Megumi Kato is Tomoya's classmate, who is hardly noticed by others. She went in the same class as Tomoya since first year, but he never noticed her. After Tomoya had met her during the fate summons, she inspired him to make a dating sim game, and she as his Main Heroine. However, he is disappointed in her real personality. Megumi is an amazing and individual character, as contradictory as it is, because she is not an interesting character. She doesn\u2019t conform to any known archetype in anime, and it really separates her character. The show\u2019s sense of direction in the scenes where Kato is present is fantastic, making the cast and even the watcher completely unaware of her presence. The show does this in many ways including making sure the other characters are the main focus and her positioning within the scenes. The show, with Kato\u2019s personality and direction-sense, were used perfectly to portray Kato\u2019s character, showcasing the thing that most anime seem to forget: characters should be people, not archetypes. All the characters in this show truly feel individual, even though a majority fall under standard archetypes. They are given enough development and individual traits to make them all feel lovable in an industry ruled by character archetypes. This is just one of those shows where after I finished the last episode, I was sad to see them all go, and that speaks waves for the characters and how good they really were, Kato in particular.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nThe art an animation is another place Saekano does a great job. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, the sense of direction centered on Kato is some of the finest I\u2019ve seen, and I\u2019m not even one for all that cinematography stuff. The show does an amazing job of capturing Kato\u2019s unoriginality and lack of presence with the camera angles used, focusing more on the main characters in the scenes where other characters are present, as well as off-focus shots, with Kato out of frame. These things and many more work to shape Kato\u2019s character perfectly. The art style is bright and vibrant, setting a perfect tone for the setting of the show, and the animation is smooth, as well. The show even adds in small moments amidst conversations of mono-color, usually colors used to describe the characters who are speaking or being spoken about. In similar fashion, it also shows brief moments where the outline colors are changed as well. In addition to everything else this show\u2019s art does right, all the character designs portray their characters perfectly and all feel original and add to their lovableness, again Kato in particular. Aside from the weird CGI hand (things?), the art and animation for Saekano was somewhere I thought it excelled for many reasons, most notably its sense of direction. It used flashes of character-specific colors and alternate outline colors to spice things up as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI can honestly say the sound is one of Saekano\u2019s weaker points. It really is hard for shows like these to grab your attention with their soundtrack, in an anime where creating a perfect atmosphere with a beautiful OST isn\u2019t as needed. That\u2019s not to say the OST is bad in the least, however. This is just one of those cases where it just wasn\u2019t outstanding enough to make a case for itself. Although, the show did do a cover of the Gurren Lagann opening in the last episode, so bonus points for that. The voice actors all played their role very well, with, dare I say, Kato in particular.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nSaekano is a show that I would recommend to almost anyone. This show just does so much right. The story, while simple has an interesting dynamic that keeps it fresh, the characters, while most of them are standard archetypes all feel individual through traits that they are given and development and backstory that is revealed. And let\u2019s not forget Megumi Kato\u2019s character elevates this show to a whole new level in every regard, not falling under any archetype, and being an original and fresh character in a medium filled with predetermined character standards. This is possible by the shows amazing sense of direction revolving around Kato, and adds to the merit of this show even more. It also uses flashes of character-specific colors during conversations. Lastly, the sound does its job, but in a type of show where OST isn\u2019t all that important to creating an immersive atmosphere, really doesn\u2019t stand out. While in terms of ecchi this may be a terrible show, with little to no ecchi at all with exception to the last 2 episodes and episode 0, this show will go down as one of my all-time favorites. You know you truly enjoy a show when, by the time it\u2019s over, you don\u2019t want to see it end. I really was sad to see this show go by the time it was over. I didn\u2019t want to leave these characters, or the adventure they were having putting together this game. Luckily, a second season is confirmed, so hopefully it comes out very soon. As for alternate recommendations, I think you should check out Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu. This show is currently airing, but really gives off the same feel as Saekano, where these characters have an adventure in the world of game-making. And this show has Hanazawa Kana. And you should also check out Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de. This is another show I really enjoyed for being Nisekoi with superpowers, but at the same time with no superpowers. Both of these shows are harems, and I think you would enjoy this one, as well if you liked Saekano as much as I did.",

            "content": "Everyone desires for romance. No matter how pitiable one may have led their life, it's a feeling deep within everyone's heart to love or to be loved. In that purpose, entertainment grew to include romance. There's a lot of show out there that gives you the promise of a romance to fulfill that desire in your heart. Then there's Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata, coming with every other show that shares the same promise.\r\nWith that in mind, what makes Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata different from the rest? It follows the same set of character trope, follows the same set of progression, it serves nothing new interms of story either. But what makes it so good? To me, at least, it's the simplicity and relatability.\\n\\n\r\nMost shows out there are pandering to the mainstream audience through a flashy scene, cute characters, self-insert OP (this is a thing), or \"fanservice\". Yep, fanservice is already ingrained in our community deep enough, we couldn't possibly survive without them by now (or could we?) Saekano do bring them all in (minus the fanservice and self-insert) and managed to make it feel brand new to us. They got the flashy scene and cute characters. \\n\\n\r\n\"But, I see a lot of show with cute characters already.\"\\n\\n\r\nHold it right there, gentleman! I'm not done talking! Besides that criteria, we got a PERSONALITY.\\n\\n\r\nThat's right people! Personality in a character is hard to be made. You can try but did the audience get the personality you're trying to relay? You need to understand people to create an intricate personality and ironically the supposedly boring character in the show turns out to be the most interesting of all. I'm talking about our main heroine here. I won't go into depths-in analysis but trust me, you'll love her just like me (or not)\\n\\n\r\nThe show also tackles a lot in the territory of Otaku culture so, I can't say this is the most beginner-friendly show. You should try this when your understanding of Otaku culture is somewhat enough to understand the basics of tropes  (such a tsundere, yandere, kuudere, galge, eroge, etc).\\n\\n\r\nThe art is flashy, somehow reminds me of Shaft's style minus the absurdity. A-1 goes over the top with this one as I saw there were no signs of quality drop. It was consistent and that was great.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actor is good. The music is as usual. Nothing great, nothing bad either.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to summarize this, this is a show with light-hearted drama and focuses on the characters building for the second season since that where the real fun begins",

A good harem series can be that middle ground where i can experience a bit of everything from every genre. From drama and romance to action and comedy.\r\nSaekano or \"How to raise a boring girlfriend\" is not only an exceptional harem series, but also very inspirational. Now you may be asking the question, \"How can the words harem and inspirational go together?\"  Well it deals how our protagonist Aki Tomoya and the 4 girls in his circle who striveto create a dating sim game that will move the Otaku nation. The show deals a lot with Otaku culture, and the struggles and difficulties of being a creator. Which is something i found to be not only inspirational but  extremely relatable since I am a creator myself.\\n\r\nThere's also a lot of great lines used through out the show that can serve as great advice not only for creators but for anyone who has a dream they want to achieve.\\n\\n\r\nThis harem series, has some great comedy, a lot of which is centered around otaku and anime  references. Which most will be able to catch onto and get a good laugh out of. It does have fan service, but it's more subtle and done in a way that makes each scene it's used in more comical and enjoyable rather then the more direct and overused approach of having ass and boobs thrown in your face that some find to be annoying.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this series,  if you are looking for a harem series, that is not only extremely comical but also looking for something to motivate you. It's excellent. \\n\\n\r\nCheck out my video review on the series on YouTube: https://youtu.be/wC5TtR6qFrg",

It's about an otaku who have a \"Red String of Fate\" moment and decided to make story (Visual Novel) about it. But the comedy/joke is very good.\r\nThe art reminds me of Baka to Test. But a certain MC is a illustrator and the CG they make is just soooo good. I played a lot of VN and when I see that CG. I'm in awe.\r\nThere is nothing really worth mention about the sound.\r\nCharacter... This one amaze me. Most of the character have atemplates like 'twin tail tsundere', 'long black hair beautiful famous girl', 'high passion otaku'. But each of them were given more traits so I don't feel 'ughhh again with this kind of character'.\\n\\n\r\nI have to give a special section for the true Main Heroine. Megumi Kato. Like the whole basically revolves around her...no, The whole anime is for her. She is the mostt well done 'boring heroine' I have ever seen. She don't have any kind of special feature, her voice is super flat, she show no emotion on her face. In fact the anime know that she is a boring realistic/tsukkomi character. But you can tell how well done she is. With no facial/voice expression you feel it what the creator wants to deliver.\\n\\n",

I certainly think so.\r\nEnter Tomaya Aki an Otaku down to the very core that has a confrontation only seen in fairy tales. In order to capture this moment eternally he makes it his sole mission to make the best Visual Novel that anyone has ever gotten their hands on joined by his gang of a tsundere, kuudere, and his blank canvas of a main heroine.\r\nStory/Character:\r\n I'm going to go ahead and start this break down with what I easily enjoyed the most. Branchingoff of the vague description of the characters I gave prior if you have seen shows such as OreImo this group of characters may not seem that unique at first glance. However, I was pleased to see that over the course of the show we were delivered with detailed back stories for each character and how they tie back to the main giving them more incentive to reach the final goal. The set up of their development really leaves you in a pinch trying to choose your favorite\\n\r\n The story over I felt was very clever and it reminded me why I love anime and the otaku culture so much. Seeing Megumi develop as a otaku herself brought back nostalgic memories from High School sharing my favorite animes and introducing more than one friend into a culture that soon became a big part of their lives. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nThe art for this anime is very vibrant and appealing to look at. I never found myself at a loss of what was happening on screen and many scenes were accented with a unique filter. All of the small details that referenced different anime made the overall environment fun. The sound for this one is something I can't say drew me in, but it certainly didn't have any major faults. The highlight of the music was definitely a shout out to a certain famous anime at the end but I will leave that for your viewing pleasure!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of animes like OreImo, Oregairu, or Toradora I am positive you will fall in love with this anime. From beginning to end it consistently delivered interesting episodes and left the next season open for some intense character developments and more light hearted fun!",

HTRABG loves to play into all of this almost as a parody; as the characters are self-aware of all the anime tropes but it basically is dancing on what it already is. Also not exceptionally interesting characters: European blonde tsundere, the cold-hearted beauty who only loves the protagonist, loli and etc. They also throw in a villain who is briefly used and then suddenly becomes friendly with the protagonist when he is in a heated search for Eriri which leads to the stiff sequence I previously wrote about. \\n\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "A typical ecchi harem romantic comedy. If that's what you were expecting, then you'll definitely get what you want here.\r\nFor me though, I didn't really expect it since I watched it blind and only knew the title and that it sounded interesting.\r\nBut oh well. The anime is as stereotypical as it gets. The characters are cliched and the anime doesn't hesitate to show it and make references of it even, since almost everyone of the cast are otakus (and soon-to-be otakus). Heck, it's prologue's first scene is a hot springs scene and the characters' conversations are talking about anime tropes and cliches.\r\nAnyway, lots of boobhugs, cleavage shots, \"easily-misunderstandable-as-sex\" scenes, stereotypical awkward positions. Yep, it's as much typical ecchi harem as it gets.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, I guess that kinda takes a few points off for me, but if that's what you want then that's cool. It just irks me that they use the excuse of the cliched cast themselves making references of the cliched characters and cliched scenes. By making them otakus. Making fun of your cliched characters won't really make them much better and likable.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough... I did adore Megumi Katou, the titular \"boring\" character though. She's not the tsundere childhood friend, or ice queen senpai, or little sister-like kouhai, or hot carefree cousin. She's a plain, regular, cute girl who doesn't have much expressions except for her regular deadpan face. For some reason she already appealed to me even with that. Although it will be interesting to see how she develops (she's what the title about, after all), she already is moe to me. I guess the other annoying cliched characters add to it too with their clinginess and tsun-ness and stuff, by making her more appealing by comparison. But well, her very \"boringness\" herself since her character was first introduced instantly clicked with me already. I laughed a lot with her snarky deadpan comments, and it really disappointed me that this anime is not very focused on her and instead focused on all the girls of the harem. It's a good thing that she's the main girl though.\\n\\n\r\nAaanyway, enough talking about Katou (well, she's the titular character though so it should be fine). Shitty cast and cliched scenes aside, it's a story of a bunch of girls brought together by the otaku guy MC to enable him to chase his dream inspired by a fateful encounter scene with titular girl, who completely shattered his image of her when they meet. And the other girls, while helping him, develop feelings for him, have cliched scenes with him, oh and pursue their dreams themselves. In that aspect it's pretty great and inspiring. Unfortunately though there's too much focus on the harem, but oh well. If you were expecting from the title something like Chuunibyo, then it's not; it's more of a mix of Sakurasou and Nisekoi (if you know those animes already).\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are great somehow. That tsundere character's tooth was fking annoying though. Sometimes it's skin, sometimes it's a tooth, but it fking irks me that I had to include it in the review. The other character's designs are not bad and wouldn't have better if not for the cliched personalities. (man, I really should stop saying cliche) The OP and ending music are heartwarming, etc etc.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it didn't manage to turn me off so bad that I had to drop it (mainly because Kato is just so cute), I got a laugh every now and then (mostly because of Kato), and yeah yeah Kato the titular character is just the best that I just wish this wasn't a harem and focused on her development and the romance between her and MC. Still looking forward to Season 2, I have high hopes but low expectations for that.",

            "content": "Comedy, Ecchi, Harem, Romance, School. This combination of tags is seen frequently, and it usually doesn't mean good news. Oversaturated fanservice, recycled tropes, and a lack of plot movement is typically what these shows bring to the table. But Saekano is different, and instead satirizes these qualities to deliver some top-notch comedy. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nLike other harem shows, there is admittedly a lack of plot progression, so it's important to go into Saekano knowing the story is far from being over, and that sequels are necessary. To treat the first season as self-contained would be an injustice. As such, the story is more focused on therelationships between the characters rather than the actual making of their game. \\n\r\nThe first season is therefore mostly introduction and set-up for (hopefully) later seasons. Much of the show is the protagonist convincing the other characters to join his circle, which turns out to be quite a difficult task, considering he has complicated histories with all of them. Even after they agree to aid him in his endeavors, it's clear they have their own romance-related reasons for doing so. Can the protagonist truly unite the characters? Hopefully we'll find out. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNot fantastic art, but definitely good enough.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the OP and ED, and thought the quirky soundtracks were appropriate for the comedy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nReally the highlight of the show. As a satire, this show employs the generic tropes we see in harem: the childhood friend, the tsundere, the slightly incestual cousin etc. But by satirizing these tropes, it brings out unexpected scenes and presents scenarios that show just how ridiculous they can be. This ridicule of tropes is most clearly seen in the \"main heroine\" Megumi Kato. She is the complete opposite of what you'd expect in harem shows; she is neither the overconfident top beauty tsundere, nor the embarrassed shy clumsy unknown classmate. She is average at nearly everything, and she's closer to people in real life than in anime: she has things she doesn't care for, which she will express, but she will also work hard for things she wants to succeed in. She doesn't have some tear-jerking backstory, and the protagonist doesn't need to \"rescue\" her. \\n\r\nAdmittedly, since the other female characters are parodies of their respective tropes, the show does sometimes just falls back on them instead of trying to do something unique. This balance of being generic while making fun of being generic is hard to achieve, and even though Saekano doesn't do it perfectly, it does do it well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI love satirical comedy, so this show was fantastic to watch from beginning to end. If that type of humor isn't your cup of tea, I'd recommend not watching it, because the humor is its main selling point. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMy rating is probably slightly inflated, because it's hard to review comedy objectively. If you're not gonna laugh at the jokes, you will not enjoy the show. But if you want a comedy harem show that parodies itself, Saekano will give you something unique.",

            "content": "Simple plot, simpler characters, some humor to keep it fresh.\r\nA basic and simple opening to such a mundane show.\r\n[Story] 6/10 - I will let the synopsis do the whole plot thing for me. As it does a better job at explaining the plot. But! Let me tell you about how the story is progressed! This story is paced very wonderfully, it can be followed and it's rarely confusing if not confusing at all. Though the story has one major flaw. The Plot is so boring and simple! I honestly thought that most of the plot if not all of the plot was about characters gaininga relationship. Yes, I know that is a major component of the plot but hear me out. It's alright to have several sub-plots but I would much rather have arguments and interactions be solely about what they are doing. Not about sub-plot stuff 80% of the time. Sure it always ends up leading back to the plot but it shouldn't be the sole focus. This story could have been made better to balance the plot and the sub-plots a bit better. \\n\\n\r\n[Art] 8/10 - Animations are amazing in this show! Everything and Everyone just seem so fluent and the motions feel and look real! It's art style is pretty good too. Nothing amazing of course but it's good! There are very rare occasions that the animation and art look bad. I can think of at least 2 but! I'm not going to explain the scenes as they are spoiler heavy. \\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 7/10 - Everything sounds great, voice actors are great the music is great, both the OP and ED fit the show very well! Why is this a 7/10? Music choice during scenes is mostly garbage... Now don't get me wrong the music isn't bad! It's just when to play music is what is killing the sound section for me. Better music choice during certain scenes would make the show a lot better!\\n\\n\r\n[Character] 4/10 - Cliche characters the show... Every. Single. Character. Is so ungodly simple, that I guessed what the character sounds and acts like just by looking at their character design. Which is where 2/4 of my points in this section are from. Character design is great! They look like they act! Which isn't always bad! I would rather have someone act like they are shy and look like they are shy. Then have said character look like they run 80 marathons a day. There is little character development, and when there is it's a major character change. Which shouldn't happen all in one episode, when you develop a character they have to earn their change. Not have it basically handed to them.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment 8/10 - While for the most part this show is boring, predictable and simple minded. To my surprise, it's quite funny! Some of the character rants are funny, cringy (but in a funny way) and never seem to get dull. Sometime's it feels like this show knows that it's cliche and uses that as a joke in itself. I had a good time while watching this. Though it lost 2 points due to some episodes being boring nonsense.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall Score] 6/10 - While the show is very simple, that is not it's weakness. Boring and mundane characters drag this show down quite heavily. This show is neither good nor bad. A lot of this shows enjoyment really comes from what kind of person you are. If you are looking for a comedy show, check this out. If you are looking for a romantic show. Don't watch this.\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend this? Eh... This show is definitely not for everyone. If you are like me check this show out. If you are the kind of person that wants a more story heavy show, go somewhere else. This show's story is not heavy and just feels like a sub-plot most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nIf today is your Birthday, Happy Birthday!\\n\r\nHave a wonderful rest of your day everyone!",
