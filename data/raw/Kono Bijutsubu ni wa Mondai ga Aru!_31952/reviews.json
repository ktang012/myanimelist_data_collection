My heart went doki doki a lot lol. \r\nI bet many people thought this will become the romcom of the season, I did personally to but it's just a goofy show overall. \r\nThe story is something certainly I don't complain about, because the comedy and art always makes up for it. I just thought it kinda slow-pasted and a little boring at times.\r\nThe art was amazing. very fitting for the anime. Character designs worked well because it was very lightheartedand also the studio made the most important scenes have the prettiest colors. \\n\\n\r\nTo include in this, I loved the music as well. The music is so different from most anime openings I listened to. The voice actors made the voices sound really good to.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters were somewhat relatable, and because of that I loved the characters a lot. Collete is the funniest character lol.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think anyone would enjoy a comedy and kind of romantic anime so please give it a try.",

            "content": "Sometimes, a strong character cast is really all an anime needs to be successful.\r\nKono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru (or Konobi for short) is a perfect example of an anime which technically doesn't do anything particularly different from your average romcom, but it accomplishes what modest goals it has with flying colors. We have a standard middle school club setting and barely any plot development to speak of; the show is simply about the everyday events the characters experience in their lives, and their interactions with each other. No more, no less. But with characters as interesting and likable as these, and some goodlaughs to go with them, that's really all you need to still deliver a very funny and entertaining anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe story mainly takes place inside a quite typical middle school art club room. What are not quite so typical though are its members. Uchimaki Subaru may be a very talented artist, but contrary to what you'd maybe expect, he's not very interested in drawing apples, statues or landscapes. The only thing he's interested in drawing... is waifus. Perfect. Uchimaki is like a tongue-in-cheek representation of what people like to joke around that the average anime viewer is like. He's very devoted and serious when it comes to his waifu drawings, he claims to not be interested in 3D girls at all since they're impractical and \"incomparable to 2D greatness\", and he even gets into trouble with his schoolwork because he's too busy watching 30 episodes of seasonal anime every week. I'm sure a lot of the viewers can relate to at least some of those things, and the ways Konobi sort of breaks the fourth wall time and time again is part of what makes it so amusing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time though, Uchimaki's world views are much to the dismay of his fellow club member Usami Mizuki, who doesn't have any interest in anime at all and thus finds his drawings to be in rather questionable taste. But at the same time she also finds out that he is a very kind and easily approachable guy on a personal level, and she just couldn't help but fall in love with him over time as a result... however since Uchimaki is only interested in his waifus rather than noisy 3D girls, she's in a pretty tough spot. A spot which Konobi also makes great use of to be a consistent source of really great comedy. Especially since Usami's feelings are clear as day to literally everyone other than Uchimaki, and they never stop making fun of her for it.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the resident oddball duo consisting of Imari Maria and Collette (family name unknown). Maria is the only one whom Uchimaki can converse openly with about his interests, as she's the only other character in the show who's also into anime and manga. In a certain way she's even more hopeless because she's seemingly gotten quite a bit of chuuni fever from it as a result. Though unlike your typical chuuni girl, Maria doesn't really play her character straight but rather it's more like an occasional chuuni act she just pulls out because she thinks it's fun. She doesn't appear to be too delusional on the inside, but for some reason likes to act like she is. Collette on the other hand... where do I even start; this girl is borderline incomprehensible. Everything she does seems completely random and not properly thought through, like a little kid with way too big of an imagination. She also wants to be a super hero, so naturally seeing Maria's confident chuuni act was like finding the person she always wanted to be herself, and thus she wastes no time at all in asking to become her apprentice. And so we end up in a situation where a pretend-chuuni girl tries her best to teach an underclassman how to become a real one. You don't see that every day. There's also the (nameless) president of the art club in there but there's not a whole lot to say about him because his shtick is basically just to fall asleep wherever and whenever possible, and never actually contribute anything useful to the club.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a very simplistic show at heart, mainly consisting of shorter skits (about 5-10 minutes each) and not much actual plot progression. But honestly it doesn't have to be anything more than it already is. Just seeing these characters live their daily lives and interacting with each other during it is more than enough to provide a solid anime, simply because of how likable all of them are and how good the comedy is. There are a lot of meta cultural references taking jabs at modern anime fans (all in good fun of course) as well as a lot of more traditional romcom elements that are used quite tastefully. I should probably mention though that any romance fans out there might be disappointed in hearing that there is almost no romantic progression between Uchimaki and Usami at all in this anime, but you only need to watch a few minutes of it to figure that out on your own. It was never going to happen because that's not actually what Konobi is about. It's an infatuation used solely for the sake of comedic effect, not feels. Poor Usami.\\n\\n\r\nIt may be a very \"standard\" anime as a whole, with a common setting, normal animation quality and soundtrack usage, and no real plot progression to speak of. But the only thing an anime of this nature really needs in order to blossom is likable characters and generally good comedy, and that is exactly where Konobi's strengths lie. And as a result this was definitely one of the shows I was looking forward to the most every week this season; it's just so much fun to watch every time.",

            "content": "Kono Bijutsubu, or \"This Art Club Has a Problem!\"\r\nWhen perusing the new stuff coming in 2016, I was really excited for this one. I'm a huge Chunibyou fan, and seeing the art was similar was pleasing.\r\nStory: 6\r\nIt doesn't take much to draw a lot of Chuunibyou comparisons based on archetypes and character design.  However, even though there's a girl with Chuni in Kono B, it's story is its own and no where as serious or life-defining, but instead is much more about a girl with a crush on a guy who only digs anime chicks.\r\nIt's very much \"adventure of the day\", with no intermixingplot elements to bind the story, other than a girl crushing on a guy who likes waifus.\\n\\n\r\nIn some anime, there is basically 0 plot development. This is one of them. Where you start is where you end. If you like that sort of thing, where no one gets too heavy and it's all in good fun, you might be a fan. \\n\\n\r\nI prefer a bit more of an unfolding story. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nI love the Chuuni art style, and this copies it perfectly. In fact, a few of the characters could just be pallet swaps, to be honest. Still, this is my favorite type of color saturation / animation / art style. If you like softer and more colorful, this will do it for you. The last episodes animation is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound. 7\\n\\n\r\nThe opening score is kind of average. The end score is good but with weird visuals. The VA's are all great fits. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter. 6\\n\\n\r\nThe teacher is cute. The boy is different. The main girl is crushing on the main boy. No one so far has any surprises or value other than whats on the surface. The more anime I watch, the more I prefer characters who are more than a trope. This so far is the shows only real shortcoming. \\n\\n\\n\r\n-The president, a sleepy character who loves naps\\n\\n\r\n-Subaru, a love-oblivious kid who dislikes \"3-d\" women and spends his time drawing waifu.\\n\\n\r\n- Mizuki, a generic-on-purpose protagonist who loves Subaru, but is ignored by him.\\n\\n\r\n-Collete, a french student left behind by her parents. She's \"the weird one.\" and basically Dekomori with a haircut.\\n\\n\r\nA little later on, a new cast member appears, who shares many interests with Subaru, which annoys the crap out of Mizuki. She's also got 8th Grade Syndrome, refers to the \"Black Flame Dragon\", and is basically a bridge of concept between this show and Chuunibyou. \\n\\n\r\nSensei Yumeha is also a thing, but she's relegated to oppai fan-service.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. 8 \\n\\n\r\nIt's a good \"smiling\" kind of a show and one you can enjoy. You -know- how most episodes will end, but it's nice to watch it happen and generally the things they try to make cute, are in fact very cute and it's pretty funny. I genuinely laugh about once or twice an episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall. 7.4\\n\\n\r\n(Note, I weigh story and characters as double scores.)\\n\\n\r\nArt Class is an anime worth watching for some and will be incredibly frustrating for others.  The art is great even if the substance is thin, it's tropes we like watching over and over. It tries really hard to draw from other works, and ends up feeling like a weak copy. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a good production value kind of show, but it's very predictable and really nothing new from any other anime that's slice of life with an unrequited romance. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros and Cons\\n\\n\r\n++: If you like the Chuunibyou art, you'll like this art.\\n\r\n+: Good for slice of life without a huge cast.\\n\r\n+: If you like low-drama.\\n\r\n+: Is generally pretty funny.\\n\\n\r\n- - : If you want something thought provoking, like Chuunibyou.\\n\r\n- - -: If you are tired of tropes. \\n\r\n- -: 0 plot progression.\\n",

            "content": "Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! is a gag comedy anime about a dysfunctional art club with eccentric members and our main protagonist Mizuki Usami like it's written in the premise, hilarity ensues...obviously. So LA pose a question...is it funny?.\r\nWell before LA can answer that, LA needs to get to the technical first.\r\nIn terms of characters, we got an eccentric bunch of characters, yes even the main girl Mizuki Usami voiced by Ari Ozawa who draws apples all the time and has a crush on the 2D anime waifu \"artist\" Subaru Uchimaki voiced by Yuusuke Kobayashi, we also have Collette voiced by Sumire Uesakathe underclassman and member of the art club who is the trickster chunni type, President voiced by Kentarou Tone, the ever sleepy and sleeping president of the art club and Yumeko Tachibana voiced by Nana Mizuki the new advisor of the art club. If there was a character that was LA's favourite it actually goes to the Nao Touyama character of Maria Imari, an eccentric chunni who knows she is a chunni but still is one and a sorta of love rival to Mizuki halfway through the anime. Maria for what a \"new character\" introduced halfway through, she quickly and smoothly integrates int the cast and has GREAT chemistry with Usami and Uchimaki.  Really since Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! is a character-situational comedy, the character stands to reason be the focus and brings out the comedy as well.\\n\\n\r\nWell on speaking of comedy, the comedy in Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! is at best character-driven and because of it can be really subjective as to if you like it's humor or not. Do you like off-handed gags that brings out a characters motivation but as compensation have some of the gags be nothing but one off or have over exaggerated reactions, is the humor you're looking for more of a Chekhov's gun material where previous gags builds up to a bigger and better gag down the line, then this is the kind of comedy that you're in for. LA won't say that this comedy is FOR EVERYONE and laugh out loud, the anime's comedy at best got a couple of chuckles here and there from the characters reaction faces alone. Now LA won't say that Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!'s comedy doesn't meet ALL of the criteria LA just said as the comedy have some smaller detailed comedic moments (like background off-handed situations to running gags from way previous episodes making surprising comeback comedic one-offs later) as well as Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!'s best strengths is it's character chemistry with the main cast of the art club, really due to the characters chemistry with one another and bouncing off comedic moments and reacting in kind really makes the comedy shine for the better, thus LA can really overlook it's running gags as that is only the foundation for the comedic moments to work off of.\\n\\n\r\nKono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! also has some sentimentality moments mainly with characters like Yumeko Tachibana trying to bring the art club together during the cultural festival, Moeka voiced by Aimi Tanaka with President in one episode and Usami for your romantic sentimentality in which YOU KNOW where it's going. The sentimentality is what counts even if straight after the heart-warming moment leads straight into a comedic one-liner etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe only BIG issue with this is that since these eccentric characters have at best some lingering running gags to them (Mizuki's crush and tsundere act and apples, Subaru's cluelessness and 2D-waifu gags and Yumeko being a ditz and misunderstanding the situation to Collette and Maria's chunni misunderstandings). But LA already explained above how the repetitive running gags can be overlooked on how the situational comedy builds and work with the running gags instead of making it stale.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Studio feel. overall was presented with a nice and decent consistency as well as the poppy and vibrant character designs, even in the most comedic moments, they do resort of \"anime emoji faces\" but LA kinda sees that as kinda the point. Nonetheless the animation's overall ok consistency and atmospheric backgrounding makes the animation ok.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, well for a rather manzai-form of comedy, most of the voice actors either are the \"boke\" (the moron) like Uchimaki, Collette and if you wanna add her Yumeko-sensei or tsukommi (wise guy) the most obvious one Usami and LA will give liberties to President as this as well. Maria is more or less BOTH of these all due to her chunni-personality being ramped up and her situational moments can BACKFIRE on her. Nonetheless from this LA's favourite voice actors goes to Ari Ozawa and Nao Touyama because of this. What LA found more a \"playing against the type\" character was Nana Mizuki as the shy-ditzy Yumeko-sensei as she usually voices the more \"badass with a tragic backstory\" type of character...it was just something LA noticed is why LA brought it up.\\n\\n\r\nKono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! isn't quite the best comedy anime this season, it's at best slightly above average at best depending on the running gags or newer gags that were brought up. So LA posed a question to you at the start of this review, is this anime funny?...well if character chemistry, well-timed comedic skits and likable and eccentric characters does it for ya, then quite easily Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! is a good comedy to watch from Summer 2016, LA won't say it's the \"best\" as it depends on taste for comedy, comedy is subjective after all, but if you want a pure situational comedy from Summer 2016, then Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! is a perfect choice.",

Well, I can tell you with a straight face that it's not. Despite its cute character designs and simple plot, this series captured my heart. How? Well, for one, it's told in the perspective of the female lead. You may think it's a shoujo series, but it shows traits that even shounen comedy series would display, meaning it's made for both boys and girls. \r\nAnother thing that I liked was the art style. As stated before,it's all cute and adorable. But upon closer inspection, you can see how detailed the background props and animation was. In terms of art, this series tops any anime of this season. Of course, that's expected since the show is about an art club.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, it was a great experience watching this anime. I whole-heartedly enjoyed it 'till the end, and I'm sure you will too! Maybe then, you'll see the joy of being in an art club!",

The comedy is weak, with a hint of slice-of-life humour, more situational than actual comedy. the romance consists of one girl crushing on a not interested, oblivious boy, and the cour ends without anything changing.\r\nwell, that said, this isn't a bad anime. it looks good, music is well fitted for this anime, and character are cute. there aren't that many cliches used too.\r\nI'd really like to elaborate, but there's really nothing more to this anime. spoiling it is impossible.\r\nIf Ihad to sum it for for TL;DR, i'd say we get a full cour of fillers for some good, interesting anime. \\n\r\nwhich is ...good? bad? i guess good, cause the art is good, right? watch only if you have time to waste watching anime. nothing lost, nothing gained with this one.",

            "content": "[Story] 6\r\nFor the most part, KonoBi takes place in a generic school setting where the main cast spends their days in the Art club. The story revolves around the art club members but mainly focuses on Usa and Uchimaki. Throughout the show, we get to see Usami-chan's experience in having to deal with Uchimaki-kun's addiction, and don't worry, this story isn't that dark. This sets up a handful of hilarious scenes and minor plot twists that might squeeze out some air from your nostrils. The story doesn't do anything in particular with the school setting that would've changed the story drastically if it didn't takeplace at school. The romance is sprinkled in here and there, but any real romantic developments are usually shot down with a one-liner from Cole-chan or anyone from the supporting cast. Overall, the story is nothing groundbreaking, but it is able to keep your interest if you are willing to give the show a chance.\\n\\n\r\n[Art] 7\\n\r\nStudio feel. got the job done here. The animation takes a dip in the middle of the series, b/c im sure KonoBi wasn't presented with a commendable budget where they could splurge on animation. For the most part, the animation is very smooth and can be VERY gorgeous when it wants to be.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 6\\n\r\nAgain, the OST is nothing too special, sets the mood for the most part, and gets the job done. Casting and voice acting was pretty good imo too. Nothing else to say really...\\n\\n\r\n[Setting]\\n\r\nMost of the action takes place on a Middle School campus, where the character's would occasionally be seen in their houses or walking together on the street. The setting isn't used to a particular advantage, more as an excuse to put all these cute characters in one place. Nothing noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\n[Character] 8\\n\r\nThe character designs are nothing new, but all of the characters are extremely kawaii and fit perfectly into a middle school setting, my favorite of the bunch being Imari, duh. The characters are extremely relateable, Usami in particular, and this makes for a more believable, entertaining story in the long-run. You don't see much in the category of character development, and you could go as far as to say that there wasn't any at all. \\n\\n\r\n[Overall] 7\\n\r\nIn short, this show isn't an investment, you can pick it up at anytime and expect to see some good waifu/Imari action, and a good laugh or two. I know saying the characters are cute isn't a good reason to watch a show, but please just watch it, even if its for the cute Usa/Cole/Imari scenes. If you're the one who assumed that this would be another generic school/romance/comedy show, YOU WERE RIGHT, but this show steady pace keeps the watcher's devotion to story and character's and their daily interatctions with one another. \\n\\n\r\n[P.S. This is my first review EVER so if it was bad, I know, I read it too. I just had to review this so that people know that its not that bad of a show. Just give it a chance.]\\n",

            "content": "There are two types of anime I consider a \u201c5\u201d: those with an equal force of determinants and merits, and those that follow a formulaic and mediocre narrative used quite often. The difference is that shows described by the former are usually on the negative side, whereas shows described by the latter can still be a good watch; Konobi is the latter.\r\nProduced by studio feel (who\u2019ve brought the likes of OreGairu and Kiss x Sis) comes \u201cThis Art Club has a Problem!\u201d, a hilarious, lighthearted rom-com with emphasis on \u201ccom\u201d; Seriously, this show is funny. Definitely one of the greatest strengths of this show isthat it knows how every other rom-com plays out and instead of trying to simply be another one, it adds a couple pivotal twists to the setup and focuses more on the comedy aspect, making this show a unique and refreshing rom-com yet still allowing itself to be held back by the limitations of its genre-type. \\n\\n\r\nKonobi follows the story of a cute middle schooler, Mizuki, and the exploits that follow as she pursues her die hard crush on Uchimaki Subaru. This is where the first pivotal twist comes into play. Subaru is a certified otaku, the only girls he\u2019s interested in are what he calls, \u201c2D girls\u201d; yes, Subaru has 17+ waifus. No joke. The second twist is not so much a twist but a unique way of keeping things fresh, it\u2019s the setting: an art club. The only reason Subaru is in the Art Club of his middle school is so that he has the means to paint his 2D waifus day after day. Now imagine the struggles that Mizuki is accompanied by when she tries to pursue her crush on a man who\u2019s only interest is in anime and manga girls. It can only be hilarious, right? This twist to the genre and premise sets up a plethora of extremely funny gags that surprisingly, aren\u2019t a hit and miss. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason the gags aren\u2019t a hit and miss because unlike many other comedy-centric shows, it doesn\u2019t rely on slapstick/chibi humour or what I like to call, \u201creaction humour\u201d; reaction humour is a show\u2019s attempt to make the viewer laugh by having its characters react to something absurd in an overblown and eccentric fashion. The reason reaction humour is almost always a hit and miss is because since it\u2019s unpredictable and comes out of nowhere, it literally either hits your funny bone or misses it. While Konobi does have humour like this, it is never solely reliant on it. Rather, Konobi constructs its gags around a specific physical or abstract object (e.g. ruining someone\u2019s painting and covering it up), and the humour is pulled from the anticipation of how the characters will eventually interact, react, and deal with the object. The humour is not wholly \u201cpredictable\u201d, but on some level you build an anticipation in your mind about the end result, and when the show either matches or subverts your expectation it\u2019s funny regardless. The hilarity that ensues throughout the show is never consistently funny, there will always be a couple gags that may very well not entertain you, but for the most part the show\u2019s humour is well above average in terms of consistency of quality. Whenever you have a show with an overabundance of jokes it is a given that some may turn out being predictable and occasionally seem lackluster. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance element of the show is heavily downplayed, and rightfully so. Its consistent comedic and lighthearted nature wouldn\u2019t dare allow for serious and touching scenes of romance. Every time it seems as if Mizuki is about to move from a platonic relationship with Subaru to a romantic one, it\u2019s always just another setup to prey on and make light of Mizuki\u2019s naive and earnest pursual of Subaru. Many of the show\u2019s episodes are divided into 2 parts, with each part following the exploits of another character or another subplot; this division sometimes makes the show feel episodic but the events that happen always impact the characters and their surroundings, so there is a sense of continuity throughout the story. This division of episodes into comedic shorts greatly compliments the pacing as well, things never unnecessarily drag out and the viewer won\u2019t ever feel bored through repetition. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just\u2026 there, they all have their own contrasting personalities but they can still just be summed up in one liners, for the most part. This is perfectly fine, considering that the show never tries to be a super realistic revolutionary romance story, it\u2019s just a gag show, so as long as the characters are likeable and funny, for all practical purposes they can be considered \u201cgood\u201d characters.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Feel are really upping their animation game; this show has dazzling visuals. Just the first episode alone has this breathtaking scene where Subaru is drawing Mizuki in the art club room, with shimmering sunset light beaming through the window, enveloping the entirety of the comfy art room in a warm, cozy colour palette that is just captivating to gaze at. With subtle, meticulous and distinct dust particles drifting through the air in a carefree manner as well, studio Feel brought this show to life. With Konobi added to their resume and OreGairu Season 2\u2019s scrupulous character animations, they\u2019re well on their way to approaching Kyoto Animation level beauty. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty standard as far as anime goes, but one thing that should be noted is that Ozawa Ari, the voice actor of our protagonist Mizuki, also voiced Sakura from the equally hilarious show Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. Coincidentally enough, both shows are actually fairly similar in terms of plot, so if you liked Gekkan Shoujo I cannot recommend Konobi enough. The soundtrack for the most part is again, pretty standard, but there are a couple tracks that are surprisingly distinct and potent. They add a sense of emotion to all the scenes and make the whole experience just a little bit more enjoyable overall.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite the show not being anything spectacular, it is fairly memorable. I was entertained a lot, I laughed a lot, I found Mizuki cute a lot, and amongst other things I was able to leave this show satisfied with and happy overall. The gorgeous visuals, the surprisingly potent soundtrack and then strong voice acting left a reasonable impression on me as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.5/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the show does nothing spectacular, but with a couple amusing twists to the rom-com setup it allows for a solid and entertaining watch throughout. I\u2019d recommend this to anyone into who likes both romance and comedy, but usually prefers the latter over the former. For similar titles, again, I\u2019d recommend Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was informative and helpful.",

            "content": "Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! (dat copy and paste doe) is just one of the many ordinary series that are just out there to make us laugh, and to enjoy the shit loan out of moe. It's basically a daily lives of high school student type of series, where you got this club that not so many people are interested in. And the students within the club ended up doing stuff that's fun, and carefree (in term of their freedom to choose what to do, what sorts of activities) despite just being a fucking \"art club\". And the centralization of focus are solelyconcentrated on those clubs activities, and some external setting with its support/minor character in the story, to expand their gag for each episodes. And so far, this anime has been pretty entertaining, mainly, the fucking moe. Plus, there's this romance between our MC (who's dense af, just like any other Harem MC out fucking there....) and... I guess, the heroine of the story, Usami Mizuki. And so far, everything that's happening in this anime, or from what i see, is very generic. Although the things that're not so generic and cliche, or just too typical of an anime of this kind to do are.... comedy that this series are showing you. Well it's not really all that different from other of those typical ones.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you're expecting a good story out of this, then let me tell you this. It's a fucking slice of life anime, you don't expect a story out of it. You should prolly expect cuteness, gag, chill and relax environment, etc. because that's just the priority in most of any slice of life shows. Although I haven't finished watching the anime just yet. I could clearly predicted that our MC and our Heroine will never get together and they will ended up stagnating their relationship, ending nowhere, and restart from the very fucking beginning. This shits happens alot in these kind of romance anime where they teases you with some romantic scene, but something tend to happen in order to not have the intended things (developing love, getting their love through the MC or something) to happen. Or else that would just be the end of the story. Or possibly, not the end, but the end of the overall gag of the series that revolves around Usami Mizuki's interaction of embarrassment; in order to gradually win our MC over and make love, or began their romance maybe. \\n\\n\r\nBut overalll, this anime was pretty generic in term of setting, story, romance gag, dense MC, characters, the overly weird and illogical thoughts of a character to do a particular things, or actions that aimed to be cute (Take Collette for instance, or the female supervisor of the art club) and so on. But nonetheless, this anime is so god damn CUTE (or moe...) AF. But because i have seen several of these types of anime before, my enjoyment of the series are also being affected by that as well. However, it's still a funny anime to watch. Not for the story in particular, and maybe for the romance that would unlikely happen between our MC and heroine. But the moe gag should keep you on your seat, while watching the anime. Coz that's like the only thing about these kind of series that make anything out of their content amusing, or enjoyable to watch. Even though i did sometime skip some parts just because it's pretty repetitive, and boring at times. It's still an ok series to watch. Give it a go.",

The plot is lacking and nothing all that gripping but that's about what I expected. The art style isn't appealing but that doesn't mean it's some kind of spectacle to behold, the songs found in this anime are nothing special either. For your characters you have a kind cute girl who likes the MC, there's the MC himself being your run of the mill, dense as a neutron star otaku, an air headed girl, an otaku girl who serves as a rival to the mainlove interest, and the lazy senpai who does essentially nothing. Where have a seen this before? Oh yeah that's right literally everywhere. The show was fine, it was like empty calories: tastes good in the moment but in the end isn't filling at all. In all honesty this anime would have gotten an overall rating of 6 from me if the ending was at all satisfying, but it wasn't. Literally nothing happens and their relationship stays in the same place with zero character development anywhere to be found. Go ahead and watch this anime if you want to but don't be expecting a masterpiece because you will be sorely disappointed.",

            "content": "High school anime are a dime a dozen.  Whether it'd be moe-related, a bunch of students in a club or whatnot doing stuff, or maybe even the dramatic story detailing a person's life, high school is the most overused setting for any given anime.  So, how do you make such an anime?  Well, throw in a couple of oddballs in a seemingly normal club and you'll get a basic setup for your standard average anime of this type.  Konobi is just another piece in the long art gallery of high school anime where it doesn't really give us anything new, butdamn is it entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Our story follows Usami Mizuki and her exploits in the art club.  After having its new member by the name of Uchimaki Subaru, she begins developing a crush on the boy and his superior art skills, only to find out that his only motivation for even participating is the fact that he wants a place in order to create the \"Perfect Waifu.\"  Followed with their energetic and naive kouhai and their extremely lazy senpai, the title of \"The Art Club has a Problem\" is...pretty self-explanatory here.\\n\\n\r\nBeing honest here, Konobi is really nothing special.  Lovestory sideplot that goes nowhere, episodic stories that more or less return the series's status quo every week with every new episode, cliche situations, everything is pretty standard and so tropey that there's really no way to actually describe other than generic.  They're all plotlines that've been done before and as someone who's seen these stories before, they were all predictable and not really worth the time to ogle over in anticipation as to what would happen next.  So, what's really the intrigue here with Konobi?\\n\\n\r\nWell, in simple terms, it would be the way these situations are portrayed.  They're all pretty standard, yes, but the series plays with the straight man/funny man dynamic where practically everyone but Usami, our main protagonist, plays the strange/interesting person role while she throws out her own retorts.  Some of the character interactions are somewhat entertaining I admit, and the characters breathe a slightly different light into these generally bland and boring story concepts, thus giving them a slight different appearance to them, enough to be technically different, even if not really at its base level.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, what is Konobi?  Konobi is a series that slathers a new coat of paint on what would be considered as boring and tired storylines, thus giving the show a different perspective with its straight/funny man style comedy as well as utilizing the art club gimmick heavily so that it doesn't just feel like a bunch of characters doing something that doesn't even relate to the title or synopsis of the series.  (Lookin' at you, K-on.)  It's entertaining, but at the same time, but doesn't have enough to make the story interesting enough to be amazing or anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Mildly entertaining \\n\r\n+ New coat of paint on old tropes\\n\r\n+ Uses the series's gimmick often\\n\r\n-  Still more or less the same generic tropes\\n\r\n-  Romantic subplot got tiring\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Slice of life needs interesting characters.  If there aren't interesting characters, than you have failed in making an good slice of life anime that separates itself from the hordes of clones with a different name to them.  \\n\\n\r\nFirst there's Usami Mizuki, our main protagonist.  Mizuki...isn't actually all that interesting.  Her entire schtick in the series is to have a crush on Subaru while also hating him for his waifu loving tendencies and his overall detachment with the real world.  (Boy like that's not overdone.)  She's also got a bust complex, has low tolerance for random bullsh*t that happens around her, the usual.  While not really all that interesting in terms of character, her role in the series as the straight man comes into play a lot in the series usually retorting Subaru or the laziness of the club president.  As a result, she's usually the one creating the air of comedy or strange situation as the catalyst to a lot of events.  But aside from that, she really has nothing to actually explain her character.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Uchimaki Subaru, the other main protagonist.  As mentioned before, his reason for even being a part of this series is because he wants to be able to draw the 'perfect waifu'.  As an otaku-type character with detachment from the 'real world' and focusing solely on fictional women and their traits that make them cute, Subaru...really isn't all that interesting either.  Really, the main characters are probably the least interesting characters in this entire series.  His antics get Mizuki mad, and then creates the majority of conflict within the series whether they'd be major or not.  Most of the runtime is devoted to Mizuki's crush on Subaru and really, with uninspiring characters, there's really nothing to actually talk about with them in particular.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the more fun ones.  The art club president (whose name escapes me), Colette, Isami, and various other side characters like Moeka make up the rest of the cast and aid in making this show actually seem worthwhile and interesting to watch.  You have the lazy moocher, the bombastic and energetic confused naive kouhai, the chuuni, and the 5 year old who wanders away from her parents so much that she needs to literally be tied to her mother to make sure she doesn't get lost.  Without these characters, Konobi would've been bland and boring, and the kinds of color that they add to the series made it all more worthwhile.  Hell, they had an entire episode near the end of the series devoted to pretty much just the 5 year old and the club president, and goddamn is it probably the best episode in this entire series.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Interesting side characters\\n\r\n-  Kind of boring main characters\\n\\n\r\nArt: Well, if a show about the art club doesn't have good art, it's a crime, right?  Well, I suppose it would be, but Konobi really doesn't suffer much in terms of art for a hilarious twist of irony.  (sadly)  Though to be fair, the show's naturally bright and colorful atmosphere and style does suit the light-hearted art-related series about character interactions and the spring of young love.  Of course, while the art does look good, it's not that stellar in the way that I would give it a high rating (like every other one of feel's work), but hey, it's better than crappy animation.\\n\\n\r\nOne easter egg that I would like to address is the fact that all of Subaru's artworks in the series (since well, he does need to make art due to the theme of the series) are references to other girls in other series'.  So if you see a drawing that seems familiar, chances are it's probably a reference.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Fun references\\n\r\n+/- Good, but average artstyle\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Sound...isn't really that much of a plus in Konobi.  The OP \"Starting Now\" is probably the most noticeable and memorable of all of the tracks due to its rock sound and kind of addicting chorus, but aside from that, the rest of the tracks really aren't up to its standard.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also kind of average, so I wouldn't put much faith into this series being the best in the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Pretty memorable OP\\n\r\n-  Average in all other aspects\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  So what is Konobi?  What did I think of it?  Well, in simple terms, it was enjoyable.  It had enough to it to make me want to watch episode after episode despite its seemingly ordinary story setup and I genuinely liked some of the characters that they had, even if they were only side characters.  Of course, there was always room for improvement, but this was probably the best that you could probably make with a series of this genre.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nYes I did.  I especially liked the character 'Moeka', the 5 year old with grown-up tastes.  She's cute, she was interesting, and she was definitely not one of those annoying kid characters that you would want to punch for being a crybaby.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nI really didn't appreciate how the main characters were so plain and unoriginal.  Personally, I think it's a mistake to make the side characters more unique and/or interesting than the main characters.  Sure the side characters got their time in the spotlight to make them shine a bit more, but when your side character focused episodes are more interesting than those that follow just the main two cast members, you're doing something TERRIBLY wrong here.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nKonobi is special enough to be considered different from the rest of the dime a dozen high school romcom/slice of life episodic shows that plague the anime seasons year after year.  For that reason, I'd say if you're looking for something like that, than this is the show that you should be watching.  If not, than don't bother.  There's nothing stellar about it aside from being mildly entertaining enough to garner enough interest to continue watching.  Aside from that, it's a pretty average show with not much else aside from its gimmick to hold itself afloat.",

This is not the case, Konobi has a great paint (literally) that would make you enjoy all the 12 chapters.\r\nFirst, the characters, they are very honest and pure with its nature, adults, the normal students or kids, all have a job and the most of their job is circle their problems and jokes on Usami, each one with his/her own color that paint a great episode without you to put effort in understand and connect.\r\nSecond, thejokes, some so simple, another very carefully hidden, but all, all, come at the right moment to you to laugh or put a great smile on your face, in different weights, colors and sizes, so you don't gonna get bored or overwhelmed.\\n\\n\r\nThird, the story, it's simple, and your guide always will be Usami and her palace the Bijutsubu (including anther scenarios), so, at least, her interaction with the others gonna be the seal of A and B part of the chapters.\\n\\n\r\nWith these three parts are enough, this story knows how to do things without getting lost in the process, so the objective of laughs and jokes will be present in all the anime, in my opinion, a little jewel for past the time with enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nIf you felt useful this review or maybe none at all, anyway, thank you to reach this part and read my review, I wish you a good anime and I hope you can enjoy it!",

            "content": "I'm going to be completely honest here. The biggest reason why I wanted to watch this rather obscure 2016 anime that no one seems to talk about is because of the main character, Usami Mizuki. When I saw her in a trailer on Anichart, for some reason I just fell in love with how adorable she looked. So of course, we come to this point.\r\nAs I expected from Kono Bijutsubu Ni Wa Mondai Ga Aru, it ended up being a casual anime series, meaning that there isn't an overarching story with a lot of dramatic tension. The setting for this is an art club withmembers that are a bit weird (as you might have guessed from the title). And I will give praise to this anime for actually taking some effort in focusing on attributes related to art and I can say that I did learn a thing or two from it. However, that is not to say that they did a very good job with it. The anime does not go into great detail about the aspects of art, as there is so much more than could be incorporated. But to compensate for that, the anime has the main theme of romance in play.\\n\\n\r\nA huge part of this anime focuses on the main character, Mizuki's constant attempts at grabbing the attention of her crush, Uchimaki Subaru. And let me just say that the fact that Mizuki is the main character of this anime itself is a huge bonus for me. She is without question my favourite character in the anime. And seeing her never ending pursuit for love was just such an adorable and enjoyable thing to watch. Say what you will about her inconfidence to Just Do It, I personally prefer it if the girls are a bit shy. So all in all, I would say that that is the best thing in the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow to make a short comment about the side characters. While I appreciate that Mizuki is the main character, I kinda wished that the side characters were given a bit more focus. This is especially true for Mizuki's friends and Imari Maria. We hardly know anything about these characters and it would have been nice to know more about them. Although, I will say that I am really glad that the side characters are all so supportive of Mizuki in achieving her goal. It just made things so much more cheerful and I love that.\\n\\n\r\nNow, because this is a casual anime series, I would have to address more than just the romance. When it comes to the comedy, I can clearly say that it is not the best I have seen. Many jokes and funny scenes feel very cliche and generic. And sometimes when they try to set up a supposedly cool joke, I find them to be highly predictable (which in most cases, I was right about the outcomes) and in the end, they just turn out to be rather disappointing in my opinion. There are a few creative jokes here and there but it just didn't feel enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is done by Feel and I would have to say that it was alright but because nothing much goes on in the anime, there really isn't anything that truly stood out in my opinion. But at least it was nice that the anime has a rather cheerful colour scheme that made it nice to look at. This is art after all. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as for the theme songs. Let me first comment. Is it just a coincidence that Mizuki Nana sang the opening when we have a character named Mizuki in the anime or was that intentional? Well in any case, because she sang the opening, it was nice to listen to. Although I can definitely say that is not my favourite song by her. For the ending theme, it was an ok song but I really didn't think too much about it.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, while I'd definitely say that I still really enjoyed watching this anime. It felt like it went pass too quickly. It didn't really bring anything new in terms of comedy and there are so many things left that could be explored. Like I said, I really wished the side characters were given more attention. So in all honesty, I really hope that there will be a 2nd season for this anime. I have a feeling it seems very unlikely because of how little attention was given to this anime. But if Feel can focus on just the right things, a 2nd season would do this anime quite some good. Plus, I just want to see more of Mizuki anyway, so of course I would really love to see a sequel. Let's hope for the best.",

            "content": "As many reviews have already highlighted the good parts of this show, which are very few. I am going to tell you about the many bad things about this show and how i believe that this show doesn't deserve anything beyond a 5 overall.\r\nSTORY: 2\r\n This show has absolutely no plot progression to speak of, it has the essence of a comedy skit anime but it tries to have the story line of a linear romcom. The show fumbles over how to progress with Subaru's artistic ability by showing him entering one art competition, and that's it. There isn't really anything else to say abouthis unique part in the story. The story also shows Mizuki and her problems involving her love for Subaru, but like every other girl, she fails miserably. the only difference is that she actually lost to a damn anime girl. and that's the end of her part in all of this. Of course there is comedy involved in all of this but when you get down to it it falls flat when you actually look into what the show was trying to make funny.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8 - Art fits well and makes the show almost bearable to watch\\n\\n\r\n While the art wasn't anything to gawk at, it captured the cuteness of the characters and made the viewers have a pleasant time watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8  - Everything in place\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds of this show went very well with the \"story\" that this anime was trying to tell. Nothing was weird or out of place and all of the voices were well done too.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 2 - No Character Personality \\n\\n\r\nThe only saving grace of any of these characters is that they are cute. especially Collette, other than that, they all fall into some sort of ultra generic trope. I also couldn't stand Mizuki's constant babbling and crying over how much of a clueless dumbass trope character Subaru is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1 - None\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, i didn't derive any enjoyment out of this show. I actually consider myself to be a pretty mindless watcher. But the story's author seems to know even less about an average slice of life anime than me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2 - I wouldn't watch this show even again even if it was my mothers dying wish\\n\\n\r\nAs most people do who value their time, they only look at the overall section. So i only have one thing to say. Like another reviewer of another anime said, \"Avoid this flaming pile of shit like the plague.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "My score was a solid 7.6, which I have rounded off to an 8 without much hesitation.\r\nKonobi offers what most romcoms do, but with consistent art and characters which actually DON'T irritate one to the core.\r\nCharacters: 9\r\nIn romcoms, I usually dislike the female lead, because she tends to be too over the top, or 'moe' or cutesy. Or the animators do her injustices by trying to bring our her 'physical attributes', which I as a female viewer dislike.\r\nHowever, Konobi's Usami Mizuki is an absolute sweetheart, and you can't help but want to hug her in sympathy of her hopeless situation. She remains strong and witty,while the whole time displaying the weaknesses of a girl in love. She is the backbone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nUchimaki Subaru is adorable, and although an incredible pain in the side where Usami is concerned, I fully understand why she is so enamored by him. He's a very well-written character, showing a young 13-14 year old boy, and, apart from his 2D obsession, is your classic young middle schooler, with mood swings and backhanded comments and opinions.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it doesn't lose out on its side characters either. Apart from the other members of the club, I found Usami's friends to be absolutely endearing. They largely exist to tease her, but they do it in that gentle way friends do, and I loved having them around.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, characters are easily this show's strong point, as not one was irritating, down to little random Moeka on the streets.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nAnother thing I'd like to mention was the art. It was consistent, unlike shows where the nose is suddenly disproportionate to the face randomly in episode 7. No, throughout, the show was visually appetizing and you could see the care with which the creators animated this.\\n\r\nApplause!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nI binge watched this over a span of a day, and my only regret is that it is over. May we see many more wonderful shows like Konobi, where characters, which are indeed the life of the show, are given justice.",

Spoilers ahead!)\r\nKono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! brings me back to when I was a teenager.\r\nIn middle school, I enrolled in an art class. I was (and still am) not an artist, and I had no huge drive to become one. So, I mainly saw the class as a free period or at least one where I didn\u2019t have to worry about much at all.\r\nDespite my low motivation, I learned a lot. Colors, shading, and perspective. I distinctly remember creating a two-faced jar and a rolled-up tube of toothpaste. Both were made from clay (thenpainted), and both were placed on the shelf in the basement for family and guests to see.\\n\\n\r\nKonobi does not teach its audience anything about art on an educational level, but it certainly knows how to get its audience laughing.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nKonobi centers on an art club filled with a handful of kooky characters. Usami, Uchimaki, Collette, and President (the senior without a name) are normal students like everybody else at their middle school. However, and as the title implies, they encounter random problems on the regular, putting them in silly, everyday situations.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is like a multicolored can of paint. It contains one part slice-of-life, one part romance, and one part comedy. All mixed together into a colorful concoction that works on most blank canvases.\\n\\n\r\nThe blue slice-of-life takes on a mini-story format. Each episode contains two or three small stories that target mundane situations. Losing an item, getting locked in a storage room, and trying to clean a pool are not exactly exciting, but they give the cast the opportunity to explore the simpler side of life. Almost as if each tiny arc is a new drawing that the show creates and the audience beholds.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the list above, a key factor is missing: art. Like many anime of this type, art is not the point but rather the glue that holds it all together. Yes, they make a sculpture or participate in competitions, but the bonding that they share is infinitely more important than the brush techniques they are using.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that the anime has an ever-so-slight focus on sexual material. Tachibana-sensei attempting to put on a tight maid outfit or Uchimaki pointing out that he can see Usami\u2019s panties for the hundredth time are funny in the moment. But, in hindsight, these instances do not fit well with the anime\u2019s friendly, everyday tone (let alone that the setting is literally a middle school).\\n\\n\r\nThe red romance seeps into most of the gaps. Due almost entirely to Usami, her mega crush on Uchimaki drives much of the anime\u2019s direction. From the small, endearing jig she does after getting his number or threatening President with deletion should he delete said number from her phone, most of the situations, in some form, relate back to the romantic tones.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, \u201cromance\u201d may be too strong of a word, for what the anime shows is more akin to \u201cextreme teasing\u201d or \u201cultimately nothing\u201d than the lovey-dovey gushing the audience wants.\\n\\n\r\nUsami more than brings the romance; it\u2019s Uchimaki who is the problem. He does not just misunderstand Usami but rather actively turns her down. He will wave off her thoughts with a \u201cJust kidding!\u201d or constantly remind everyone that he only likes two-dimensional girls. His utter lack of interest ruins many of the scenes in a frustrating manner, leaving the audience to roll their eyes as Usami (inevitably) fails to get across her feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThe yellow comedy arguably stands as the foundation of the entire anime. The jokes it delivers are not necessarily clever, but they can be subtle, rewarding its audience with small fits of laughter should they pick up on the references to earlier episodes or the actions taken by the cast. When Uchimaki points out that Tachibana is passed out on the floor again or when Usami\u2019s arm is raised into the scene before the punchline hits, Konobi allows for simple yet effective jokes to thrive throughout its run.\\n\\n\r\nSubtlety isn\u2019t its only comedic brand, but that\u2019s both a blessing and a curse. Straightforward funnies, such as when the manga clerk puts on a smile and says to herself that she wants Usami, Imari, and Uchimaki to leave because they are causing a ruckus, are easily funny. Same goes for its visual gags: a red punch mark imprinted on Uchimaki\u2019s cheek, President slowly losing his sanity with cleaning pop cans. And again with its on-the-spot humor such as when Usami and Uchimaki never recognize the overly competitive student who challenges Uchimaki to contests.\\n\\n\r\nBut when the anime constantly relies on the say-it-will-not-happen-but-it-happens-anyway shtick or the he-said-something-weird-so-let-me-tell-him-it-is-weird formula, the anime devolves into a series of same-y jokes that keep the characters from being as comedically creative as the art they produce.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, Konobi\u2019s paint is not the most appealing in the world, but it forms enough fun to make it worth using on the walls of any clubroom.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nArguably, Konobi\u2019s best quality is the art and animation it so regularly uses.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, to start out, it should be noted that the settings itself is plain. It\u2019s in a school and, worse still, it primarily takes place in the same location \u2013 the art club \u2013 almost the entire time. However, what it lacks in background variety it makes up for in artistic appeal.\\n\\n\r\nLook back at episode three. When Collette is first introduced, and she enlists Uchimaki\u2019s help to find her locket (\u201cthe kind that can\u2019t fly\u201d), she eventually stops to inspect a poster. To get Collette\u2019s attention, he tugs on her arm. But he does so off camera, so the shot shows only Collette\u2019s slight jostle.\\n\\n\r\nThat honestly does not seem like much, but this nuanced movement highlights how much care the animation is given. I.e., since the art is \u201cimmobile,\u201d many more resources are spent on the characters and their mobility. Scenes like Usami running up steps to meet Uchimaki on a bridge are noticeably fluid, and such scenes are seen at different points throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also includes many reactions from the characters. Round eyes, triangular mouths, and tons of blushing elevate its comedy to an even greater degree. Often times, these reactions are coupled with colorful or more artsy backgrounds that play along with the fun and the art motif, subsequently boosting the comedy yet again.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters\u2019 designs, they are not as impressive as the animation or the colorful, comedic art. But they do have their merits.\\n\\n\r\nUsami\u2019s bob-cut hairdo and bunny hair clip gives her a tomboy look while accentuating her girly behavior. Collette\u2019s long, blonde hair contrasts well with her green eyes, her bit of hair that stands up gives her a silly, childlike look, and her short stature adds to her cuteness levels. And President\u2019s ragged hair, loose-and-white button-up shirt, and propensity for wearing no shoes highlight his laziness to the max.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nKonobi fails in one major regard: varying up the character scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast contains six different people. Usami, Uchimaki, Collette, Imari, President, and Tachibana-sensei. Technically, more characters exist throughout the season, but these six are undoubtedly the main ones focused on.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as the opening sentence declares, the anime does not do enough to populate its scenes with different pairings. Most notably, the whole group hardly ever do anything together. As the season progresses, Collette and President appear less and less. And Tachibana-sensei and Imari, who arrived a quarter of the way and halfway through the season respectively, barely get any screen time once their introductory episodes conclude.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say that the characters themselves do not have their relationships in place. Tachibana-sensei is harsh on Collette, President always comes very close to revealing Usami\u2019s feelings for Uchimaki, Imari becomes Collete\u2019s \u201cmaster,\u201d President has a thing for Tachibana-sensei, and Usami (obviously) loves Uchimaki. But, for whatever reason, Konobi does not like to experiment with other and multiple pairings, sticking instead with the ones it already has.\\n\\n\r\nOn an individual scale, the characters have their roles and their types, allowing the slice-of-life, romance, and comedy to prosper when necessary.\\n\\n\r\nUsami gets extremely flustered when she deals with Uchimaki or people tease her about her feelings. But she also is not afraid to get overly violent should somebody (usually President) happen to annoy her. Her friends (especially Kaori) support her in her doomed quest, and she never gives up, even when her name is on the line.\\n\\n\r\nUchimaki cares only for two-dimensional girls, believing that three-dimensional ones are a nuisance unworthy of his attention. He can also draw and paint quite well, and he has a subtle kindness to him that isn\u2019t immediately apparent.\\n\\n\r\nCollette hails from America, and she is about as goofy as possible. Doing magic tricks, wearing bird heads, and believing in justice, this recent elementary-school graduate only sees the happier side to life no matter what she may be doing.\\n\\n\r\nPresident takes his sleeping seriously, making sure to use the club room\u2019s couch (and their own funds) to his advantage to catch a wink. While he rarely participates in club activities, and he may seem unreliable, he looks out for the others whenever possible.\\n\\n\r\nTachibana-sensei always has her heart in the right place. She practices her motivational phrases, awards fancy marks as positive reinforcement (even if they happen to ruin Uchimaki\u2019s painting), and she encourages the club in their endeavors. She has a strict side, but her cute behavior (intentional or not) wins over most people that she meets.\\n\\n\r\nImari is a girl who, like Uchimaki, loves manga and all-things two-dimensional. She has chuunibyou tendencies, believing that her arm contains a demonic power that she must control. Usami sees Imarii as a threat to her (Usami\u2019s) own feelings for Uchimaki at first, but, as she gets to know more about Imari\u2019s athleticism and ability to listen to others, it becomes apparent that Imari is less a rival and more a friend.\\n\\n\r\nLike the story, almost none of the characters here deal much with art. However, and sticking with themes, they each have a \u201cproblem\u201d all their own. \u201cProblems\u201d which the audience can clean from their base characteristics. Usami obsesses over Uchimaki. Uchimaki pines after two-dimensional girls. Collette acts like a child. President is way too lazy. Tachibana-sensei cannot speak properly. And Imari plays out her imaginative thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nSince the anime is a romantic-comedy, these \u201cproblems\u201d are never addressed as fixable ones. But that\u2019s okay. They are what give the characters and the show in general the foundation to present its content, so one should not expect them to change much at all throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nKonobi\u2019s musical offerings are once again like the rest of its qualities. That is, while nothing manages to be super impressive, it contains certain pieces here and there that stick out in a positive way.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, the tiny transition piece that plays when one scene switches to another is this quick, dropping sound that adds a bit of charm to the show. Same goes for the transition piece between the mini-stories. A simple set of piano notes that skip happily along make the switch comforting rather than jarring.\\n\\n\r\nThe smaller sound-effects, like the rattling that Usami does when questioned about her romantic feelings for Uchimaki, continue to up the playfulness of the show and add to it even more comedy chops.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting also has its moments. Sumire Uesaka as Collette achieves silliness with ease, especially when she makes her own sound-effects for teleporting-locket magic tricks. Ari Ozawa as Usami speaks cutely whenever she blushes (which happens all the time). And veteran Nana Mizuki as Tachibana-sensei uses a younger, more girly voice that fits the novice teacher well.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack goes with lots of piano, flutes, and wooden instruments to up its lighthearted atmosphere. Stepping drums, clapping beats, and extra chimes add variety to the OST while continuing with the slice-of-life feel it aims for. Plus, the handful of insert songs, like when the club cleans the pool or as the final, closing track in episode twelve, prove Konobi\u2019s attention to its music.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track relies mostly on guitar and drums for its first half, but, as the song progresses, the distorted sounds, background vocals, and fast-paced instruments craft the piece into a livelier one that starts each episode off with fun in mind. At the minimum, the chanting \u201cHey!\u201d and beat itself are catchy enough to follow along with.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track goes a little weird. The instruments and sounds are simultaneously all over the place and organized, giving it a semi-chaotic composition that, in a way, comes off as artsy. Techno drums, faint background vocals, and off-kilter notes make this direction even more apparent. The singing itself is normal, but it contrasts with the weirdness, making said weirdness that much more noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is one of those shows that just goes forgotten among the more unique, popular, or truly awful within its season. I almost never see anyone else talk about this anime in the community since it has aired \u2013 and I think that\u2019s a shame.\\n\\n\r\nBut I can understand why. From the analysis above, it\u2019s pretty clear that the show does not do anything amazing, and it does not do anything horrible. It just coasts along the middle ground for nearly its entire run.\\n\\n\r\nOn a personal level, I see a similar yet different outcome. None of the characters are memorable, but Collette\u2019s carefree quirkiness, Usami\u2019s immense cuteness, and Tachibana-sensei\u2019s good spiritedness were a ton of fun throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the mini-stories also had me laughing out loud. President and Uchimaki ruining Usami\u2019s picture with red paint. Collette\u2019s locket situation. The \u201ctreasure\u201d they find and subsequently try to hide. These scenes and more had me in high spirits for most of its run.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, for those that know me, they know that I am huge on romance. It\u2019s my favorite genre, after all. So, when I say that I loved the romantic moments involving Usami, I mean it. Uchimaki visiting her house to give Usami her printouts, the indirect kiss with the drinks, and when they got locked up in the storage room got me smiling wide and \u201cAww!\u201d-ing hard.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite romance moment, though, was the classic dinner-bath-or-something-else scene. Seeing them as a married couple in Usami\u2019s imagination, catching the reference to Usami\u2019s apple painting hanging on the wall, and watching Usami steam up the room due to having these thoughts made for a wonderful romantic-comedy scene.\\n\\n\r\nI was really hoping, hoping beyond hope, that Uchimaki was playing the long con. That his constant pushback and persona was just a fa\u00e7ade to get him closer to Usami. And that, by the end, the show would pull the reverse-reverse and make it Usami herself that he had fallen for. That would have been awesome as a joke and to give me the ultimate romance payoff.\\n\\n\r\nAlas, it was not meant to be. Yes, we got the ending exchange between the two where, for maybe a second, he reconsiders his thoughts on three-dimensional girls and Usami. But that was not enough in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nKono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! may not be on the forefront of everyone\u2019s mind, but it stands solid nonetheless. Its subtle jokes, attention to animated detail, and a penchant for romance justify this mindset. While the characters and the content itself may ultimately be too plain, it no doubt gets higher marks than a rolled-up toothpaste project.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, a colorful mixture of slice-of-life, romance, and comedy that is worthy of being on the walls of any clubroom\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, fluid animation techniques, hilarious reactions, and some thoughtful character designs keep the visuals looking strong\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Usami, Uchimaki, and the others each have their \u201cproblems\u201d that form the foundation for the romantic-comedy direction taken\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, okay OP, good ED, good OST, and good VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, while Usami and Uchimaki\u2019s relationship goes nowhere, the characters were silly, the comedy was fun, and the romantic moments were awesome\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "This is a better then usual anime I found. (in short I should say that is)\r\nLets start out with the story shall we.\r\nThe story is kind of structured like a generic Slice of Life or Romcom (Which I feel it was both). It makes the story run a bit slow at times and sometimes throws you into interesting scenarios. But although I quite enjoyed the concept of the story and even though it ran a bit dry from time to time it still had this thing that kept me coming back for more. Just to see really what wacky things the characters would be upto next.\\n\\n\r\nI'm just going to add my Art and sound together.\\n\\n\r\nI found these both to be about average the art style is kind of quirky and different but nothing I'd write a whole paragraph about so... Meh?\\n\\n\r\nWhile I found the opening theme to be one of the better ones I've heard I also found that that's about all I remember from the soundtrack. But the emotion in the voices were great so good for them?\\n\\n\r\nNow time for Characters (and this is the exciting part I found)\\n\\n\r\nSo the characters are really what made this story and the anime so great to watch. Let's put it this way there is kind of a Love Triangle (if you could call it that) between a main character (there are a few of them) another main characters and his \"waifu's\". Now this makes things a bit hard for the main character and gives her conflict that pretty much makes up the entire story. If she really can handle all of this and although you don't really see herself grow as a character the story is set in such a way that you've seen how she got there. While that happens the other characters kind of act as the almost sitcom style comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nNow it'd be hard to get into why I enjoyed it so much without giving anything away but I'll just say that it's all about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I found this to be quite enjoyable but due to how the story can easily run dry (especially if you try to watch large amounts in a single sitting), you may want to watch this series in smaller dosses. The comedy is pretty original with the occasional anime typical jokes thrown in there too. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading and hope this helped you a bit",

The voice actors made the voices sound really good to.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters were somewhat relatable, and because of that I loved the characters a lot.

            "content": "Sometimes, a strong character cast is really all an anime needs to be successful.\r\nKono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru (or Konobi for short) is a perfect example of an anime which technically doesn't do anything particularly different from your average romcom, but it accomplishes what modest goals it has with flying colors. We have a standard middle school club setting and barely any plot development to speak of; the show is simply about the everyday events the characters experience in their lives, and their interactions with each other. No more, no less. But with characters as interesting and likable as these, and some goodlaughs to go with them, that's really all you need to still deliver a very funny and entertaining anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe story mainly takes place inside a quite typical middle school art club room. What are not quite so typical though are its members. Uchimaki Subaru may be a very talented artist, but contrary to what you'd maybe expect, he's not very interested in drawing apples, statues or landscapes. The only thing he's interested in drawing... is waifus. Perfect. Uchimaki is like a tongue-in-cheek representation of what people like to joke around that the average anime viewer is like. He's very devoted and serious when it comes to his waifu drawings, he claims to not be interested in 3D girls at all since they're impractical and \"incomparable to 2D greatness\", and he even gets into trouble with his schoolwork because he's too busy watching 30 episodes of seasonal anime every week. I'm sure a lot of the viewers can relate to at least some of those things, and the ways Konobi sort of breaks the fourth wall time and time again is part of what makes it so amusing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time though, Uchimaki's world views are much to the dismay of his fellow club member Usami Mizuki, who doesn't have any interest in anime at all and thus finds his drawings to be in rather questionable taste. But at the same time she also finds out that he is a very kind and easily approachable guy on a personal level, and she just couldn't help but fall in love with him over time as a result... however since Uchimaki is only interested in his waifus rather than noisy 3D girls, she's in a pretty tough spot. A spot which Konobi also makes great use of to be a consistent source of really great comedy. Especially since Usami's feelings are clear as day to literally everyone other than Uchimaki, and they never stop making fun of her for it.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the resident oddball duo consisting of Imari Maria and Collette (family name unknown). Maria is the only one whom Uchimaki can converse openly with about his interests, as she's the only other character in the show who's also into anime and manga. In a certain way she's even more hopeless because she's seemingly gotten quite a bit of chuuni fever from it as a result. Though unlike your typical chuuni girl, Maria doesn't really play her character straight but rather it's more like an occasional chuuni act she just pulls out because she thinks it's fun. She doesn't appear to be too delusional on the inside, but for some reason likes to act like she is. Collette on the other hand... where do I even start; this girl is borderline incomprehensible. Everything she does seems completely random and not properly thought through, like a little kid with way too big of an imagination. She also wants to be a super hero, so naturally seeing Maria's confident chuuni act was like finding the person she always wanted to be herself, and thus she wastes no time at all in asking to become her apprentice. And so we end up in a situation where a pretend-chuuni girl tries her best to teach an underclassman how to become a real one. You don't see that every day. There's also the (nameless) president of the art club in there but there's not a whole lot to say about him because his shtick is basically just to fall asleep wherever and whenever possible, and never actually contribute anything useful to the club.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a very simplistic show at heart, mainly consisting of shorter skits (about 5-10 minutes each) and not much actual plot progression. But honestly it doesn't have to be anything more than it already is. Just seeing these characters live their daily lives and interacting with each other during it is more than enough to provide a solid anime, simply because of how likable all of them are and how good the comedy is. There are a lot of meta cultural references taking jabs at modern anime fans (all in good fun of course) as well as a lot of more traditional romcom elements that are used quite tastefully. I should probably mention though that any romance fans out there might be disappointed in hearing that there is almost no romantic progression between Uchimaki and Usami at all in this anime, but you only need to watch a few minutes of it to figure that out on your own. It was never going to happen because that's not actually what Konobi is about. It's an infatuation used solely for the sake of comedic effect, not feels. Poor Usami.\\n\\n\r\nIt may be a very \"standard\" anime as a whole, with a common setting, normal animation quality and soundtrack usage, and no real plot progression to speak of. But the only thing an anime of this nature really needs in order to blossom is likable characters and generally good comedy, and that is exactly where Konobi's strengths lie. And as a result this was definitely one of the shows I was looking forward to the most every week this season; it's just so much fun to watch every time.",

            "content": "Kono Bijutsubu, or \"This Art Club Has a Problem!\"\r\nWhen perusing the new stuff coming in 2016, I was really excited for this one. I'm a huge Chunibyou fan, and seeing the art was similar was pleasing.\r\nStory: 6\r\nIt doesn't take much to draw a lot of Chuunibyou comparisons based on archetypes and character design.  However, even though there's a girl with Chuni in Kono B, it's story is its own and no where as serious or life-defining, but instead is much more about a girl with a crush on a guy who only digs anime chicks.\r\nIt's very much \"adventure of the day\", with no intermixingplot elements to bind the story, other than a girl crushing on a guy who likes waifus.\\n\\n\r\nIn some anime, there is basically 0 plot development. This is one of them. Where you start is where you end. If you like that sort of thing, where no one gets too heavy and it's all in good fun, you might be a fan. \\n\\n\r\nI prefer a bit more of an unfolding story. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nI love the Chuuni art style, and this copies it perfectly. In fact, a few of the characters could just be pallet swaps, to be honest. Still, this is my favorite type of color saturation / animation / art style. If you like softer and more colorful, this will do it for you. The last episodes animation is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound. 7\\n\\n\r\nThe opening score is kind of average. The end score is good but with weird visuals. The VA's are all great fits. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter. 6\\n\\n\r\nThe teacher is cute. The boy is different. The main girl is crushing on the main boy. No one so far has any surprises or value other than whats on the surface. The more anime I watch, the more I prefer characters who are more than a trope. This so far is the shows only real shortcoming. \\n\\n\\n\r\n-The president, a sleepy character who loves naps\\n\\n\r\n-Subaru, a love-oblivious kid who dislikes \"3-d\" women and spends his time drawing waifu.\\n\\n\r\n- Mizuki, a generic-on-purpose protagonist who loves Subaru, but is ignored by him.\\n\\n\r\n-Collete, a french student left behind by her parents. She's \"the weird one.\" and basically Dekomori with a haircut.\\n\\n\r\nA little later on, a new cast member appears, who shares many interests with Subaru, which annoys the crap out of Mizuki. She's also got 8th Grade Syndrome, refers to the \"Black Flame Dragon\", and is basically a bridge of concept between this show and Chuunibyou. \\n\\n\r\nSensei Yumeha is also a thing, but she's relegated to oppai fan-service.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. 8 \\n\\n\r\nIt's a good \"smiling\" kind of a show and one you can enjoy. You -know- how most episodes will end, but it's nice to watch it happen and generally the things they try to make cute, are in fact very cute and it's pretty funny. I genuinely laugh about once or twice an episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall. 7.4\\n\\n\r\n(Note, I weigh story and characters as double scores.)\\n\\n\r\nArt Class is an anime worth watching for some and will be incredibly frustrating for others.  The art is great even if the substance is thin, it's tropes we like watching over and over. It tries really hard to draw from other works, and ends up feeling like a weak copy. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a good production value kind of show, but it's very predictable and really nothing new from any other anime that's slice of life with an unrequited romance. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros and Cons\\n\\n\r\n++: If you like the Chuunibyou art, you'll like this art.\\n\r\n+: Good for slice of life without a huge cast.\\n\r\n+: If you like low-drama.\\n\r\n+: Is generally pretty funny.\\n\\n\r\n- - : If you want something thought provoking, like Chuunibyou.\\n\r\n- - -: If you are tired of tropes. \\n\r\n- -: 0 plot progression.\\n",

            "content": "Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! is a gag comedy anime about a dysfunctional art club with eccentric members and our main protagonist Mizuki Usami like it's written in the premise, hilarity ensues...obviously. So LA pose a question...is it funny?.\r\nWell before LA can answer that, LA needs to get to the technical first.\r\nIn terms of characters, we got an eccentric bunch of characters, yes even the main girl Mizuki Usami voiced by Ari Ozawa who draws apples all the time and has a crush on the 2D anime waifu \"artist\" Subaru Uchimaki voiced by Yuusuke Kobayashi, we also have Collette voiced by Sumire Uesakathe underclassman and member of the art club who is the trickster chunni type, President voiced by Kentarou Tone, the ever sleepy and sleeping president of the art club and Yumeko Tachibana voiced by Nana Mizuki the new advisor of the art club. If there was a character that was LA's favourite it actually goes to the Nao Touyama character of Maria Imari, an eccentric chunni who knows she is a chunni but still is one and a sorta of love rival to Mizuki halfway through the anime. Maria for what a \"new character\" introduced halfway through, she quickly and smoothly integrates int the cast and has GREAT chemistry with Usami and Uchimaki.  Really since Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! is a character-situational comedy, the character stands to reason be the focus and brings out the comedy as well.\\n\\n\r\nWell on speaking of comedy, the comedy in Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! is at best character-driven and because of it can be really subjective as to if you like it's humor or not. Do you like off-handed gags that brings out a characters motivation but as compensation have some of the gags be nothing but one off or have over exaggerated reactions, is the humor you're looking for more of a Chekhov's gun material where previous gags builds up to a bigger and better gag down the line, then this is the kind of comedy that you're in for. LA won't say that this comedy is FOR EVERYONE and laugh out loud, the anime's comedy at best got a couple of chuckles here and there from the characters reaction faces alone. Now LA won't say that Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!'s comedy doesn't meet ALL of the criteria LA just said as the comedy have some smaller detailed comedic moments (like background off-handed situations to running gags from way previous episodes making surprising comeback comedic one-offs later) as well as Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!'s best strengths is it's character chemistry with the main cast of the art club, really due to the characters chemistry with one another and bouncing off comedic moments and reacting in kind really makes the comedy shine for the better, thus LA can really overlook it's running gags as that is only the foundation for the comedic moments to work off of.\\n\\n\r\nKono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! also has some sentimentality moments mainly with characters like Yumeko Tachibana trying to bring the art club together during the cultural festival, Moeka voiced by Aimi Tanaka with President in one episode and Usami for your romantic sentimentality in which YOU KNOW where it's going. The sentimentality is what counts even if straight after the heart-warming moment leads straight into a comedic one-liner etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe only BIG issue with this is that since these eccentric characters have at best some lingering running gags to them (Mizuki's crush and tsundere act and apples, Subaru's cluelessness and 2D-waifu gags and Yumeko being a ditz and misunderstanding the situation to Collette and Maria's chunni misunderstandings). But LA already explained above how the repetitive running gags can be overlooked on how the situational comedy builds and work with the running gags instead of making it stale.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Studio feel. overall was presented with a nice and decent consistency as well as the poppy and vibrant character designs, even in the most comedic moments, they do resort of \"anime emoji faces\" but LA kinda sees that as kinda the point. Nonetheless the animation's overall ok consistency and atmospheric backgrounding makes the animation ok.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, well for a rather manzai-form of comedy, most of the voice actors either are the \"boke\" (the moron) like Uchimaki, Collette and if you wanna add her Yumeko-sensei or tsukommi (wise guy) the most obvious one Usami and LA will give liberties to President as this as well. Maria is more or less BOTH of these all due to her chunni-personality being ramped up and her situational moments can BACKFIRE on her. Nonetheless from this LA's favourite voice actors goes to Ari Ozawa and Nao Touyama because of this. What LA found more a \"playing against the type\" character was Nana Mizuki as the shy-ditzy Yumeko-sensei as she usually voices the more \"badass with a tragic backstory\" type of character...it was just something LA noticed is why LA brought it up.\\n\\n\r\nKono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! isn't quite the best comedy anime this season, it's at best slightly above average at best depending on the running gags or newer gags that were brought up. So LA posed a question to you at the start of this review, is this anime funny?...well if character chemistry, well-timed comedic skits and likable and eccentric characters does it for ya, then quite easily Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! is a good comedy to watch from Summer 2016, LA won't say it's the \"best\" as it depends on taste for comedy, comedy is subjective after all, but if you want a pure situational comedy from Summer 2016, then Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! is a perfect choice.",

Well, I can tell you with a straight face that it's not. Despite its cute character designs and simple plot, this series captured my heart. How? Well, for one, it's told in the perspective of the female lead. You may think it's a shoujo series, but it shows traits that even shounen comedy series would display, meaning it's made for both boys and girls. \r\nAnother thing that I liked was the art style. As stated before,it's all cute and adorable. But upon closer inspection, you can see how detailed the background props and animation was. In terms of art, this series tops any anime of this season. Of course, that's expected since the show is about an art club.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, it was a great experience watching this anime. I whole-heartedly enjoyed it 'till the end, and I'm sure you will too! Maybe then, you'll see the joy of being in an art club!",

            "content": "[Story] 6\r\nFor the most part, KonoBi takes place in a generic school setting where the main cast spends their days in the Art club. The story revolves around the art club members but mainly focuses on Usa and Uchimaki. Throughout the show, we get to see Usami-chan's experience in having to deal with Uchimaki-kun's addiction, and don't worry, this story isn't that dark. This sets up a handful of hilarious scenes and minor plot twists that might squeeze out some air from your nostrils. The story doesn't do anything in particular with the school setting that would've changed the story drastically if it didn't takeplace at school. The romance is sprinkled in here and there, but any real romantic developments are usually shot down with a one-liner from Cole-chan or anyone from the supporting cast. Overall, the story is nothing groundbreaking, but it is able to keep your interest if you are willing to give the show a chance.\\n\\n\r\n[Art] 7\\n\r\nStudio feel. got the job done here. The animation takes a dip in the middle of the series, b/c im sure KonoBi wasn't presented with a commendable budget where they could splurge on animation. For the most part, the animation is very smooth and can be VERY gorgeous when it wants to be.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 6\\n\r\nAgain, the OST is nothing too special, sets the mood for the most part, and gets the job done. Casting and voice acting was pretty good imo too. Nothing else to say really...\\n\\n\r\n[Setting]\\n\r\nMost of the action takes place on a Middle School campus, where the character's would occasionally be seen in their houses or walking together on the street. The setting isn't used to a particular advantage, more as an excuse to put all these cute characters in one place. Nothing noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\n[Character] 8\\n\r\nThe character designs are nothing new, but all of the characters are extremely kawaii and fit perfectly into a middle school setting, my favorite of the bunch being Imari, duh. The characters are extremely relateable, Usami in particular, and this makes for a more believable, entertaining story in the long-run. You don't see much in the category of character development, and you could go as far as to say that there wasn't any at all. \\n\\n\r\n[Overall] 7\\n\r\nIn short, this show isn't an investment, you can pick it up at anytime and expect to see some good waifu/Imari action, and a good laugh or two. I know saying the characters are cute isn't a good reason to watch a show, but please just watch it, even if its for the cute Usa/Cole/Imari scenes. If you're the one who assumed that this would be another generic school/romance/comedy show, YOU WERE RIGHT, but this show steady pace keeps the watcher's devotion to story and character's and their daily interatctions with one another. \\n\\n\r\n[P.S. This is my first review EVER so if it was bad, I know, I read it too. I just had to review this so that people know that its not that bad of a show. Just give it a chance.]\\n",

            "content": "There are two types of anime I consider a \u201c5\u201d: those with an equal force of determinants and merits, and those that follow a formulaic and mediocre narrative used quite often. The difference is that shows described by the former are usually on the negative side, whereas shows described by the latter can still be a good watch; Konobi is the latter.\r\nProduced by studio feel (who\u2019ve brought the likes of OreGairu and Kiss x Sis) comes \u201cThis Art Club has a Problem!\u201d, a hilarious, lighthearted rom-com with emphasis on \u201ccom\u201d; Seriously, this show is funny. Definitely one of the greatest strengths of this show isthat it knows how every other rom-com plays out and instead of trying to simply be another one, it adds a couple pivotal twists to the setup and focuses more on the comedy aspect, making this show a unique and refreshing rom-com yet still allowing itself to be held back by the limitations of its genre-type. \\n\\n\r\nKonobi follows the story of a cute middle schooler, Mizuki, and the exploits that follow as she pursues her die hard crush on Uchimaki Subaru. This is where the first pivotal twist comes into play. Subaru is a certified otaku, the only girls he\u2019s interested in are what he calls, \u201c2D girls\u201d; yes, Subaru has 17+ waifus. No joke. The second twist is not so much a twist but a unique way of keeping things fresh, it\u2019s the setting: an art club. The only reason Subaru is in the Art Club of his middle school is so that he has the means to paint his 2D waifus day after day. Now imagine the struggles that Mizuki is accompanied by when she tries to pursue her crush on a man who\u2019s only interest is in anime and manga girls. It can only be hilarious, right? This twist to the genre and premise sets up a plethora of extremely funny gags that surprisingly, aren\u2019t a hit and miss. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason the gags aren\u2019t a hit and miss because unlike many other comedy-centric shows, it doesn\u2019t rely on slapstick/chibi humour or what I like to call, \u201creaction humour\u201d; reaction humour is a show\u2019s attempt to make the viewer laugh by having its characters react to something absurd in an overblown and eccentric fashion. The reason reaction humour is almost always a hit and miss is because since it\u2019s unpredictable and comes out of nowhere, it literally either hits your funny bone or misses it. While Konobi does have humour like this, it is never solely reliant on it. Rather, Konobi constructs its gags around a specific physical or abstract object (e.g. ruining someone\u2019s painting and covering it up), and the humour is pulled from the anticipation of how the characters will eventually interact, react, and deal with the object. The humour is not wholly \u201cpredictable\u201d, but on some level you build an anticipation in your mind about the end result, and when the show either matches or subverts your expectation it\u2019s funny regardless. The hilarity that ensues throughout the show is never consistently funny, there will always be a couple gags that may very well not entertain you, but for the most part the show\u2019s humour is well above average in terms of consistency of quality. Whenever you have a show with an overabundance of jokes it is a given that some may turn out being predictable and occasionally seem lackluster. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance element of the show is heavily downplayed, and rightfully so. Its consistent comedic and lighthearted nature wouldn\u2019t dare allow for serious and touching scenes of romance. Every time it seems as if Mizuki is about to move from a platonic relationship with Subaru to a romantic one, it\u2019s always just another setup to prey on and make light of Mizuki\u2019s naive and earnest pursual of Subaru. Many of the show\u2019s episodes are divided into 2 parts, with each part following the exploits of another character or another subplot; this division sometimes makes the show feel episodic but the events that happen always impact the characters and their surroundings, so there is a sense of continuity throughout the story. This division of episodes into comedic shorts greatly compliments the pacing as well, things never unnecessarily drag out and the viewer won\u2019t ever feel bored through repetition. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just\u2026 there, they all have their own contrasting personalities but they can still just be summed up in one liners, for the most part. This is perfectly fine, considering that the show never tries to be a super realistic revolutionary romance story, it\u2019s just a gag show, so as long as the characters are likeable and funny, for all practical purposes they can be considered \u201cgood\u201d characters.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Feel are really upping their animation game; this show has dazzling visuals. Just the first episode alone has this breathtaking scene where Subaru is drawing Mizuki in the art club room, with shimmering sunset light beaming through the window, enveloping the entirety of the comfy art room in a warm, cozy colour palette that is just captivating to gaze at. With subtle, meticulous and distinct dust particles drifting through the air in a carefree manner as well, studio Feel brought this show to life. With Konobi added to their resume and OreGairu Season 2\u2019s scrupulous character animations, they\u2019re well on their way to approaching Kyoto Animation level beauty. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty standard as far as anime goes, but one thing that should be noted is that Ozawa Ari, the voice actor of our protagonist Mizuki, also voiced Sakura from the equally hilarious show Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. Coincidentally enough, both shows are actually fairly similar in terms of plot, so if you liked Gekkan Shoujo I cannot recommend Konobi enough. The soundtrack for the most part is again, pretty standard, but there are a couple tracks that are surprisingly distinct and potent. They add a sense of emotion to all the scenes and make the whole experience just a little bit more enjoyable overall.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite the show not being anything spectacular, it is fairly memorable. I was entertained a lot, I laughed a lot, I found Mizuki cute a lot, and amongst other things I was able to leave this show satisfied with and happy overall. The gorgeous visuals, the surprisingly potent soundtrack and then strong voice acting left a reasonable impression on me as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.5/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the show does nothing spectacular, but with a couple amusing twists to the rom-com setup it allows for a solid and entertaining watch throughout. I\u2019d recommend this to anyone into who likes both romance and comedy, but usually prefers the latter over the former. For similar titles, again, I\u2019d recommend Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was informative and helpful.",

            "content": "Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! (dat copy and paste doe) is just one of the many ordinary series that are just out there to make us laugh, and to enjoy the shit loan out of moe. It's basically a daily lives of high school student type of series, where you got this club that not so many people are interested in. And the students within the club ended up doing stuff that's fun, and carefree (in term of their freedom to choose what to do, what sorts of activities) despite just being a fucking \"art club\". And the centralization of focus are solelyconcentrated on those clubs activities, and some external setting with its support/minor character in the story, to expand their gag for each episodes. And so far, this anime has been pretty entertaining, mainly, the fucking moe. Plus, there's this romance between our MC (who's dense af, just like any other Harem MC out fucking there....) and... I guess, the heroine of the story, Usami Mizuki. And so far, everything that's happening in this anime, or from what i see, is very generic. Although the things that're not so generic and cliche, or just too typical of an anime of this kind to do are.... comedy that this series are showing you. Well it's not really all that different from other of those typical ones.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you're expecting a good story out of this, then let me tell you this. It's a fucking slice of life anime, you don't expect a story out of it. You should prolly expect cuteness, gag, chill and relax environment, etc. because that's just the priority in most of any slice of life shows. Although I haven't finished watching the anime just yet. I could clearly predicted that our MC and our Heroine will never get together and they will ended up stagnating their relationship, ending nowhere, and restart from the very fucking beginning. This shits happens alot in these kind of romance anime where they teases you with some romantic scene, but something tend to happen in order to not have the intended things (developing love, getting their love through the MC or something) to happen. Or else that would just be the end of the story. Or possibly, not the end, but the end of the overall gag of the series that revolves around Usami Mizuki's interaction of embarrassment; in order to gradually win our MC over and make love, or began their romance maybe. \\n\\n\r\nBut overalll, this anime was pretty generic in term of setting, story, romance gag, dense MC, characters, the overly weird and illogical thoughts of a character to do a particular things, or actions that aimed to be cute (Take Collette for instance, or the female supervisor of the art club) and so on. But nonetheless, this anime is so god damn CUTE (or moe...) AF. But because i have seen several of these types of anime before, my enjoyment of the series are also being affected by that as well. However, it's still a funny anime to watch. Not for the story in particular, and maybe for the romance that would unlikely happen between our MC and heroine. But the moe gag should keep you on your seat, while watching the anime. Coz that's like the only thing about these kind of series that make anything out of their content amusing, or enjoyable to watch. Even though i did sometime skip some parts just because it's pretty repetitive, and boring at times. It's still an ok series to watch. Give it a go.",

The plot is lacking and nothing all that gripping but that's about what I expected. The art style isn't appealing but that doesn't mean it's some kind of spectacle to behold, the songs found in this anime are nothing special either. For your characters you have a kind cute girl who likes the MC, there's the MC himself being your run of the mill, dense as a neutron star otaku, an air headed girl, an otaku girl who serves as a rival to the mainlove interest, and the lazy senpai who does essentially nothing. Where have a seen this before? Oh yeah that's right literally everywhere. The show was fine, it was like empty calories: tastes good in the moment but in the end isn't filling at all. In all honesty this anime would have gotten an overall rating of 6 from me if the ending was at all satisfying, but it wasn't. Literally nothing happens and their relationship stays in the same place with zero character development anywhere to be found. Go ahead and watch this anime if you want to but don't be expecting a masterpiece because you will be sorely disappointed.",

            "content": "High school anime are a dime a dozen.  Whether it'd be moe-related, a bunch of students in a club or whatnot doing stuff, or maybe even the dramatic story detailing a person's life, high school is the most overused setting for any given anime.  So, how do you make such an anime?  Well, throw in a couple of oddballs in a seemingly normal club and you'll get a basic setup for your standard average anime of this type.  Konobi is just another piece in the long art gallery of high school anime where it doesn't really give us anything new, butdamn is it entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Our story follows Usami Mizuki and her exploits in the art club.  After having its new member by the name of Uchimaki Subaru, she begins developing a crush on the boy and his superior art skills, only to find out that his only motivation for even participating is the fact that he wants a place in order to create the \"Perfect Waifu.\"  Followed with their energetic and naive kouhai and their extremely lazy senpai, the title of \"The Art Club has a Problem\" is...pretty self-explanatory here.\\n\\n\r\nBeing honest here, Konobi is really nothing special.  Lovestory sideplot that goes nowhere, episodic stories that more or less return the series's status quo every week with every new episode, cliche situations, everything is pretty standard and so tropey that there's really no way to actually describe other than generic.  They're all plotlines that've been done before and as someone who's seen these stories before, they were all predictable and not really worth the time to ogle over in anticipation as to what would happen next.  So, what's really the intrigue here with Konobi?\\n\\n\r\nWell, in simple terms, it would be the way these situations are portrayed.  They're all pretty standard, yes, but the series plays with the straight man/funny man dynamic where practically everyone but Usami, our main protagonist, plays the strange/interesting person role while she throws out her own retorts.  Some of the character interactions are somewhat entertaining I admit, and the characters breathe a slightly different light into these generally bland and boring story concepts, thus giving them a slight different appearance to them, enough to be technically different, even if not really at its base level.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, what is Konobi?  Konobi is a series that slathers a new coat of paint on what would be considered as boring and tired storylines, thus giving the show a different perspective with its straight/funny man style comedy as well as utilizing the art club gimmick heavily so that it doesn't just feel like a bunch of characters doing something that doesn't even relate to the title or synopsis of the series.  (Lookin' at you, K-on.)  It's entertaining, but at the same time, but doesn't have enough to make the story interesting enough to be amazing or anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Mildly entertaining \\n\r\n+ New coat of paint on old tropes\\n\r\n+ Uses the series's gimmick often\\n\r\n-  Still more or less the same generic tropes\\n\r\n-  Romantic subplot got tiring\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Slice of life needs interesting characters.  If there aren't interesting characters, than you have failed in making an good slice of life anime that separates itself from the hordes of clones with a different name to them.  \\n\\n\r\nFirst there's Usami Mizuki, our main protagonist.  Mizuki...isn't actually all that interesting.  Her entire schtick in the series is to have a crush on Subaru while also hating him for his waifu loving tendencies and his overall detachment with the real world.  (Boy like that's not overdone.)  She's also got a bust complex, has low tolerance for random bullsh*t that happens around her, the usual.  While not really all that interesting in terms of character, her role in the series as the straight man comes into play a lot in the series usually retorting Subaru or the laziness of the club president.  As a result, she's usually the one creating the air of comedy or strange situation as the catalyst to a lot of events.  But aside from that, she really has nothing to actually explain her character.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Uchimaki Subaru, the other main protagonist.  As mentioned before, his reason for even being a part of this series is because he wants to be able to draw the 'perfect waifu'.  As an otaku-type character with detachment from the 'real world' and focusing solely on fictional women and their traits that make them cute, Subaru...really isn't all that interesting either.  Really, the main characters are probably the least interesting characters in this entire series.  His antics get Mizuki mad, and then creates the majority of conflict within the series whether they'd be major or not.  Most of the runtime is devoted to Mizuki's crush on Subaru and really, with uninspiring characters, there's really nothing to actually talk about with them in particular.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the more fun ones.  The art club president (whose name escapes me), Colette, Isami, and various other side characters like Moeka make up the rest of the cast and aid in making this show actually seem worthwhile and interesting to watch.  You have the lazy moocher, the bombastic and energetic confused naive kouhai, the chuuni, and the 5 year old who wanders away from her parents so much that she needs to literally be tied to her mother to make sure she doesn't get lost.  Without these characters, Konobi would've been bland and boring, and the kinds of color that they add to the series made it all more worthwhile.  Hell, they had an entire episode near the end of the series devoted to pretty much just the 5 year old and the club president, and goddamn is it probably the best episode in this entire series.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Interesting side characters\\n\r\n-  Kind of boring main characters\\n\\n\r\nArt: Well, if a show about the art club doesn't have good art, it's a crime, right?  Well, I suppose it would be, but Konobi really doesn't suffer much in terms of art for a hilarious twist of irony.  (sadly)  Though to be fair, the show's naturally bright and colorful atmosphere and style does suit the light-hearted art-related series about character interactions and the spring of young love.  Of course, while the art does look good, it's not that stellar in the way that I would give it a high rating (like every other one of feel's work), but hey, it's better than crappy animation.\\n\\n\r\nOne easter egg that I would like to address is the fact that all of Subaru's artworks in the series (since well, he does need to make art due to the theme of the series) are references to other girls in other series'.  So if you see a drawing that seems familiar, chances are it's probably a reference.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Fun references\\n\r\n+/- Good, but average artstyle\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Sound...isn't really that much of a plus in Konobi.  The OP \"Starting Now\" is probably the most noticeable and memorable of all of the tracks due to its rock sound and kind of addicting chorus, but aside from that, the rest of the tracks really aren't up to its standard.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also kind of average, so I wouldn't put much faith into this series being the best in the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Pretty memorable OP\\n\r\n-  Average in all other aspects\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  So what is Konobi?  What did I think of it?  Well, in simple terms, it was enjoyable.  It had enough to it to make me want to watch episode after episode despite its seemingly ordinary story setup and I genuinely liked some of the characters that they had, even if they were only side characters.  Of course, there was always room for improvement, but this was probably the best that you could probably make with a series of this genre.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nYes I did.  I especially liked the character 'Moeka', the 5 year old with grown-up tastes.  She's cute, she was interesting, and she was definitely not one of those annoying kid characters that you would want to punch for being a crybaby.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nI really didn't appreciate how the main characters were so plain and unoriginal.  Personally, I think it's a mistake to make the side characters more unique and/or interesting than the main characters.  Sure the side characters got their time in the spotlight to make them shine a bit more, but when your side character focused episodes are more interesting than those that follow just the main two cast members, you're doing something TERRIBLY wrong here.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nKonobi is special enough to be considered different from the rest of the dime a dozen high school romcom/slice of life episodic shows that plague the anime seasons year after year.  For that reason, I'd say if you're looking for something like that, than this is the show that you should be watching.  If not, than don't bother.  There's nothing stellar about it aside from being mildly entertaining enough to garner enough interest to continue watching.  Aside from that, it's a pretty average show with not much else aside from its gimmick to hold itself afloat.",

The biggest reason why I wanted to watch this rather obscure 2016 anime that no one seems to talk about is because of the main character, Usami Mizuki. When I saw her in a trailer on Anichart, for some reason I just fell in love with how adorable she looked. So of course, we come to this point.\r\nAs I expected from Kono Bijutsubu Ni Wa Mondai Ga Aru, it ended up being a casual anime series, meaning that there isn't an overarching story with a lot of dramatic tension. The setting for this is an art club withmembers that are a bit weird (as you might have guessed from the title). And I will give praise to this anime for actually taking some effort in focusing on attributes related to art and I can say that I did learn a thing or two from it. However, that is not to say that they did a very good job with it. The anime does not go into great detail about the aspects of art, as there is so much more than could be incorporated. But to compensate for that, the anime has the main theme of romance in play.\\n\\n\r\nA huge part of this anime focuses on the main character, Mizuki's constant attempts at grabbing the attention of her crush, Uchimaki Subaru. And let me just say that the fact that Mizuki is the main character of this anime itself is a huge bonus for me. She is without question my favourite character in the anime. And seeing her never ending pursuit for love was just such an adorable and enjoyable thing to watch. Say what you will about her inconfidence to Just Do It, I personally prefer it if the girls are a bit shy. So all in all, I would say that that is the best thing in the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow to make a short comment about the side characters. While I appreciate that Mizuki is the main character, I kinda wished that the side characters were given a bit more focus. This is especially true for Mizuki's friends and Imari Maria. We hardly know anything about these characters and it would have been nice to know more about them. Although, I will say that I am really glad that the side characters are all so supportive of Mizuki in achieving her goal. It just made things so much more cheerful and I love that.\\n\\n\r\nNow, because this is a casual anime series, I would have to address more than just the romance. When it comes to the comedy, I can clearly say that it is not the best I have seen. Many jokes and funny scenes feel very cliche and generic. And sometimes when they try to set up a supposedly cool joke, I find them to be highly predictable (which in most cases, I was right about the outcomes) and in the end, they just turn out to be rather disappointing in my opinion. There are a few creative jokes here and there but it just didn't feel enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is done by Feel and I would have to say that it was alright but because nothing much goes on in the anime, there really isn't anything that truly stood out in my opinion. But at least it was nice that the anime has a rather cheerful colour scheme that made it nice to look at. This is art after all. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as for the theme songs. Let me first comment. Is it just a coincidence that Mizuki Nana sang the opening when we have a character named Mizuki in the anime or was that intentional? Well in any case, because she sang the opening, it was nice to listen to. Although I can definitely say that is not my favourite song by her. For the ending theme, it was an ok song but I really didn't think too much about it.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, while I'd definitely say that I still really enjoyed watching this anime. It felt like it went pass too quickly. It didn't really bring anything new in terms of comedy and there are so many things left that could be explored. Like I said, I really wished the side characters were given more attention. So in all honesty, I really hope that there will be a 2nd season for this anime. I have a feeling it seems very unlikely because of how little attention was given to this anime. But if Feel can focus on just the right things, a 2nd season would do this anime quite some good. Plus, I just want to see more of Mizuki anyway, so of course I would really love to see a sequel. Let's hope for the best.",

            "content": "As many reviews have already highlighted the good parts of this show, which are very few. I am going to tell you about the many bad things about this show and how i believe that this show doesn't deserve anything beyond a 5 overall.\r\nSTORY: 2\r\n This show has absolutely no plot progression to speak of, it has the essence of a comedy skit anime but it tries to have the story line of a linear romcom. The show fumbles over how to progress with Subaru's artistic ability by showing him entering one art competition, and that's it. There isn't really anything else to say abouthis unique part in the story. The story also shows Mizuki and her problems involving her love for Subaru, but like every other girl, she fails miserably. the only difference is that she actually lost to a damn anime girl. and that's the end of her part in all of this. Of course there is comedy involved in all of this but when you get down to it it falls flat when you actually look into what the show was trying to make funny.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8 - Art fits well and makes the show almost bearable to watch\\n\\n\r\n While the art wasn't anything to gawk at, it captured the cuteness of the characters and made the viewers have a pleasant time watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8  - Everything in place\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds of this show went very well with the \"story\" that this anime was trying to tell. Nothing was weird or out of place and all of the voices were well done too.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 2 - No Character Personality \\n\\n\r\nThe only saving grace of any of these characters is that they are cute. especially Collette, other than that, they all fall into some sort of ultra generic trope. I also couldn't stand Mizuki's constant babbling and crying over how much of a clueless dumbass trope character Subaru is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1 - None\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, i didn't derive any enjoyment out of this show. I actually consider myself to be a pretty mindless watcher. But the story's author seems to know even less about an average slice of life anime than me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2 - I wouldn't watch this show even again even if it was my mothers dying wish\\n\\n\r\nAs most people do who value their time, they only look at the overall section. So i only have one thing to say. Like another reviewer of another anime said, \"Avoid this flaming pile of shit like the plague.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "My score was a solid 7.6, which I have rounded off to an 8 without much hesitation.\r\nKonobi offers what most romcoms do, but with consistent art and characters which actually DON'T irritate one to the core.\r\nCharacters: 9\r\nIn romcoms, I usually dislike the female lead, because she tends to be too over the top, or 'moe' or cutesy. Or the animators do her injustices by trying to bring our her 'physical attributes', which I as a female viewer dislike.\r\nHowever, Konobi's Usami Mizuki is an absolute sweetheart, and you can't help but want to hug her in sympathy of her hopeless situation. She remains strong and witty,while the whole time displaying the weaknesses of a girl in love. She is the backbone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nUchimaki Subaru is adorable, and although an incredible pain in the side where Usami is concerned, I fully understand why she is so enamored by him. He's a very well-written character, showing a young 13-14 year old boy, and, apart from his 2D obsession, is your classic young middle schooler, with mood swings and backhanded comments and opinions.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it doesn't lose out on its side characters either. Apart from the other members of the club, I found Usami's friends to be absolutely endearing. They largely exist to tease her, but they do it in that gentle way friends do, and I loved having them around.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, characters are easily this show's strong point, as not one was irritating, down to little random Moeka on the streets.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nAnother thing I'd like to mention was the art. It was consistent, unlike shows where the nose is suddenly disproportionate to the face randomly in episode 7. No, throughout, the show was visually appetizing and you could see the care with which the creators animated this.\\n\r\nApplause!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nI binge watched this over a span of a day, and my only regret is that it is over. May we see many more wonderful shows like Konobi, where characters, which are indeed the life of the show, are given justice.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nKono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! brings me back to when I was a teenager.\r\nIn middle school, I enrolled in an art class. I was (and still am) not an artist, and I had no huge drive to become one. So, I mainly saw the class as a free period or at least one where I didn\u2019t have to worry about much at all.\r\nDespite my low motivation, I learned a lot. Colors, shading, and perspective. I distinctly remember creating a two-faced jar and a rolled-up tube of toothpaste. Both were made from clay (thenpainted), and both were placed on the shelf in the basement for family and guests to see.\\n\\n\r\nKonobi does not teach its audience anything about art on an educational level, but it certainly knows how to get its audience laughing.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nKonobi centers on an art club filled with a handful of kooky characters. Usami, Uchimaki, Collette, and President (the senior without a name) are normal students like everybody else at their middle school. However, and as the title implies, they encounter random problems on the regular, putting them in silly, everyday situations.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is like a multicolored can of paint. It contains one part slice-of-life, one part romance, and one part comedy. All mixed together into a colorful concoction that works on most blank canvases.\\n\\n\r\nThe blue slice-of-life takes on a mini-story format. Each episode contains two or three small stories that target mundane situations. Losing an item, getting locked in a storage room, and trying to clean a pool are not exactly exciting, but they give the cast the opportunity to explore the simpler side of life. Almost as if each tiny arc is a new drawing that the show creates and the audience beholds.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the list above, a key factor is missing: art. Like many anime of this type, art is not the point but rather the glue that holds it all together. Yes, they make a sculpture or participate in competitions, but the bonding that they share is infinitely more important than the brush techniques they are using.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that the anime has an ever-so-slight focus on sexual material. Tachibana-sensei attempting to put on a tight maid outfit or Uchimaki pointing out that he can see Usami\u2019s panties for the hundredth time are funny in the moment. But, in hindsight, these instances do not fit well with the anime\u2019s friendly, everyday tone (let alone that the setting is literally a middle school).\\n\\n\r\nThe red romance seeps into most of the gaps. Due almost entirely to Usami, her mega crush on Uchimaki drives much of the anime\u2019s direction. From the small, endearing jig she does after getting his number or threatening President with deletion should he delete said number from her phone, most of the situations, in some form, relate back to the romantic tones.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, \u201cromance\u201d may be too strong of a word, for what the anime shows is more akin to \u201cextreme teasing\u201d or \u201cultimately nothing\u201d than the lovey-dovey gushing the audience wants.\\n\\n\r\nUsami more than brings the romance; it\u2019s Uchimaki who is the problem. He does not just misunderstand Usami but rather actively turns her down. He will wave off her thoughts with a \u201cJust kidding!\u201d or constantly remind everyone that he only likes two-dimensional girls. His utter lack of interest ruins many of the scenes in a frustrating manner, leaving the audience to roll their eyes as Usami (inevitably) fails to get across her feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThe yellow comedy arguably stands as the foundation of the entire anime. The jokes it delivers are not necessarily clever, but they can be subtle, rewarding its audience with small fits of laughter should they pick up on the references to earlier episodes or the actions taken by the cast. When Uchimaki points out that Tachibana is passed out on the floor again or when Usami\u2019s arm is raised into the scene before the punchline hits, Konobi allows for simple yet effective jokes to thrive throughout its run.\\n\\n\r\nSubtlety isn\u2019t its only comedic brand, but that\u2019s both a blessing and a curse. Straightforward funnies, such as when the manga clerk puts on a smile and says to herself that she wants Usami, Imari, and Uchimaki to leave because they are causing a ruckus, are easily funny. Same goes for its visual gags: a red punch mark imprinted on Uchimaki\u2019s cheek, President slowly losing his sanity with cleaning pop cans. And again with its on-the-spot humor such as when Usami and Uchimaki never recognize the overly competitive student who challenges Uchimaki to contests.\\n\\n\r\nBut when the anime constantly relies on the say-it-will-not-happen-but-it-happens-anyway shtick or the he-said-something-weird-so-let-me-tell-him-it-is-weird formula, the anime devolves into a series of same-y jokes that keep the characters from being as comedically creative as the art they produce.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, Konobi\u2019s paint is not the most appealing in the world, but it forms enough fun to make it worth using on the walls of any clubroom.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nArguably, Konobi\u2019s best quality is the art and animation it so regularly uses.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, to start out, it should be noted that the settings itself is plain. It\u2019s in a school and, worse still, it primarily takes place in the same location \u2013 the art club \u2013 almost the entire time. However, what it lacks in background variety it makes up for in artistic appeal.\\n\\n\r\nLook back at episode three. When Collette is first introduced, and she enlists Uchimaki\u2019s help to find her locket (\u201cthe kind that can\u2019t fly\u201d), she eventually stops to inspect a poster. To get Collette\u2019s attention, he tugs on her arm. But he does so off camera, so the shot shows only Collette\u2019s slight jostle.\\n\\n\r\nThat honestly does not seem like much, but this nuanced movement highlights how much care the animation is given. I.e., since the art is \u201cimmobile,\u201d many more resources are spent on the characters and their mobility. Scenes like Usami running up steps to meet Uchimaki on a bridge are noticeably fluid, and such scenes are seen at different points throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also includes many reactions from the characters. Round eyes, triangular mouths, and tons of blushing elevate its comedy to an even greater degree. Often times, these reactions are coupled with colorful or more artsy backgrounds that play along with the fun and the art motif, subsequently boosting the comedy yet again.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters\u2019 designs, they are not as impressive as the animation or the colorful, comedic art. But they do have their merits.\\n\\n\r\nUsami\u2019s bob-cut hairdo and bunny hair clip gives her a tomboy look while accentuating her girly behavior. Collette\u2019s long, blonde hair contrasts well with her green eyes, her bit of hair that stands up gives her a silly, childlike look, and her short stature adds to her cuteness levels. And President\u2019s ragged hair, loose-and-white button-up shirt, and propensity for wearing no shoes highlight his laziness to the max.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nKonobi fails in one major regard: varying up the character scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast contains six different people. Usami, Uchimaki, Collette, Imari, President, and Tachibana-sensei. Technically, more characters exist throughout the season, but these six are undoubtedly the main ones focused on.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as the opening sentence declares, the anime does not do enough to populate its scenes with different pairings. Most notably, the whole group hardly ever do anything together. As the season progresses, Collette and President appear less and less. And Tachibana-sensei and Imari, who arrived a quarter of the way and halfway through the season respectively, barely get any screen time once their introductory episodes conclude.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say that the characters themselves do not have their relationships in place. Tachibana-sensei is harsh on Collette, President always comes very close to revealing Usami\u2019s feelings for Uchimaki, Imari becomes Collete\u2019s \u201cmaster,\u201d President has a thing for Tachibana-sensei, and Usami (obviously) loves Uchimaki. But, for whatever reason, Konobi does not like to experiment with other and multiple pairings, sticking instead with the ones it already has.\\n\\n\r\nOn an individual scale, the characters have their roles and their types, allowing the slice-of-life, romance, and comedy to prosper when necessary.\\n\\n\r\nUsami gets extremely flustered when she deals with Uchimaki or people tease her about her feelings. But she also is not afraid to get overly violent should somebody (usually President) happen to annoy her. Her friends (especially Kaori) support her in her doomed quest, and she never gives up, even when her name is on the line.\\n\\n\r\nUchimaki cares only for two-dimensional girls, believing that three-dimensional ones are a nuisance unworthy of his attention. He can also draw and paint quite well, and he has a subtle kindness to him that isn\u2019t immediately apparent.\\n\\n\r\nCollette hails from America, and she is about as goofy as possible. Doing magic tricks, wearing bird heads, and believing in justice, this recent elementary-school graduate only sees the happier side to life no matter what she may be doing.\\n\\n\r\nPresident takes his sleeping seriously, making sure to use the club room\u2019s couch (and their own funds) to his advantage to catch a wink. While he rarely participates in club activities, and he may seem unreliable, he looks out for the others whenever possible.\\n\\n\r\nTachibana-sensei always has her heart in the right place. She practices her motivational phrases, awards fancy marks as positive reinforcement (even if they happen to ruin Uchimaki\u2019s painting), and she encourages the club in their endeavors. She has a strict side, but her cute behavior (intentional or not) wins over most people that she meets.\\n\\n\r\nImari is a girl who, like Uchimaki, loves manga and all-things two-dimensional. She has chuunibyou tendencies, believing that her arm contains a demonic power that she must control. Usami sees Imarii as a threat to her (Usami\u2019s) own feelings for Uchimaki at first, but, as she gets to know more about Imari\u2019s athleticism and ability to listen to others, it becomes apparent that Imari is less a rival and more a friend.\\n\\n\r\nLike the story, almost none of the characters here deal much with art. However, and sticking with themes, they each have a \u201cproblem\u201d all their own. \u201cProblems\u201d which the audience can clean from their base characteristics. Usami obsesses over Uchimaki. Uchimaki pines after two-dimensional girls. Collette acts like a child. President is way too lazy. Tachibana-sensei cannot speak properly. And Imari plays out her imaginative thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nSince the anime is a romantic-comedy, these \u201cproblems\u201d are never addressed as fixable ones. But that\u2019s okay. They are what give the characters and the show in general the foundation to present its content, so one should not expect them to change much at all throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nKonobi\u2019s musical offerings are once again like the rest of its qualities. That is, while nothing manages to be super impressive, it contains certain pieces here and there that stick out in a positive way.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, the tiny transition piece that plays when one scene switches to another is this quick, dropping sound that adds a bit of charm to the show. Same goes for the transition piece between the mini-stories. A simple set of piano notes that skip happily along make the switch comforting rather than jarring.\\n\\n\r\nThe smaller sound-effects, like the rattling that Usami does when questioned about her romantic feelings for Uchimaki, continue to up the playfulness of the show and add to it even more comedy chops.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting also has its moments. Sumire Uesaka as Collette achieves silliness with ease, especially when she makes her own sound-effects for teleporting-locket magic tricks. Ari Ozawa as Usami speaks cutely whenever she blushes (which happens all the time). And veteran Nana Mizuki as Tachibana-sensei uses a younger, more girly voice that fits the novice teacher well.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack goes with lots of piano, flutes, and wooden instruments to up its lighthearted atmosphere. Stepping drums, clapping beats, and extra chimes add variety to the OST while continuing with the slice-of-life feel it aims for. Plus, the handful of insert songs, like when the club cleans the pool or as the final, closing track in episode twelve, prove Konobi\u2019s attention to its music.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track relies mostly on guitar and drums for its first half, but, as the song progresses, the distorted sounds, background vocals, and fast-paced instruments craft the piece into a livelier one that starts each episode off with fun in mind. At the minimum, the chanting \u201cHey!\u201d and beat itself are catchy enough to follow along with.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track goes a little weird. The instruments and sounds are simultaneously all over the place and organized, giving it a semi-chaotic composition that, in a way, comes off as artsy. Techno drums, faint background vocals, and off-kilter notes make this direction even more apparent. The singing itself is normal, but it contrasts with the weirdness, making said weirdness that much more noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is one of those shows that just goes forgotten among the more unique, popular, or truly awful within its season. I almost never see anyone else talk about this anime in the community since it has aired \u2013 and I think that\u2019s a shame.\\n\\n\r\nBut I can understand why. From the analysis above, it\u2019s pretty clear that the show does not do anything amazing, and it does not do anything horrible. It just coasts along the middle ground for nearly its entire run.\\n\\n\r\nOn a personal level, I see a similar yet different outcome. None of the characters are memorable, but Collette\u2019s carefree quirkiness, Usami\u2019s immense cuteness, and Tachibana-sensei\u2019s good spiritedness were a ton of fun throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the mini-stories also had me laughing out loud. President and Uchimaki ruining Usami\u2019s picture with red paint. Collette\u2019s locket situation. The \u201ctreasure\u201d they find and subsequently try to hide. These scenes and more had me in high spirits for most of its run.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, for those that know me, they know that I am huge on romance. It\u2019s my favorite genre, after all. So, when I say that I loved the romantic moments involving Usami, I mean it. Uchimaki visiting her house to give Usami her printouts, the indirect kiss with the drinks, and when they got locked up in the storage room got me smiling wide and \u201cAww!\u201d-ing hard.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite romance moment, though, was the classic dinner-bath-or-something-else scene. Seeing them as a married couple in Usami\u2019s imagination, catching the reference to Usami\u2019s apple painting hanging on the wall, and watching Usami steam up the room due to having these thoughts made for a wonderful romantic-comedy scene.\\n\\n\r\nI was really hoping, hoping beyond hope, that Uchimaki was playing the long con. That his constant pushback and persona was just a fa\u00e7ade to get him closer to Usami. And that, by the end, the show would pull the reverse-reverse and make it Usami herself that he had fallen for. That would have been awesome as a joke and to give me the ultimate romance payoff.\\n\\n\r\nAlas, it was not meant to be. Yes, we got the ending exchange between the two where, for maybe a second, he reconsiders his thoughts on three-dimensional girls and Usami. But that was not enough in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nKono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! may not be on the forefront of everyone\u2019s mind, but it stands solid nonetheless. Its subtle jokes, attention to animated detail, and a penchant for romance justify this mindset. While the characters and the content itself may ultimately be too plain, it no doubt gets higher marks than a rolled-up toothpaste project.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, a colorful mixture of slice-of-life, romance, and comedy that is worthy of being on the walls of any clubroom\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, fluid animation techniques, hilarious reactions, and some thoughtful character designs keep the visuals looking strong\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Usami, Uchimaki, and the others each have their \u201cproblems\u201d that form the foundation for the romantic-comedy direction taken\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, okay OP, good ED, good OST, and good VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, while Usami and Uchimaki\u2019s relationship goes nowhere, the characters were silly, the comedy was fun, and the romantic moments were awesome\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "This is a better then usual anime I found. (in short I should say that is)\r\nLets start out with the story shall we.\r\nThe story is kind of structured like a generic Slice of Life or Romcom (Which I feel it was both). It makes the story run a bit slow at times and sometimes throws you into interesting scenarios. But although I quite enjoyed the concept of the story and even though it ran a bit dry from time to time it still had this thing that kept me coming back for more. Just to see really what wacky things the characters would be upto next.\\n\\n\r\nI'm just going to add my Art and sound together.\\n\\n\r\nI found these both to be about average the art style is kind of quirky and different but nothing I'd write a whole paragraph about so... Meh?\\n\\n\r\nWhile I found the opening theme to be one of the better ones I've heard I also found that that's about all I remember from the soundtrack. But the emotion in the voices were great so good for them?\\n\\n\r\nNow time for Characters (and this is the exciting part I found)\\n\\n\r\nSo the characters are really what made this story and the anime so great to watch. Let's put it this way there is kind of a Love Triangle (if you could call it that) between a main character (there are a few of them) another main characters and his \"waifu's\". Now this makes things a bit hard for the main character and gives her conflict that pretty much makes up the entire story. If she really can handle all of this and although you don't really see herself grow as a character the story is set in such a way that you've seen how she got there. While that happens the other characters kind of act as the almost sitcom style comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nNow it'd be hard to get into why I enjoyed it so much without giving anything away but I'll just say that it's all about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I found this to be quite enjoyable but due to how the story can easily run dry (especially if you try to watch large amounts in a single sitting), you may want to watch this series in smaller dosses. The comedy is pretty original with the occasional anime typical jokes thrown in there too. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading and hope this helped you a bit",

The ending was quick and everyone can notice that the producer wanted to end it in a good way but he did it so quickly that it turned against him\r\nAudio 8/10 the specific anime did not require that much of a sound effect for the environments that it took place. The tracks were decent but regardless of my taste they made them fit to where they should.\r\nArt 9/10 the art was reallygood. To be honest this anime probably has my favorite art style. I like it a lot. Especially how the colors are displayed which makes sense for an anime that has to do with art.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10 Half of the characters were well developed and easy to keep them in mind while the other half of them were just bystanders. 2 of the main characters were plain and predictable almost like they existed for the purpose of...  Well having characters to display.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10 while it was not the best thing to watch it was not so bad considering that it was something that I am used to watch. The way the characters were interacting was pleasant though repetitive. Furthermore despite the lack of an actual storyline they put a lot of effort into making it special. I don't think I should give a thumbs up for this attempt but it was still something not as common as I am used to",

It is different from a lot of school life anime, and I liked it because of it. \r\nStory: Now for the story their is not too much to it. You have this art club full of students with all different personalities. every episode is it own different story that is it own episode. For that reason I give the story a 6, not too much to it (other than the unrequited love between the characters). \r\nArt: The art in this i fantastic, Involving around an art clubyou would expect a very great art quality, and I was not disappointed. The art I give a 9. \\n\\n\r\nSound: For the sound I watched it sub (which at the time of this review, it the only version available). The sub is not that bad although when is a sub ever bad. The sound I give a 7. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Now I have a lot to say about the characters. First off usually in a school life anime the characters are in high school, that is not the case this time because they are in middle school students. Now this might turn some people off to this anime because the characters are going to really not be grown up yet. This really interested me going in because for most slice of life fans you are consisted in a high school environment, and not a middle school environment.  The characters I give a 10. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: The enjoyment value I give a 7, I was enjoying this though I thought this would be easy to binge watch but it did not go through. The overall value is an 8, I enjoyed myself through this anime.",

In Chunnibyou's story is all about \"chunni\" things but in this anime is a pure comedy.\r\nStory: 7\r\nI already stated that this anime is a pure comedy, so story is not something you're looking for when you decide to watch this anime.\r\nThis anime focused onits comedy and sometimes they put romance in it, but romance in this anime just like \"sweets\".\\n\\n\r\nThere are 4 members in Art Club\\n\\n\r\n- The president, the funny thing is his name never mentioned in the entire series, they only call him by \"president\". Despite from being a president he never do anything, all he was doing only naps.\\n\\n\r\n- Usami Mizuki, the heroine, who loves drawing apple and in love with Subaru but always ingored because this guy only interested with 2D.\\n\\n\r\n- Uchimaki Subaru, the last member of the club and the main character, a guy who loves 2D more than anyone and only drew 2D-waifu character instead of \"Art\" things.\\n\\n\r\n- Collete, an underclassman who is also a member of the art club, doesn't do anything for the club and only having fun with them\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nBeautiful, suited the theme, not a single \"fail\" animation found.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI always skip the Opening but not with the Ending.

            "content": "\"Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru \" is a typical and lighthearted slice of life romantic comedy. It uses tropes like any other anime, since that\u00b4s pretty much unavoidable, but it is a show that definitely shows it is trying it\u00b4s best in spite of a couple fatal flaws in the set up.\r\nOn the good points side, the show has stunning art. If it wasn\u00b4t for the general lack of more fluid art which at the same time has bigger detail, it would have a full 10. However, this is a big nitpick, and between it\u00b4s focus on art and the general unique designfor many characters. hand to hand with some comedic focus, the show definitely creates visuals well-worth keeping your eyes on.\\n\\n\r\nThe show looses a lot of points though (skip to the next paragraph if you haven\u00b4t watched it as this sentence may have minor spoilers) is how the central plot makes no progress. This is a big thing for light novel adaptations such as this one, but it takes almost ridiculous levels in this show.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not the only trope the show uses badly though, as the majority of it\u00b4s characters are rather bland and the show often tries to shove relatability down our throats like it\u00b4s sour medicine...that doesn\u00b4t work. It also tends to re-use it\u00b4s comedy a bit too often, making them get old really fast, and while we do get some amazing comedy sequences on the show\u00b4s lined-up misunderstanding style, it can be enough for you to zone out and miss out on important parts.\\n\\n\r\nIt does make a comeback on it\u00b4s side-characters, though, as the line between main and side-characters is rather blurry. The distribution of focus on this anime is rather refreshing, allowing a lot of it\u00b4s side-characters to have a proper spotlight not just making things more immersive as a slice of life, but also upgrading characters beyond plot devices. However, even here plot and characters generally don\u00b4t change, have little progress. As there is nothing to do, characters are just set to goof around and it makes the whole thing ultimately feel quite pointless. \\n\\n\r\nThis is not just about being a slice of life show, but it goes beyond that. The fatal flaw of this show, it seems, is the premise. There is very little to really explore if you\u00b4re not willing to let go of the thing you think your character relatable to the audience, in this case, how the main character is a giant otaku. This results in an emptiness regarding any kind of story and while the show is definitely trying it\u00b4s best at coming up with fresh ideas, there is really only so much you can pull. A lot of it\u00b4s problems, bland characters, repetition of jokes, etc... are something I believe comes from this.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"kono bijutsubu ni wa mondai ga aru!\" is a happy show that is great to relax to, but plays safe a bit too much regarding it\u00b4s main character which empties it\u00b4s premise of what little potential it could have in the first place. Watch if you\u00b4re into art and slice of life as the show definitely knows what it is doing in that department, but don\u00b4t if you\u00b4re looking for some deeply fleshed out romance or characters. Ultimately, it\u00b4s an OK show that nonetheless would likely be better off as a short-episode anime.",

            "content": "Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! (This Art Club Has A Problem!)\r\nArt/Characters: Before anything else, I need to say how much I love the opening animation to this show. It shows the basic steps to drawing a character and making it come to life, and the characters are the main ones in the show. It\u2019s a play on images! I think that is just so much fun and then it shows well how they all interact together and all of the confusion that the show promises is available to see in the opening animation. As for the art of the show as a wholeI felt that it was fresh and not too generic, as it could have easily been. It had a shine to it that is unlike anything I have really seen at all in this season. But just because it is fresh doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t anime clich\u00e9s. The twin tails girl, the awkward adviser, and one of the main characters having a messy hair style, either way it still felt good and original. As for the characters themselves, I have seen them before, but their character style isn\u2019t overused. The main girl is hopelessly in love with main guy but the main guy doesn\u2019t seem to notice. Uchimaki is just focused on his 2D anime wife. The club president is actually a new character I haven\u2019t really seen, he seems to take on the role of \u201cperson most likely to nap through school\u201d. As for Colette, her most interesting trait is that she doesn\u2019t have dialogue until a few episodes in, but can be seen hiding in episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: The music! The Music! THE MUSIC of this show is so catchy and so poppy and so fun and so enjoyable that I would pay to own the soundtrack. The bubbly and the synth music just go so well together that I can\u2019t get over it. This is the type of background music that compliments the show so well, that it actually gives the show depth. The actual sound direction however, is a little lax. There was the occasional crash when something fell, or the door sliding open, but what would have really pulled me in, would be when the closeness of the camera was on the canvas, and you would be able to hear the paint brush sweep across creating a new dynamic. It would have been nice, but it didn\u2019t happen. However, I must say that the music that replaced that sound, more than compensated and I was happy anyway.\\n\\n\r\nStory: This is the story of how Usami is trying to win the love of her life, Uchimaki. But he is not interested in 3D girls, and he is only focused on the wives that he paints and the ones he watches in anime. While she is trying to win him over, she is surrounded by Colette, a troublemaker that seems to only want to goof off, and the club president, who really only wants to sleep through club activities. Between, trying to win his love and being surrounded by people who don\u2019t seem to care, Usami really just wants to use the club time to paint and express herself with what she deems as \u201cTrue art\u201d, aka. not anime girls.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection: This is one of those shows that I saw the art, I saw the title, and instantly fell in love. I am such a sucker for club-based anime, and I am proud of that. This show, as I have said before, has amazing music and it is honestly one of the best parts of this show. But that alongside a hilarious pairing of a studious girl with an otaku boy, the show really blossoms into something special. There is even another character that comes around who wants to impress Usami and no matter what he does, he can\u2019t seem to get it right, which I think is quite playfully fun and I actually feel a little bad for him. As I hinted before, the opening is so good and so clever when it comes to the way it ties the show together. I have often said that a good opening is better than a PV in many ways. The PV is supposed to give a taste of the art, the animation, and maybe the voice acting, but an opening is supposed to showcase what the characters are supposed to be like, and this opening is the crown jewel if I have ever seen one. As for the rest of the show, it is fantastic. It is funny, it pushes limits, and it is really smart. The one thing I didn\u2019t like was that there didn\u2019t seem to be much progression. I won\u2019t spoil the ending, but I do think it is important to have progression through the entire show, but on the other hand, to not have any, and then have the final episode go to fast, can really kill a show for me, and I am glad that the show didn\u2019t take the latter route. The show that is before you has a fresh and enjoyable art style, with clever humor, amazing music, and is only a little clich\u00e9; check it out if you love Club-based anime!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.5/10\\n",

            "content": "Looking at This Art Club Has a Problem! before I started it, it seemed like a generic cute high school romantic comedy type show. It didn't look like it was anything too promising and didn't seem to bring a whole lot to the table. Just a follow the beaten-path show that you'll see many of every season. However due to me watching this in my Summer months when I have allot more free time to watch anime on my hands, I decided to pick it up. This Art Club Has a Problem! was much better than I expected it to be going into it, itleaned more towards the comedy aspect than the high school romance which really made this anime different compared to other high school rom-com's. \\n\\n\r\nThis Art Club Has a Problem did definitely have it's romantic aspects to it... There were even a few episodes where it was the main focus. However they never took \"love\" too seriously in this anime, for them this \"love\" that was happening was nothing more than a segway to the next joke. Comedy was the focus in this anime, they never let things get too serious when it came to those romantic scenes, they always used it as a transition for the next joke instead of using it to develop their love for each other. I really enjoyed that about this anime, the \"love\" that was suppose to be developing between these too was treated as a joke, for some people that might be seen as \"poor writing\" but for me I saw it as the most realistic thing that could've happened... \\n\\n\r\nSubaru Uchimaki shows absolutely no interesting in 3D women at all through out this ENTIRE series... If a true love formed between Mizuki and Subaru I don't think I would've been able to tolerate the anime. Think about it a guy who's been put into lewd scenarios with these characters and had NO reaction to it at all would not just suddenly fall in love because she walked home with him after school or because he shared an umbrella with her or something else really native to these shows. As sad as it may be for Mizuki, it's much better that they never tried to form a love between these two and instead focused on making the viewer laugh at her desperate attempts and the follow-up comedy...\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a high scool romance you've come to the wrong place, well I wouldn't say this is necessarily NOT a high school romance but I wouldn't say it was a generic high school romace either, they did provide quite a bit of fan-service though... Also excellent comedy errr-mmm hmm. This show and all of it's love able characters will give you a good laugh which definitely makes it worth watching in my books.",

Many scenes of his comedy are based on Cliches typical of this genre.\r\nThe animation is well done and the Soundtrack is also good, the background music goes well with the type of series, the opening is something sticky but it is lively in a mediocre way.\r\nThe characters: Mizuki is the only one who really caused me some grace with his behavior Tsundere towards Uchimaki (who will NEVER look at it as I can see), the rest of characters (Colette, the President, the girl Chunibyo and the teacher whoLooks like a student) have nothing of charisma and are somewhat boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe story about Mizuki trying to get Uchimaki (an obsessed Otaku) to focus on her, while attending an Art club where the only ones who draw are the two, because the rest of the members do not do it or they are lazy guided by a teacher Who looks more like a high school student moe. While a \"rival\" appears (which in the end turns out not to be) as obsessed with the anime as Uchimaki, let's say it could be better led and more ordered.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, I can not classify it as a bad series, it fulfilled my expectations according to what I expected from this anime.",

            "content": "[This review contains relatively major spoilers.]\r\nI am sort of glad that I watched this.\r\nI probably wouldn't recommend this to others.\r\nI have watched this once, subtitled. I have only watched the anime.\r\nI probably won't watch this again.\r\n---- Positives ----\r\nThe events of the first few episodes are interesting.\r\nThis series is a situation/happenings based school life series. The first several sections of the series are interesting. I initially had an extremely positive impression of this series. [Unfortunately, that impression didn't last through the end]\r\nA 2D-loving character who never falters.\r\nI've found that the 2D-loving character type is usually just an excuse to attract members of the opposite gender underfalse pretenses - once a group had gathered, the 2D-loving character reveals that they are actually 3D-loving as well. Such is not the case here - Uchimaki never shows any interest in 3D in the series, even to the point of it possibly being a negative [detailed in the Negatives section].\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is actually nice [though not on the surface].\\n\r\nThe way this series ends would usually be mediocre to negative for me, but when combined with how the entire series up until that point played out, I would consider the ending to be a positive. More details in the Negatives section regarding how Usami isn't treated well by the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe series ties in supporting characters without much of an introduction.\\n\r\nYes, this is a positive. Supporting characters are important to the story throughout, and when they show up, you're expected to remember who they are or just play along until you can figure out who they must be. This actually has a nice feeling to it, whereas many other series hit you over the head with who supporting characters are and spend too much time getting the viewer familiar with the characters before using them in meaningful ways.\\n\\n\r\nUsami's \"na--!\".\\n\r\nWhenever she's flustered, her reaction is interesting.\\n\\n\r\nUsami's dance at the end of episode 4.\\n\r\nI think this scene showed a lot despite being so short and potentially missable since it was mostly background music - the fact that this short scene wasn't voiced added to its value.\\n\\n\r\n---- Negatives ----\\n\\n\r\nWe lose Collette to Imari.\\n\r\nI thought that Collette was one of the best characters in the series, but partway through, she essentially gets tied to Imari and both of them get less-important roles from that point onward.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: Partially. Given that I don't recall ever seeing Collette paint, I should have known that she would eventually have less focus. --but I think that more scenes with her included would have been more interesting than the Usami-Uchimaki scenes that we got.\\n\\n\r\nUsami isn't treated very well by the story.\\n\r\nBy her measures [and the club president's measures], she's making progress, but Uchimaki never genuinely hints at reciprocal feelings. Two hints, when he says that he can just barely tolerate her modeling for a painting even though she's 3D, and possibly his gaze in the final episode, are given toward this romance, but that's all. Imari comes along and it seems like there's going to be a moment where she and Usami have a confrontation regarding Uchimaki, but that doesn't happen and, instead, Imari [takes Collette and] sort of fades into the background. That included, there are moments when the story could have given her a chance, but instead she just gets completely blocked at every turn.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: Yes, actually. The scene at the end is actually deep. Instead of the usual hinting at a romance at the end of a series, here we see Usami not compromising even through the mean story that she's had to fight against. She seems to be saying that she's willing to wait and become closer to Uchimaki when he's ready, rather than forcing it. Although the meanness of the story and the blocked-ness of the ending would usually be negatives, since they happen together, they're actually a positive for the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe series feels a little loose, even for a school life series.\\n\r\nThe later episodes are missing interesting developments and situations. The first few episodes were packed sufficiently with material, but the later episodes seemed deficient at times.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No, the series attempted to throw in Imari, but even that didn't last for too long. The later episodes could have had more-interesting scenarios and/or developments.",

            "content": "KonoBi :P\r\nKono Bijutsubu is a pretty funny show. The main character, Usami is a normal female person who after joining the art club, finds herself surrounded with *interesting* personalities. Being the normal person that she is, she tries to proceed with things normally or making things go normal, only to get get dragged into mayhem caused by the other characters.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThere isn't really a story in this show. It is more of the progress of the characters becoming closer and getting used to each other. Just like how you slowly get to know your friends as you guys just met each other, it is thesame in this show, just that in this show you start off with seeing their whacky personalities. There are a few sad undertones that realises how the characters are actually people with feelings too, even if it seems as if it is all just a fictional situation. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art is clear and bright-coloured. It has a light palette and gives the show a fun and cheerful feel, perfect for the genre it is trying to bring across: Comedy. The character expressions are decent and makes you expect funny situations one after another.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nWeird personalities mashed into one club does things pretty well :) \\n\r\nFirst we have Usami the main character. As I said before, a pretty normal character but that is exactly why she's not bad with the cast of characters as she brings across the contrast all what's happening with what is normal.\\n\r\nUchimaki Subaru is whom the show is secondarily based upon. A true blue otaku at its finest! As if it runs in his blood, Subaru is the manifestation of everything that is Otaku and sadly for Usami, only otaku. Joining the art club with the goal of creating the PERFECT WAIFU, Subaru's wholehearted passion ends up influencing all the activities the Art Club does. And you get to see drawings of waifus from various other shows too ;) including a trap.....\\n\r\nWith Colette's downright weirdly interesting antics, Club President's unending yearning for sleep and Imari Maria's super cute and cool chuuni mode <3, they somehow mesh together pretty well and make up a hilarious show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI'll be honest and say the extent of enjoyment is depending on one's own tastes but I can definitely say that the extent to which each character exhibits their personality is damn satisfying to watch how it plays out with corresponding the other character's personality and counter reactions. I had a lot of fun watching KonoBi every week and I hope you will as well.\\n\\n\r\nWatching KonoBi is a fun way to spend your time. While it may not be a masterpiece of sort, it is a decent comedy to bring out laughter. And by the way, there is a somewhat indirect vague resolution of the romance (?) at the last bridge scene :))\\n\\n\r\n\"True love transcends dimensions\" \\n\r\n\"There were too many good shows this season. I had to watch 30 episodes every week.\"\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning- This review may contain minor spoilers and is quite long\r\nI suppose I should write a review on something I actually quite liked. It'll be a good change from getting my blood boiling from busting out a 3000-word rant of an anime I generally despise. So here's an anime review of a short, sweet and relaxing anime that surprised me enough to write a review on it.\r\nKono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!, or \"Konobi!\" for short, is a one-cour series animated by studio feel- a studio that has sort of come to itself and started making some fairly big cult-hits like Dagashi Kashi andthe hot new romance that is Tsuki ga Kirei. These are a far cry from their more infamous (famous?) works like Mayo Chiki and Kiss x Sis. Konobi seems to be a sort of transition anime- something to test new waters on- a manga adaptation with SoL elements and a relaxed anime that doesn't take itself too seriously (with enough gimmicky situations to attract their old crowd) but also something that works hard to leave an impression on the viewer in the end. Does this work? Well, in a way, yes.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime can very easily be taken as a knock-off Gekkan shojou or Chuunibyou and indeed the comparisons are numerous enough to not be slightly suspicious towards the producers of the show. The anime is composed of short stories that take up about a third to half an episode and mostly involve the characters in various silly situations. Just like Gekkan and Chuu2. Where this anime divorces itself from the aforementioned shows, however, is the continuity. The events that transpire have consequences that influence the flow of the show as well as having an impact on future events. This makes the anime very well paced and its incredibly relaxing shifting between the stories as the show expertly slows and speeds up when it needs to. This is helped by the fact that the show is actually quite funny. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters initially started out as fairly normal middle school-SoL-comedy cast with the lazy Art club president, the male MC who has talent but applies it in questionable areas, a cloud cuckoolander girl who always finds opportunities to get up to her usual antics and the main character who has a crush on the male MC but is a class 2 tsundere and struggles to get her feelings out throughout the show- leading to comedic situations. This anime has some pretty great situational comedy. Things are actually quite predictable but the characters have enough charm with them that it just works. The situations the characters end up in are oftentimes unrealistic and happen for the sake of comedy but the anime knows this and balances it out with some great interactions between the different characters. There's even a character (Koyama sensei) who doesn't have any comedic situations tied to him and exist solely for grounding the anime. And he does a fine job. This groundedness and great pacing allow the anime to also work well as a slice of life as many of the short stories- especially in the second half- are simply sublime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely the highlight of this show. They may not be original and they certainly don't do things better than the cast of characters from the shows I've previously mentioned but they do have character. The main character- Usami Mizuki- is a fun character to follow around. Her passionate tendencies give rise to many hilarious moments such as the episode where the artist guy we never learn the name of (as a joke) trash talks on her crush's artistic style and motivations. She has such a large personality that its great to see her also have a more toned-down, perceptive and compassionate side to her to juxtapose as well as to add to the anime's overall relaxed nature. Her voice actor - Ozawa Ari - also voiced Chiyo from Gekkan. Whilst she was great there I feel she fitted the slightly immature Usami much better. The main male character- Uchimaki Subaru- is also pretty great. He's nowhere near as developed or well-explored as Mizuki and actually fits more into a generic main boy character. He has enough unique qualities to sell the relationship though as his generally calm demeanor also crosses into the territory of him having an inability to give a f*ck when the artist guy is trash talking him. Both he and Mizuki have solid background and motivations so whatever they do is perfectly reasonable and oftentimes hilarious. The interaction between the two in the various stories are fun to watch and the anime captures the innocent romance of a young middle school crush very nicely. The writing doesn't consider them as idiots and doesn't treat the audience as such either. They very much act their age and this makes every achievement- from completing the painted mural on the pool to completing the artwork made of cans at the end- all the more satisfying. I'm genuinely glad the anime focused on the (developing?) relationship between these two as they provide an endless source of fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters aren't as developed but they have adequate amounts of screentime and moments to themselves. It's enough to explore their different attributes and I consider the short stories dedicated to them- namely Colette the cloud cukoolander and the Art club president - to be some of the best with their meaningful and satisfying aesops as well as the charm in full force. I mean, I can't be the only one who found the game of \"staying in the shadow\" played between Colette and the little girl incredibly cute, right? Imari Maria makes is introduced as a slight Chuu2 character halfway through and doesn't get nearly as much as she deserves- being only around sometimes and is overshadowed by the rest of the cast. Her optimistic outlook and her generally free-spirited disposition, however, sell her character in the few scenes she has. I just wish she was actually as important as the show had initially shown her to be but I understand the show's desire to not step into the realm of a serious romance too much. So as a supporting character, she plays her role well. There's also the new advisor for the art club- Tachibana Yumeko sensei who finds herself in hilarious situations much of the time she appears but also receives just the right amount of screentime as well as a very nice introductory story. And the story in the first half of episode 8 is genuinly hilarious with her.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is quite similar to those of Doga Kobo's more recent works, especially in the colour and lighting department. It's a mostly subdued art style that emphasises the SoL nature of the show. The thing that annoys me about it though is the backgrounds being incredibly boring to look at. There's little to latch onto the scenery like in Doga Koba and Kyoani shows (heck, even JC Staff will kick its ass). I wouldn't be so harsh comparing it to those well-established studios if it weren't for this anime being made to obviously compete with the shows those studios turn out. The direction is also very boring throughout the show and it tells me that the people making this were perhaps playing it too safe. The director- Okawa Kei- has directed Oregairu season 2 and the soon-to-be-released Hinamatsuri (which looks really good for now). He and the directing staff do improve over the course of the show as the characters become more closely entwined with the story but overall it is decidedly average. The actual animation itself is decent. I like most of the character designs and the change of art styles at times adds to the anime's innocent-hearted expression. Some of the character animations in the later episodes are surprisingly great- enough to compete even with Kyoani at times. It is, however, quite inconsistent in the first half with some characters not drawn to scale correctly and the CG cars being quite distracting. I can happily say that the second half corrects most of these issues though. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is generally good. Unfortunately, I can't stop myself from comparing it to soundtracks in Doga Kobo shows. It really is similar to Gekkan- perhaps even more so than the art. It does have one soundtrack- \"Nijigenzuki de Warui desu ka\"?- which starts exactly like \"Kyoushuu kara Mebuku Mono\" from Hibike! Euphonium 2's soundtrack. Exact same notes (you can copy paste the names to YouTube and compare). This anime aired a season before Hibike!'s second season did so I find this situation quite funny. Both soundtracks are used in more emotional SoL moments in both anime so I can only guess two different minds came to the same conclusion on how to express the same type of scene through different paths. The OP is sung by Mizuki Nana and is not particularly great to listen to alone but the visuals do have perks I like such as Mizuki running with a paintbrush with red paint on the end- revealing the final picture she was painting at the end- an easy detail to miss. The OP sung by Uesaka Sumire is similar to Chuu2's ED with a cube in the middle of a revolving chequered landscape and the major characters spinning along. I don't really get it to be honest and I wish they put more effort into it but it works as a curtain closer.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime delivers some great SoL-romcom moments that allows it to compete with more established shows in its genre. The characters are well-written and have great personalities that are well explored with enough time given to them. The bulk of the story is told from the perspective of one of the best main characters- even better than Sakura Chiyo from Gekkan shojou in my opinion (to be fair, Gekkan has an overall much stronger cast). The character interactions are all great. The anime has superb pacing and a well-executed format of half episode-long stories that connect well with each other. The writing for these individual stories is sublime and are either very cute, funny, fun or all three. The animation and music aren't great but passable and it's a generally good show to look at due to its bright colour palette. This is not just a knock off Doga Kobo/Kyoani show- it actually beats them in some aspects. Its an anime that doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't try to win any awards but this adds to the charm of the show. I definietly recommend it to anyone looking for a SoL romcom.\\n\\n\r\nOther shows to recommend would be every show I mentioned in this review- Gekkan Shojou, Chuu2 etc. In fact, just go for most Kyoani and Doga Kobo shows (except Umaru). Tonari no Kaibatsu is an even more relaxed show with more mature high school characters in equally hilarious circumstances and situations (and better development). \\n\r\nStudio feel is an anime studio I'll be looking forward to in the future. Adapting from manga while the rest of the industry is still in the light novel frenzy is certainly enough to get my interested. If this show and Tsuki ga Kirei are any indication of what might come, we might have a new talent in a world dominated by JC Staff, Kyoani, PA Works and Doga Kobo. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n",

            "content": "AVERAGE! DAMN! SO AVERAGE.\r\nIt's not bad, it's just average. I knew there would be no story to speak of when going in, there almost never is any real story for shows like this, if you want story you need to go for light novels(most novels have a fairly good one since everything depends upon it) or long running manga that are more serious in nature. In the first place you can't expect anime to cover a lot of story with the diluted plot you get after processing it from the manga.\r\nAnyway, I didn't come here for any special plot or story, I watch stuff likethis to laugh and a serious story just tends to get in the way, so it's not a minus that there's none. However, I feel like I've seen this anime dozens of times at least. It's hard to laugh, at most I get a chuckle now and then and some light-hearted smiles. Clich\u00e9s are everywhere, seriously. This entire thing is pretty much just more food for the romcom starved people that love their clich\u00e9s. I've pretty much seen every character in this thing with another name and look in another story, often several of them in the same work, that's how overused this is. It's so damn overused. It's clear that the author just copy-pasted the generic stereotypes from other novels/manga/anime that \"works\" and thought \"it's tried and tested, failsafe, mwahahaha\", literally no effort whatsoever can have been put into making these characters and the least interesting ones are probably the two mcs. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, not only are the characters so overused and generic that you will feel like you've seen them countless times before, the story setting is the same. Yet another school romcom with some oddballs and a club setting, gosh, we haven't seen that before, right? It doesn't make it better that the jokes are stale as well and you WILL have heard/seen most of them before, extremely predictable. The author is not even trying to be imaginative and new-thinking, he's just comfortably recycling stuff that has worked in other anime/manga in a way that will make you sincerely believe that he is just sitting there flipping through other works and ripping them off when he finds something amusing while slightly changing it in one way or another, effectively catering to people who love that stuff way too much.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't really hate it, I just thought it was somewhat boring since it felt like I had seen it all before and that the author didn't even try to make stuff different. It's hard to make something completely fresh and new, but I'd like to at least see an effort to not adhere to EVERY character/story/joke clich\u00e9 with no exception and come up with some new stuff, at least get one or two original characters. \\n\\n\r\nDo I think you should watch this? Quite honestly, no. Unless you love the clich\u00e9s this thing offers, you will be bored to death. I recommend reading the manga instead, it will go faster and therefore it will be more interesting. Some stuff just doesn't adapt well into anime. This is one of those things, that is better as a manga. It will still be the same clich\u00e9s and other crap, but at least it will not bore you to death with more fast paced progression.",

            "content": "...well. Right from the first episode, I knew what I was in for. A romcom that was gonna drag on for however long it aired on a will-they-won't-they-confess being the base for its story. I've seen plenty of romcom anime that bring their own ideas / unique characters to the table. Ones that actually go somewhere with the ships, or ones that use the fact that the romance doesn't progress as the base for some creative jokes (ex: GSNK).  This? This....?\r\nThe romance doesn't progress, and it feels unbearably obligatory, as if making it go somewhere would mean the end of the show. The countlessfakeout confessions make the process that much more exhausting.  \\n\\n\r\nSide note: Why does Usami love someone whose hobbies she basically hates? He's obsessed with anime, and she barely (if at all) likes it. I haven't finished this to find out, but I'm betting it's one of those \"he was so nice that one random time\" thing. Usami, just....calm down. Let the guy draw anime fanart. \\n\\n\r\nIt's kind of funny that both Sakura Chiyo and Usami Mizuki are voiced by the same seiyuu. The contrast between the self-aware and hilarious parody of the shoujo genre and the unaware shamble of shoujo tropes is made more evident because of this.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy never got any semblance of a laugh out of me. It feels oddly....dry?\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, there is one, and only one thing I walked away from this liking.\\n\r\nThe opening.",

The Characters were relatable, especially for an otaku like myself and everyone else here. This show was extremely average personally. As I watched I could predict nearly everything that happened. The show had nothing to make it unique. That aside I thought the characters were fun to watch connect. The fact that she had a crush on Uchimachi yet he had his \"waifus\" was hilarious. They did a really good job on making it clear tothe audience that it was a comedy. I found myself laughing a lot. I wish the show had more story to it, i feel like It could be a show i would recommend to people if it had some sort of linear plot to follow.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, No i would not recommend this show to people who want to see it for its story. Although, if you would like to relax and unwind while watching a pretty funny anime, this is just the thing to watch. Don't expect much out of their relationship though. I was hoping for that the whole show and was kind of disappointed at the end. So I don't want to lead anyone on, forgive me for slightly spoiling their relationship. But nonetheless, I had fun watching the show and will look forward to any specials or even a season 2. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n\\n",

There could have been a story, but i don't really pretend it from that kind of anime. In my opinion is a great waste of potential and a \"bad\" planning choise, but the show isn't that bad, so i'll stop the moaning here.\r\nArt: 7\r\nHere is so much a matter of taste, people, the style isn't original and the animation not out of ordinary, but on that point i have to say that there isn't a reason for having amazinganimations for that kind of show, they only will result strange! All flow well and the art sytle and color are perfect for a school comedy/romance.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nNothing bad to say about the sound compart...oh, wait, i really don't like the ending, but the opening is light and happy/energetic enough to make me forget about that! The ost ride on the same line, light and happy, so it fits the mood of \"Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!\" perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\\n\r\nWell, that will be brief: no originality.\\n\r\nThe lack of originality in the chara desing and choice of personality isn't a \"so bad\" thing, alone, but you have to balance it at least with an original or strange way of interaction between the characters, if you don't do it the result will be poor. I gave a 6 because i like the \"character type\" that are present in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nI don't know why but i like the show. Maybe because it was relaxing and without pretention/presumption, a simple show that take itself for what it is, and nothing more. There were some funny moments, nothing hilarious, but surely funny!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a 6 nor a 7, i want half points lol\\n\r\nIf only they have put some more meat on the \"art fire\" and feast around it, the show might will became a lot more interesting!\\n\\n\r\nRecommended for who search some light and slightly funny anime to use as a break from more \"mental series\".",
