            "content": "Compared to the first season in which I did really like, the 2nd season was less climatic and actually more 'peaceful', yet I kept watching it till the end, probably just to see a resolution to the story or maybe just due to liking the main characters.\r\nAnimation: This is what I shall always be critical about, I have never liked BeeTrain's style which tends to drag the story and make everything slower paced than they are supposed to be. Noir and Madlax have been a snore fest for me, Tsubasa Chronicles although having a manga to backup, had almost the same pacing with characters wearingstatic expressions throughout the episodes with the exceptions of a few gasps and shouts... I mean... they are even lazy to make livelier expressions! And due to NHK restrictions, everything has been toned down. A little more blood and gore like the anime X or as projected in the manga would have propelled this anime to a higher rating, how they tried to make everything bloodless just seemed awkward. Don't misunderstand, CLAMPs art is still really good, its just the animation that did not live up to standards\\n\\n\r\nSound: No one has complaints here, Yuki Kajiura's music continues to excel with some great tracks like Crying Alone, Aikoi and Broken Sword of Justice, in fact, almost everyone would agree that the music is the main factor that still keeps viewers interested. For this season I preferred the ending to the opening, an uplifting, lively song full of hope and happiness, perfectly suited for Syaoran and Sakura's feelings. The seiyuus gave the same pleasing performances as before.\\n\\n\r\nStory: there were some arcs that were very good, like the Ashura arc, Kurogane's past and the Piffle arc. Some fillers were quite interesting too while some others like back to ChunHyang's world were just too repetitive. It was very apparant that they were trying to save the 2nd Syaoran bit as a climax for the next season by dragging out the plot to the extent of turning it into 'finding one feather an episode'. Therefore as an intermediate bit for the Tsubasa series, this season didn't leave too strong of an impression, yet it did succeed in leaving some questions and desire for the next season, thanks to the excellent Kurogane arc and the mysterious 'Syaoran in the tube' which gave hints to the other side of Tsubasa, a darker and unpredictable plot which was to be unfolded in the future.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The good point of Tsubasa is that the group of main characters are basically lovable, with different personalities and from different backgrounds, yet giving off a feel like they are one big happy family who care for each other very much. Mainly 2 obvious character developments were done in this season, including the background story of Kurogane and most importantly, Sakura does have a bit more development compared to the walking shell in the 1st season. Syaoran, Mokona and Fai were still their usual selves but I never minded that because seeing this group interacting is basically one of the fun moments of Tsubasa. Although thanks to the rigid animation, the characters still gave off a rather stony, lifeless feel. It may just be me but yes, compared to the other animated Clamp works, this seemed too obvious.\\n\\n\r\nI did still enjoy this series, thanks to the excellent music and my love for the Sakura+Syaoran pairing but still I can't help thinking this could have been handled a lot better with such a strong manga to back it up. In other words, it had potential, but it just didn't live up to most expectations.\\n\r\nIf you are fond of the first season though you might like the second season. However it would be advisable not to read the manga first or you'd get very disappointed with how this anime turned out to be",

            "content": "Since this is basically a continuation from the first season, I copied most of my review from Tsubasa Chronicle and put it here with a few changes:\r\nTsubasa RESERVoir Chronicle (TRC) - the anime - showed a lot of promise from its very first episode. However, because of the fact that TRC is aired during the children's hour in Japan, which limits exactly the kind of content they are allowed to put into this anime, and as a result, have disappointed many viewers thinking they would be witnessing a story that was close to what was written in the manga by CLAMP. However, despite all ofthat, Tsubasa Chronicle still shapes up to be a relatively enjoying series, if you can get through a couple of the more slower arcs and horrendous fillers.  The second season is full of more of the same as with the first season, but with more fillers in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, is pretty much the same as it was with the first season.  CLAMP does an excellent job in that department.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kaijura has once again put together a very beautiful soundtrack to go along with the second season.  He has presented us with more emotional and beautiful scores to go along with the anime and you will find yourself humming a lot of the tunes.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season is pretty much a slow continuation from the first season.  However, I feel it goes even slower than the first and you just feel like your being cheated out of the potential of a very good anime.  However, because it is shown during the children's hour, that may be a plausible reason that the potential is not being reached.  Again, if you have the patience to put up with slow progress and fillers, the relationship between Sakura and Syaoran is what makes this anime worth it.",

            "content": "Choose the title you find more appropriate: Tsubasa Filler Chronicles or Tsubasa Disappointing Chronicles, because either way, I wouldn't exactly call this an actual \"season two\".\r\nSTORY: CLAMP's ever so popular (And probably my favorite CLAMP title) massive cross over manga series, Tsubasa, continues on it's second anime season.\r\nWith it's likable main cast: the determined Syaoran, the kind and sweet Sakura, gruff swordsman Kurogane, the goofy but mysterious Fai, and of course the mascot, Mokona all in toll, most fans are expecting another enjoyable (and hopefully with a faster paced story) world(s) traveling adventure as they continue to collect feathers in order to return Sakura's lostmemories.\\n\\n\r\nAnd from what I can tell, that's exactly what the producers were hoping for, that the fans love the characters just enough to watch this season, so they can get away with very pointless episodes, and with little actual story material only follow about three story arcs from the manga that barely cover half of the animes episode span, and the rest of it becoming boring filler episodes (With nine straight filler episodes until its end).\\n\r\nIt's not that these episodes are the most absolutely terrible things in the world, it's just that the writers, unfortunately, seem to have taken advantage of the traveling to different worlds concept for the sake of being a cash in, with no effort on expanding the story.\\n\r\nAnd what's the worse side-effect of a mostly filler season? Little to almost no character development at all.\\n\r\nThe cast are simply boring husks of themselves, they don't develop, they don't do anything different, they just stay the same.\\n\\n\r\nGoing further into laziness, this anime constantly rehashes all of it's side characters from various other series created by CLAMP, which is another concept that got taken advantage of from the manga, that even fans of other CLAMP titles will tire of these recurring characters. Which was something manga was charming and famous for.\\n\r\nAnother noticeable fact is the series main antagonist does little to nothing at all in the story (Less than what what he did in the manga I mean) except a few chats with his female subordinate or a few speeches.\\n\r\nAnd in the end, hardly any progress is made in the story, that ended up becoming just a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nART: Constant low budget animation, that sometimes have obvious quality issues, and Tsubasa deserved better than this, even flipping through pages of the manga looked better than half of the anime, which only adds to the disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: But unlike the animation, it appears that they had put effort with a bigger budget for the background music, though there are some techno background music that sounds totally out of place, and the theme music is nothing special compared to season one's.\\n\r\nThe english dub in the first season suffered a lot from the voice actors having to get used to their roles in a slow start up feel, but thankfully in season two it's not the main problem anymore. \\n\r\nThe english cast itself is quite an impressive line up with big name voice actors Vic Mignogna, Chris Sabat, Monica Rial, and Jason Liebrecht voicing the main cast. \\n\r\nEspecially Chris Sabat who is well suited for Kurogane and Monica Rial was an excellent choice for Sakura.\\n\r\nBut even with the improvements to the english dub, it is still underwhelming. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ The Tsubasa crew enters in its \"second season.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Almost no character development at all.\\n\r\n- Very boring filler episodes make up the majority of the season, taking advantage of several concepts the manga has in order to make these episodes.\\n\r\n- Bland theme music and a sub par english dub.\\n\r\n- Disappointing animation.\\n\\n\r\nI feel that by the end of the season many fans will feel that they wasted their time, but not completely hate it, just feel very disappointed that very little of manga's story made it's way to the anime's \"second season\".",

Do not let it matter what pressures others put on you! Continue to wish for that which your heart truly desires!!\u201d\r\nRecently I watched Season 1 of Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicals (will be shortened to Tsubasa for the sake of the review) and I enjoyed it a lot actually. If you had read my review on Season 1, you might remember that I had very few problems with the series, mainly on the story, but either way I likedit enough to watch Season 2. Let me say that I found Season 2 to be more enjoyable for quite a few reasons actually, one being that there was more action in this season than in the previous, another being more of a plot starting to unfold (eventually leading up to Tokyo Revelations if my sources are correct), and more back stories to our heroes. So, without further ado, let's get this review started, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nTsubasa is an anime about a princess who looses her memories, and the journey of her and 3 heroes as they set on a journey through other dimensions to find those lost memories that have taken the form of powerful feathers that can grant the holder tremendous powers, often leading to trouble. As our heroes explore these worlds, they usually end up helping the citizens of that dimension with problems involving evil emperors, demons, or other things similar to that. That was the basic plot of season 1, and season 2 is very similar to that. Basically, it's a continuation of their journey for her feathers. As I said before, the plot had started to unfold the further the anime progresses. Mysterious characters start to come into play, character's back stories are told, and it all starts to piece together little by little. Other than those few additions to the story, it is very similar to the first season, but like the first season, the second season fails to end the series on a satisfying note, which is why they ended up making 7 more episodes to conclude the series. Overall, I personally found the story better in this season.\\n\\n\r\nBee Train was the company who animated Tsubasa, same company who animated Phantom ~Requiem for the Phantom~, Murder Princess, and the .//hack series. I enjoyed the animation as much as I had the first season, so I was satisfied when I realized not much had changed in the art department.\\n\\n\r\nI've watched the English Dub, due to the fact I received both Season 1 and 2 as gifts from a family member. From what I watched, I liked the voice acting in season 2 better. My main problem with the English Dub in season 1 was Monica Rial's singing. While I do love her acting career, I hated hated HATED it when she sang. It was off pitch and frankly... annoying. However, there was no singing coming from her in this season, so that upped my opinion about the dubbed cast for this series. I still love Vic Mignogna as Fai, and Kurogane and Syaoran started becoming more likable the more they talked.\\n\\n\r\nNot much should change from my last review in terms of the characters. For starters, we have Syaoran. He's the male protagonist of the series. He's calm, he's smart, and he has rad kicking abilities, so rad that he might even give Sanji (One Piece) a run for his money. He is also slightly skilled with a sword, thanks to Kurogane. Kurogane (Kuro-Poo, Kuro Kuro, Kuropon, Daddy, nicknames are endless) is the big, buff, rough and tough character that no one should mess with if they don't want their butt kicked. He is scary at times, but he's an overall nice and funny guy. Next is Fai, my personal favorite. He's apparently a mage, but you'd never be able to tell that he is cause he never seems to use his magic. Quite frankly, I don't even know what he does to help anymore... but he's still epic. Sakura is the female protagonist of the series. She's gotten easier to handle the more memories she gets, but until the finally confesses to Syaoran (if she even confesses), I'll be thinking of her as a character that can't really seem to do anything. And last, the most annoying character in the entire series... Mokona. Like most animes, there is always that little animal sidekick that usually ends up annoying the heck out of me. She/He is standable this season, but just barely. Overall, a slight improvement on the characters this season.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot. I will eagerly await the Tokyo Revelations/Spring Thunder Chronicals in the mail as it ships all the way from wherever Amazon is keeping it... but until then, I recommend that you watch this. It is also recommended that you watch season 1 before this due to the fact that some characters will be returning from season 1 in season 2, but if you don't mind, you can watch this if you so desire. But overall, I liked Tsubasa a lot.",

            "content": "The first season of Tsubasa Chronicle was riddled with problems that bogged down an otherwise great show concept. Having an expanded universe of in-house creations across different worlds/dimensions is an exciting idea. Sadly, when coupled with mediocre animation, flat voice acting, and worst of all, one-off stories that don't go anywhere, it's hard to still justify that concept. The 2nd season promises more exciting and dangerous adventures and to possibly repair the mistakes of the past. But does it actually deliver on its promise? Personally, I have to disagree.\r\nWith the last major arc of the 1st season, we are left with a few unresolved questions.Who is the mysterious clone of Syaroan kept by Fei Wong? Will Syaroan's rival Seishiro come back to impede his progress? How many more memory feathers are there? What about the pasts and significance of Fai and Kurogane? There's a lot for this show to explain and cover in 26 episodes and yet it seems that the series seems more content dragging its feet than to hold its viewer's attention. More \"feather of the week\" episodes are abound in this season, many of them never relating back to the main questions at hand. The first 3 episodes are dedicated to a race with a feather as the prize. During the preliminaries, it is discovered someone is meddling with the race and causing the \"dragonfly\" cars to explode! Fast-paced action plus a dash of psychological insight would have made this a stellar beginning to the season. Instead, it's a slow watch as the race plays out predictably up until a nonsensical twist. You could say the same for many of the arcs in this season - they have an interesting premise, play out slow and predictably, then throw a random twist in there that's more confusing than entertaining. Considering the series has been quite straightforward thus far, I doubt it's anything that you need to think about - it's more or less a way so the story can start moving to the next world.\\n\\n\r\nWhat could be considered the most disappointing is that a rather large chunk of the season is filler! The first 17 episodes are more or less canon, while the last 9 are all originals. Are the original episodes at least a worthwhile watch? Normally I'd say no, but considering the material I've seen up until these episodes, I'd say stick with it if you like what you see. Most of the originals are bland like the one where Kero from Cardcaptor Sakura and Mokona meet, but some of them have some fairly interesting ideas. The one where they return to Koryo to meet Chu'nyan and enter a demon parallel world is decent for extended world building and the last arc in Tao Country with the ruler Chaos had a lot of good ideas. But I've said this before - this show is great with ideas but it doesn't know how to properly execute them. With a better studio or writing staff at the helm, it would've made for a great OVA. Instead, its underdeveloped and is more content being padding for a season than it is showing off the team's creative talents.\\n\\n\r\nAs curious as some of these originals are, it begs the question - why not adapt the manga portion for the last 9 episodes instead of coming up with originals?  There's a rather intriguing answer behind this. According to a comment made by a fan of the series, the show originally aired on a channel that was more educational and made for kids. A major arc in the series, the Tokyo arc, shows a lot of violence and gore(!) - rather than adapt this, they instead filled up the rest of the requested episodes with their own. There are many conclusions you can walk away with from this story - the studio weren't fully aware of the restrictions and they did it out of necessity, they wanted a kiddie series like Cardcaptor Sakura and instead they got something much more dark, etc. Whatever the case, everyone loses with the end result and the Tokyo arc could've showed off the strong potential the series has.\\n\\n\r\nSo does this season at least do anything better than the previous one? Gladly, it does! The biggest takeaway from this is Kurogane's backstory, in which we see a tale of a young swordsman hone his craft in a royal family only for tragedy to strike and scar him permanently. It's not as impactful as a solid \"wandering ronin\" tale, but it's a shining moment that the series desperately needed. Though Fai doesn't get any real backstory (again), an early one-off episode gives a small peak as to what it may be. Even without all the finer details, it still is a rather sweet story that shows off Fai's boyish charm. Though we don't get all the pieces to the puzzle, there's enough to help shape a better image of Syaroan and Sakura's partners.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is still the same for the series, bland and second rate. It needs help from Bee Train's parent company, Production I.G., badly. Compare this to the flashiness the Birdcage movie had - it's a real disappointment. As a general rule of thumb, if your show is action oriented, shortcuts only hurt it overall. This wouldn't be as bad if the series were a slice of life but the cutaways during a critical scene and off-models really damage the appearance of the show. I will say that there seems to be more variety in the music, with a few more original songs. I take back what I said about the first season music-wise - the soundtrack to this anime is very good and helps save a few scenes with Yuki Kajiura's wonderful songwriting. The voice acting also seems a bit more lively this time - it's not perfect but it evokes more emotion than the stale delivery that haunted the first season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Tsubasa Chronicle 2nd Season a 4/10. Some series get better if you allow them the chance to shine. Other series are almost mandatory to watch in full - to quote a friend, \"you need to see the ending to understand the beginning\". Tsubasa Chronicle, at least from the anime adaptation, is neither of those. It is a series that comes close to achieving strength but poor circumstances deny it from being a series that's worth any investment. I can not recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nDo you like or dislike this anime? If you haven't watched it, are you encouraged to watch it or not? Leave a comment on my profile telling me what you think of the anime and/or my review.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading and have a blessed day!",

            "content": "When I first reviewed Tsubasa Chronicle's first season, I was curious as to where all the negative reviews came from. The anime seemed like a faithful enough adaptation at first glance. Aside from its mediocre animation quality and the two filler episodes, I just couldn't see why it received such a enormous backlash.\r\nThen 2nd Season happened.\r\nLet's just sum up everything wrong about Tsubasa Chronicle 2nd Season:\r\n1) The chronology of the manga content is even more jumbled up than before.\r\n2) The censorship being more prevalent and obvious.\r\n3) Lapses in logic (AKA plot-holes) and otherwise alterations of Tsubasa's lore.\r\n4) Half of the season is filler.\r\n5) More thanhalf of the fillers are boring or pointless.\\n\r\n6) No manga content were adapted after Recort arc. Anime's story ended with an ambiguous ending that suggested that the characters' journey continues with no end in sight.\\n\\n\r\nSome time during production, I'd assume, Bee Train was forced into a rushed production by NHK. They also had to cut out the Tokyo story arc and beyond because of their mature content in order to pander to a younger audience. But even with that consideration, I have no idea why they switched the order of the story around. Not only does it spoil certain story content ahead of time, it also causes certain plot-holes to appear. These plot-holes were aggravated by the fillers replacing certain manga story arcs, including the Idol arc, and this probably made adapting the rest of the manga even more difficult for the studio when certain plotline didn't make sense due to these alterations.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be one thing if all the fillers were as amazing as the first handful of them in 2nd season. I was actually rather impressed by the first three filler episodes of the season. The first one corrected the plot-hole the previous season created, which is that the dead could never be brought back to life, no matter how much power you have. Not only did it correct that lore, it also included a cruel irony involving Sakura causing a tragedy she could've only prevented with a specific memory she retrieved at the end of that episode. That's rather brilliant writing for a filler. The other two episodes showed the main characters' interactions with others who looked like people they knew. This resulted in some decent interaction as we get to see more of how the characters felt towards those people, even if they are not the same person.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the rest of the fillers were nowhere as interesting or insightful, as they are either pure fanservice material (Kero of CCS makes an appearance), or just boring story arcs that shovel the story along, resulting in no interesting lessons, message, or character development of significance. And there truly isn't much character development indeed because they strayed away from the Tokyo arc, a story arc that involved major plot-development and significant changes to the main characters. As a result, most of the main characters lost their opportunity to grow beyond their boring and cliched archetypes, especially the Mary Sue Sakura that could do no wrong. There's a reason why this band of heroes seemed like your typical shounen heroes - it's so that CLAMP could deconstruct these archetypes in the Tokyo arc. Unfortunately, because the anime didn't get to do that, we are left with the cliches and none of the deconstruction. Sakura, especially, was left behind as the dull and annoying Mary Sue who could do no wrong, when in the manga, she became more battle-hardened and independent. Kurogane also never got to learn the meaning of true strength because the Celes arc never happened in this anime, so he ended up as a typical grumpy antihero we've seen a million times. We never got to learn why Fai chose not to use magic, or why he seemed to have a death-wish in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nI also really don't like how Sakura's feathers came with memories that were conveniently related to the theme of each episode. Very contrived and lazy writing. The final filler arc in the season also contains some of the worst fillers of all the episodes, not just because it's boring, but because it's riddled with the most amount of plot-holes and bad writing. For one thing, many of Sakura's feathers had conveniently fell into the country of Tao without any explanation at all; for another, Fai's curse was not triggered when a certain being of enormous magical capacity had appeared, thus breaking a major rule about Fai that surfaced in the Infinity arc (of the manga). And don't get me started on that stupid ending where the journey goes on forever and ever. What is this? Pokemon?!\\n\\n\r\nThere are just so many changes to the storyline that Tsubasa is ultimately butchered and bears little to no resemblance with the manga version of the story after Recort. CLAMP is partly responsible for springing such a game-changing deconstruction in the Tokyo arc, I guess, but I wonder why they didn't bother to hash out these developments properly behind the scenes before allowing Bee Train to adapt the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, drop the anime after the Recort arc, and don't bother with the fillers except the first three. Stick with the manga after that. I only bothered to finish this series just so I could review it properly, but I was so glad when it was finally over.",

            "content": "Well, sequels are always exciting and expected to be even better that the previous season. And this sequel is way even better than the season one.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026.\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nThe very adventurous journey of the group continues in this sequel when new worlds are a lot more exciting with actions, laughter, romance and heart-warming drama of the main characters as well as for the characters they meet. Even previous worlds are further explored. But of course, the most anticipating and exciting part for the sequel are the revelations. Questions are slightly answered, truths slightly unfold, and the main plot is slightly hinted. Thelines are more inspiring. The romance part is also further explored.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nIn this season, because they\u2019ve been journeying for so long, the main characters\u2019 bond is even stronger when they gradually open up about their pasts. They appreciate, understand, and trust one another even more. They even influences and give advises with each other. Even Fai, who\u2019s the hardest one to understand because of his poker face, gradually let others in. He sometimes uses his abilities to help others when he himself said that he vowed not to do so. In the previous season, Sakura was very frail, weak, and quiet because the memories that have been returned to her were still very few. But in this season, she is a lot more cheerful and strong-willed. And even without her memories of Syaoran, somehow she still feels the same way for him. On the other hand, Syaoran admits that he does not only stay beside Sakura because of the feathers but he himself wants to. Even when their pasts are slightly hinted, most of them still have a very mysterious aura about them but among them Syaoran is the most mysterious. When the plot is gradually unfolding, his identity is becoming more and more confusing and because of that, every revelation is just so exciting and anticipating. But of course, the most fun part is still the gathering of other characters from previous worlds and another anime. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION and SOUND\\n\r\nThe animation is also even better with breath-taking landscapes of every new world. Well, CLAMP has one of the best illustrations and artworks in the history of manga and anime world. Again, with the sounds. The sounds are just ridiculously amazing. It does not only give the final touch to the series but it is one of the biggest factors why this series is such a hit. It\u2019s unique and very much original but most amazingly, it is magical, beautiful, and just so brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nWith that all said, I guess my only slight disappointment would be that the plot is just slightly revealed. And when I say slightly I mean very much slightly. I\u2019ve read the manga form already and so I am anticipating for the adaptation of it in anime form. As much as I love mangas, I am a very visual person so I just love to see the story in anime form. And if you think that the revelations in this season are plenty already then you are horribly wrong. I would say it is just around 20-30% of the real thing. Well, setting aside that, this is definitely one of the most amazing series ever in the history of manga and anime world. \\n",

            "content": "Animation: No complaints\r\nSounds: No complaints\r\nPlot: Lots of complaints. The first half of this season builds a number of interesting scenarios with some rather deep messages- death is permanent, coping with your past, what it means to love someone vs what it means to love your idea of someone- these ideas disappear in the second portion of this season and are replaced with numerous cheesy platitudes and reused worlds. There is also a guy in a tank of water who bears a striking resemblance to the main character, but nothing about him is ever explained. The villain with muttonchops and a monocle seems important but ispassed over and replaced with a person who is- apparently- a sentient version of Sakura's feathers, it is never explained why these particular memories are able to achieve sentience, or why they are all together for that matter.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Lots of complaints, I'll just list them by character.\\n\\n\r\nSyaoran- Generic hero, his childhood friend and possible love interest is in danger and he needs to help her. Nothing ever comes of a rather intense scene wherein Syaoran seems to forget who he is for a moment and utterly destroys a guardian in the lands of Rekord. \\n\\n\r\nKurogane: Generic  monsters-destroyed-my-village fighter.\\n\\n\r\nSakura: Cardboard cut out love interest and plot device. She demonstrated the possibility of being interesting, then Mokona's spell backfired.\\n\\n\r\nFai- On the verge of becoming interesting. Like Syaoran, there are numerous hints up to the land of Rekord that imply something not quiet right about our little Wizard friend. It's a good thing Mokona's teleporting spell backfired, or else you may have had to develop a less than Black-and-white character with (GASP) complexities that stem beyond happy-go-lucky Fai. Why, in the first season, does Fai give us the impression his own life isn't worth all that much to him? Why, in this season, does Fai go out of his way to help that girl from Chobits? Why is that tattoo so important to him? Who is King Ashura? Who is Yuui?(Oh wait, the name Yuui isn't even mentioned because that takes us to close to a character being three dimensional and not all-good or all-bad.)\\n\\n\r\nYuuko- I've been building a bit of a theme here, up until Mokona's teleportation spell backfires in the Land of Rekord a number of characters seem to be on the verge of becoming interesting. Yuuko's personality before Rekord is a complete 180 from her personality after Rekord. In the final arc of the show Yuuko spits out this \u201cBe good so good things happen to you!\u201d line that her character lacks both the moral authority and stupidity to blurt out. What happened to the character who demands equal compensation for all services rendered and why would someone with a philosophy like that spout such idiotic none sense? What happened to the character who attempted to work around the fate she was provided without breaking the codes she adhered to? I really don't even know what to say, I'm pretty sure I suffered a concussion from the amount of times my head hit my desk when that line came up on my subtitles.\\n\\n\r\nThis series wasn't just bad in the way some series are bad: It was bad because it was so disappointing.",

            "content": "Fans of the first season- this is nothing more than fun. The second season of Tsubasa proved to be pretty dull in most aspects. Expecting plot development? The same awesome music from the first season? Motion? Well, you're in for a big surprise- Tsubasa, the second season, has little to none.\r\nFirst of all, let's begin with the easy stuff to point out. The art itself is something I've always enjoyed, but the stiffness in the first season was a little uncomfortable. Things don't move very often, and looping is almost overused. I was hoping I could see some improvement for the second season, but Iwas disappointed once again. Things get stiffer. Pauses are almost unbearable and half of the motion in the characters and such is strictly looping. Visually, Tsubasa was a boring piece of work. \\n\\n\r\nThank heavens for the sound, which swoops in and saves the day (sometimes). Though from time to time, you hear the old familiar songs we know and love from the past (or even maybe a rendition or two) play during scenes, the popularly used songs of season two are a little aggravating in my mind. The new hit fighting song became a techno-pop-like sound, that I can't really place, and I wish I could give it a better genre. What I do know is that the way it drags on and keeps repeating reminds me of a mediocre video game. Other popular songs include vocal tracks. This is not only a little distracting from the dialogue, but the vocals don't always have the best English, so your ears are competing with an accent and the occasional Engrish. Maybe this was difficult enough that I missed plot development.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is our next topic! So I thought the episodes were fun. To be honest, I felt they had more variety and more substance than in the first season (even with places of old showing up). Things were kept creative, and it was fun to watch the journey progress now that everyone is so close to one another. There's no denying it's definitely more fun than season one, at least for the proper Tsubasa fan. But for all viewers, I'm afraid to say the story moves forward only an inch or two. Don't expect anything to really happen. They vaguely mention a twist here or a twist there, but why? And when will it ever show up again? Only the nonexistent Tsubasa season 3 could tell, but, well... \\n\\n\r\nMost of this season I would label a disappointment. At least, if I'm paying attention to what's really going on. For some mindless Tsubasa-loving entertainment, go ahead and try it out. Fans, it's fun! Only fun, and probably not worthy of buying. But go ahead and rent it if season one wasn't enough Tsubasa for you. Just know, you've been warned.\\n\\n\r\n-shoujokiss7",

There are differences but not that much.\r\nI happen to add +1 in Story (4/10). After reaching its downfall and it's poor progression of the story, it eventually became decent enough for me to accept that fact and just enjoy the series.\r\nI gave their sound -1 (9/10). The OP and ED isn't near to the goodness of season one. The first season's OP and ED were very irresistible. I always had the habit of skipping OPs and EDs but Tsubasa Chronicle broke that record for me. The only thing thattells me to keep it great is because of its awesome insert songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe character progression, even at its slow pacing, really improved... AT LAST! I've been waiting for this time... been waiting for this improvement! Added a one to character (8/10) for it.\\n\\n\r\nThis season is basically the same as the first season but its downfall isn't falling that hard now. It's remaining on its rate not to be one... still, it did fall down greatly.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I'd have to suggest this to people who like romance with a little bit of action in it. I wouldn't really suggest anyone to watch this series... never especially having 52 episodes with more than 3/4 as outrageous fillers.",

It is very recommended you buy the OVA with this season. The OVA continues and leaves the show with a more complete ending.\r\nThis a tie-in show for most of studio Clamp\u2019s works.  Most of show\u2019s characters are either directly referenced or remade.  Watching all the other shows isn\u2019t necessary but adds to the backgrounds a bit.  xxxHolic season 1 before Tsubasa would be a plus though. \r\nAnyhow, it\u2019s a good adventure story.This part has Sakura more involved since she is closer to being complete again.  The characters get stronger as you would expect\\n\\n\r\nTheme Songs 4/5\\n\r\nThis season has another good opening and ending.  Mostly fast paced, I didn\u2019t skip them.\\n\\n\r\nEnding 3/5 \\n\r\nNO spoilers, the ending was\u2026 incomplete at best.  The OVA does a better job.  It\u2019s still recommended.\\n",

The second season is, as said, just more of what you saw in the first season. They're collecting feathers for another 26 episodes. Since I've already read the manga, but a while ago so im unsure what's really in the manga and what is a filler, I'm fine with just enjoying the ride thus its a 7 in enjoyment. \r\n But(!) if you're watching this season in the hopes of getting answers you're in for disappointment. It doesn't really tell you anythingof relevance to the main story, that's why I give that part a 5. If you actually want to get on with the series as a story my tip is to watch the OVA \"Tokyo revelations\". You'll see what I mean.",

            "content": "When I watched the first episode I thought this should be a great anime, unfortunately it's pretty much all filler which really takes it's toll in the second season. With little amounts of plot thrown in it makes it quite a chore to keep watching.\r\nThe same characters they meet was a novelty at first but seeing them meet the same characters in different settings with different memories which felt like the fiftieth time started to feel very old and very predictable. It then included the characters helping them in some way again and it began to felt like groundhog day. Though I must admit whenthey're in the cartoon world the filler was appreciated and was a nice change of pace. When I reached episode 45 I started thinking they're not going to have much time to develop the story and it will become rushed which would be a shame because the small bits of plot that were given was good, by episode 50 I realized they're not going to include any answers at all and it was going to be in 5 episodes of OVA's.. Which I would imagine will feel rushed unless they're all forty minutes long.\\n\\n\r\nWith CLAMP you find that the art is intricate and beautiful with each character having a distinct face and the clothing being well thought out and detailed. Though the characters look to be eating Green Giant sweetcorn without hitting the gym to bulk up and rocking the praying mantis look.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in the anime is fantastic and sounds epic which I felt suited the first episode and unfortunately very little else, this was due to it being over used in situations that didn't really need it, such as when they arrive in a new land and they see two men in masks fighting with wooden swords, which felt like the anime didn't know how to differentiate between action scenes and leisurely strolls.\\n\\n\r\nTsubasa Chronicle is an anime not without good points, the characters are well developed as you would expect of 52 episodes of filler, and you feel connected to the characters and their struggles, though you start to feel cheated when you learn a little of the main plot only to be dragged straight back to meeting the punk gang again. Fai and Kurogane provide the entertainment and one liners, while Sakura and Syaoran sit quiet and say please and thank you and remind you that they're still there and without the story backing it up you wonder why any of them are travelling at all.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy the anime though it was mainly because of Kurogane and Fai, with their voice actors being Piccolo of Dragon Ball and Tamaki Suoh of Ouran Highschool Host Club and pretty much being the same characters it felt like a cross over with them exchanging one liners and insults to one an other.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would say if you're not a fan of filler I wouldn't recommend you to watch it, read it on Wikipedia instead in half the time and you will get all of what happened in the 52 episodes. I am going to continue to watch the OVA's so it's not bad enough to rage quit but certainly is a struggle, with the humor and the beautiful worlds they travel to it makes it enjoyable and it does start to feel like an epic journey and you will want to know how it all ends for their worlds and the characters.\\n\\n\\n",

By chasing the truck? It last for many minutes? (I don't know if thatarc last for 2-3 episodes or what) But overall it's nice so i give the story 6\\n\\n\r\nArt : CLAMP's art style, yes, i love clamp's art style, the eyes are unique in their way, especially how they colored the texture of fai's eye. but Beetrain made another failure, but this time the art is better than the first, i love how they made a little effort, but still fuck you beetrain :v so i'll give the art 7\\n\\n\r\nSound : Kajiura Yuki once again made a very nice musical score, better than the first one, i rated it 8 because the ending song doesn't attract me a lot, the Opening? I love it, This is better than the OP of the first\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : going to listed it \\n\\n\r\nSakura : (7/10) at the first season, we see her very fragile, but at this season, she is very cheerful, but sometimes useless (sorry SyaoSakura fans)\\n\\n\r\nSyaoran : (7/10) i rate him 7 because he developed a little but still become mysterious, a lots of question enter in my mind, including the mystery behind his eye\\n\\n\r\nKurogane : (8/10) now i understand why he fight, \"a man who is fighting because the monster just ruined his village\" warrior\\n\\n\r\nFai : (8/10) he become more mysterious at the season 2, a lots of question just entered at my mind while observing him (this is not a fan talk, because i'm his fan for a long time) the top question is \"Why his aura suddenly goes mysterious? Is it about his mask? Or something bothers him? Why he help chi? Is there any relation about king Ashura to him?\" But still he's one of the great CLAMP characters ever made\\n\\n\r\nMokona : (6/10) sometimes Mokona is useless, but she is still helpful, well the episode 11 is the best stand alone episode because of her and her minds\\n\\n\r\nYuuko : (5/10) i'm still thinking something about her since that time i haven't read the XXXHolic but now it makes sense to me. The thing that bothers me about her is \"does she have any conscience in what she take from them?\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall i give the characters 7\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : (6/10h i give it 6 even thou i enjoy it because some other episodes here are just nonsense, example of it is the Truck chasing episode, even thou they need to get the feather at the truck, the complain here is why it last for minutes?, also there's an episode where they back again to one of the worlds where they went, oh come on! **facepalm** then the ending wasn't animated\\n\\n\r\nOverall : i rate it 7, TC is an anime that sometimes will disappoint you but you'll find it enjoyful, if you fond of the beautiful music that is definitely a masterpiece, you'll find it enjoyful",

            "content": "Compared to the first season in which I did really like, the 2nd season was less climatic and actually more 'peaceful', yet I kept watching it till the end, probably just to see a resolution to the story or maybe just due to liking the main characters.\r\nAnimation: This is what I shall always be critical about, I have never liked BeeTrain's style which tends to drag the story and make everything slower paced than they are supposed to be. Noir and Madlax have been a snore fest for me, Tsubasa Chronicles although having a manga to backup, had almost the same pacing with characters wearingstatic expressions throughout the episodes with the exceptions of a few gasps and shouts... I mean... they are even lazy to make livelier expressions! And due to NHK restrictions, everything has been toned down. A little more blood and gore like the anime X or as projected in the manga would have propelled this anime to a higher rating, how they tried to make everything bloodless just seemed awkward. Don't misunderstand, CLAMPs art is still really good, its just the animation that did not live up to standards\\n\\n\r\nSound: No one has complaints here, Yuki Kajiura's music continues to excel with some great tracks like Crying Alone, Aikoi and Broken Sword of Justice, in fact, almost everyone would agree that the music is the main factor that still keeps viewers interested. For this season I preferred the ending to the opening, an uplifting, lively song full of hope and happiness, perfectly suited for Syaoran and Sakura's feelings. The seiyuus gave the same pleasing performances as before.\\n\\n\r\nStory: there were some arcs that were very good, like the Ashura arc, Kurogane's past and the Piffle arc. Some fillers were quite interesting too while some others like back to ChunHyang's world were just too repetitive. It was very apparant that they were trying to save the 2nd Syaoran bit as a climax for the next season by dragging out the plot to the extent of turning it into 'finding one feather an episode'. Therefore as an intermediate bit for the Tsubasa series, this season didn't leave too strong of an impression, yet it did succeed in leaving some questions and desire for the next season, thanks to the excellent Kurogane arc and the mysterious 'Syaoran in the tube' which gave hints to the other side of Tsubasa, a darker and unpredictable plot which was to be unfolded in the future.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The good point of Tsubasa is that the group of main characters are basically lovable, with different personalities and from different backgrounds, yet giving off a feel like they are one big happy family who care for each other very much. Mainly 2 obvious character developments were done in this season, including the background story of Kurogane and most importantly, Sakura does have a bit more development compared to the walking shell in the 1st season. Syaoran, Mokona and Fai were still their usual selves but I never minded that because seeing this group interacting is basically one of the fun moments of Tsubasa. Although thanks to the rigid animation, the characters still gave off a rather stony, lifeless feel. It may just be me but yes, compared to the other animated Clamp works, this seemed too obvious.\\n\\n\r\nI did still enjoy this series, thanks to the excellent music and my love for the Sakura+Syaoran pairing but still I can't help thinking this could have been handled a lot better with such a strong manga to back it up. In other words, it had potential, but it just didn't live up to most expectations.\\n\r\nIf you are fond of the first season though you might like the second season. However it would be advisable not to read the manga first or you'd get very disappointed with how this anime turned out to be",

However, because of the fact that TRC is aired during the children's hour in Japan, which limits exactly the kind of content they are allowed to put into this anime, and as a result, have disappointed many viewers thinking they would be witnessing a story that was close to what was written in the manga by CLAMP. However, despite all ofthat, Tsubasa Chronicle still shapes up to be a relatively enjoying series, if you can get through a couple of the more slower arcs and horrendous fillers.  The second season is full of more of the same as with the first season, but with more fillers in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, is pretty much the same as it was with the first season.  CLAMP does an excellent job in that department.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kaijura has once again put together a very beautiful soundtrack to go along with the second season.  He has presented us with more emotional and beautiful scores to go along with the anime and you will find yourself humming a lot of the tunes.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season is pretty much a slow continuation from the first season.  However, I feel it goes even slower than the first and you just feel like your being cheated out of the potential of a very good anime.  However, because it is shown during the children's hour, that may be a plausible reason that the potential is not being reached.  Again, if you have the patience to put up with slow progress and fillers, the relationship between Sakura and Syaoran is what makes this anime worth it.",

            "content": "Choose the title you find more appropriate: Tsubasa Filler Chronicles or Tsubasa Disappointing Chronicles, because either way, I wouldn't exactly call this an actual \"season two\".\r\nSTORY: CLAMP's ever so popular (And probably my favorite CLAMP title) massive cross over manga series, Tsubasa, continues on it's second anime season.\r\nWith it's likable main cast: the determined Syaoran, the kind and sweet Sakura, gruff swordsman Kurogane, the goofy but mysterious Fai, and of course the mascot, Mokona all in toll, most fans are expecting another enjoyable (and hopefully with a faster paced story) world(s) traveling adventure as they continue to collect feathers in order to return Sakura's lostmemories.\\n\\n\r\nAnd from what I can tell, that's exactly what the producers were hoping for, that the fans love the characters just enough to watch this season, so they can get away with very pointless episodes, and with little actual story material only follow about three story arcs from the manga that barely cover half of the animes episode span, and the rest of it becoming boring filler episodes (With nine straight filler episodes until its end).\\n\r\nIt's not that these episodes are the most absolutely terrible things in the world, it's just that the writers, unfortunately, seem to have taken advantage of the traveling to different worlds concept for the sake of being a cash in, with no effort on expanding the story.\\n\r\nAnd what's the worse side-effect of a mostly filler season? Little to almost no character development at all.\\n\r\nThe cast are simply boring husks of themselves, they don't develop, they don't do anything different, they just stay the same.\\n\\n\r\nGoing further into laziness, this anime constantly rehashes all of it's side characters from various other series created by CLAMP, which is another concept that got taken advantage of from the manga, that even fans of other CLAMP titles will tire of these recurring characters. Which was something manga was charming and famous for.\\n\r\nAnother noticeable fact is the series main antagonist does little to nothing at all in the story (Less than what what he did in the manga I mean) except a few chats with his female subordinate or a few speeches.\\n\r\nAnd in the end, hardly any progress is made in the story, that ended up becoming just a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nART: Constant low budget animation, that sometimes have obvious quality issues, and Tsubasa deserved better than this, even flipping through pages of the manga looked better than half of the anime, which only adds to the disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: But unlike the animation, it appears that they had put effort with a bigger budget for the background music, though there are some techno background music that sounds totally out of place, and the theme music is nothing special compared to season one's.\\n\r\nThe english dub in the first season suffered a lot from the voice actors having to get used to their roles in a slow start up feel, but thankfully in season two it's not the main problem anymore. \\n\r\nThe english cast itself is quite an impressive line up with big name voice actors Vic Mignogna, Chris Sabat, Monica Rial, and Jason Liebrecht voicing the main cast. \\n\r\nEspecially Chris Sabat who is well suited for Kurogane and Monica Rial was an excellent choice for Sakura.\\n\r\nBut even with the improvements to the english dub, it is still underwhelming. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ The Tsubasa crew enters in its \"second season.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Almost no character development at all.\\n\r\n- Very boring filler episodes make up the majority of the season, taking advantage of several concepts the manga has in order to make these episodes.\\n\r\n- Bland theme music and a sub par english dub.\\n\r\n- Disappointing animation.\\n\\n\r\nI feel that by the end of the season many fans will feel that they wasted their time, but not completely hate it, just feel very disappointed that very little of manga's story made it's way to the anime's \"second season\".",

Do not let it matter what pressures others put on you! Continue to wish for that which your heart truly desires!!\u201d\r\nRecently I watched Season 1 of Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicals (will be shortened to Tsubasa for the sake of the review) and I enjoyed it a lot actually. If you had read my review on Season 1, you might remember that I had very few problems with the series, mainly on the story, but either way I likedit enough to watch Season 2. Let me say that I found Season 2 to be more enjoyable for quite a few reasons actually, one being that there was more action in this season than in the previous, another being more of a plot starting to unfold (eventually leading up to Tokyo Revelations if my sources are correct), and more back stories to our heroes. So, without further ado, let's get this review started, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nTsubasa is an anime about a princess who looses her memories, and the journey of her and 3 heroes as they set on a journey through other dimensions to find those lost memories that have taken the form of powerful feathers that can grant the holder tremendous powers, often leading to trouble. As our heroes explore these worlds, they usually end up helping the citizens of that dimension with problems involving evil emperors, demons, or other things similar to that. That was the basic plot of season 1, and season 2 is very similar to that. Basically, it's a continuation of their journey for her feathers. As I said before, the plot had started to unfold the further the anime progresses. Mysterious characters start to come into play, character's back stories are told, and it all starts to piece together little by little. Other than those few additions to the story, it is very similar to the first season, but like the first season, the second season fails to end the series on a satisfying note, which is why they ended up making 7 more episodes to conclude the series. Overall, I personally found the story better in this season.\\n\\n\r\nBee Train was the company who animated Tsubasa, same company who animated Phantom ~Requiem for the Phantom~, Murder Princess, and the .//hack series. I enjoyed the animation as much as I had the first season, so I was satisfied when I realized not much had changed in the art department.\\n\\n\r\nI've watched the English Dub, due to the fact I received both Season 1 and 2 as gifts from a family member. From what I watched, I liked the voice acting in season 2 better. My main problem with the English Dub in season 1 was Monica Rial's singing. While I do love her acting career, I hated hated HATED it when she sang. It was off pitch and frankly... annoying. However, there was no singing coming from her in this season, so that upped my opinion about the dubbed cast for this series. I still love Vic Mignogna as Fai, and Kurogane and Syaoran started becoming more likable the more they talked.\\n\\n\r\nNot much should change from my last review in terms of the characters. For starters, we have Syaoran. He's the male protagonist of the series. He's calm, he's smart, and he has rad kicking abilities, so rad that he might even give Sanji (One Piece) a run for his money. He is also slightly skilled with a sword, thanks to Kurogane. Kurogane (Kuro-Poo, Kuro Kuro, Kuropon, Daddy, nicknames are endless) is the big, buff, rough and tough character that no one should mess with if they don't want their butt kicked. He is scary at times, but he's an overall nice and funny guy. Next is Fai, my personal favorite. He's apparently a mage, but you'd never be able to tell that he is cause he never seems to use his magic. Quite frankly, I don't even know what he does to help anymore... but he's still epic. Sakura is the female protagonist of the series. She's gotten easier to handle the more memories she gets, but until the finally confesses to Syaoran (if she even confesses), I'll be thinking of her as a character that can't really seem to do anything. And last, the most annoying character in the entire series... Mokona. Like most animes, there is always that little animal sidekick that usually ends up annoying the heck out of me. She/He is standable this season, but just barely. Overall, a slight improvement on the characters this season.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot. I will eagerly await the Tokyo Revelations/Spring Thunder Chronicals in the mail as it ships all the way from wherever Amazon is keeping it... but until then, I recommend that you watch this. It is also recommended that you watch season 1 before this due to the fact that some characters will be returning from season 1 in season 2, but if you don't mind, you can watch this if you so desire. But overall, I liked Tsubasa a lot.",

            "content": "The first season of Tsubasa Chronicle was riddled with problems that bogged down an otherwise great show concept. Having an expanded universe of in-house creations across different worlds/dimensions is an exciting idea. Sadly, when coupled with mediocre animation, flat voice acting, and worst of all, one-off stories that don't go anywhere, it's hard to still justify that concept. The 2nd season promises more exciting and dangerous adventures and to possibly repair the mistakes of the past. But does it actually deliver on its promise? Personally, I have to disagree.\r\nWith the last major arc of the 1st season, we are left with a few unresolved questions.Who is the mysterious clone of Syaroan kept by Fei Wong? Will Syaroan's rival Seishiro come back to impede his progress? How many more memory feathers are there? What about the pasts and significance of Fai and Kurogane? There's a lot for this show to explain and cover in 26 episodes and yet it seems that the series seems more content dragging its feet than to hold its viewer's attention. More \"feather of the week\" episodes are abound in this season, many of them never relating back to the main questions at hand. The first 3 episodes are dedicated to a race with a feather as the prize. During the preliminaries, it is discovered someone is meddling with the race and causing the \"dragonfly\" cars to explode! Fast-paced action plus a dash of psychological insight would have made this a stellar beginning to the season. Instead, it's a slow watch as the race plays out predictably up until a nonsensical twist. You could say the same for many of the arcs in this season - they have an interesting premise, play out slow and predictably, then throw a random twist in there that's more confusing than entertaining. Considering the series has been quite straightforward thus far, I doubt it's anything that you need to think about - it's more or less a way so the story can start moving to the next world.\\n\\n\r\nWhat could be considered the most disappointing is that a rather large chunk of the season is filler! The first 17 episodes are more or less canon, while the last 9 are all originals. Are the original episodes at least a worthwhile watch? Normally I'd say no, but considering the material I've seen up until these episodes, I'd say stick with it if you like what you see. Most of the originals are bland like the one where Kero from Cardcaptor Sakura and Mokona meet, but some of them have some fairly interesting ideas. The one where they return to Koryo to meet Chu'nyan and enter a demon parallel world is decent for extended world building and the last arc in Tao Country with the ruler Chaos had a lot of good ideas. But I've said this before - this show is great with ideas but it doesn't know how to properly execute them. With a better studio or writing staff at the helm, it would've made for a great OVA. Instead, its underdeveloped and is more content being padding for a season than it is showing off the team's creative talents.\\n\\n\r\nAs curious as some of these originals are, it begs the question - why not adapt the manga portion for the last 9 episodes instead of coming up with originals?  There's a rather intriguing answer behind this. According to a comment made by a fan of the series, the show originally aired on a channel that was more educational and made for kids. A major arc in the series, the Tokyo arc, shows a lot of violence and gore(!) - rather than adapt this, they instead filled up the rest of the requested episodes with their own. There are many conclusions you can walk away with from this story - the studio weren't fully aware of the restrictions and they did it out of necessity, they wanted a kiddie series like Cardcaptor Sakura and instead they got something much more dark, etc. Whatever the case, everyone loses with the end result and the Tokyo arc could've showed off the strong potential the series has.\\n\\n\r\nSo does this season at least do anything better than the previous one? Gladly, it does! The biggest takeaway from this is Kurogane's backstory, in which we see a tale of a young swordsman hone his craft in a royal family only for tragedy to strike and scar him permanently. It's not as impactful as a solid \"wandering ronin\" tale, but it's a shining moment that the series desperately needed. Though Fai doesn't get any real backstory (again), an early one-off episode gives a small peak as to what it may be. Even without all the finer details, it still is a rather sweet story that shows off Fai's boyish charm. Though we don't get all the pieces to the puzzle, there's enough to help shape a better image of Syaroan and Sakura's partners.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is still the same for the series, bland and second rate. It needs help from Bee Train's parent company, Production I.G., badly. Compare this to the flashiness the Birdcage movie had - it's a real disappointment. As a general rule of thumb, if your show is action oriented, shortcuts only hurt it overall. This wouldn't be as bad if the series were a slice of life but the cutaways during a critical scene and off-models really damage the appearance of the show. I will say that there seems to be more variety in the music, with a few more original songs. I take back what I said about the first season music-wise - the soundtrack to this anime is very good and helps save a few scenes with Yuki Kajiura's wonderful songwriting. The voice acting also seems a bit more lively this time - it's not perfect but it evokes more emotion than the stale delivery that haunted the first season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Tsubasa Chronicle 2nd Season a 4/10. Some series get better if you allow them the chance to shine. Other series are almost mandatory to watch in full - to quote a friend, \"you need to see the ending to understand the beginning\". Tsubasa Chronicle, at least from the anime adaptation, is neither of those. It is a series that comes close to achieving strength but poor circumstances deny it from being a series that's worth any investment. I can not recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nDo you like or dislike this anime? If you haven't watched it, are you encouraged to watch it or not? Leave a comment on my profile telling me what you think of the anime and/or my review.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading and have a blessed day!",

            "content": "When I first reviewed Tsubasa Chronicle's first season, I was curious as to where all the negative reviews came from. The anime seemed like a faithful enough adaptation at first glance. Aside from its mediocre animation quality and the two filler episodes, I just couldn't see why it received such a enormous backlash.\r\nThen 2nd Season happened.\r\nLet's just sum up everything wrong about Tsubasa Chronicle 2nd Season:\r\n1) The chronology of the manga content is even more jumbled up than before.\r\n2) The censorship being more prevalent and obvious.\r\n3) Lapses in logic (AKA plot-holes) and otherwise alterations of Tsubasa's lore.\r\n4) Half of the season is filler.\r\n5) More thanhalf of the fillers are boring or pointless.\\n\r\n6) No manga content were adapted after Recort arc. Anime's story ended with an ambiguous ending that suggested that the characters' journey continues with no end in sight.\\n\\n\r\nSome time during production, I'd assume, Bee Train was forced into a rushed production by NHK. They also had to cut out the Tokyo story arc and beyond because of their mature content in order to pander to a younger audience. But even with that consideration, I have no idea why they switched the order of the story around. Not only does it spoil certain story content ahead of time, it also causes certain plot-holes to appear. These plot-holes were aggravated by the fillers replacing certain manga story arcs, including the Idol arc, and this probably made adapting the rest of the manga even more difficult for the studio when certain plotline didn't make sense due to these alterations.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be one thing if all the fillers were as amazing as the first handful of them in 2nd season. I was actually rather impressed by the first three filler episodes of the season. The first one corrected the plot-hole the previous season created, which is that the dead could never be brought back to life, no matter how much power you have. Not only did it correct that lore, it also included a cruel irony involving Sakura causing a tragedy she could've only prevented with a specific memory she retrieved at the end of that episode. That's rather brilliant writing for a filler. The other two episodes showed the main characters' interactions with others who looked like people they knew. This resulted in some decent interaction as we get to see more of how the characters felt towards those people, even if they are not the same person.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the rest of the fillers were nowhere as interesting or insightful, as they are either pure fanservice material (Kero of CCS makes an appearance), or just boring story arcs that shovel the story along, resulting in no interesting lessons, message, or character development of significance. And there truly isn't much character development indeed because they strayed away from the Tokyo arc, a story arc that involved major plot-development and significant changes to the main characters. As a result, most of the main characters lost their opportunity to grow beyond their boring and cliched archetypes, especially the Mary Sue Sakura that could do no wrong. There's a reason why this band of heroes seemed like your typical shounen heroes - it's so that CLAMP could deconstruct these archetypes in the Tokyo arc. Unfortunately, because the anime didn't get to do that, we are left with the cliches and none of the deconstruction. Sakura, especially, was left behind as the dull and annoying Mary Sue who could do no wrong, when in the manga, she became more battle-hardened and independent. Kurogane also never got to learn the meaning of true strength because the Celes arc never happened in this anime, so he ended up as a typical grumpy antihero we've seen a million times. We never got to learn why Fai chose not to use magic, or why he seemed to have a death-wish in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nI also really don't like how Sakura's feathers came with memories that were conveniently related to the theme of each episode. Very contrived and lazy writing. The final filler arc in the season also contains some of the worst fillers of all the episodes, not just because it's boring, but because it's riddled with the most amount of plot-holes and bad writing. For one thing, many of Sakura's feathers had conveniently fell into the country of Tao without any explanation at all; for another, Fai's curse was not triggered when a certain being of enormous magical capacity had appeared, thus breaking a major rule about Fai that surfaced in the Infinity arc (of the manga). And don't get me started on that stupid ending where the journey goes on forever and ever. What is this? Pokemon?!\\n\\n\r\nThere are just so many changes to the storyline that Tsubasa is ultimately butchered and bears little to no resemblance with the manga version of the story after Recort. CLAMP is partly responsible for springing such a game-changing deconstruction in the Tokyo arc, I guess, but I wonder why they didn't bother to hash out these developments properly behind the scenes before allowing Bee Train to adapt the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, drop the anime after the Recort arc, and don't bother with the fillers except the first three. Stick with the manga after that. I only bothered to finish this series just so I could review it properly, but I was so glad when it was finally over.",

            "content": "Well, sequels are always exciting and expected to be even better that the previous season. And this sequel is way even better than the season one.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026.\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nThe very adventurous journey of the group continues in this sequel when new worlds are a lot more exciting with actions, laughter, romance and heart-warming drama of the main characters as well as for the characters they meet. Even previous worlds are further explored. But of course, the most anticipating and exciting part for the sequel are the revelations. Questions are slightly answered, truths slightly unfold, and the main plot is slightly hinted. Thelines are more inspiring. The romance part is also further explored.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nIn this season, because they\u2019ve been journeying for so long, the main characters\u2019 bond is even stronger when they gradually open up about their pasts. They appreciate, understand, and trust one another even more. They even influences and give advises with each other. Even Fai, who\u2019s the hardest one to understand because of his poker face, gradually let others in. He sometimes uses his abilities to help others when he himself said that he vowed not to do so. In the previous season, Sakura was very frail, weak, and quiet because the memories that have been returned to her were still very few. But in this season, she is a lot more cheerful and strong-willed. And even without her memories of Syaoran, somehow she still feels the same way for him. On the other hand, Syaoran admits that he does not only stay beside Sakura because of the feathers but he himself wants to. Even when their pasts are slightly hinted, most of them still have a very mysterious aura about them but among them Syaoran is the most mysterious. When the plot is gradually unfolding, his identity is becoming more and more confusing and because of that, every revelation is just so exciting and anticipating. But of course, the most fun part is still the gathering of other characters from previous worlds and another anime. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION and SOUND\\n\r\nThe animation is also even better with breath-taking landscapes of every new world. Well, CLAMP has one of the best illustrations and artworks in the history of manga and anime world. Again, with the sounds. The sounds are just ridiculously amazing. It does not only give the final touch to the series but it is one of the biggest factors why this series is such a hit. It\u2019s unique and very much original but most amazingly, it is magical, beautiful, and just so brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nWith that all said, I guess my only slight disappointment would be that the plot is just slightly revealed. And when I say slightly I mean very much slightly. I\u2019ve read the manga form already and so I am anticipating for the adaptation of it in anime form. As much as I love mangas, I am a very visual person so I just love to see the story in anime form. And if you think that the revelations in this season are plenty already then you are horribly wrong. I would say it is just around 20-30% of the real thing. Well, setting aside that, this is definitely one of the most amazing series ever in the history of manga and anime world. \\n",

            "content": "Animation: No complaints\r\nSounds: No complaints\r\nPlot: Lots of complaints. The first half of this season builds a number of interesting scenarios with some rather deep messages- death is permanent, coping with your past, what it means to love someone vs what it means to love your idea of someone- these ideas disappear in the second portion of this season and are replaced with numerous cheesy platitudes and reused worlds. There is also a guy in a tank of water who bears a striking resemblance to the main character, but nothing about him is ever explained. The villain with muttonchops and a monocle seems important but ispassed over and replaced with a person who is- apparently- a sentient version of Sakura's feathers, it is never explained why these particular memories are able to achieve sentience, or why they are all together for that matter.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Lots of complaints, I'll just list them by character.\\n\\n\r\nSyaoran- Generic hero, his childhood friend and possible love interest is in danger and he needs to help her. Nothing ever comes of a rather intense scene wherein Syaoran seems to forget who he is for a moment and utterly destroys a guardian in the lands of Rekord. \\n\\n\r\nKurogane: Generic  monsters-destroyed-my-village fighter.\\n\\n\r\nSakura: Cardboard cut out love interest and plot device. She demonstrated the possibility of being interesting, then Mokona's spell backfired.\\n\\n\r\nFai- On the verge of becoming interesting. Like Syaoran, there are numerous hints up to the land of Rekord that imply something not quiet right about our little Wizard friend. It's a good thing Mokona's teleporting spell backfired, or else you may have had to develop a less than Black-and-white character with (GASP) complexities that stem beyond happy-go-lucky Fai. Why, in the first season, does Fai give us the impression his own life isn't worth all that much to him? Why, in this season, does Fai go out of his way to help that girl from Chobits? Why is that tattoo so important to him? Who is King Ashura? Who is Yuui?(Oh wait, the name Yuui isn't even mentioned because that takes us to close to a character being three dimensional and not all-good or all-bad.)\\n\\n\r\nYuuko- I've been building a bit of a theme here, up until Mokona's teleportation spell backfires in the Land of Rekord a number of characters seem to be on the verge of becoming interesting. Yuuko's personality before Rekord is a complete 180 from her personality after Rekord. In the final arc of the show Yuuko spits out this \u201cBe good so good things happen to you!\u201d line that her character lacks both the moral authority and stupidity to blurt out. What happened to the character who demands equal compensation for all services rendered and why would someone with a philosophy like that spout such idiotic none sense? What happened to the character who attempted to work around the fate she was provided without breaking the codes she adhered to? I really don't even know what to say, I'm pretty sure I suffered a concussion from the amount of times my head hit my desk when that line came up on my subtitles.\\n\\n\r\nThis series wasn't just bad in the way some series are bad: It was bad because it was so disappointing.",

            "content": "Fans of the first season- this is nothing more than fun. The second season of Tsubasa proved to be pretty dull in most aspects. Expecting plot development? The same awesome music from the first season? Motion? Well, you're in for a big surprise- Tsubasa, the second season, has little to none.\r\nFirst of all, let's begin with the easy stuff to point out. The art itself is something I've always enjoyed, but the stiffness in the first season was a little uncomfortable. Things don't move very often, and looping is almost overused. I was hoping I could see some improvement for the second season, but Iwas disappointed once again. Things get stiffer. Pauses are almost unbearable and half of the motion in the characters and such is strictly looping. Visually, Tsubasa was a boring piece of work. \\n\\n\r\nThank heavens for the sound, which swoops in and saves the day (sometimes). Though from time to time, you hear the old familiar songs we know and love from the past (or even maybe a rendition or two) play during scenes, the popularly used songs of season two are a little aggravating in my mind. The new hit fighting song became a techno-pop-like sound, that I can't really place, and I wish I could give it a better genre. What I do know is that the way it drags on and keeps repeating reminds me of a mediocre video game. Other popular songs include vocal tracks. This is not only a little distracting from the dialogue, but the vocals don't always have the best English, so your ears are competing with an accent and the occasional Engrish. Maybe this was difficult enough that I missed plot development.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is our next topic! So I thought the episodes were fun. To be honest, I felt they had more variety and more substance than in the first season (even with places of old showing up). Things were kept creative, and it was fun to watch the journey progress now that everyone is so close to one another. There's no denying it's definitely more fun than season one, at least for the proper Tsubasa fan. But for all viewers, I'm afraid to say the story moves forward only an inch or two. Don't expect anything to really happen. They vaguely mention a twist here or a twist there, but why? And when will it ever show up again? Only the nonexistent Tsubasa season 3 could tell, but, well... \\n\\n\r\nMost of this season I would label a disappointment. At least, if I'm paying attention to what's really going on. For some mindless Tsubasa-loving entertainment, go ahead and try it out. Fans, it's fun! Only fun, and probably not worthy of buying. But go ahead and rent it if season one wasn't enough Tsubasa for you. Just know, you've been warned.\\n\\n\r\n-shoujokiss7",

After reaching its downfall and it's poor progression of the story, it eventually became decent enough for me to accept that fact and just enjoy the series.\r\nI gave their sound -1 (9/10). The OP and ED isn't near to the goodness of season one. The first season's OP and ED were very irresistible.

The only thing thattells me to keep it great is because of its awesome insert songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe character progression, even at its slow pacing, really improved... AT LAST!

It is very recommended you buy the OVA with this season. The OVA continues and leaves the show with a more complete ending.\r\nThis a tie-in show for most of studio Clamp\u2019s works.  Most of show\u2019s characters are either directly referenced or remade.  Watching all the other shows isn\u2019t necessary but adds to the backgrounds a bit.  xxxHolic season 1 before Tsubasa would be a plus though. \r\nAnyhow, it\u2019s a good adventure story.This part has Sakura more involved since she is closer to being complete again.

Since I've already read the manga, but a while ago so im unsure what's really in the manga and what is a filler, I'm fine with just enjoying the ride thus its a 7 in enjoyment. \r\n But(!) if you're watching this season in the hopes of getting answers you're in for disappointment. It doesn't really tell you anythingof relevance to the main story, that's why I give that part a 5. If you actually want to get on with the series as a story my tip is to watch the OVA \"Tokyo revelations\". You'll see what I mean.",

            "content": "When I watched the first episode I thought this should be a great anime, unfortunately it's pretty much all filler which really takes it's toll in the second season. With little amounts of plot thrown in it makes it quite a chore to keep watching.\r\nThe same characters they meet was a novelty at first but seeing them meet the same characters in different settings with different memories which felt like the fiftieth time started to feel very old and very predictable. It then included the characters helping them in some way again and it began to felt like groundhog day. Though I must admit whenthey're in the cartoon world the filler was appreciated and was a nice change of pace. When I reached episode 45 I started thinking they're not going to have much time to develop the story and it will become rushed which would be a shame because the small bits of plot that were given was good, by episode 50 I realized they're not going to include any answers at all and it was going to be in 5 episodes of OVA's.. Which I would imagine will feel rushed unless they're all forty minutes long.\\n\\n\r\nWith CLAMP you find that the art is intricate and beautiful with each character having a distinct face and the clothing being well thought out and detailed. Though the characters look to be eating Green Giant sweetcorn without hitting the gym to bulk up and rocking the praying mantis look.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in the anime is fantastic and sounds epic which I felt suited the first episode and unfortunately very little else, this was due to it being over used in situations that didn't really need it, such as when they arrive in a new land and they see two men in masks fighting with wooden swords, which felt like the anime didn't know how to differentiate between action scenes and leisurely strolls.\\n\\n\r\nTsubasa Chronicle is an anime not without good points, the characters are well developed as you would expect of 52 episodes of filler, and you feel connected to the characters and their struggles, though you start to feel cheated when you learn a little of the main plot only to be dragged straight back to meeting the punk gang again. Fai and Kurogane provide the entertainment and one liners, while Sakura and Syaoran sit quiet and say please and thank you and remind you that they're still there and without the story backing it up you wonder why any of them are travelling at all.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy the anime though it was mainly because of Kurogane and Fai, with their voice actors being Piccolo of Dragon Ball and Tamaki Suoh of Ouran Highschool Host Club and pretty much being the same characters it felt like a cross over with them exchanging one liners and insults to one an other.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would say if you're not a fan of filler I wouldn't recommend you to watch it, read it on Wikipedia instead in half the time and you will get all of what happened in the 52 episodes. I am going to continue to watch the OVA's so it's not bad enough to rage quit but certainly is a struggle, with the humor and the beautiful worlds they travel to it makes it enjoyable and it does start to feel like an epic journey and you will want to know how it all ends for their worlds and the characters.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Okay Tsubasa Chronicles Season 2, basically it's better than season 1, maybe beetrain realize that they fvcked up the characters so they need to improve it a little bit and because TC is popular to kids, for the best, i'm trying to set aside my favoritism to this anime\r\nNote : there are some spoilers, please note about it\r\nstory : lots of filler, i'm disappointed a little, Episode 11 is the best stand alone comedy episode for me, and i hate the episode where they need to chase the goddamn truck, seriously? By chasing the truck? It last for many minutes? (I don't know if thatarc last for 2-3 episodes or what) But overall it's nice so i give the story 6\\n\\n\r\nArt : CLAMP's art style, yes, i love clamp's art style, the eyes are unique in their way, especially how they colored the texture of fai's eye. but Beetrain made another failure, but this time the art is better than the first, i love how they made a little effort, but still fuck you beetrain :v so i'll give the art 7\\n\\n\r\nSound : Kajiura Yuki once again made a very nice musical score, better than the first one, i rated it 8 because the ending song doesn't attract me a lot, the Opening? I love it, This is better than the OP of the first\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : going to listed it \\n\\n\r\nSakura : (7/10) at the first season, we see her very fragile, but at this season, she is very cheerful, but sometimes useless (sorry SyaoSakura fans)\\n\\n\r\nSyaoran : (7/10) i rate him 7 because he developed a little but still become mysterious, a lots of question enter in my mind, including the mystery behind his eye\\n\\n\r\nKurogane : (8/10) now i understand why he fight, \"a man who is fighting because the monster just ruined his village\" warrior\\n\\n\r\nFai : (8/10) he become more mysterious at the season 2, a lots of question just entered at my mind while observing him (this is not a fan talk, because i'm his fan for a long time) the top question is \"Why his aura suddenly goes mysterious? Is it about his mask? Or something bothers him? Why he help chi? Is there any relation about king Ashura to him?\" But still he's one of the great CLAMP characters ever made\\n\\n\r\nMokona : (6/10) sometimes Mokona is useless, but she is still helpful, well the episode 11 is the best stand alone episode because of her and her minds\\n\\n\r\nYuuko : (5/10) i'm still thinking something about her since that time i haven't read the XXXHolic but now it makes sense to me. The thing that bothers me about her is \"does she have any conscience in what she take from them?\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall i give the characters 7\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : (6/10h i give it 6 even thou i enjoy it because some other episodes here are just nonsense, example of it is the Truck chasing episode, even thou they need to get the feather at the truck, the complain here is why it last for minutes?, also there's an episode where they back again to one of the worlds where they went, oh come on! **facepalm** then the ending wasn't animated\\n\\n\r\nOverall : i rate it 7, TC is an anime that sometimes will disappoint you but you'll find it enjoyful, if you fond of the beautiful music that is definitely a masterpiece, you'll find it enjoyful",
