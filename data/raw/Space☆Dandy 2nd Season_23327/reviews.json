Odds are that you do, if you are on this site and reading this review.\r\nFrom the producer who brought you Cowboy Bebop, and Samurai Champloo, comes SPACE DANDY (season 2 in this case), and Space Dandy is a platform that  both celebrates and lampoons anime topes from every genre, using the vehicle  of a group of alien-hunter/discoverers in space.\r\nLiterally everything from the double-intro to the theme song, to the narrated intro, to the antagonists (Dr. Geb and his questionably effective planning/execution), to the episodic nature of the Dandy universe makes this asuperlative enjoyment for anyone who enjoys anime and doesn't take it too seriously. If you can laugh at yourself and delight in the subversion of expectation, Space Dandy is for you. \\n\\n\r\nThe most recent episode aired last night and lampooned not only high-school based anime, but the High School Musical craze as well as a few other common thematic elements from high school anime that I won't go in to so as to avoid spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nBut seriously, if the idea of following around Space Dandy, and his brave space crew...in space! makes you happy or seems interesting, you owe it to yourself and your eyeballs to check it out",

            "content": "If there\u2019s a show that can make you go \u201cWHAT?\u201d Space Dandy would be one of the first to come to mind. The \u2018what\u2019 doesn\u2019t associate with a kind of reaction that\u2019s negative though. Rather, I see Space Dandy a show of creative anthology. Each episode takes the characters on a wild ride in space with Dandy doing his usual gags. While the show often goes wacky with its direction, it\u2019s safe to say that the real point of the Space Dandy focuses on much more. Space Dandy Season 2 returns with Dandy and his adventurous crew in this sequel. And seriously, this show cravesfor attention when it comes to imaginative endeavors. \\n\\n\r\nDirected by the brainchild of Cowboy Bebop, Shinichiro Watanabe once again proves his worth. Breaking down the boundary of the adventure theme, he takes this sequel to new heights with his creativity. It quickly makes its point with the first episode by adapting various references and explodes them onto the screen. The comedic nature of the show quickly takes command but also fits in various satires and gags to illustrate creativity. As daring as the first season, it\u2019s not afraid to pull off risks. The risk here is that episodes can come with a mixed bag. But really, Space Dandy was never a show about overly complex plot angles or some dynamic narrative. Rather, it keeps the space adventure zipping along that is mastered with uniqueness.\\n\\n\r\nStuffed with craziness, the show plays around with itself like it\u2019s in a class of its own. Make no mistake though, Dandy plays more than just the role of a professor as he takes on the good adventure with his crew members. Essentially, the show was about hunting down aliens as Dandy dedicates it as his job. However, many episodes explores more than just that clich\u00e9. Comedy first, and space adventure second is probably the better way to say it in this case. Space Dandy has been defined as a show that is free to do whatever it wants. There\u2019s no boundary that confines itself or limit its ideas. Most of the episodes takes in space but also seizes opportunities to expand its settings. These include but not limited to high school, a mystical lake, and even a world where there\u2019s no sadness. (literally, as that title implies). Regardless, the main objective that Space Dandy achieves is not an adventure of classic fun but rather inspiration, the way it presents its stylish blockbuster hit from where season 1 already built upon.\\n\\n\r\nA majority of the attention is focused on the main characters. In fact, the main characters has this connection with both each other and I dare say\u2026the audience. Dandy has this personality that is like a chemistry set for a scientist. Once they get their hands on it, they can\u2019t stop. Their curiosity takes them like the way Dandy takes his adventures to wonders of the universe. This sense of nature can even label him as a hero as Dandy has prevented tragedies and even entire galactic wars in one of the episodes in this season. On the other hand, Dandy\u2019s two sidekicks QT and Meow play some major roles as well in the sequel. Unlike most series that tries to succeed with \u2018beating the Big Bad to save the world\u2019, Space Dandy is more about achieving some goal. It focuses on what the premise of each episode and twists in a ways beyond incalculable imaginations. Some of them will make your mind go \u201cWHAT?\u201d while other times will bring a smile of appreciation. It shouldn\u2019t be any surprising though. The sequel doesn\u2019t derive far from the style of season 1. Each episode is carefully crafted with its main and supporting characters to fit with its creative context. The catch is also that the show isn\u2019t exactly like a \u2018monster of the week\u2019 program. Instead, it seeks ambition and articulate concepts beyond just the space tropes. However, it can sometimes be frustrating to realize that most characters seize to appear in the future and only opt to play their roles in that specifically dedicated episode.\\n\\n\r\nTo take for granted, various themes play along the show as if it\u2019s self-aware. Destiny is one such theme as Dandy often seemingly gets himself involved with circumstances beyond his control. They say fate and destiny is something people can\u2019t defy. In Space Dandy though, that\u2019s a different story as Dandy often tries to tempt fate. His various battles such as against aliens, monstrous fishes, and armed forces often puts Dandy\u2019s own life in jeopardy. Yet, somehow Dandy pulls off a spectacular show when it\u2019s put up or shut up time. It\u2019s not clearly defined as deus ex machina because like I mentioned before, the show is seemingly self-aware about what Dandy is capable of. The sequel takes even more daring risks with imaginative worlds. One such episode really takes the cake with Dandy being in a world where sadness and death itself is extinct. The avant-garde nature combined with its unique humor of each episode brings forward talent on the tables as well. Each episode has a different screen writer including Watanabe himself. I give praise to Kiyotaka Oshiyama and Masaaki Yuasa for their stylish and clever writing. More so, Watanabe shows his skills in coordination by deconstructing the essence of an adventure. The sequel takes its adventure far beyond just space and into scenarios that not even the Twilight Zone can see with its eyes.\\n\\n\r\nProduction quality generally remains the same with Bones in charge of the operation. Character designs are still like the previous season with not much difference. There are some particular episodes that Dandy has slight differences to reflect the nature of itself. Otherwise, character designs still reflect the sci-fi trope such as the aliens, space vehicles, and fabulous gentlemen of the universe. One thing I find season 2 masterfully done is how artwork sells what it tries to advertise. The preview of each episode only produces an initial impression with the title being a potential trademark. However, the execution can really knock an audience off-guard with its contrasting visuals. Episodes directed by Watanabe and Yuasa are prominent examples for this. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is more of a classic appreciation. The western style OST fused with sci-fi tones is something to take notice of. The soothing music, the elegance of the OST, and colorful edginess clarify what this season is trying to accomplish. Surprisingly enough, I find the dubs comparable to the original Japanese versions. In both instances, Dandy has a voice of an explorer and takes on adventures with enthusiasm. Other characters too have influences whether they are human, robots, or aliens. One particular episode even has references to the voice actor with his own character (DUB version) and a classic battle of the bands theme. The OP and ED songs remain generally the same for the sequel though. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no single word to describe the second season. It can be fun, sexy, entertaining, insightful, influential, creative, thrilling, formulaic, intelligent, sensitive, charming, or just dandy. Some episodes can also be deep with hidden meanings and evoke emotions. Each episode is filled with potential and explores space like an anthology. Yes, the series may not make sense at times and will leave you in the hanging. Yes, the sequel may have never solved a story subplot or context that should have been. However, does it really need to? Remember, the show doesn\u2019t limit itself with its adventures. It stretches beyond the boundary of imagination by indulging on its unorthodox or perhaps even radical style. In the end, you might ask yourself \u201cwhat the hell?\u201d I know I did but doesn\u2019t regret a single minute afterwards. \\n",

            "content": "This is more of the stuff you saw in the first season. The animation is still great, music is still good, but for some reason I enjoyed this season less than the 1st one. \r\nFor some reason the stories in individual episodes, despite looking good graphically in most cases failed to resonate with me and left less impact than, for example, the absolutely amazing \"plant episode\" from the first season of space dandy. I'm not sure why this happened.\r\nIt is still worth watching, mostly because of high quality animation, and because of unusual stories, but expect it to have less impact than the first season.At least the way it worked for me.\\n\\n\r\nDetailed breakdown below:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10.\\n\r\nAs I said, most of the episodes failed to properly resonate with me and I found some of them very dull, desptie amazing artwork. However, now and then there are sparks of amazing, that was present in the original 1st season. There's smaller degree of \"weird alienness\", smaller number of weird worlds and strange stories, but now and then the story does make an interesting point or two, that makes you stop and think.\\n\\n\r\nStill.. I felt like this anime could use a much better scriptwriter. Much better one.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing worth mentioning is that there's a very subtle headscratcher in this series that reminded me of Rick and Morty. It is very easy to miss.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10:\\n\r\nVery high quality fluid animation. However, this time around there were several occurrences where I noticed footage reuse and \"panning shots\" (someone talks in small number of frames and the camera slowly pans acros the scene). This is usually used to reduce animation costs, and I do not recall this happening in the 1st season. However, the anime never goes overboard with it, and still looks good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10:\\n\r\nIT is good/catchy, however, in a few circumstances where music was supposed to take the lead, it failed to deliver. Basically, music is mostly good, but I couldn't call it \"great\". It does its job. Still, it is of higher quality than in many other animes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10:\\n\r\nCharacters lack depth and fails to deliverer in circumstances where story tries to portray them as deep/complex personalities. This is not surprising, because everybody is technically a stereotype/caricature and the show is usually about portraying some weird situation, world or planet, but at the end of the anime, it is not possible to say much about characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 6/10:\\n\r\nI found two episodes dull. The rest was okay. There was a small number of interesting headscratcher in the show, but despite high quality animation by studio bones, I wouldn't call this a masterpiece. Bones developed many other titles that were superior to this one (RahXephon, for example).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10:\\n\r\nThe anime has good animation and is worth because of it. However, I felt like the show desperately needed a better scriptwriter, and failed to deliver its full potential because of it. The artwork is very good, however.\\n\\n\r\nIt is wroth checking out, and is recommended in case you wanted to check out high quality visuals and fluid animation.\\n",

            "content": "Space Dandy is unique, it is a huge bag filled with endless creativity, it is fun, it is trippy, it is superb. Season 1 is good but there are several episodes that are a hit or miss, however, season 2 is awesome, much better than the first.\r\nSTORY: 9/10\r\nStory? What story? Technically, the universe of Space Dandy is so vast that the creators can concoct any story and it will still make perfect sense. Space Dandy is an episodic anime, with the episodes differing A LOT from each other, this is mostly due to the fact that Space Dandy is directed by multiple directors, each bringingtheir own flair and style into the episode they directed, which is why I said this is a huge bag filled with endless creativity, because it is!\\n\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t any continuity between the episodes, as such you are free to watch the episodes separately and still enjoy it as a whole. Dandy and his co may die in one episode, and appear perfectly fine in the next, and this fact, supposedly established in the very first episode of season 1, is actually explained brilliantly towards the end of the series (hence my high score).\\n\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\r\nHands down, Space Dandy is one of the most beautiful animes I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Remember when I mentioned the episodes differ a lot from each other? This applies to the art as well! Each and every single episode are drawn in a different style and this gives us viewers a myriad of eye candies to watch for (that ancient Japanese artstyle in ep 5? Wow). Not to mention the jaw-dropping sceneries found in many parts of the show, my eyes were glued to the screen at all times. \\n\\n\r\nSOUNDS: 10/10\\n\r\nSpace Dandy wouldn\u2019t be the same without the awesome soundtrack behind it. Most of the soundtracks are funk and jazz music (dandy!), of course there are plenty of other genres as well, heck, we even have live rock music (ep 7), high school musical style (ep 4), disco music from the 80s (ep 9) and many more. This season of Space Dandy had really upped the ante especially on this area, so pay attention to it as well when you watch it. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 8/10\\n\r\nSadly, this season has more episodes of Dandy being isolated from QT and Meow, so we don\u2019t see much of them as compared to the first season. Anyhow, Dandy is as cool as ever, and this coolness escalates to a much higher level especially towards the finale. Scarlet and Honey gets more screentime as well and they will be featured much, much more than just at their respective workplaces. Dr Gel and Bea are also featured as recurrent villains, and towards the finale, there\u2019s a big surprise waiting\u2026\\n\\n\r\nWe also have a huge cast of new characters joining in, with my favourites being Johnny and Planet Limbo herself. See for yourself and you will as well, I am sure, love the characters in Space Dandy. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\\n\r\nGranted, due to the episodic nature of Space Dandy, episodes may be a hit or miss, subjective to the viewer him/herself. If you ask me, I fell in love with most of the episodes of this season compared to the last season, and this season has many episodes with very high rewatchability, either to marvel at the greatness of the art, or the gorgeous soundtrack, or the mightily creative story and characters. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\r\nI\u2019d reckon that Space Dandy is viewable for all ages, but is especially appealing to the adults. Space Dandy should become more enjoyable as you age, due to the wide range of pop culture references in it. In conclusion, Space Dandy is a clever anime, and a brilliant work of art. \\n",

            "content": "*Note: This review is about the series in general, not just Season 2*\r\nBoobies and butts are what make the universe a pretty awesome place to exist in. How is this so? Just ask Dandy himself, and he could tell you all about it in glorious enthusiasm. This Dandy I speak of is named Space Dandy. Imagine if you mixed the best of western and eastern humor of TV animation shows and combine them into one nifty package. That should tell you right away that Space Dandy destines to be different and fresh without making an overtly big deal about it. Regardless, you certainly can\u2019t beatthis hot fun garbage series with any other garbage entertainment, anime or otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted, when talking about Space Dandy, that this is not a Shinichiro Watanabe directed anime in its purest sense, the director of such classics as Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Even though he overseas chief direction for the show, this is essentially a conglomerate of different anime directors putting their own directorial spin on the series. That should tell you right there that Space Dandy does not follow any direct narrative from point A to point B. Episodic episodes spliced together to follow Dandy and his band of various misfits, all create a western-style animated series vibe that can be nostalgic for those of us growing up as kids watching these shows day by day. So if you thought this was going to be a Cowboy Bebop-style show, just be thankful that you will be getting the filler episode portions of Bebop.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, that should not entail that Space Dandy is nothing more than a comedic version of Bebop. In actuality, it brings forth a very unique style of its own to formulate charm to its humor and characters. Almost all jokes prevalent in Space Dandy hit all of the notes perfectly with nicely done comedic timing and on top of it, they don\u2019t just make all of the jokes onto one subject matter. Sure, the main focus of Space Dandy\u2019s comedy is purely sexual with its constant pandering over butts and boobs, but once you further yourself into the show, you\u2019ll realize that it is not the case. Many tropes are satirized from what you would typically see in any animated show with male characters like Dandy; always getting what he wants in the end that quickly falls flat over him.\\n\\n\r\nThere are genuine surprises thrown in here and there. For instance, it is probably one of the few anime you will ever see that has its own musical number. Even with its comedy, the writers actually delve into introspective subject matter that actually become insightful and melancholic while still maintaining its humor without exemplifying it unnaturally. Rarely would I ever applaud a show for being able to achieve both of these elements. The reason being is how the jokes are written in very clever fashion by its intricate pacing and punchlines. Never is there a dull moment between the hilarious banter of Dandy and his friends out of the 26 episodes in this series.\\n\\n\r\nDandy himself is quite the protagonist in keeping the show at an evenly paced comedy with his larger than life charisma and presence. Normally with a man who constantly obsesses over booty and tits can be grating over a period of time. What makes Dandy an exception is that they do not really shove the obvious joke down our throats continuously, although in some parts they do, especially in the earlier episodes. He proves himself to be an exceptional lead, but that\u2019s not to say he\u2019s the only one who is able to do that in Space Dandy.\\n\\n\r\nMeow, Dandy\u2019s right hand man after humiliating him in the first episode, isn\u2019t similar to Dandy in terms of personality. In fact, Meow would be the one to set him straight to focus on their missions, even though Dandy himself isn\u2019t a total idiot in most cases. QT, Dandy\u2019s robot sidekick, is the same way in this aspect, where he is always trying to keep things in order over Dandy\u2019s typical behavior. Both of these leads are extremely lovable because of the perfect chemistry between them and Dandy. Even when their relationship seems atypical, goofy trite at first glance, they eventually warm up to being match made in heaven.\\n\\n\r\nWhat good is it to talk about Space Dandy without mentioning its elaborate music? Absolutely zilch. I will speak in no hyperbole whatsoever in stating that Space Dandy has the most infectious Opening I\u2019ve had the pleasure of listening to. The word infectious is meant in the most positive sense possible. Newcomer Kensuke Ushio has really made himself quite a success story in 2014 with this and also composing for Ping Pong The Animation. The opening itself sets the mood for the entire show and lets you know that fun is about to come your way, like any other good opening does to any other show.\\n\\n\r\nOne very important thing to note is the artistic direction and how diverse the animators decided to put into creating this very elaborate, kooky universe. All of the alien creatures are very unique in design that are a mix mash of previously imagined aliens and putting in their own vision. The lavish colors are put with great care so Space Dandy can be easy and pleasing to the eyes. It also helps that the animation is nice and fluid to further the aesthetic to new heights. Also, because there are multiple directors for each episode, some of them even put their own artistic vision into the spectrum. One notable is Masaaki Yuasa, director of The Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong The Animation, who filled in one episode for animation direct in episode 3, who managed to put in a whole different spin for the series in terms of animation.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, there is really nothing like Space Dandy that you often see in anime. In some ways, it\u2019s sort of Japan\u2019s answer to western animated TV shows and saying, \u201cHey, we can make episodic goofy comedies just like the rest of y\u2019all!\u201d Regardless of whether that was their true intention or not, it definitely speaks volumes by analyzing how Space Dandy can work both as a satire or a genuine comedy. Japanese anime purists may watch this with disdain because its not the archetypal anime, even in comedy standards, that we are used to. But if you\u2019re willing to give credit where credit is due for a Japan-produced nostalgia trip of late-\u201990s to early 2000\u2019s animated shows, look no further.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "Its a Space Dandy review, Baby.\r\nIll start this off by saying that this show took a quite unexpected leap forward during its second season. Space Dandy part 2 focused on some pretty deep questions, and our loveable oaf dandy turns about to be quite the philosopher.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nThe one key element that a show needs is unpredictability. Many shows have well thought-out stories with coherent back stories and a good progression. Space Dandy has somehow succeeded in showing the complete opposite of this. The episode to episode chronology is nearly inconsistent (although this is later explained), and this makes every new episode a new adventure. \r\nPartof the reason for Space Dandy's remarkable story was due to the multitude of directors and writers working on the show, each one bringing their own style to the show. The most profound episodes are written by none other than Shinichiro Watanabe. After so many predictable shows with careful a planning, Space Dandy stands out from the crowd.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Space Dandy pays homage to earlier 90s sci-fi shows, such as Cowboy Bebop and Cyber City Oedo: yet throws in a bit of flair with bright colour pallets. Everything from the Aloha Oe to Dandy's pompadour has an aura of rebelliousness  which perfectly fits the theme of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOn inspection of the 2 Dandy OSTs, it is clear that Space Dandy uses a wide range of genres to create the scenes. From jazz reminiscent of Bebop, to acoustic and piano singles that create a melancholic atmosphere: Space Dandy has it all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough many characters stay true to their original personas, their is a great deal of development for the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nQTs romance at the end of season 1; Meow's family episode, Scarlet's inner feelings and Dandy's constant desire to help those in need all show a level of depth I never expected from this show. While Dandy may appear a lustful clueless oaf to the new viewer, we are slowly shown a far more profound side to him: with each episode bringing to light another side to out multi-dimensional hero\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat more is there to say, baby. You would be hard pressed to find anyone who didn't enjoy Space Dandy. The strong following is proof enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall space dandy is a testament to what is possible if writers, directors and animators are given creative freedom. Space Dandy was not designed to sell, nor was it designed to pander to a particular audience. In essence, Space Dandy is proof that you don't need perfect animation, coherent plots or a specific audience to make a great show.\\n\\n\r\nWatch space dandy: you'll be surprised.",

Yes.\r\nI am not going to waste time writing a synopsis, summary or any other time wasting bullshit. I am simply going to tell you why this anime is fabulous.\r\nSpace Dandy is a concoction of episodes directed by many, many different episode directors under, I assume, the watchful eye of one of my personal heroes in the anime industry.\r\nWhat we have in Space Dandy that makes it fabulous is organised chaos. Some rules and cliches have been followed but not many. This makes it an anime that asks thingsof the viewers. It asks us to beat with it. It asks us to be forgiving. It asks us to be understanding. Most of the time though, it just wants us to go with the flow. Because of this some of the episodes are not going to speak to everyone and others are not going to be understood by everyone. But this is always the risk with an anime in this format.\\n\\n\r\nWhat we do have though, is the femme fatale(s), the trusted companions, the anti-heroes (of which the main protagonist is included most of the time), some GAR, time and space travelling, some multidimensional space-time theories, zombies, plants, cyberpunk, western inspired themes, boobs, robots, a rock-band, warring space opera empires and many other things including but not excluded to space travelling fish.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that is very important for the enjoyment of an episodic anime is the character development of side characters. You have to be fast if you want your viewer to get involved and engaged in a character which, more than likely, will not be around again. Space Dandy succeeds in this, which is one of the main reasons why it is good. Scenarios are painted up for us involving characters that's been on screen for 10 minutes and I actually cared about what was going to happen to them. That's a pretty rare feat. when it comes to me.\\n\\n\r\nGood bye.\\n",

            "content": "To start off, I decided to write this review when I saw current reviews with misleading information about the show. This isn't a show that will force you to think deeper, because you don't need to to enjoy it, however, it does extend a hand to those who do wish to find the deeper meaning. One of the things that makes this show so unique, is it's unwillingness to be controlled by the status quo of an anime. Our \"Hero\" is indeed a hero, but not one of traditional nature. He comes across as more of a human and ordinary guy because that's exactly whathe is. In most shows, whether you know it or not, the \"hero\" has extraordinary luck and it allows the plot to progress further because of all the amazing opportunities they are given to show off their skills. Space Dandy, is not bound by such luck and therefor requires a lot more work to develop his character. The more you watch the more you can feel for and relate to Dandy and his issues.\\n\\n\r\nNow to talk about the other characters, QT and Meow. These are the supporting actors that really make this show something else. They aren't overly cliched and overdone characters, though I was worried QT was going to be the overdone calculated and boring robot. However, I was wrong. Each character has their own incredibly unique personality. Meow is probably one of the more relatable characters, he's a dropout and though his family loves him very much, he still doesn't feel content with being nothing whether he knows it or not. QT is Dandy's handy vacuum AI that helps him with a lot more than what he was programmed for and secretly harboring lots of different emotions, and that's one of the things that makes this show so beautiful, ANYBODY could be apart of Space Dandy's crew, because the characters, while having great personality, are mundane and ones that relate more to the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to spoil the show for you, but while every episode seems disconnected, in the end it brings it all together and explains the randomness of the show. At first I had a hard time watching space Dandy because I asked myself \"What's the point? The end result can't make me feel anything more than the first episode did because the plot doesn't really progress.\" Now here I am, writing my first anime review on what I believe to be one of the greatest plotless masterpieces around today.",

            "content": "An outrageously fun, hilarious sci-fi with a lovable crew and their bizarre space adventures. \r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\r\n(This review covers both seasons.)\r\nSpace Dandy was the most fun anime I\u2019ve seen in a long, long time. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been so motivated to marathon a show. I finished the 26 episodes in 3 days. It\u2019s hilarious, always leaving me with a smile. The characters are very charming and loveable. The plots are absurd and over-the-top, but even through the silliness it manages to settle down sometimes to make you feel at peace, even melancholy and lonely.\r\nI\u2019ve said before, but entertainment\u2014no matter what form\u2014whether it\u2019s anime ormovies or books are really just about giving you that emotional experience. Don\u2019t worry about the details. Don\u2019t worry about the logic. If you love it enough just go with it.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the animation is absolutely amazing. It\u2019s so full of life and details it's worth re-watching. This is a show that demands to be seen in true Blu-ray quality. You would be hurting yourself to watch it any other way. You have to see this in full 1080p to experience the incredible imagination. There are bizarre aliens, exotic planets, and beautiful cosmic scenery to witness.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is about a crew of three and their space adventures trying to find and capture rare aliens. These aliens are then registered for a cash reward. Your hero is a care-free slacker who loves women and going to a space Hooters. At his side is an adorable, outdated vacuum cleaning robot that puts up with him. Then there\u2019s a space cat that\u2019s just as lazy.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub and its writing are fantastic. I strongly recommend watching that version. It\u2019s obvious the translation team took liberties to westernize the material, but it\u2019s very well-suited. If I didn\u2019t know this was an anime, I\u2019d swear it was western made because so much of the humor feels western. Even the dialogue feels very modern with slang like \u201csketchy\u201d and references to Twitter.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode is something different because they each have a very strong emotional theme. There\u2019s a lot of variety to the plots. Everything from a zombie episode; a galactic space race; going on a date; meeting parallel dimensions; even something as simple as a road trip. There\u2019s even touches of continuity as the they refer back to older plots and items. When the show takes a break from its wacky adventures to settle down the music really adds a surreal, distant, almost lonely mood. Other times the episodes are just plain weird and abstract.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m reminded of Futurama: another sci-fi show that makes stories and jokes out of scientific concepts. Space Dandy was a blast to watch. It's like no other anime I can think of. Without a doubt it's my favorite of 2014.",

            "content": "(7.5/10)\r\nSo I don't really have much to say about the second season of Space Dandy. It pretty much maintained what I really enjoyed about the first season, as well as the parts that I didn't really enjoy. It's still a very inconsistent show, with three episodes this second seasons that were especially unfun to watch. \r\nAt its worst it's a middling, dull knockoff trying to parody shit that has already been endlessly parodied by other programs. It comes off as cliche and lazy. At it's best it's a genre mixing masterwork of jaw-dropping animation, great short-form storytelling, and engaging characters. \r\nIn season 2 there wasan odd focus on music in a few episodes which really just didn't sound too good. A high-school musical-esq episode that, while it may make sense on paper, really didn't translate on screen. They parodied a lot of those cliches that come with that kind of genre, but didn't really do so in an interesting enough way to get me to be engaged with it. That mixed in with truly mediocre songwriting didn't do the show any favors. \\n\\n\r\nIn this season, though, there was a distinct focus on the endgame, too. Which was surprising. It's a show that can be made infinitely, so it takes a lot of guts (and balls) from Watanabe and Minami for not milking it for all it's worth. It fits better as a 2-core. It looks more appealing as a short-lived, but very fun show. \\n\\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nThe series finale, all spoilers aside, shows a show that knows itself. More importantly, it shows a creator and writer that knows the show. He knows exactly what the show is and what it is aiming to be. Mixing absolutely insane spectacle, touching character moments, and obvious bathos into a very entertaining and undoubtedly awesome conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe shows finale was even hinted at many times in the shows second season, with many fan theories being proven correct, which shows a longer con that the creator was playing. This is also a thumbs up. \\n\\n\r\nIf only the show felt a bit more consistent in its delivery. I think if it weren't for the third music-oriented episode, I would have been comfortable with giving this show a great 8/10, which means it would have earned its spot as one of my favorite anime. That being said, unfortunately, for as awesome as a few key episodes were, especially the ones guest animated and directed, you simply can't forgive the blundering duds that were in the second season as well. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, certain episodes stood out as much as the specific few in season 1 as well. An episodes by the key animator for Kizumonogatari was something special, as well as episodes with big names like Kiyotaka Oshiyama, and the glorious Masaaki Yuasa, create some of the shows most memorable pieces of animation. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the second season solidified Space Dandy as a very memorable space romp with perhaps the most charismatic and fun lead in any anime I've ever seen. He's someone who lives by no rules other than his own. Someone who is both emotional and distant. Someone values ass and boobs above all else. \\n\\n\r\nHe's Space Dandy, baby!",

            "content": "This is my first review and I'm not really good at writing but I enjoyed the show and wanted to review it.\r\nSo, Space Dandy \"Season 2\". I didn't really have any expectations for this show because Season 1 disappointed me a bit just because my hype was so high for it. There were some enjoyable episodes but overall, Season 1 was a good show, and that's about it. However, after I got used to the formula of the show, Season 2 was very entertaining.\r\nThere really isn't any story to Space Dandy, everything is different every week and the stories range from making a band togoing to a musical high school and other various random things. I actually loved this format, because getting something new each week was great. If you are looking for something like Cowboy Bebop just because of the Watanabe name, you will be disappointed. And I am assuming that's why so many people disliked this show, or rather, was disappointed with it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art for this show is amazing. There were different directors throughout the entire show and a lot of episodes looked completely different from each other. This is great, as sometimes an episode needs to look completely different because of the tone/theme of the episode and it works, most of the time. I can also talk about the animation here, in which Bones did an amazing job. Even with the episodes where you can tell that they are saving budget, it looks great.\\n\\n\r\nDandy was the center of this show. Without Dandy being an amazing character, the show would fall on its face. Sinclair did a great job voicing him, and Dandy's mannerisms and how he acted really made the show for me. I didn't really have any problems with the supporting characters like Meow, QT and Honey, but I loved Scarlet and the episode dedicated to her and Dandy was great. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the show more compared to last \"season\", and if you like episodic shows you should like this show. If there were .5s on MAL I would give it a 7.5, though. \\n",

            "content": "comic space opera in which a trio of protagonists bounces through a series of loosely connected adventures on alien planets; as a protagonist, Dandy is not that easy to like, and the decision to open up the anime to many guest directors means unevenness - many episodes come off as lazy on the part of everyone but the dub voice actors and animators, the latter of which do an especially good job of doubling down on colors and action sakuga. (Both aspects are apparent as early as episode 1: totally lame plot and characters, great animation.) Some episodes are failures (I was particularly disappointed byepisode 25, which seemed like it might be developing into a cool mystery, only for it turn out out to be multiple deus ex machinas.) Still, some episodes are well worth watching, perhaps more than once, with a noticeable improvement in season 2: episode 2, \"The Search for the Phantom Space Ramen\"; episode 4, \"Sometimes You Can't Live with Dying\" (an amusing zombie utopia); episode 9, \"Plants Are Living Things, Too\" (extremely questionable ethics aside); episode 10, \"There's Always Tomorrow\" (Meow, surprisingly, winds up being the best characterized person in the whole series); episode 16, \"Slow and Steady Wins the Race\" (existential risk); episode 18, \"The Big Fish is Huge\" (Ghibliesque); episode 21, \"A World with No Sadness\" (meditative death dream sequence with surreal Italian Renaissancesque worldbuilding set to progressive rock pieces by OGRE YOU ASSHOLE); and episode 24, \"An Other-Dimensional Tale\" (_Flatland_, and the secret of FTL travel in a multiverse).",

It's also one of those rare series where I enjoyed the Dub more than the Sub.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story tends to change with each episode, each episode following a bizarre story. It's either getting chased by booby monsters or getting stuck in an island with a weird guy with a ukulele. The stories weren't bad at all and I found myself laughing at the end of each episode. If the stories followed a concrete storyline with nochanges, maybe this would be higher on my list but I suppose these crazy story lines are what make Space Dandy... Dandy?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, the art in some/most of these episodes were amazing. There were some episodes where the studio experimented with different styles but still, those experiments were very enjoyable to watch. There were these two particular episodes (The Limbo and the fishing one, won't go into too much detail or I'll be entering Spoiler zone) where the animation was top notch. They really were a treat for the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music here is just...perfect for the series. The Funky/Jazzy soundtrack was very enjoyable and were just a perfect choice for this kind of sci-fi theme. The soundtrack really enhanced the experience and is one of the main reasons why Space Dandy got such a high rating from me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf felt as if the ending was a bit rushed for me however it still was one hell of a dandy ride. An amazing series.",

            "content": "Space Dandy was created by the same people who brought you Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop, legendary anime known for their great storytelling and stunning visuals, so what makes Space Dandy so special? Well it should be noted, he's a dandy guy in space with a great story to tell.  The episodes seem a bit random but really piece together in the end, Space Dandy season 2 really brings together the entire feel of adventure you get from season 1, it has great storytelling and is in all entertaining.  Critiques to keep in mind however, the ending is full of crap, not reallya spoiler, more of a warning.  You really get attached to the story and art of the show, sometimes an episode can get you confused, but in the end you'll really miss the journey you went through with the Dandy Space Crew.  Truly an anime worth watching, and one of the few where the dubbed and subbed are as equally good, so watching either is great.  \\n\r\nFor some more in-depth, first we can start with story: the story is a jumbled just like the first season but the seemingly random plotline is what really makes the story great, especially with all the butts and boobies to gawk at on the way.  The art is just stunning, the animation itself is outstanding and in few episodes you'll have to pause just to admire the quality of both character design and background art.  The sound and music of the show is great, it has great music to listen and gives a sense of awe.  The character development of the anime.........isn't that well done.  Keep in mind they can travel in space! They aren't off to see the same person all the time! However, you get a sense the characters never really change purely because the gang continues to move around everywhere, leaving loose ends everywhere such as Scarlett's and Dandy's relationship or Honey and her brothers true nature.  Personal enjoyment is truly a 10, the anime is phenomenal in the sense of entertainment!  Overall it'd deserve a 9, being a great anime to remember and watch when you want another adventure, but not one with complex storylines or anything serious, something just to sit back and relax, laugh and cry a bit, definitely a 9/10.",

Some episodes were really wierd, some unbelievable creativ. Space Dandy is in  its own league. There is no other show i could compare it to. SP 2 owns its wierdness.  There is high rewachtabilty and such a breath of fresh air. i could take my eyes of the screen. We got to know why the gogol empire is hunting Dandy. which is great. My favorite is the rockstar episode and the whole ending.\r\nCharacter: 8/10\r\nEvery Charactergets his time to shine. Even sidecharacters are well flesh out  and likeble. Their Interacrions are fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nthis is where SP2 shines. Some episodes have stellar animation. They use for every episode different artstyles. which keeps it fresh. some character designs look like they have been taken from a ghibli movie. which is great. Every character has a unique look.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThat OP and ED is so good and addictiv. i never skipped those. The soundtrack in the episodes are funky or jazz like which i licked.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 Started strong. Now for a long time i havent been that much entertained like in Space Dandy 2 and i will probably rewatch some episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n",

The characters act the exact same way from the first season, so it won't be too hard to carry on with the same enjoyment as you may have had in the first season. They introduce a new character, whose role is minor yet at the same time a little important. Then the show all comes down to apretty odd ending, which like I said earlier fits with the show. I would have changed the way it ended though, the ending they gave the show just doesn't really fit the mood for the rest of the series. I would rate 10 but emotions aside from how fantastic the show is, I give it a 9 for a weirdly 'rushed' ending.",

            "content": "Space Dandy is dandy in space! \r\nSpace Dandy to me feels like a love letter to anime by some of its most famous artists. Watanabe Shinichiro, Yamamoto Sayo, Shingo Natsume, Masaaki Yuasa and the list goes on and on. Adding to its long list of amazing musical artists and one of the current animation kings studio Bones, lots of references, and you get an absolutely amazing anime. \r\nThe episodic format of Space Dandy works primarily with well-known concepts and premises. From the most basic such as a girl and a father figure going through adventure to the crazy ones with singularities and universes and dimensionjumps. Obviously there are always interesting twists and animeesque elements. And the episodes hold up. With episodic series you always have a risk of having few good episodes mixed in with lots of boring stuff. Dandy keeps its consistency throughout the show and the episodes are so creative and entertaining that I could see an entire anime series built around most of them. There is one episode that felt very out of place to me (season 2 episode 8) but the episode in on itself was so interesting that I didn\u2019t even mind the tonal change. \\n\\n\r\nDandy is probably one of the most iconic characters of the last years in anime. He is an asshole but he has heart of gold. He\u2019s a pervert but a gentleman at the same time. He\u2019s a badass, an idiot, a genius, maybe a god, maybe a loser; maybe even a singer and a dancer. Maybe all of it, or maybe none of it? Wait, who is he again?\\n\\n\r\nBoth Qt and Meow get an individual episode and are overall likeable and quirky. Honey and Scarlet are both sexy and ready to kick some ass whenever necessary. Most of support characters from individual episodes are great. I don\u2019t remember any strikingly boring or annoying characters. That maybe is because the drives of Space Dandy are concepts and not characters. And that is to me the biggest flaw of the show (and it\u2019s purely subjective). While I love high-end conceptual shows I prefer character driven ones much more. All of the episodes are basically a same thing over and over again. Dandy and the crew are thrown into specific setting and we see how it turns out. I fully understand why would people rate this 10/10. But to me it\u2019s over the topness lacks honesty. It feels synthetic. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t go higher than very high 8\\n\\n\r\nThe production is insane. Lots of episodes are different and take the specific trademarks of key animators and directors working on them. And they go all the way with them. The designs are out of this world. Just the sheer amount of them and their variety deserves huge round of applause. The voice acting is pretty much perfect and has lots of famous names. The music is just spectacular. From synth sci-fi vibes to rock and punk to orchestral music. While the soundtrack is not as iconic as Cowboy Bebop\u2019s it\u2019s definitely one of the best soundtracks of the last half decade. \\n\\n\r\nSpace Dandy is just a gargantuan series full of love. This truly was a \u201cproject\u201d and not a simple anime, and I fully recommend it. Not many series are crafted with such care and turn out to be this amazing. It is a celebration of everything that makes anime great. And I love it\\n",

From what I saw around before starting it, I already knew it was going to be really different visually speaking but also because the tone seemed far more silly and light-hearted. So I just shrugged it off, braced myself and jumped in, ready for dissapointment.\r\nAnd -I have to admit it- at first I kinda was. There\u2019s no denying the two are completely different, and despite enjoying some references to \u2018Cowboy Bedop\u2019 spottedhere and there, at times the abyssal difference between the two genuinely made me gringe to the point of thinking \u2018why did they have to pollute my memory of \u2018Cowboy Bebop\u2019 in this way? Why, Studio Bones, WHY???\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nMy only consolation for 2 seasons and 12 episodes had been having fun noticing the different styles in the animation from episode to episode and enjoying the hell out of the visual aspects of some of them (like ep 9, 18 and 21), the unbelievable humor of some of them (ep 4 and 20), the sheer adorableness of ep 5 and 23 or the amaing, un-called for load of serious shit popping up at unexpected times hitting me right in the feels\u2026 all of this while getting upset by other episodes that got too stupid, unnecessay or just boring.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, escluding a couple of highly enjoyable moments, I was just not that amused.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the fact that they played so much and so well with different genres (which was one of the features I loved the most in Cowboy Bebop\u2019) but I still considered \u2018Space Dandy\u2019 as a random bunch of animated pieces thrown together for the sake of it -which is something I can enjoy if done well (like in this case) but that I don\u2019t really fully appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nBut then I got to the last 5 minutes of the last episode\u2026\\n\\n\r\nABSOLUTELY. MINDBLOWN.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering how my expectations were set, the ending had a reaaally shattering impact on my poor unprepared soul. This has brought storytelling to a whole different level. The plot of \u2019Cowboy Bebop\u2019\u2019 had just been extremely diluited and greatly character-based, whilst in \u2018Space Dandy\u2019 they basically let it all at the end. Despite it being admittedly still rather inconsistent, considering that it just really gives the impression of being a unapologetic mess of random stories with little to no sense of continuity whatsoever, I can only just say one thing to the way the handled it: well done, Bones, you played your cards in the best way possible.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a fully deserved 8/10. I didn\u2019t always enjoy everything and I still feel conflicted about a lot of aspects but it was undeniably entertaining, good for a nice laugh once you get into the spirit and even moment of pure aesthetic appreciation (some of the planets were just straight up stunning).\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recomend it if you\u2019re up for some nonsense humor, mellow yet lovable charcters, incredile designs and the frieakiest aliens I\u2019ve ever seen animated.

If you can laugh at yourself and delight in the subversion of expectation, Space Dandy is for you. \\n\\n\r\nThe most recent episode aired last night and lampooned not only high-school based anime, but the High School Musical craze as well as a few other common thematic elements from high school anime that I won't go in to so as to avoid spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nBut seriously, if the idea of following around Space Dandy, and his brave space crew...in space! makes you happy or seems interesting, you owe it to yourself and your eyeballs to check it out",

            "content": "If there\u2019s a show that can make you go \u201cWHAT?\u201d Space Dandy would be one of the first to come to mind. The \u2018what\u2019 doesn\u2019t associate with a kind of reaction that\u2019s negative though. Rather, I see Space Dandy a show of creative anthology. Each episode takes the characters on a wild ride in space with Dandy doing his usual gags. While the show often goes wacky with its direction, it\u2019s safe to say that the real point of the Space Dandy focuses on much more. Space Dandy Season 2 returns with Dandy and his adventurous crew in this sequel. And seriously, this show cravesfor attention when it comes to imaginative endeavors. \\n\\n\r\nDirected by the brainchild of Cowboy Bebop, Shinichiro Watanabe once again proves his worth. Breaking down the boundary of the adventure theme, he takes this sequel to new heights with his creativity. It quickly makes its point with the first episode by adapting various references and explodes them onto the screen. The comedic nature of the show quickly takes command but also fits in various satires and gags to illustrate creativity. As daring as the first season, it\u2019s not afraid to pull off risks. The risk here is that episodes can come with a mixed bag. But really, Space Dandy was never a show about overly complex plot angles or some dynamic narrative. Rather, it keeps the space adventure zipping along that is mastered with uniqueness.\\n\\n\r\nStuffed with craziness, the show plays around with itself like it\u2019s in a class of its own. Make no mistake though, Dandy plays more than just the role of a professor as he takes on the good adventure with his crew members. Essentially, the show was about hunting down aliens as Dandy dedicates it as his job. However, many episodes explores more than just that clich\u00e9. Comedy first, and space adventure second is probably the better way to say it in this case. Space Dandy has been defined as a show that is free to do whatever it wants. There\u2019s no boundary that confines itself or limit its ideas. Most of the episodes takes in space but also seizes opportunities to expand its settings. These include but not limited to high school, a mystical lake, and even a world where there\u2019s no sadness. (literally, as that title implies). Regardless, the main objective that Space Dandy achieves is not an adventure of classic fun but rather inspiration, the way it presents its stylish blockbuster hit from where season 1 already built upon.\\n\\n\r\nA majority of the attention is focused on the main characters. In fact, the main characters has this connection with both each other and I dare say\u2026the audience. Dandy has this personality that is like a chemistry set for a scientist. Once they get their hands on it, they can\u2019t stop. Their curiosity takes them like the way Dandy takes his adventures to wonders of the universe. This sense of nature can even label him as a hero as Dandy has prevented tragedies and even entire galactic wars in one of the episodes in this season. On the other hand, Dandy\u2019s two sidekicks QT and Meow play some major roles as well in the sequel. Unlike most series that tries to succeed with \u2018beating the Big Bad to save the world\u2019, Space Dandy is more about achieving some goal. It focuses on what the premise of each episode and twists in a ways beyond incalculable imaginations. Some of them will make your mind go \u201cWHAT?\u201d while other times will bring a smile of appreciation. It shouldn\u2019t be any surprising though. The sequel doesn\u2019t derive far from the style of season 1. Each episode is carefully crafted with its main and supporting characters to fit with its creative context. The catch is also that the show isn\u2019t exactly like a \u2018monster of the week\u2019 program. Instead, it seeks ambition and articulate concepts beyond just the space tropes. However, it can sometimes be frustrating to realize that most characters seize to appear in the future and only opt to play their roles in that specifically dedicated episode.\\n\\n\r\nTo take for granted, various themes play along the show as if it\u2019s self-aware. Destiny is one such theme as Dandy often seemingly gets himself involved with circumstances beyond his control. They say fate and destiny is something people can\u2019t defy. In Space Dandy though, that\u2019s a different story as Dandy often tries to tempt fate. His various battles such as against aliens, monstrous fishes, and armed forces often puts Dandy\u2019s own life in jeopardy. Yet, somehow Dandy pulls off a spectacular show when it\u2019s put up or shut up time. It\u2019s not clearly defined as deus ex machina because like I mentioned before, the show is seemingly self-aware about what Dandy is capable of. The sequel takes even more daring risks with imaginative worlds. One such episode really takes the cake with Dandy being in a world where sadness and death itself is extinct. The avant-garde nature combined with its unique humor of each episode brings forward talent on the tables as well. Each episode has a different screen writer including Watanabe himself. I give praise to Kiyotaka Oshiyama and Masaaki Yuasa for their stylish and clever writing. More so, Watanabe shows his skills in coordination by deconstructing the essence of an adventure. The sequel takes its adventure far beyond just space and into scenarios that not even the Twilight Zone can see with its eyes.\\n\\n\r\nProduction quality generally remains the same with Bones in charge of the operation. Character designs are still like the previous season with not much difference. There are some particular episodes that Dandy has slight differences to reflect the nature of itself. Otherwise, character designs still reflect the sci-fi trope such as the aliens, space vehicles, and fabulous gentlemen of the universe. One thing I find season 2 masterfully done is how artwork sells what it tries to advertise. The preview of each episode only produces an initial impression with the title being a potential trademark. However, the execution can really knock an audience off-guard with its contrasting visuals. Episodes directed by Watanabe and Yuasa are prominent examples for this. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is more of a classic appreciation. The western style OST fused with sci-fi tones is something to take notice of. The soothing music, the elegance of the OST, and colorful edginess clarify what this season is trying to accomplish. Surprisingly enough, I find the dubs comparable to the original Japanese versions. In both instances, Dandy has a voice of an explorer and takes on adventures with enthusiasm. Other characters too have influences whether they are human, robots, or aliens. One particular episode even has references to the voice actor with his own character (DUB version) and a classic battle of the bands theme. The OP and ED songs remain generally the same for the sequel though. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no single word to describe the second season. It can be fun, sexy, entertaining, insightful, influential, creative, thrilling, formulaic, intelligent, sensitive, charming, or just dandy. Some episodes can also be deep with hidden meanings and evoke emotions. Each episode is filled with potential and explores space like an anthology. Yes, the series may not make sense at times and will leave you in the hanging. Yes, the sequel may have never solved a story subplot or context that should have been. However, does it really need to? Remember, the show doesn\u2019t limit itself with its adventures. It stretches beyond the boundary of imagination by indulging on its unorthodox or perhaps even radical style. In the end, you might ask yourself \u201cwhat the hell?\u201d I know I did but doesn\u2019t regret a single minute afterwards. \\n",

            "content": "This is more of the stuff you saw in the first season. The animation is still great, music is still good, but for some reason I enjoyed this season less than the 1st one. \r\nFor some reason the stories in individual episodes, despite looking good graphically in most cases failed to resonate with me and left less impact than, for example, the absolutely amazing \"plant episode\" from the first season of space dandy. I'm not sure why this happened.\r\nIt is still worth watching, mostly because of high quality animation, and because of unusual stories, but expect it to have less impact than the first season.At least the way it worked for me.\\n\\n\r\nDetailed breakdown below:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10.\\n\r\nAs I said, most of the episodes failed to properly resonate with me and I found some of them very dull, desptie amazing artwork. However, now and then there are sparks of amazing, that was present in the original 1st season. There's smaller degree of \"weird alienness\", smaller number of weird worlds and strange stories, but now and then the story does make an interesting point or two, that makes you stop and think.\\n\\n\r\nStill.. I felt like this anime could use a much better scriptwriter. Much better one.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing worth mentioning is that there's a very subtle headscratcher in this series that reminded me of Rick and Morty. It is very easy to miss.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10:\\n\r\nVery high quality fluid animation. However, this time around there were several occurrences where I noticed footage reuse and \"panning shots\" (someone talks in small number of frames and the camera slowly pans acros the scene). This is usually used to reduce animation costs, and I do not recall this happening in the 1st season. However, the anime never goes overboard with it, and still looks good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10:\\n\r\nIT is good/catchy, however, in a few circumstances where music was supposed to take the lead, it failed to deliver. Basically, music is mostly good, but I couldn't call it \"great\". It does its job. Still, it is of higher quality than in many other animes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10:\\n\r\nCharacters lack depth and fails to deliverer in circumstances where story tries to portray them as deep/complex personalities. This is not surprising, because everybody is technically a stereotype/caricature and the show is usually about portraying some weird situation, world or planet, but at the end of the anime, it is not possible to say much about characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 6/10:\\n\r\nI found two episodes dull. The rest was okay. There was a small number of interesting headscratcher in the show, but despite high quality animation by studio bones, I wouldn't call this a masterpiece. Bones developed many other titles that were superior to this one (RahXephon, for example).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10:\\n\r\nThe anime has good animation and is worth because of it. However, I felt like the show desperately needed a better scriptwriter, and failed to deliver its full potential because of it. The artwork is very good, however.\\n\\n\r\nIt is wroth checking out, and is recommended in case you wanted to check out high quality visuals and fluid animation.\\n",

            "content": "Space Dandy is unique, it is a huge bag filled with endless creativity, it is fun, it is trippy, it is superb. Season 1 is good but there are several episodes that are a hit or miss, however, season 2 is awesome, much better than the first.\r\nSTORY: 9/10\r\nStory? What story? Technically, the universe of Space Dandy is so vast that the creators can concoct any story and it will still make perfect sense. Space Dandy is an episodic anime, with the episodes differing A LOT from each other, this is mostly due to the fact that Space Dandy is directed by multiple directors, each bringingtheir own flair and style into the episode they directed, which is why I said this is a huge bag filled with endless creativity, because it is!\\n\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t any continuity between the episodes, as such you are free to watch the episodes separately and still enjoy it as a whole. Dandy and his co may die in one episode, and appear perfectly fine in the next, and this fact, supposedly established in the very first episode of season 1, is actually explained brilliantly towards the end of the series (hence my high score).\\n\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\r\nHands down, Space Dandy is one of the most beautiful animes I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Remember when I mentioned the episodes differ a lot from each other? This applies to the art as well! Each and every single episode are drawn in a different style and this gives us viewers a myriad of eye candies to watch for (that ancient Japanese artstyle in ep 5? Wow). Not to mention the jaw-dropping sceneries found in many parts of the show, my eyes were glued to the screen at all times. \\n\\n\r\nSOUNDS: 10/10\\n\r\nSpace Dandy wouldn\u2019t be the same without the awesome soundtrack behind it. Most of the soundtracks are funk and jazz music (dandy!), of course there are plenty of other genres as well, heck, we even have live rock music (ep 7), high school musical style (ep 4), disco music from the 80s (ep 9) and many more. This season of Space Dandy had really upped the ante especially on this area, so pay attention to it as well when you watch it. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 8/10\\n\r\nSadly, this season has more episodes of Dandy being isolated from QT and Meow, so we don\u2019t see much of them as compared to the first season. Anyhow, Dandy is as cool as ever, and this coolness escalates to a much higher level especially towards the finale. Scarlet and Honey gets more screentime as well and they will be featured much, much more than just at their respective workplaces. Dr Gel and Bea are also featured as recurrent villains, and towards the finale, there\u2019s a big surprise waiting\u2026\\n\\n\r\nWe also have a huge cast of new characters joining in, with my favourites being Johnny and Planet Limbo herself. See for yourself and you will as well, I am sure, love the characters in Space Dandy. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\\n\r\nGranted, due to the episodic nature of Space Dandy, episodes may be a hit or miss, subjective to the viewer him/herself. If you ask me, I fell in love with most of the episodes of this season compared to the last season, and this season has many episodes with very high rewatchability, either to marvel at the greatness of the art, or the gorgeous soundtrack, or the mightily creative story and characters. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\r\nI\u2019d reckon that Space Dandy is viewable for all ages, but is especially appealing to the adults. Space Dandy should become more enjoyable as you age, due to the wide range of pop culture references in it. In conclusion, Space Dandy is a clever anime, and a brilliant work of art. \\n",

            "content": "*Note: This review is about the series in general, not just Season 2*\r\nBoobies and butts are what make the universe a pretty awesome place to exist in. How is this so? Just ask Dandy himself, and he could tell you all about it in glorious enthusiasm. This Dandy I speak of is named Space Dandy. Imagine if you mixed the best of western and eastern humor of TV animation shows and combine them into one nifty package. That should tell you right away that Space Dandy destines to be different and fresh without making an overtly big deal about it. Regardless, you certainly can\u2019t beatthis hot fun garbage series with any other garbage entertainment, anime or otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted, when talking about Space Dandy, that this is not a Shinichiro Watanabe directed anime in its purest sense, the director of such classics as Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Even though he overseas chief direction for the show, this is essentially a conglomerate of different anime directors putting their own directorial spin on the series. That should tell you right there that Space Dandy does not follow any direct narrative from point A to point B. Episodic episodes spliced together to follow Dandy and his band of various misfits, all create a western-style animated series vibe that can be nostalgic for those of us growing up as kids watching these shows day by day. So if you thought this was going to be a Cowboy Bebop-style show, just be thankful that you will be getting the filler episode portions of Bebop.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, that should not entail that Space Dandy is nothing more than a comedic version of Bebop. In actuality, it brings forth a very unique style of its own to formulate charm to its humor and characters. Almost all jokes prevalent in Space Dandy hit all of the notes perfectly with nicely done comedic timing and on top of it, they don\u2019t just make all of the jokes onto one subject matter. Sure, the main focus of Space Dandy\u2019s comedy is purely sexual with its constant pandering over butts and boobs, but once you further yourself into the show, you\u2019ll realize that it is not the case. Many tropes are satirized from what you would typically see in any animated show with male characters like Dandy; always getting what he wants in the end that quickly falls flat over him.\\n\\n\r\nThere are genuine surprises thrown in here and there. For instance, it is probably one of the few anime you will ever see that has its own musical number. Even with its comedy, the writers actually delve into introspective subject matter that actually become insightful and melancholic while still maintaining its humor without exemplifying it unnaturally. Rarely would I ever applaud a show for being able to achieve both of these elements. The reason being is how the jokes are written in very clever fashion by its intricate pacing and punchlines. Never is there a dull moment between the hilarious banter of Dandy and his friends out of the 26 episodes in this series.\\n\\n\r\nDandy himself is quite the protagonist in keeping the show at an evenly paced comedy with his larger than life charisma and presence. Normally with a man who constantly obsesses over booty and tits can be grating over a period of time. What makes Dandy an exception is that they do not really shove the obvious joke down our throats continuously, although in some parts they do, especially in the earlier episodes. He proves himself to be an exceptional lead, but that\u2019s not to say he\u2019s the only one who is able to do that in Space Dandy.\\n\\n\r\nMeow, Dandy\u2019s right hand man after humiliating him in the first episode, isn\u2019t similar to Dandy in terms of personality. In fact, Meow would be the one to set him straight to focus on their missions, even though Dandy himself isn\u2019t a total idiot in most cases. QT, Dandy\u2019s robot sidekick, is the same way in this aspect, where he is always trying to keep things in order over Dandy\u2019s typical behavior. Both of these leads are extremely lovable because of the perfect chemistry between them and Dandy. Even when their relationship seems atypical, goofy trite at first glance, they eventually warm up to being match made in heaven.\\n\\n\r\nWhat good is it to talk about Space Dandy without mentioning its elaborate music? Absolutely zilch. I will speak in no hyperbole whatsoever in stating that Space Dandy has the most infectious Opening I\u2019ve had the pleasure of listening to. The word infectious is meant in the most positive sense possible. Newcomer Kensuke Ushio has really made himself quite a success story in 2014 with this and also composing for Ping Pong The Animation. The opening itself sets the mood for the entire show and lets you know that fun is about to come your way, like any other good opening does to any other show.\\n\\n\r\nOne very important thing to note is the artistic direction and how diverse the animators decided to put into creating this very elaborate, kooky universe. All of the alien creatures are very unique in design that are a mix mash of previously imagined aliens and putting in their own vision. The lavish colors are put with great care so Space Dandy can be easy and pleasing to the eyes. It also helps that the animation is nice and fluid to further the aesthetic to new heights. Also, because there are multiple directors for each episode, some of them even put their own artistic vision into the spectrum. One notable is Masaaki Yuasa, director of The Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong The Animation, who filled in one episode for animation direct in episode 3, who managed to put in a whole different spin for the series in terms of animation.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, there is really nothing like Space Dandy that you often see in anime. In some ways, it\u2019s sort of Japan\u2019s answer to western animated TV shows and saying, \u201cHey, we can make episodic goofy comedies just like the rest of y\u2019all!\u201d Regardless of whether that was their true intention or not, it definitely speaks volumes by analyzing how Space Dandy can work both as a satire or a genuine comedy. Japanese anime purists may watch this with disdain because its not the archetypal anime, even in comedy standards, that we are used to. But if you\u2019re willing to give credit where credit is due for a Japan-produced nostalgia trip of late-\u201990s to early 2000\u2019s animated shows, look no further.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "Its a Space Dandy review, Baby.\r\nIll start this off by saying that this show took a quite unexpected leap forward during its second season. Space Dandy part 2 focused on some pretty deep questions, and our loveable oaf dandy turns about to be quite the philosopher.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nThe one key element that a show needs is unpredictability. Many shows have well thought-out stories with coherent back stories and a good progression. Space Dandy has somehow succeeded in showing the complete opposite of this. The episode to episode chronology is nearly inconsistent (although this is later explained), and this makes every new episode a new adventure. \r\nPartof the reason for Space Dandy's remarkable story was due to the multitude of directors and writers working on the show, each one bringing their own style to the show. The most profound episodes are written by none other than Shinichiro Watanabe. After so many predictable shows with careful a planning, Space Dandy stands out from the crowd.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Space Dandy pays homage to earlier 90s sci-fi shows, such as Cowboy Bebop and Cyber City Oedo: yet throws in a bit of flair with bright colour pallets. Everything from the Aloha Oe to Dandy's pompadour has an aura of rebelliousness  which perfectly fits the theme of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOn inspection of the 2 Dandy OSTs, it is clear that Space Dandy uses a wide range of genres to create the scenes. From jazz reminiscent of Bebop, to acoustic and piano singles that create a melancholic atmosphere: Space Dandy has it all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough many characters stay true to their original personas, their is a great deal of development for the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nQTs romance at the end of season 1; Meow's family episode, Scarlet's inner feelings and Dandy's constant desire to help those in need all show a level of depth I never expected from this show. While Dandy may appear a lustful clueless oaf to the new viewer, we are slowly shown a far more profound side to him: with each episode bringing to light another side to out multi-dimensional hero\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat more is there to say, baby. You would be hard pressed to find anyone who didn't enjoy Space Dandy. The strong following is proof enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall space dandy is a testament to what is possible if writers, directors and animators are given creative freedom. Space Dandy was not designed to sell, nor was it designed to pander to a particular audience. In essence, Space Dandy is proof that you don't need perfect animation, coherent plots or a specific audience to make a great show.\\n\\n\r\nWatch space dandy: you'll be surprised.",

Yes.\r\nI am not going to waste time writing a synopsis, summary or any other time wasting bullshit. I am simply going to tell you why this anime is fabulous.\r\nSpace Dandy is a concoction of episodes directed by many, many different episode directors under, I assume, the watchful eye of one of my personal heroes in the anime industry.\r\nWhat we have in Space Dandy that makes it fabulous is organised chaos. Some rules and cliches have been followed but not many. This makes it an anime that asks thingsof the viewers. It asks us to beat with it. It asks us to be forgiving. It asks us to be understanding. Most of the time though, it just wants us to go with the flow. Because of this some of the episodes are not going to speak to everyone and others are not going to be understood by everyone. But this is always the risk with an anime in this format.\\n\\n\r\nWhat we do have though, is the femme fatale(s), the trusted companions, the anti-heroes (of which the main protagonist is included most of the time), some GAR, time and space travelling, some multidimensional space-time theories, zombies, plants, cyberpunk, western inspired themes, boobs, robots, a rock-band, warring space opera empires and many other things including but not excluded to space travelling fish.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that is very important for the enjoyment of an episodic anime is the character development of side characters. You have to be fast if you want your viewer to get involved and engaged in a character which, more than likely, will not be around again. Space Dandy succeeds in this, which is one of the main reasons why it is good. Scenarios are painted up for us involving characters that's been on screen for 10 minutes and I actually cared about what was going to happen to them. That's a pretty rare feat. when it comes to me.\\n\\n\r\nGood bye.\\n",

            "content": "To start off, I decided to write this review when I saw current reviews with misleading information about the show. This isn't a show that will force you to think deeper, because you don't need to to enjoy it, however, it does extend a hand to those who do wish to find the deeper meaning. One of the things that makes this show so unique, is it's unwillingness to be controlled by the status quo of an anime. Our \"Hero\" is indeed a hero, but not one of traditional nature. He comes across as more of a human and ordinary guy because that's exactly whathe is. In most shows, whether you know it or not, the \"hero\" has extraordinary luck and it allows the plot to progress further because of all the amazing opportunities they are given to show off their skills. Space Dandy, is not bound by such luck and therefor requires a lot more work to develop his character. The more you watch the more you can feel for and relate to Dandy and his issues.\\n\\n\r\nNow to talk about the other characters, QT and Meow. These are the supporting actors that really make this show something else. They aren't overly cliched and overdone characters, though I was worried QT was going to be the overdone calculated and boring robot. However, I was wrong. Each character has their own incredibly unique personality. Meow is probably one of the more relatable characters, he's a dropout and though his family loves him very much, he still doesn't feel content with being nothing whether he knows it or not. QT is Dandy's handy vacuum AI that helps him with a lot more than what he was programmed for and secretly harboring lots of different emotions, and that's one of the things that makes this show so beautiful, ANYBODY could be apart of Space Dandy's crew, because the characters, while having great personality, are mundane and ones that relate more to the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to spoil the show for you, but while every episode seems disconnected, in the end it brings it all together and explains the randomness of the show. At first I had a hard time watching space Dandy because I asked myself \"What's the point? The end result can't make me feel anything more than the first episode did because the plot doesn't really progress.\" Now here I am, writing my first anime review on what I believe to be one of the greatest plotless masterpieces around today.",

            "content": "An outrageously fun, hilarious sci-fi with a lovable crew and their bizarre space adventures. \r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\r\n(This review covers both seasons.)\r\nSpace Dandy was the most fun anime I\u2019ve seen in a long, long time. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been so motivated to marathon a show. I finished the 26 episodes in 3 days. It\u2019s hilarious, always leaving me with a smile. The characters are very charming and loveable. The plots are absurd and over-the-top, but even through the silliness it manages to settle down sometimes to make you feel at peace, even melancholy and lonely.\r\nI\u2019ve said before, but entertainment\u2014no matter what form\u2014whether it\u2019s anime ormovies or books are really just about giving you that emotional experience. Don\u2019t worry about the details. Don\u2019t worry about the logic. If you love it enough just go with it.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the animation is absolutely amazing. It\u2019s so full of life and details it's worth re-watching. This is a show that demands to be seen in true Blu-ray quality. You would be hurting yourself to watch it any other way. You have to see this in full 1080p to experience the incredible imagination. There are bizarre aliens, exotic planets, and beautiful cosmic scenery to witness.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is about a crew of three and their space adventures trying to find and capture rare aliens. These aliens are then registered for a cash reward. Your hero is a care-free slacker who loves women and going to a space Hooters. At his side is an adorable, outdated vacuum cleaning robot that puts up with him. Then there\u2019s a space cat that\u2019s just as lazy.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub and its writing are fantastic. I strongly recommend watching that version. It\u2019s obvious the translation team took liberties to westernize the material, but it\u2019s very well-suited. If I didn\u2019t know this was an anime, I\u2019d swear it was western made because so much of the humor feels western. Even the dialogue feels very modern with slang like \u201csketchy\u201d and references to Twitter.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode is something different because they each have a very strong emotional theme. There\u2019s a lot of variety to the plots. Everything from a zombie episode; a galactic space race; going on a date; meeting parallel dimensions; even something as simple as a road trip. There\u2019s even touches of continuity as the they refer back to older plots and items. When the show takes a break from its wacky adventures to settle down the music really adds a surreal, distant, almost lonely mood. Other times the episodes are just plain weird and abstract.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m reminded of Futurama: another sci-fi show that makes stories and jokes out of scientific concepts. Space Dandy was a blast to watch. It's like no other anime I can think of. Without a doubt it's my favorite of 2014.",

            "content": "(7.5/10)\r\nSo I don't really have much to say about the second season of Space Dandy. It pretty much maintained what I really enjoyed about the first season, as well as the parts that I didn't really enjoy. It's still a very inconsistent show, with three episodes this second seasons that were especially unfun to watch. \r\nAt its worst it's a middling, dull knockoff trying to parody shit that has already been endlessly parodied by other programs. It comes off as cliche and lazy. At it's best it's a genre mixing masterwork of jaw-dropping animation, great short-form storytelling, and engaging characters. \r\nIn season 2 there wasan odd focus on music in a few episodes which really just didn't sound too good. A high-school musical-esq episode that, while it may make sense on paper, really didn't translate on screen. They parodied a lot of those cliches that come with that kind of genre, but didn't really do so in an interesting enough way to get me to be engaged with it. That mixed in with truly mediocre songwriting didn't do the show any favors. \\n\\n\r\nIn this season, though, there was a distinct focus on the endgame, too. Which was surprising. It's a show that can be made infinitely, so it takes a lot of guts (and balls) from Watanabe and Minami for not milking it for all it's worth. It fits better as a 2-core. It looks more appealing as a short-lived, but very fun show. \\n\\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nThe series finale, all spoilers aside, shows a show that knows itself. More importantly, it shows a creator and writer that knows the show. He knows exactly what the show is and what it is aiming to be. Mixing absolutely insane spectacle, touching character moments, and obvious bathos into a very entertaining and undoubtedly awesome conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe shows finale was even hinted at many times in the shows second season, with many fan theories being proven correct, which shows a longer con that the creator was playing. This is also a thumbs up. \\n\\n\r\nIf only the show felt a bit more consistent in its delivery. I think if it weren't for the third music-oriented episode, I would have been comfortable with giving this show a great 8/10, which means it would have earned its spot as one of my favorite anime. That being said, unfortunately, for as awesome as a few key episodes were, especially the ones guest animated and directed, you simply can't forgive the blundering duds that were in the second season as well. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, certain episodes stood out as much as the specific few in season 1 as well. An episodes by the key animator for Kizumonogatari was something special, as well as episodes with big names like Kiyotaka Oshiyama, and the glorious Masaaki Yuasa, create some of the shows most memorable pieces of animation. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the second season solidified Space Dandy as a very memorable space romp with perhaps the most charismatic and fun lead in any anime I've ever seen. He's someone who lives by no rules other than his own. Someone who is both emotional and distant. Someone values ass and boobs above all else. \\n\\n\r\nHe's Space Dandy, baby!",

            "content": "This is my first review and I'm not really good at writing but I enjoyed the show and wanted to review it.\r\nSo, Space Dandy \"Season 2\". I didn't really have any expectations for this show because Season 1 disappointed me a bit just because my hype was so high for it. There were some enjoyable episodes but overall, Season 1 was a good show, and that's about it. However, after I got used to the formula of the show, Season 2 was very entertaining.\r\nThere really isn't any story to Space Dandy, everything is different every week and the stories range from making a band togoing to a musical high school and other various random things. I actually loved this format, because getting something new each week was great. If you are looking for something like Cowboy Bebop just because of the Watanabe name, you will be disappointed. And I am assuming that's why so many people disliked this show, or rather, was disappointed with it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art for this show is amazing. There were different directors throughout the entire show and a lot of episodes looked completely different from each other. This is great, as sometimes an episode needs to look completely different because of the tone/theme of the episode and it works, most of the time. I can also talk about the animation here, in which Bones did an amazing job. Even with the episodes where you can tell that they are saving budget, it looks great.\\n\\n\r\nDandy was the center of this show. Without Dandy being an amazing character, the show would fall on its face. Sinclair did a great job voicing him, and Dandy's mannerisms and how he acted really made the show for me. I didn't really have any problems with the supporting characters like Meow, QT and Honey, but I loved Scarlet and the episode dedicated to her and Dandy was great. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the show more compared to last \"season\", and if you like episodic shows you should like this show. If there were .5s on MAL I would give it a 7.5, though. \\n",

            "content": "comic space opera in which a trio of protagonists bounces through a series of loosely connected adventures on alien planets; as a protagonist, Dandy is not that easy to like, and the decision to open up the anime to many guest directors means unevenness - many episodes come off as lazy on the part of everyone but the dub voice actors and animators, the latter of which do an especially good job of doubling down on colors and action sakuga. (Both aspects are apparent as early as episode 1: totally lame plot and characters, great animation.) Some episodes are failures (I was particularly disappointed byepisode 25, which seemed like it might be developing into a cool mystery, only for it turn out out to be multiple deus ex machinas.) Still, some episodes are well worth watching, perhaps more than once, with a noticeable improvement in season 2: episode 2, \"The Search for the Phantom Space Ramen\"; episode 4, \"Sometimes You Can't Live with Dying\" (an amusing zombie utopia); episode 9, \"Plants Are Living Things, Too\" (extremely questionable ethics aside); episode 10, \"There's Always Tomorrow\" (Meow, surprisingly, winds up being the best characterized person in the whole series); episode 16, \"Slow and Steady Wins the Race\" (existential risk); episode 18, \"The Big Fish is Huge\" (Ghibliesque); episode 21, \"A World with No Sadness\" (meditative death dream sequence with surreal Italian Renaissancesque worldbuilding set to progressive rock pieces by OGRE YOU ASSHOLE); and episode 24, \"An Other-Dimensional Tale\" (_Flatland_, and the secret of FTL travel in a multiverse).",

            "content": "First Review, be gentle guise.\r\nSpace Dandy is a really unique series, coming from the creators of Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop, it indeed is a wacky and amazing series. It's also one of those rare series where I enjoyed the Dub more than the Sub.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story tends to change with each episode, each episode following a bizarre story. It's either getting chased by booby monsters or getting stuck in an island with a weird guy with a ukulele. The stories weren't bad at all and I found myself laughing at the end of each episode. If the stories followed a concrete storyline with nochanges, maybe this would be higher on my list but I suppose these crazy story lines are what make Space Dandy... Dandy?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, the art in some/most of these episodes were amazing. There were some episodes where the studio experimented with different styles but still, those experiments were very enjoyable to watch. There were these two particular episodes (The Limbo and the fishing one, won't go into too much detail or I'll be entering Spoiler zone) where the animation was top notch. They really were a treat for the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music here is just...perfect for the series. The Funky/Jazzy soundtrack was very enjoyable and were just a perfect choice for this kind of sci-fi theme. The soundtrack really enhanced the experience and is one of the main reasons why Space Dandy got such a high rating from me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf felt as if the ending was a bit rushed for me however it still was one hell of a dandy ride. An amazing series.",

            "content": "Space Dandy was created by the same people who brought you Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop, legendary anime known for their great storytelling and stunning visuals, so what makes Space Dandy so special? Well it should be noted, he's a dandy guy in space with a great story to tell.  The episodes seem a bit random but really piece together in the end, Space Dandy season 2 really brings together the entire feel of adventure you get from season 1, it has great storytelling and is in all entertaining.  Critiques to keep in mind however, the ending is full of crap, not reallya spoiler, more of a warning.  You really get attached to the story and art of the show, sometimes an episode can get you confused, but in the end you'll really miss the journey you went through with the Dandy Space Crew.  Truly an anime worth watching, and one of the few where the dubbed and subbed are as equally good, so watching either is great.  \\n\r\nFor some more in-depth, first we can start with story: the story is a jumbled just like the first season but the seemingly random plotline is what really makes the story great, especially with all the butts and boobies to gawk at on the way.  The art is just stunning, the animation itself is outstanding and in few episodes you'll have to pause just to admire the quality of both character design and background art.  The sound and music of the show is great, it has great music to listen and gives a sense of awe.  The character development of the anime.........isn't that well done.  Keep in mind they can travel in space! They aren't off to see the same person all the time! However, you get a sense the characters never really change purely because the gang continues to move around everywhere, leaving loose ends everywhere such as Scarlett's and Dandy's relationship or Honey and her brothers true nature.  Personal enjoyment is truly a 10, the anime is phenomenal in the sense of entertainment!  Overall it'd deserve a 9, being a great anime to remember and watch when you want another adventure, but not one with complex storylines or anything serious, something just to sit back and relax, laugh and cry a bit, definitely a 9/10.",

Some episodes were really wierd, some unbelievable creativ. Space Dandy is in  its own league. There is no other show i could compare it to. SP 2 owns its wierdness.  There is high rewachtabilty and such a breath of fresh air. i could take my eyes of the screen. We got to know why the gogol empire is hunting Dandy. which is great. My favorite is the rockstar episode and the whole ending.\r\nCharacter: 8/10\r\nEvery Charactergets his time to shine. Even sidecharacters are well flesh out  and likeble. Their Interacrions are fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nthis is where SP2 shines. Some episodes have stellar animation. They use for every episode different artstyles. which keeps it fresh. some character designs look like they have been taken from a ghibli movie. which is great. Every character has a unique look.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThat OP and ED is so good and addictiv. i never skipped those. The soundtrack in the episodes are funky or jazz like which i licked.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 Started strong. Now for a long time i havent been that much entertained like in Space Dandy 2 and i will probably rewatch some episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n",

The characters act the exact same way from the first season, so it won't be too hard to carry on with the same enjoyment as you may have had in the first season. They introduce a new character, whose role is minor yet at the same time a little important. Then the show all comes down to apretty odd ending, which like I said earlier fits with the show. I would have changed the way it ended though, the ending they gave the show just doesn't really fit the mood for the rest of the series. I would rate 10 but emotions aside from how fantastic the show is, I give it a 9 for a weirdly 'rushed' ending.",

            "content": "Space Dandy is dandy in space! \r\nSpace Dandy to me feels like a love letter to anime by some of its most famous artists. Watanabe Shinichiro, Yamamoto Sayo, Shingo Natsume, Masaaki Yuasa and the list goes on and on. Adding to its long list of amazing musical artists and one of the current animation kings studio Bones, lots of references, and you get an absolutely amazing anime. \r\nThe episodic format of Space Dandy works primarily with well-known concepts and premises. From the most basic such as a girl and a father figure going through adventure to the crazy ones with singularities and universes and dimensionjumps. Obviously there are always interesting twists and animeesque elements. And the episodes hold up. With episodic series you always have a risk of having few good episodes mixed in with lots of boring stuff. Dandy keeps its consistency throughout the show and the episodes are so creative and entertaining that I could see an entire anime series built around most of them. There is one episode that felt very out of place to me (season 2 episode 8) but the episode in on itself was so interesting that I didn\u2019t even mind the tonal change. \\n\\n\r\nDandy is probably one of the most iconic characters of the last years in anime. He is an asshole but he has heart of gold. He\u2019s a pervert but a gentleman at the same time. He\u2019s a badass, an idiot, a genius, maybe a god, maybe a loser; maybe even a singer and a dancer. Maybe all of it, or maybe none of it? Wait, who is he again?\\n\\n\r\nBoth Qt and Meow get an individual episode and are overall likeable and quirky. Honey and Scarlet are both sexy and ready to kick some ass whenever necessary. Most of support characters from individual episodes are great. I don\u2019t remember any strikingly boring or annoying characters. That maybe is because the drives of Space Dandy are concepts and not characters. And that is to me the biggest flaw of the show (and it\u2019s purely subjective). While I love high-end conceptual shows I prefer character driven ones much more. All of the episodes are basically a same thing over and over again. Dandy and the crew are thrown into specific setting and we see how it turns out. I fully understand why would people rate this 10/10. But to me it\u2019s over the topness lacks honesty. It feels synthetic. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t go higher than very high 8\\n\\n\r\nThe production is insane. Lots of episodes are different and take the specific trademarks of key animators and directors working on them. And they go all the way with them. The designs are out of this world. Just the sheer amount of them and their variety deserves huge round of applause. The voice acting is pretty much perfect and has lots of famous names. The music is just spectacular. From synth sci-fi vibes to rock and punk to orchestral music. While the soundtrack is not as iconic as Cowboy Bebop\u2019s it\u2019s definitely one of the best soundtracks of the last half decade. \\n\\n\r\nSpace Dandy is just a gargantuan series full of love. This truly was a \u201cproject\u201d and not a simple anime, and I fully recommend it. Not many series are crafted with such care and turn out to be this amazing. It is a celebration of everything that makes anime great. And I love it\\n",

From what I saw around before starting it, I already knew it was going to be really different visually speaking but also because the tone seemed far more silly and light-hearted. So I just shrugged it off, braced myself and jumped in, ready for dissapointment.\r\nAnd -I have to admit it- at first I kinda was. There\u2019s no denying the two are completely different, and despite enjoying some references to \u2018Cowboy Bedop\u2019 spottedhere and there, at times the abyssal difference between the two genuinely made me gringe to the point of thinking \u2018why did they have to pollute my memory of \u2018Cowboy Bebop\u2019 in this way? Why, Studio Bones, WHY???\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nMy only consolation for 2 seasons and 12 episodes had been having fun noticing the different styles in the animation from episode to episode and enjoying the hell out of the visual aspects of some of them (like ep 9, 18 and 21), the unbelievable humor of some of them (ep 4 and 20), the sheer adorableness of ep 5 and 23 or the amaing, un-called for load of serious shit popping up at unexpected times hitting me right in the feels\u2026 all of this while getting upset by other episodes that got too stupid, unnecessay or just boring.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, escluding a couple of highly enjoyable moments, I was just not that amused.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the fact that they played so much and so well with different genres (which was one of the features I loved the most in Cowboy Bebop\u2019) but I still considered \u2018Space Dandy\u2019 as a random bunch of animated pieces thrown together for the sake of it -which is something I can enjoy if done well (like in this case) but that I don\u2019t really fully appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nBut then I got to the last 5 minutes of the last episode\u2026\\n\\n\r\nABSOLUTELY. MINDBLOWN.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering how my expectations were set, the ending had a reaaally shattering impact on my poor unprepared soul. This has brought storytelling to a whole different level. The plot of \u2019Cowboy Bebop\u2019\u2019 had just been extremely diluited and greatly character-based, whilst in \u2018Space Dandy\u2019 they basically let it all at the end. Despite it being admittedly still rather inconsistent, considering that it just really gives the impression of being a unapologetic mess of random stories with little to no sense of continuity whatsoever, I can only just say one thing to the way the handled it: well done, Bones, you played your cards in the best way possible.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a fully deserved 8/10. I didn\u2019t always enjoy everything and I still feel conflicted about a lot of aspects but it was undeniably entertaining, good for a nice laugh once you get into the spirit and even moment of pure aesthetic appreciation (some of the planets were just straight up stunning).\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recomend it if you\u2019re up for some nonsense humor, mellow yet lovable charcters, incredile designs and the frieakiest aliens I\u2019ve ever seen animated.

I went into the original Space Dandy not really knowing too much about it. I only saw like one episode years ago back on Adult Swim so I only had a vague/hazy feel of the show. I went into it with a mindset of \"Oh it\u2019s a nice turn your brain off\" anime, and to an extent I wasn't too far off. So putting aside the story synopsis (You can just read show description after all) I am going to try mybest to relay my feelings and thoughts on the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nSo when you think of the story to Space Dandy there is actually quite a bit to take away from it. Now you can easily go through and view it at face value as an episodic story that just has its own unique \"Story\" per episode. For example it can be something like (Episode 1 I ate cereal, Episode 2 I'm climbing a mountain) and you can pretty much see that those two are different things with little to no correlation. So that's a way that people can view the show. It may not be for everyone, if you are looking for a story that seems consistent with a linear plot line I suggest you watch a different show. Otherwise watch away to your hearts content. P.S If a linear story is your thing I recommend you watch from season 1 episode 1 to the end of season 2 you may just find what you are looking for maybe. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nSo when you look at an anime what do you see artwork of course! Drawings, Pictures, Animation etc. Space Dandy has some unique artwork to it by far. I can say for sure that it has a really beautiful world that it\u2019s trying to convey. When I thought of a space anime I felt to be honest that it was going to get a little bit old after a bit. Primarily since there may not be too much you can do with planets, and ships and space stations may get old. However Space Dandy is much more than just that. From looking at waters of an ocean to the explosions of spacecraft, this show has it all. Plus a little eye candy for your lookie loos out there ;) In all seriousness though this is a very beautiful anime and the artwork and colors are very pleasing to the eye. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nDon't even get me started on the sound baby. So first the voice acting is well done. I watched both seasons dubbed and I have to say that this anime is one where I for sure prefer dub over sub. Ian Sinclair does a fantastic job for the voice of Space Dandy. He is able to convey Dandy's personality very well, plus he just sounds so entertaining. Moving on to the music, I have to say that I am hooked on the soundtrack as of late. A really good song I recommend is \"I should be\" it\u2019s so good. But getting back on point a good anime has great music and visuals that's why we watch them over reading a manga (Not saying one is better than the other) we want to see our characters move, talk, laugh, and listen to some groovy tunes as well. I find this soundtrack very befitting for Space Dandy and this anime for sure is one of my favorite in terms of music. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nSo there are a lot of colorful characters in Space Dandy that you meet along the way. Space is large and vast and full of many things so it makes sense to want to see as much as we can. I feel there is adequate character development for not just the main crew but the side characters we meet along the way. I will not be going into detail about the characters (Look at other people\u2019s reviews for that) rather I feel it\u2019s best to say that for the most part there is a sense of completeness for everyone. It\u2019s sad in a way because you can get so caught up on a side character and their story that you kinda wish they were going to join the crew and or become a huge character later on. Who knows that may happen in season 3... Maybe. Putting that aside I will say the main crew is quite memorable, and I could say the same for side characters if there happens to be a particular episode you just really enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nSo going over my personal experience again just to reiterate. I originally started watching Space Dandy because I wanted to just watch a nonsensical brainless anime. So I started from the first season. Now when it comes to the \"Mindless Comedy\" genre it may not be as fulfilling as say a psychological or romance but I say to hell with it in regards to its show and Space Dandy has its own unique appeal. Going over just a broad sense of both seasons here I find that they are more or less the same what I mean is that the general formula of Space Dandy remains the same. It\u2019s not a show where Season 1 is one way and Season 2 is a massive curve ball. I will say Season 2 is a bit more deep that the first for sure. But it\u2019s still great. You find yourself growing to like this crew and the journey they go on. It\u2019s been a long time since I had an anime that left me with a yearning for it. Even though I finished it I still want more out of this show I want to see the Dandy crew back at it again. I will say that in terms of rewatch factor I won\u2019t be going straight back into the show watching it from start to finish right away. I may watch an episode here or there because like I stated earlier in my review the episodes don't necessarily follow a linear story. I will probably rewatch it later on in the future however. Plus the soundtrack like I said before is phenomenal I love it so much. You can bet your booty I'm going to be listening to it for a while whenever I'm on my computer. The creators knew that they were doing when they made this anime. It parodies the tropes of modern anime and does a decent job. It\u2019s like how Austin Powers parodied the spy genre. Space Dandy is like that and has all the charm that goes with it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI give this anime a 10, I really do enjoy it a lot. I can recommend this anime to anyone who wants a good comedy or just very chill anime to watch. After all this isn't meant to be some huge drama fest show just something where you can watch a nice relaxing show crack open a cold one (If you drink) and watch the adventures of the Dandy guy in Space. \\n\\n\r\nStay Dandy Baby\\n",

            "content": "\u201cYou get to a certain point when you just want to get to the meat of a review, you've already made it through a prequel, you've seen all of what the critical reviews can offer already, so just get to the point\u201d, I'm sure a good percentage of people that care about reading other people's reviews repeat this sentence even on an unnoticeable level before digging in on these type of critics and I'm no exception myself, as flat forward Dandy is, the goal of my reviews draw heavily on that, drop all the deal weight and clutter only relevant information that both praises andbashes a specific show accordingly, and I'm no judger... and no J.K Rowling either. Or else I would have already called all of you gay for reading the review and call it a day, baby.\\n\r\nSee above \ud83d\udc46? That's how easy it is to stray out of actually reviewing something and stalling for the extra paragraph to pad your already empty piece of uncohesive sentences that don't say anything despite taking up all of your screens. See? I've done it again, baby.\\n\r\nWith a plot-free show much like the first season basically was (although it's debatable, but that's what the general public opinion is), Space Dandy isn't tied up to the traditional methods of sculpting up a proper storyline that holds itself against other broad titles, it speaks through the humor and irony of mocking up both real life and other high and mighty nouveau-rich names that try to scale up against the odds, it doesn't need a deep character behind it or even a super relatable one that makes all of the 14-year-olds go nuts memeing on social media and giving r/im14andthisisdeep something to feed upon. But season 2 embraced that change along with its loved and praised own made up way of developing a plot and throws you into a mix between both world's finest that you're left to appreciate the \u201cupgrade\u201d that you know a lot of people hate because change is something bad apparently. But this is how Space Dandy gives the middle finger to that, baby.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (9.5/10):\\n\r\nI can't say this for the majority of the first season, it was freaking amazing on its own way, but let's be honest, episodes that threw hints on what actually was going on were always there, and before you question in agony \u201cwait, this show has a plot?\u201d; yes it does, and always had since episode 1 season 1. Remember the two empires that were always warring? All fo those dimension-crossing jokes that get thrown around every single episode? All of those become relevant, so relevant in fact it makes Tube Simulator not relevant a single bit. And no, I don't want Pyramides (Only a 9-year-old would get the past references), baby.\\n\r\nThere is a sense of immense satisfaction when finally when you've made it to the last episode and starting to link everything together, \u201choly shrimp, that makes a lot of sense\u201d is your catchphrase for the rest of the day after you finish watching the end-game. It's always been there, genuinely hidden it makes you chuckle all the time when you're on a re-watch. which you should totally do, baby.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (9.5/10):\\n\r\nTalk about astonishing and consistency as a duo that never fall short to keep up the same pace, there hasn't been a single episode that lacked the same quality content, visually speaking. Probably because of how varying it was. Remember how the previous season had all of those \u201cdifferent\u201d episodes that tackle different themes, arching from sad to goofy, yes takes it to a whole other level that it also packs up its own unique art style and animation, I could have sworn some of the episodes was so freaking visually wondering that I would mistake them for a world-class piece of painting, baby.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10):\\n\r\nDisney, you should welcome a new competitor to your game, and yes, I'm talking about that legendary musical episode, how can an episode get even more divine each moment it continues until it gives you the south eargasm you've been leaning forward to but never expected to get in such a show? Leave it to Dandy I guess, baby.\\n\r\nSo glad they kept the opening and ending sequences from the past season, and even introduced episode specials when they had to, and they were just as good (exclusive to the ending by the way), baby.\\n\r\nI'm just going say, that, yeah, I'm making small paused, because, it's an important acknowledgment for me to make. Space Dandy has the best English dub I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. No, it's just, there is no contest, Space Cowboy held that title for so long it's time to let a new face sit on that thrown, baby.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10):\\n\r\nWho said a character had to have a complicated backstory to be up there with the big names? Just name it Dandy and there you go, you've just created an icon. But seriously, how can you hate on this refined legend?\\n\r\nDandy, the man that needs no introduction, with as much dandiness a man could ever ask for is finally getting some booty, or should I say almost, either way, it's for you to interpret, finally given some closure on why it's only him, what makes him so special, and it seems with that many episodes around him, you kind of get why, but not really, turned out there was a deeper sense behind him all along. Let's just say, he's that thing you never want to mess with or you'll end up messing up the whole universe, baby.\\n\r\nIt looked like QT and Meow got enough recognition from the first season as they had entire episodes centered around them, I wish there was more to uncover on them, but it was all dedicated for Dandy and his \u201cdevelopment\u201d, but you can always enjoy the goodness it gave us concerning Scarlet and Honey, even Dr. Gel had some great screening along with a specific character called Johhny who praise will require me to write a separate review on how cool a character he is, he didn't drop the line \u201chere comes Johnny\u201d for nothing, baby.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nIt takes a lot for me to let down from this perfect score, but considering the satisfaction, I got out of this show? If it can be converted to raw energy I'll be an oil mine to start world war 3, baby.\\n\r\nI loved the gags, the fourth wall breaking jokes slammed the walls harder than ever, and the characters and theme discussed were some of my favorites, it has everything from death, love, relationships... baby.\\n\r\nThis season had some of my all-time favorite episodes, along with the first season, of course, those were some of the most intense and genuin laughs I've ever got, baby.\\n\r\nBut that's not all of it, it really walks you through a lot of different scenarios, it shows you the man Dandy really is, how much mystery he held inside of him all along, it's so was beautiful it can inspire you to do things, baby.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9.6/10):\\n\r\nHonestly, even if I was trying not to recommend this series, this season, in particular, makes it a confirmed yes from me, I would probably go rewatch the first season just so I can rewatch this one alone, and when they say they don't come up with shows like these lately, they are not joking at the very least. But each one has their cup of tea I guess, I still get that people don't actually like this series at all for how blunt and goofy it is, but it's the premise all along, it's about the comedy primarily, and the hidden depth secondarily. and I learned that slowly as I've always wondered why was this season way more praised than the first one even those the latter was beautiful, but I guess it's up for the mood too to decide. At least for now, all I can see is, see you Space Dandy...",

I don't think there was a single episode here that I didn't love. As well as looking amazing (with hats off to all the guest animators the studio brought in), the second season also happened to be absolutely hilarious, emotional, and even managed to (kinda) explain the loose plot and continuity issues I previously had in the final episodes of the season.\r\nMy one complaint is that we didn't have any of the episodes focused around QT and Meow like there were inseason one - not a big problem, though, cause we got more Scarlet and Honey in exchange.\\n\r\nAlso, \"May be continued?\"?! What a tease to end the series on! I give that 9 Baccano's/10 for frustrating ways to make us crave more right at the end of a series! \\n\\n\r\nFavourite Episode: \"I Can't Be the Only One, Baby\" - I cried tears of laughter in this episode.

            "content": "Space Dandy is nuts. It's eccentricity shrouds the show's more deep and layered meaning which most viewers would honestly miss. I'd be lying if I didn't say the insane and trippy narratives of each episode didn't often go over my head as well. Generally, I understood the main thrust of each story and the feelings the evoke. However, when it comes to the more philosophical and existential concepts it would take someone far more studied than me to truly and fully appreciate it. Studio Bones (and of course Watanabe Shinichiro) does a magnificent job with the character designs and animation. The color pallet, expressiveness, andoccasional mixture of different art styles all blend together to create something wonderfully pleasing and unique in an ocean of samey looking anime. \\n\\n\r\nDespite it being about a group of Alien Bounty Hunters constantly looking for their next hit job. Space Dandy is really just a blank slate to test out a bunch of different ideas of multiple styles and genres. Space Dandy is anything but the same experience over and over again. As for it's consistency? Well your mileage may vary.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the first few episodes, there is no real big continuous plot and each episode starts independent of the rest, allowing the show to be enjoyed in any episode order. Starting from the ground up at the beginning of each episode ignores any life altering/universe changing event that may have happened previously, preventing the show from every feeling like progress is happening. Characters don't really get to grow and they're largely the same every episode but this is hardly an issue because the show never promised to go for a lengthy plot-driven narrative in the first place. The characters are largely driven by very simplistic goals (love, money, a care-free life), which allows whatever twisted scenarios for them to get caught up in to be the true main character of the show. Our heroes, if you even want to call them that, are pretty vain and how they get through, deal with, or fail each episode's weekly obstacle is the source of the show's fun. Dandy's persistence and insistence is admirable even if he gets in trouble for it. I found his struggles unrelatable but not unrealistic, where is how I relate to most of the characters and find it amusing that the show isn't eager to always let them win in the end.\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth the watch if anything just to see how far the lunacy can get dialed up. Any fans of Cowboy Bebop may not appreciate it's more cartoony turn. However, the show is very reminiscent of Bebop episodes that took a more bizarre wacky interpretation, but all the time.",
