            "content": "It's funny how trends, tastes, and even perceptions can change over time. Less than a decade ago being called a geek, nerd or otaku was considered an insult, and while those terms have maintained their derogatory status to a degree (especially in Japan), the steady march of technology has dictated the rise of the \"Beta Male\", and nowhere is this more apparent than in the entertainment industries.\r\nIn 2001 the PC and Dreamcast game Comic Party was adapted and released as an anime, and with it came the birth of a totally new genre - the otaku comedy. Since that time there have been numerous mangaand anime that have utilised the theme in some manner, from the romanticised look at otaku life that is Genshiken, to the insane classical stylings of Nodame Cantabile's heroine, Noda Megumi. These days the number of titles that have some involvement with the genre is on the rise, and while some take a decidedly rose-tinted view of the subject, there are others (NHK ni Youkoso!, Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu (no, seriously), Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd, etc), that allow glimpses into the darker side of otaku life.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also those that approach the subject of otaku in an imaginative, yet decidedly tongue-in-cheek manner.\\n\\n\r\nKami Nomi Zo Shiru Sekai (The World God Only Knows, or KamiNomi), tells the story of Katsuragi Keima, the \"king\" of bishoujo games (galge), and dating sims, who is better known throughout the internet as the \"Capturing God\". He is content to live his life in the virtual world because \"reality is just a crappy game\" where the girls are impossible to deal with. All of that changes when he answers a mysterious e-mail addressed to the God of Conquest (another one of his monikers), and subsequently meets the demon girl Elucia de Lut Ima (Elci).\\n\\n\r\nThe plot attempts to meld several different themes into one continuous narrative, and in order to do this it utilises a number of devices that can sometimes get in the way. Like Amagami SS, the storyline follows the \"short arc for each girl\" format, complete with the \"reset\" at the end. This is accompanied by some fairly typical \"soul possession\" concepts, basic yet still humourous slapstick, and a rather interesting take on dating sims in general.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately it doesn't completely work.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that while KamiNomi is essentially a straight forward otaku comedy, the inclusion of so many disparate themes eventually causes a degree of conflict within the framework of the story. The major issue is the idea that one can use dating sim methodology to form a real world relationship, and while it is possible to learn the basics, this can never replace actual experience. In addition to this is the fact that the viewer is supposed to believe that a notorious game addict like Keima can suddenly turn on the charm when dealing with real girls, many of whom he initially can't stand to be around, and this in itself raises the question of suspicion on the part of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nThere is an attempt to rectify these issues, but this relies on the tried and tested method of memory manipulation rather than an explanation of how a social recluse is easily able to communicate with others. That said, the series utilises some well placed visual gags to divert the viewers attention away from any plot holes or conflicts, and the story is interesting and humourous enough to make it accessible to a much broader audience than one might initially expect.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to looks, KamiNomi is pretty much back to basics in virtually every department, with one area of notable exception (we'll get to that in a moment). That said, while the degree of genericism in the visuals is high, there's also something slightly more subtle at work as well. The character designs are taken directly from the manga by Wakaki Tamiki, and what's interesting about this is that while the mangaka made a conscious effort to allow the comedy to flourish, he also tried to show what each character is, rather than simply trying to define them as individuals.\\n\\n\r\nConfused? I'll explain then.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is partly derived from that of the common or garden dating sim or galge, and as regular players of these games will know, characters of a specific type will share certain visual features. Wakaki has attempted to incorporate some of these into the design of the girls that Keima goes after, and this in turn defines their personalities as they have been created to fit a specific mould. In addition to this, because the player is usually faceless in these games, Wakaki chose to parody a few of the better known \"genius\" characters from anime for his \"God of Conquest\", in particular Lelouch vi Brittania and Yagami Light.\\n\\n\r\nSo don't be fooled by the simplistic looks.\\n\\n\r\nThe area that really stands out is the effects, in particular the variety, timing and imagination that has gone into making them. While the rest of the anime may look colourful yet average, KamiNomi is surprising for the quality of a number of its visual set pieces, but it's the audio choreography that changes those scenes from simply being pretty into something worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nIn anime, as in life, timing is everything, and in this respect Manglobe have a very good pedigree. But then what else would one expect from the studio that brought us Michiko to Hatchin, Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy (unfortunately they're also responsible for the abysmal Sacred Blacksmith, but we won't go there). While this is very clearly a comedy series the studio has made the effort to deliver a quality show, and because there's little that can be done about the design of the visuals, a lot of effort has gone into making this anime sound great.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening sequence is indicative of this ethos at work, and features some clever imagery that is well timed to match the changes in the theme song (God Only Knows, performed by Elisa). The ending sequence is a bit more complicated as there are actually four tracks and sequences on offer. The main ED, Koi no Shirushi, is a fairly average J-Pop track, but for the majority of episodes the female leads take turns singing it (while the rest perform backing vocals). As for the remaining tracks, Tatta Ichi Do no Kisei by Sakurai Tomo (episode four), along with the visuals, is meant to be a play on the average ending sequences of dating sims and galge. On the other hand Happy Crescent by Toyama Nao is supposed to be a \"live\" idol performance, so it's a shame it's such a generic song.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the best of the EDs, is the final one, Shuuseki Kairo no Yume Tabibito, which is sung in a completely amateurish and off key style by the lead man himself, Shimono Hiro (with support from the female seiyuu who apparently are collectively known as Oratorio The World God Only Knows), and is very much in keeping with the slightly delusional and slapstick comedy of the series.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately there's one big flaw in KamiNomi, and that's the lack of character development. Normally this shouldn't really be an issue for what is effectively an otaku comedy/parody, but because of the inclusion of certain plot themes, aspects like characterisation and growth become more prominent.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the more complicated a story is, the better the characters have to be.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there is some development due to the soul possession aspect of the story, it never really impacts on the overall narrative due to the \"reset\" at the end of each girl's arc. This has the effect of nullifying what has gone before, and even though Keima and Elci aren't subject to it as a rule, there is very little given over to their growth over the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe real strength of the characters comes from the comedy side of the show, and in this respect the seiyuu are pretty good. Shimono Hiro (Keima), and Itou Kanae (Elci), are great as the proverbial \"Odd Couple\", and while there are some great skits from the other leading ladies, their timing and delivery, especially with each other, is sometimes a joy to behold.\\n\\n\r\nKami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai is a strangely mixed bag that works on certain levels, but ultimately it would have been better off trying to weave fewer themes into the plot. Individually the concepts behind the series are imaginative and somewhat inventive, but the complications caused by trying to blend several ideas together sometimes creates a quagmire in the storyline, and inserting a joke to brush over it is nothing more than papering over the cracks. That said, the series is enjoyable enough to warrant at least one watch, and viewers should also keep in mind that this twelve episode anime is nothing more than a prelude of things to come, especially as the manga has already gone beyond the 100 chapter mark.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the incomplete nature of the story may put people off, the fact that a sequel is on the horizon may signify that all hope is not yet lost. Then again, they may simply \"cop out\" by ending the series before the real storyline begins.\\n\\n\r\nWe'll have to wait and see.\\n",

            "content": "\"Reality is a shit game!\"\r\n'Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai' ('The World Only God Knows') is about a self-claimed \"Otoshigami (Capture God)\" who can \"capture\" the heart of any 2D girls in dating-sim games. One day, he unknowingly signs a contract with a demon through email, and ends up in a quest to capture real-life (3D) girls in order to collect runaway souls residing within their hearts.\r\nThe first season of 'KamiNomi\" involves the capture of 4 girls, with 3 filler episodes.\r\nKatsuragi Keima is an interesting character. He's full of confidence in front of the PFP screen and calls himself \"Capture God\", backing up his claim withgodly galge gaming and analytical skills. What's more interesting is that he applies eroge logic and theory to real life, disapproving people, objects, and events in reality as having \"unrealistic settings\". Keima is a reluctant hero in this show as he's only interested in 2D girls, and he received very little character development, but that's just fine because it shows how dedicated he is to gaming, and his \"modern samurai\" way of life. Filler ep-4 was a great display of his game philosophy and dedication.\\n\\n\r\nElsea is a demon who looks and behaves like a typical clumsy 2D girl. Her character development was very poor despite having a filler ep-8. Her very existence and costume/accessories is probably more suitable for 'Soul Eater' series, but her character is one of the best eye candy ever, and she's a package that makes the absurd premise possible.\\n\\n\r\nTakahara Ayumi was the first target, a Sporty Cool. She was given only a single episode, but served well as an introduction to the premise.\\n\\n\r\nAoyama Mio is next, a Tsundere Princess. She seemed like an common archetype at first, but our Capture God finds out that she was no longer what she claimed to be. Her arc was an introduction to Keima's standard gaming strategy: Encounter, creating chances to meet often, formation of negative impression, and turning the negative impression into positive impression.\\n\\n\r\nThen comes Nakagawa Kanon, a Yandere Idol. Her insecurity as a solo performer leads to unhealthy obsession with Keima because he shows zero interest in her. Her arc was rather draggy, but features quite a bit of insert songs and slapstick comedy.\\n\\n\r\nBest was saved for the last with Shiomiya Shiori, an introvert librarian. The story's pace suddenly slowed for her arc, which turned from a slapstick-heavy comedy to serious artsy anime. Her character made this a very interesting arc. We as viewers can hear her \"speech in the mind\", but Keima who's used to be in our position suddenly realizes the difficulty in her capture because he had to work to draw out the inner voice. Shiori's character development was done very well with her gradual curiosity in the trouble maker at the library, and Capture God's eventual understanding of his target. It is extremely difficult to make slow, mesmerizing pace work, but the amazing direction and production had done just that. The atmosphere in the library and art house camera movement / perspectives were phenomenal, and painted a world of its own.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode was a filler. While it was somewhat corny, it further establishes the protagonist's character and devotion to video games, and the pure absurdity of it was hilarious. The near-full use of 8-plus-minute oratorio also featured as OP was a nice touch that intensified drama. It also ended with a cliffhanger by introducing a new girl demon character, and hinting a sequel season.\\n\\n\r\nComedy was quite inconsistent. Sometimes intelligent, such as stating 3D girls' flaws with 2D logic, parodies, and God's Teachings. Other times, it's plain stupid, like Elsea tripping randomly.\\n\r\nOverall, the story and characters are very interesting, but as a fantasy comedy, it's filled with improbable situations, gimmicky story developments (like requiring the target to fall in love, girls losing memory after Capture), and the inevitable corniness that comes with it. Character development for all the heroines were done in a frantic speed as an arc-format anime, but every one of them were more than the typical 2D heroines thanks to numerous plot twists, and they were captured in unconventional methods that never gets tiring.\\n\r\nIt is apparent that the ending was produced with another season in mind. In fact, at least 24 episodes may have been decided from the start, so it may still be a bit too early to judge its story and character development just yet.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe OP in 'KamiNomi' can only be described as a \"Masterpiece\". The animation quality, atmosphere, song quality, song choice, originality, transition flow, audio-visual harmony, appropriateness, effectiveness as OP, wow-factor... I would rate 10/10 for every aspect of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this series is generic anime style drawn to perfection. Unique design for the protagonist, and Elsea must be the cutest anime girl ever. The supporting characters are generic but easily distinguishable designs, this works to support the plots where Keima predicts girls' personality based on appearance. Dynamic movements, funny chibi-forms, artistic representations, and great use of CG. The presentation was done exceptionally well with bunch of creative cuts, background effects for comedy and mood setting. Above all, the amount of detail is staggering, with the sheer number of objects in the background, books with pages of real texts, reflections on various surfaces, and attention to imperfections and stains on walls and floors. Characters also have up to 3 degrees of shading versus the typical 2. Despite the generic style, art work in this series is so outstanding that it can no longer be considered ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu cast was excellent. The protagonist's voice had a wide range, from the absolute confidence while talking about eroge theories to humorous screams. Everyone else also sounded like they should, full of emotions.\\n\r\nBGM was really sophisticated and lively, complementing the story by enhancing the atmosphere of every scene. Different sets of BGM were used for each arc.\\n\r\nKanon's insert songs were incredibly well done. Yes, they're moe pop songs, but the level of production was so high that it's hard to believe they were written solely for anime inserts.\\n\r\nRegular ED is a light pop song in good contrast with OP accompanied by a creative theme.\\n\\n\r\n'KamiNomi' had a fantastic pacing and offers comedy, drama, and emotional attachment. All of it was backed by a masterful presentation that was incredible to the point of over-production. Despite its inherent corniness, I found this show to be extremely enjoyable. It is the series with a sense of highest degree of completion among all series I've seen so far. In fact, the production value in this series rivals that of theatrical anime movies.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the way they presented the empty feeling you get after the girls forget Keima's involvement after the kisses. It must be devastating to be the only one having the memory of their time together even if he wasn't interested in 3D girls. Nevertheless, our samurai hero will stand strong and keep the memories of \"The World God Only Knows\" in his heart as he continues on to fulfill his mission of capturing girls' hearts in the second season. I will definitely be there to hear the demon's \"dorodorodoro\" detection of another wandering soul and witness the Capture God`s miracles.\\n",

            "content": "So, this is my first Review on my favorite manga and anime, KamiNomi!\r\nI'll try to keep it short and clean c:\r\n-Story & Overall-\r\nWhat I would like to announce, this is not your regular average harem anime. It has a good plot and idea to it, actually and it does make sense in the world it was created into!\r\nThe way that the main character has to wear consequences and plan out his actions is just entertaining (as are the dialogs) and it definitely made me sit down and read/ watch.\r\nKamiNomi does not try to be more than what it is and keeps going at it's ownpace, always introducing different situations and new challenges the main characters have to face.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\r\nWell, it is drawn by none other than Watanabe Akio - the designs, actually. If you watched and are fan of the Bakemono/Nisemono series, you already noticed this.\\n\r\nIt really depends on the taste, though - I enjoyed watching the Art style for KamiNomi, however being a great SHAFT studio fan, I would have preferred (and as with many other shows I enjoy) if they had put in more visual effects like turning around and basically what Shaft does... *trails off*\\n\\n\r\nThe uniform designs are unique as hell - I seriously haven't seen anything like those before and it makes me want to wear them as well~!\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nMusic wise, can I say that the Openings are epic? Have you seen an anime with Orchestra music yet? I mean really? \\n\r\nWhenever I listen to it, I feel like I am going to watch some church/Religion anime -- But the fact is, the music is heavenly. That s the only way to describe it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Character-\\n\r\nOh the characters...\\n\r\nWe have two main ones, Elsie and Keima.\\n\\n\r\nKeima, your average gamer boy who hates reality to it's last bits. His character is simple - in a way, yet very well handled and developed to make the series to what it originally is. He is a very likeable character (not like some douches from other harem animes *cough*Makoto*cough cough*)\\n\\n\r\nElsie, your kind demon who comes from Hell and guides Keima to fulfill their mission! (Not spoiling much)\\n\r\nVery naive and innocent, Elsie is seen to be closed into people's heart quite easily. She is silly and her obsession with trains-- \\n\\n\r\nScratch that, those were fire trucks, I'm sorry! \\n\r\nA big thank you Zaraquiel99 for pointing that out!\\n\\n\r\n-- is just so out of nowhere, it is almost creative. I never saw a character with such interest, really now.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is not shunned or put into a corner either - they each have their own backstory, flaws and emotions, giving us a deeper, in-depth look to them and not being handled as some harem-element.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nI see quite a lot of people who enjoy and like KamiNomi.\\n\r\nI even buy the volumes that I can get my hands on - it is the most bought manga I have in my room, which consist of 5 vols already. \\n\r\nI really do want to support Tamaki and his work, so I do not regret spending my money on this manga. At all.\\n\\n\r\nHe deserves it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\nAnd that was my short review~ I hope I could convince you at some point... ; - ;\\n\r\nPlease just give it a try at least! >/////",

            "content": "Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai, The World God Only Knows, is an anime that centers on an otaku gamer's life. When I first found this series, I researched on it a bit on Wikipedia, found it somewhat unimpressive in plot, character and art, and didn't even bother reading the manga. I have to say that I was wrong to judge this series by merely the front cover of its Wikipedia article. After the anime came out and my anime savvy friend directly recommended this to me, I found that I was drawn into the story, something that rarely happens for an ardent critic like me.This anime aims to set a standard for humor and adventure, and I believe that it achieves both.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\r\nThe art is great. Although I've seen better and more creatively drawn animes, with regard to the context of this anime, the art is drawn very appropriately. For example, during the comedy scenes, the art is drawn chibi but with some elements that further resonates the humor, whether it be a small action or item in the background. The art never hinders your enjoyment of this anime and even improves the experiences with elegantly drawn characters like Elsie. \\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10)\\n\r\nThe World God Only Knows is about the life of a 2-D \"Game God\" Keima. He is known throughout the web as the conqueror of all visual novel, bishoujo games. One day he unknowingly signs a contract with the devil, mistakenly taking the contract as a challenge to his Otaku God position, to help a demon girl Elsie collect escaped souls from hell that hide within the empty space in girls' hearts. Should he not comply with the contract, both he and Elsie will lose their heads. Literally.To exorcist the evil soul, he must make the girl fall in love with him and kiss him. The only problem is that everyone in real life calls him an otaku and avoids him for his addiction to 2-D girls and games. This story incorporates comedy right into the base and still embodies an objective to be achieved throughout the course of the series... all while giving the viewers some LOLs in the process.  \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nAlthough I do not usually comment on the sounds, I did notice that certain things were outstanding. This anime does not have a particularly \"addictive\" opening and ending theme, but it has creativeness that far surpasses some addictive-themed animes. In episode 4, there is an extra opening and ending that really personifies the storyline and shows diligent planning that went along with it. This ability to creatively adapt to the content of each episode with compatible musical compositions  is what really separates this anime from others and also earns the music producers some well-deserved kudos.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are exemplary. Keima, especially, was someone who really stood out from the mundane, long list of modern anime characters. Although he doesn't embody the cold, taciturn personality that I usually look for in male protagonists, he is clearly distant from the level of backboneless \"male\" (sometimes I really do question their gender) protagonists that get beat around by the females. What I like most about Keima is that he establishes his ideals and is determined to do what he believes in. He overcomes many embarrassments and obstacles and always seems to plan for the worst (I hope some people in real life would learn that). Other times his dedicated assertions, like \"Life is just a crappy video game\" and \"Real life girls suck. 2-D girls are better\", were really similar to mine and gave me some lulz. As someone who likes to relate to male protagonists, I really felt that I could connect with Keima and understand his ideals - part of the reason why this anime drew my attention. Elsie, the pretty female protagonist, was also a very likable character. She embodies the \"kawaaiii\" personally and really tries her best to help Keima (despite the fact that some efforts have opposite effects). She is never arrogant or unpleasant and always tries to care for Keima to act like his \"little sister\" (although there definitely are some love feelings between them). \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nThe World God Only Knows is a great anime overall. It combines humor and adventure successfully into a masterpiece that many previous animes have tried and failed to attain. For someone who had such cynical and critical attitudes before watching, it took only 10 minutes of the first episode to turn me and my ideals 180 degrees into zealous enjoyment. If you're looking for a funny anime that still has a good story played out by likable characters, The World God Only Knows is definitely an anime that you should put on your list.",

There isn't a single reason I can see to that after watching The World God Only Knows 12 episodes (being painfully tortured by the last 5 episodes).\r\nIt's cliche after cliche every single episode. It's true that they tried to cover it up, by coming up with the whole \"I don't get in touch with real girls because the games girls are so much better but I'll use my gaming skills to stereotype girls and it'll work out\" stuff, but while it worked well on the first episode, it gotboring right after it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is really lame. Like, totally lame. Lamest of lamest. The guy is a master on finishing dating games with the heroine. He then, receives a \"challenge\" asking if he really can capture every girl and accepts it. The thing is that the challenge was about real girls, who are possessed by loose souls and to free those souls he has to make them fall in love with him and have a \"happy ending\" with them.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls with whom Keima ends up on each arc are painfully dull. They act exactly as you'd expect from them. No surprises at all. It's like they're actually following a book for cliche girl characters on animes. The hyperactive-strong-tempered girl, the high-and-mighty-tsundere, the popular girl who fears being alone and the freaking annoying silent and shy librarian (god, how I wanted to shoot my screen while she went on about books! The hell was that, some sort of \"go read a book\" brainwashing?) I'm not gonna even bother mentioning Elsea cuz she's just there to add another boring character to the whole set.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack felt out of place during the whole anime! Epic songs, characters suddenly singing, seriously, why? The art was nothing more than you could expect from a harem anime. Even this aspect feels like a cliche.\\n\\n\r\nI was able to enjoy myself a lot in the first episode, and a little bit up to episode 6 or 7. After this, god knows where I gathered strength to watch it till the end.\\n\\n\r\nI really can't understand all the hype behind this anime. There isn't a single trace of originality nor attempt of seeking it. I wasn't this dissatisfied after watching an anime since Shuffle!",

            "content": "TWOGK's a really good cheeseburger anime.  I mean that in the sense that you know it's not necessarily \"deep\" or particularly \"meaningful\", but it makes you happy and satisfied when you watch it.  Hell, it's junk food, but it's damn good junk food.\r\nTWGOK basically runs like a dating sim game, with a new girl basically every chapter/episode.  Even though it's kind of silly, and it's somewhat harem (not in the annoying way, because the girls forget him after he captures them, so there isn't this whole cat-fight thing), but it's fun and interesting, and very pleasing to watch.  It doesn't reallyhave a message, or even a great storyline, but the romance is cheesy and satisfying-- you know he gets the girl in the end, and it's fun to watch him do it, gal-game style.\\n\\n\r\nI've been following the manga for a while now, and I've been really really looking forward to the anime adaptation, and this first episode really was everything I expected, and more.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the anime is pretty high quality, I think.  It's no Advent Children, or even 50cm a second, but it's detailed, pretty and appropriate-- the whole anime basically runs like the CG captures that you \"Get!\" in dating sim games (if you don't play, you have no idea what I'm talking about, but it's just pretty good/sharp art in general). \\n\\n\r\nThe voicing/sound/music is also really good.  The music that's played when Keima does his \"I see it-- the endinguuu~~!\" is pretty epic.  The music is sharp, and the anime has this weird techie/computer/DIGITARUUU feel to it-- pretty neat.  \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I give this anime pretty average scores in storyline and character, but this anime is just fun and enjoyable to watch-- so it's a 9 :D\\n\\n",

            "content": "Expected a twist on harem anime, but was disappointed by how boring and silly it became. Not even funny enough to tolerate.\r\n\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\r\nWhy do I keep being surprised when MyAnimeList gives me another shit recommendation? I saw the 8\u2019s and 9\u2019s (even some 10\u2019s); I saw the 5-stars; and I read the reviews telling me it was funny\u2014that it\u2019s not your typical harem show.\r\nI love a good story that parodies, deconstructs, or puts a twist on clich\u00e9s. And this show sort of, kinda does that? But not really because so much of it falls flat. The premise is actually much better suited for a more seriousstory.\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts funny so I had hopes. I expected to get funnier and wittier, but it actually got more and more dull. It became tedious after halfway through. When a show gets boring I switch over to the dub because I can\u2019t stand being forced to read subtitles for a shit show. It\u2019s a chore. The dub actually made it funnier and more bearable.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has a different girl every few episodes for our main guy to seduce, but the girls are so one-dimensional. It makes no sense when the show\u2019s premise is supposed to be an attack on clich\u00e9s. The girls are supposed to represent typical female archetypes in dating sims, but there weren\u2019t any twists or anything unexpected about them. It was played straight.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character doesn\u2019t even seduce them in a clever or interesting way either. It just happens without any real struggle or conflict so you\u2019re left with the girls\u2019 stories to support the plotting.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character I liked was Elsie, the female sidekick. She was ditzy, funny, and made the show tolerable. She carried half the show for me. Elsie actually cared about the demon contract. She cared about trying to seduce the girls (because her life depended on it).\\n\\n\r\nI wished for a lot more of her because the main character was so uninteresting. I couldn\u2019t relate to him. He was bland and just didn\u2019t seem to care that if he didn\u2019t fulfill his demonic contract he\u2019d die.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise deserved a better story than this. Here\u2019s how it could\u2019ve been much more engaging.\\n\\n\r\n- Take it more seriously.\\n\r\n- Should\u2019ve been a character drama that focused on his growth as a person.\\n\r\n- He\u2019d mature, realizing he shouldn\u2019t have such an unhealthy obsession over dating simulators.\\n\r\n- He\u2019d be forced to interact with real women and find out that real human interaction is far more difficult than a video game.\\n\r\n- You\u2019d see him struggle, you\u2019d see him learn, and you\u2019d see him develop.\\n\r\n- It can still be funny. The 40-Year Old Virgin is somewhat like this. It still had great characters and a character arc while remaining funny.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to bother with season 2. The show was amusing (at first), but it\u2019s not worth sitting through 12 episodes for.",

            "content": "Hello everyone! My name is Austin & I will be doing my FIRST ever review!\r\nAs a big fan of romantic comedies, I fully enjoyed watching this anime & its sequels. \r\n[SUMMARY]\r\nThe story is about a high school boy who is completely obsessed with dating sims & therefore is known as the \"God of Conquest\". Due to his legendary gaming skills, he received a mysterious email asking for his help in conquering girls. Little did he know the message was pertaining to conquering real life girls & that the sender was from a cute demon girl by the name of Elsie. From that point on, hewas obligated (by life) to helping Elsie find & capture loss souls hidden inside these girls.\\n\\n\r\n[STORY] - 10\\n\r\nWhen it comes to RomComs, it's pretty hard for me not to give a high rating due to my love for them. The unique plot of a boy using his gaming skills to make cute girls fall in love with him is something completely unique. This story line probably would come off as very appealing to those who think video games can't help you in life. Each girl he conquers has a very unique & different personality than the rest, which gives new & exciting elements to each episode. So overall, even if I wasn't a RomCom fan, I'd still give this series a very high rating.\\n\\n\r\n[ART] - 9\\n\r\nThe art style of the anime is pretty much the same as many other animes, but that doesn't mean I don't like it. I'll admit, there are not many elements of the artwork that are different from other animes. But then again, sometimes its the best to stick with what's hot. None of the artwork is sloppy & is very well drawn out, so I will give the artwork a 9.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND] - 8\\n\r\nWhen it comes to sound, most animes in my opinion sound very similar, yet good (just like the artwork). The voice actors, though, do a very good job at making the right sound & tone depending on the situation. The intro & outro song are also pretty good, but not so good that I'd put it on my favorite songs list. Overall, voice acting & music is good, but not so different from the rest (which isn't bad).\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER] - 10\\n\r\nLike I said in the story rating, all the characters are EXTREMELY unique. \\n\r\n> Keima - The way he talks sounds very indifferent. Also, even for a person who doesn't socialize very much, he is a very, very smooth talker & acts very cool in a way you wouldn't expect for such an anti-social guy\\n\r\n> Elsie - She is probably one of the most energetic & happy people I've seen in an anime. Always trying to please people & making cute remarks, it's hard not to like her.\\n\r\n> Conquered Girls - Each one has a different attitude, style, & appearance which can appeal to a wide variety of people. Because of these unique aspects, it keeps the story very interesting & makes sure the viewer can't predict what will happen. But due to the fact many of these girls are very lovable, it makes you want to root for one of them but then you realize in the end Keima most likely won't end up with that particular character. \\n\r\n> To sum it up, character design is very unique & appealing to the viewers, including myself.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT] - 10\\n\r\nNot much to say, but the fact that I did & still am enjoying this anime. If you have read my ratings on each topic, then you'll probably know why. But because anime enjoyment varies depending on the person, you'll never truly know how much you'll like it until you try it!\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL] - 10\\n\r\nAs my first review, I decided to skip this since I'm not exactly sure what I should put here.\\n\\n\r\nTHANK YOU for reading my first review if you read it & I promise I will improve my writing & reviewing.\\n\\n\r\n- Austin\\n\\n\r\nPS: I did this at 2 AM",

            "content": "The World God Only Knows, basically, is the world that only Keima knows. Even I, have no idea, what kind of delusion this man is living in, but it sure as hell is pretty funny. The best way to sum up this anime is - a touching, smart and nonsensical comedy, that leaves you feeling happy at the end of it.\r\nTL:DR\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nSound: 7/10\r\nCharacter: 7/10\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\r\nOverall: 7/10 (rounded up from 6.75)\r\nGood Points:\r\n+ Superb comic relief and funny scenes\r\n+ Interesting male lead\r\n+ Cute and irresistible female lead\r\n+ Good emotional / touching scenes\r\n+ Not overboard with the ecchi/harem theme\r\n+ Character growth in the four \"targets\" (Ayumi, Mio,Kanon, Shiori)\\n\r\n+ Great background art and music\\n\\n\r\nBad Points:\\n\r\n- Lack of character development and growth in the main cast\\n\r\n- Some lack of coherence in the later plot arcs\\n\r\n- Lack of overarching plot, or conflict\\n\r\n- Plot is straightforward and generally predictable\\n\r\n- At least 2 filler episodes (in a 12 episode anime? Yep, you bet'cha)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has four main story arcs, namely, the Ayumi arc, the Mio arc, the Kanon arc and the final Shiori arc. All of the arcs are distinct and special, even though the main idea of the anime - to make girls fall in love with Keima, by solving some life problem that they have - is remains consistent throughout. There is another side arc - the one about Sora arc in episode 4 but that only lasts one episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe Ayumi arc was, I have to say this, both funny and touching. I didn't expect much from this anime because it had so much to do with dating sims and the classic \"make a girl fall in love with you\" theme, that I thought it'd be completely unrealistic and stupid. Except that it wasn't. While it was nonsensical at times for the comic relief - most parts did seem realistic - and the way that Keima found out about Ayumi's \"fear\" and \"hesitation\", and the words that he used to move her heart, proved to be a bit of a plot twist in the first arc, and that was what made me continue watching this anime, despite it being a really \"uninteresting\" idea in my opinion. (+1 for coherence)\\n\\n\r\nThe Mio arc completely added onto the comic element of this anime, although it didn't add alot of depth. Mio was the typical tsundere, and it was easy to see how Keima would \"conquer her\", by simply doing transport service for her day after day until her heart softened and he could finally come to terms to talk - and dance - with her, under a romantic moonlit sky (oh the convenience). To be fair though, at this point the anime starts to lose a bit of coherence - especially the chauffeur who was following Mio around for no apparent reason. If her dad passed away just a day ago or something, I might understand, but the chauffeur was likely unemployed for quite sometime already, Mio couldn't possibly have been paying him.\\n\\n\r\nThen comes the Kanon arc where things start to make less and less sense. Kanon is somehow able to hold a rooftop concert everyday in school, without ever contacting any logistics personnel, no sound crew, no light crew, nothing. Just her and a stage, and somehow all the music and lights come on and things start playing - that's an absolute no go. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, so the idea that she turns \"invisible\" is linked to her characterization as feeling \"invisible\" all the time. I get it, but then why is it that she randomly turns from \"invisible\" to slightly translucent, so often? Is there a rule saying that you need to look harder or closer enough for her to be visible? Does she randomly vary between degrees of invisibility? Because she isn't completely invisible, she should be able to be seen based on the distortions of the background, and if she IS completely invisible, Keima shouldn't EVER be able to see her.\\n\\n\r\nNext, Kanon carries these stun guns that are completely for comic effect. Sure thing. But again - this made no sense, and she seems to have carried these guns for absolute fun and only ever uses them on Keima. I know it's for comic relief - but still - at least humour me by explaining it in a funny way, it was never really mentioned at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe Kanon arc was slightly deeper in nature though, than the previous two. The idea of an idol who feels lonely despite having so many fans - this is a real phenomena that felt completely natural. The way Keima realizes this is not very \"fascinating\", but the anime really put quite a lot of thought into developing the plot around Kanon - from all her fansign events, to her dramas, to her voice-acting schedules, as well as to her actual concerts. It felt like there was a deeper meaning behind just \"making Kanon fall in love with Keima\" it moved on to \"making Kanon believe in herself\" - especially when rejecting the kiss from Kanon - even though he still got it at the end, though. (+1 for depth)\\n\\n\r\nThe Shiori arc, the final arc as well, was slightly convoluted, but was I thought, the most interesting of all the arcs. A girl who doesn't talk at all, how the heck do you communicate with someone like that? While Keima's method - pissing her off, essentially - wasn't completely revolutionary, it was also mixed in with being sensitive, and understanding the shy girl under the pile of books. The deeper meaning is trying to understand the thoughts behind people's faces, even if they don't talk - it's possible to feel, to get a sensing of what the person behind the mask is thinking - by simply judging their actions and the way they act. (+1 for interest, +1 for depth)\\n\\n\r\nI can't say that any part of this arc is coherent though - from locking down an entire library that happens to have only 1 entrance, to drilling a hole through the roof, to the sheer scale of the library in comparison to the number of people inside it at any one particular time, why Shiori doesn't carry around a notebook with her to write down what she is trying to communicate - so I can't give it any points for that. Also, the resolution of the arc wasn't very substantial - all Keima really did was accompany her, then kiss her, and that should creep Shiori out, honestly, rather than make her fall in love with him - it was all too sudden and unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nThen we finally come to talk about the side arc - Sora's arc, about a buggy game tha Keima must, absolutely must, complete. No matter how many bugs there are in the game - Keima persists in completing it because it's not Sora's fault that the game she's stuck in sucks so bad that everyone else gave up on it. While it may merely just be a characterisation arc - the plot itself is interesting enough - when things seem impossible, will you try every possible way - until you beat it or you realize it really is impossible? Coherence is slightly out of the window - and Keima is honestly wasting his time on some stupid game - but that's how life is - we have options as choices, though not very clear-cut, the decisions we make determine our \"route\", and perhaps, just perhaps, there's always a way \"out\" of our problems, a way to reach our goals, if only we have the perseverance to try and try again. (+1 for depth)'\\n\\n\r\nAnd so to sum up, the story does have an overarching plot, but it is hardly developed. Elsie ends up catching 4 runaway spirits - but progress is unknown, and we're not sure how many more Keima must complete until he's finally free of the death collar. The plot itself though, if you look at it from a deeper perspective, is quite deep, though it fails on both coherence and level of interest - plot is generally predictable and not very ingenious.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Scene 0/2 - Nothing too exciting, but covers most of the characters\\n\r\nED Scene 2/2 - Interesting use of the paint to form a colourful picture of Keima\\n\r\nAnimation 3/3 - Absolutely love the cute animations used throughout the anime\\n\r\nAesthetics 3/3 - I really like the cute theme that the use, as well as all the bubbles and all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Theme 0/3 - Didn't like the OP theme at all, it's in poor english and wasn't catchy.\\n\r\nED Theme 3/3 - Absolutely loved the ED theme - it was happy, uplifting and catchy\\n\r\nBackground Music 2/2 - Some parts were annoying and repetitive, but mostly well done\\n\r\nAdditional themes 2/2 - Definitely enjoyed the Kanon arc's theme songs. Although they were cliche idol songs, they were great to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization is definitely pretty good in this anime - since it's quite character-centric. We'll start with the two main characters - Keima and Elsie.\\n\\n\r\nKeima is not your average hikkikomori/otaku character. Everyone treats him like a loser - and he kinda is a loser for excelling only in dating sims - but he's actually pretty smart, he's logical, he's also a thinker and there is a lot more to his moral / emotional side than just his cold exterior. His multi-faceted nature is what I really like about him. He tries to look cool, but he constantly loses it when Elsie drives him crazy. He doesn't have much of a back story though, and honestly shows very little growth throughout the anime - except from the fact that he accepts the fact that he can conquer real life girls as well as those in games. Keima doesn't come to any self-realization in this first season of the anime. (+1 for interesting, +1 for depth)\\n\\n\r\nElsie is your average, typical, hyperactive cute girl who does anything to make Keima happy. She puts in lots of effort - cleaning the house, making breakfast, even making a cake (lol) - not trying to win Keima's favour because she likes him or anything, but simply because she wants to be a good little sister to him (imouto). She's completely, cute innocent and irresistible. However, as a character, she doesn't have much depth to her at all. She doesn't show much growth - and we don't know much about her backstory - other than that she has an older sister who is WAAAY better than her.\\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters are not the focal point though, the girls in the arcs are. Ayumi, starts off as a girl who really wants to win in the track and field meet - and turns out to doubt herself, and her own ability to run. She hates Keima because he's a loser, and feels embarrassed whenever Keima puts up banners to support her. She feels like he is mocking her, but in the end, Keima shows that he understands her more than anyone else - and he shows legitimate care for her by buying her hampers and a pair of running shoes. (+1 for growth)\\n\\n\r\nMio Aoyama, at first pulling of the rich lady feel - suddenly turns around to actually being a poor girl living a rich lifestyle (in a shoddy apartment). She gets abandoned by her chauffeur, ends up having to use Keima Transport Services, and eventually picks up the will to use small change when buying things. Unfortunately, none of these changes/ character development is substantial enough to warrant any points - they are all very trivial and minor in nature. Her backstory, is also underdeveloped. We know that her father died and she isn't rich anymore, and that she enjoyed her time with her father, but her father didn't seem to teach her much, and we don't know exactly how she lived in the past when her father was around either, we can only assume she lived like a princess (in which case, wouldn't her mum start educating her that she can't live that way anymore?).\\n\\n\r\nKanon, the idol and rising star, who is only 16 years old, but probably is one of the best and youngest idols ever known, still struggles with identity and confidence issues ever since her earlier girl group - Citron - broke up (for very lame reasons, actually). Her character development and depth has got to be the most out of all the arcs - because her backstory is much more comprehensive and rich. It's not just random flashbacks like the previous few arcs - it's relationships that come back to find her as well - her former bandmates sent her flowers to congratulate her on performing on the stage, Citron always wanted to perform. Also, much character growth from always being unconfident - to having new found confidence in herself. (+1 for depth, +1 for growth)\\n\\n\r\nThen lastly, we have Shiori, who is the quiet, shy girl who is really, really hard to understand. They did spend a lot of time trying to develop her character though - there were many, many scenes of her and her past encounters with books and the library in general. It was basically her monologue-ing to herself about how she loves books, about why she loves books and why she can't live without books. What a bookworm. The growth she shows is quite apparent - she moves from being a shy, untalkative, loner, to becoming slightly more assertive, and more able to communicate with others. Still, her backstory is vague and unconvincing, and as a character, she's naive and uninteresting, given the number of books she has read - she must have learnt something from those books, but it looks like her maturity of thinking is nowhere near \"developed\" in anyway. (+1 for growth)\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, the character growth that is lacking in the main characters, are found in the supporting characters - but hopefully, the main characters get more character development in the coming few seasons. Also, most of the characters are rather \"cliched\" except for the main character, but it is likely that they are meant to be this way - following the dating sim idea. Character interactions though, are definitely solid. Though they may be very exaggerated, it was always enjoyable how the two main cast, and their \"mother\" clicked together. (+1 for interaction)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the most funniest animes I've watched. I couldn't stop laughing from episode 1-4, and those were definitely enjoyable. The comic element died down slightly from then on, but there were always so many absurd and nonsensical situations and really funny reactions between Keima and Elsie and their mother, that it definitely made for a very enjoyable watch. (+3 for comedy) \\n\\n\r\nInitially, I was pretty interested and excited to find out how Keima would convince / smooth talk / strategize to win over the girls he encountered, namely because of the first arc. But this excitement died down over time - and I found myself simply watching for the comic element, and nothing much else. It seemed like it was already a given that Keima would be successful in capturing all the girls that he was tasked to - and there were little problems / conflict doing so, so after the first two arcs, things became a lot less interesting. But, I did feel that all the kissing scenes involving Keima were all touching in their own special way, so  I thought that the anime played those out pretty well.\\n\r\n(+1 for excitement, +1 for emotion)\\n\\n\r\nPacing was definitely okay, although I thought that the first arc could be extended. If only the first episode could have been 45 mins or so - that would have been better than the very abridged first Ayumi arc that we had. The emotional bits were well emphasized, although I thought that for the final arc, the book scenes were abit too overwhelming. By the first series of Shiori flashbacks of her reading books - I basically got the gist of it \"she's a bookworm, I get it already! Can we move on now?\" (+2 for pacing)\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I have to give a miss for 1 point for the filler episode that is basically episode 8, and arguably, episodes 4 and 12, because all of these advanced the plot line in no reasonable way or fashion, and seemed completely out of the blue.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.75/10",

            "content": "This show is a really good one that has alot of rewatch value. Im still watching it but im in the middle, close to the end of the 3rd Season so its enough to give you a review especially since i cant spoil the ending of the last season, however at the end of the first and second seasons they let you know a following season is in the works, so i dont know if a 4th season is coming or not but it would be great if it was!\r\nSo this anime is based on the main character who is Keima Katsuragi. He is basicallythe Otaku of Video games, but the video games are only dating sims and Nothing Else! Hes a master at this genre of games.\\n\\n\r\nHe basically shut himself from the \"Real World\" but to understand what i mean by that you gotta watch it :P\\n\\n\r\nKeima....or Katsuragi as they call him, is a student who gets straight A's, so he plays his dating sim games during class and he gives no f***s,  and this pisses off his teachers, but he has his smarts to back him up.  Boss Level: ITS OVER 9000-\\n\\n\r\nOk lol, So one day hes playing his PFP (Shows version for a PSP) and he gets this message that gives him a contract and he accepted it. However this wasnt just an in game contract. \\n\\n\r\nAnd after this, a demon named Elsie: The cute girl with the skull shaped thing on her head, tells him the contract was to help her collect \"Loose Souls\" that have escaped from the depths of hell. These loose souls are located within various girls and in order to get rid of the souls he has to make those girls fall in love with him. \\n\\n\r\nHe does this one by one so it isnt a swarm type of harem and the love doesnt feel forced which is why i like it. Oh and if he doesnt do it both him and Elsie would die because when he accepted the contract, an explosive collar got attached to both of their necks. \\n\\n\r\nSo the story starts off with them both working together to capture these loose souls. Its pretty much like this in all the seasons so far but the 3rd season is a little different. And the information in this review is based on what i remember from the first season, and all of this happens in the first episode. The really good stuff starts during the episodes so i HIGHLY guarantee you to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nSounds like a boring review? Thats because i havent spoiled that much. The show is awesome and really funny so i guarantee you watch it. :)\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "Manga adaptations are, by and large, a double-edged sword.  On one hand they can be a guaranteed-profit venture for the production company, while on the other it can be incredibly difficult to capture the charm of the original work and can often leave us fans bitterly disappointed.  Being an avid fan of the original manga, it is needless to say that I expected a lot from the anime adaptation of The World God Only Knows (or TWGOK).  Unfortunately, it joins the long list of manga-turned-anime that have fallen just short.\r\nThe plot centres around Katsuragi Keima, known on the internet as the \u201cCapturingGod\u201d of galges (dating sims), who has no interest in the real world.  But this all changes when he accidently signs a contract with Hell, meaning he has to go around catching runaway spirits with the (admittedly cute) demon-in-training, Elsie.  These spirits hide inside the hearts of real girls and it is up to Keima to \u201ccapture\u201d their hearts and drive out these spirits.\\n\\n\r\nThe story overall is refreshing and unique.  Some of the situations that Keima and Elsie get into are genuinely hilarious, as are all the parodies of eroge stereotypes.  It is also quite faithful to the original manga.  However, it suffers from a major setback, and that is the short 12-episode container.\\n\\n\r\nYes, it has been confirmed that there will be a second season starting April 2011, but where does this leave the first season?  All in all it is an entertaining watch, but it\u2019s hard to look past the fact that by itself it is just a series of random \"captures\" with little-to-no plot development bar the first episode.  Some of the arcs seem unnecessarily dragged out, making the pacing a bit awkward.  Furthermore, Manglobe insisted on throwing filler episodes into the mix which completely bewildered me.  While it\u2019s true that these fillers (or breaks, or whatever you want to call them) are present in the original manga, in the anime they just served to intensify the shortfalls in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAs readers of the manga know these initial captures are just the introduction to the greater underlying storyline, and it\u2019s unfortunate that the anime adaptation had to finish a whole season without even touching on it.  For an anime series whose length will be determined by DVD/Blu-ray sales, Manglobe didn\u2019t do the franchise any favours with the 12 episode format and the fillers.\\n\\n\r\nAs looks go TWGOK is not too bad, but it\u2019s not great either.  The character designs are a little inconsistent, but they hold up to a good standard overall.  The colour palette is the standard comedy fare, as is the animation.  Some of the scenes seem overdone and there is very little use of light and shade.  But there are some good bits; the animation of Keima\u2019s theory scenes always got a laugh out of me and Kanon\u2019s concert sequences are also a highlight.  The final result is a slightly better than average looking anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe music one of the strengths of this anime.  The opening, composed especially for the show by Tenmon, is perfectly suited.  The full song being 8 minutes long, the parts not used for the opening sequence are used for background music in addition to some other instrumental tracks to add to the atmosphere.  While the soundtrack is a bit lacking in variety it suits the mood of the show very well.  The cast of seiyuu also do a surprisingly good job of portraying the characters despite there being no real standout performances.\\n\\n\r\nThe diverse range of characters is what really makes the TWGOK manga really stand out.  Katsuragi Keima is the enigmatic anti-hero, obsessed with his game world and disillusioned with the real world.  Wakaki subtly pokes fun at practically every single galge stereotype with Keima\u2019s flawed personality and the vast range of girls that Keima captures; tsunderes, yanderes, kuuderes, every other type of \u2013dere you can think of, and many more.  These elements have been retained in the anime, and Keima still shines though as a unique and thoroughly entertaining protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Elsie, who takes the role of the cute and quirky sidekick.  While it is always fun to see more of Elsie, sometimes a disproportionate chunk of screen-time is given to her and the capture targets.  The extra character development that this screen-time allows is welcome but it tends to unbalance the whole show.  The story should revolve around Keima, and at times the writers at Manglobe seem to lose sight of that fact.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the curse of the 12 episode container strikes again, meaning that we don\u2019t get to see any other recurring characters besides Keima and Elsie.  The lack of variety in the recurring cast hurts this anime pretty badly, which is a shame since more of these characters are due to be introduced right after the point where the season ended.  The lack of episodes also means that the anime fails to address Keima's motivation in all but the first episode, which trivializes his character somewhat.\\n\\n\r\nNow I have been fairly critical of TWGOK, though that is not to say that I didn\u2019t enjoy watching it.  It is, if nothing else, entertaining, and I recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good rom-com with a twist.  However, the simple fact is it could have been much better had they done a few things differently.  The current format does very little to attract new people to the franchise, and it will be a huge shame if the series is axed after the second season because of the mistakes they made in the first.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, bring on season two.  Here\u2019s hoping Manglobe learns from their mistakes.  Overall score: 7.2/10 (rounded to 7)",

            "content": "This anime adaptation is a fucking disgrace to the manga.\r\nI have followed the manga since its very start and have enjoyed it very much. I'll stretch out as far as saying it is a masterpiece, ranking as one of my favorite mangas of all time. Then there is the anime.\r\nAs you have already noticed, I'm already annoyed how the anime turned out. I'm gonna rip and analyze one point of the time, and we're gonna start straight on...\r\nKeima: This is the main character. He is, as the title implies, a God. The God of Galge Gaming, or that's at least what he should be. Inthe manga, he was bitchin' cold to everyone else and showed no interests for real girls. Because 2D-girls was his thing, due to his world consisting ONLY of galges. So when he got forced by Else to do all the captures, he simply accomplished his tasks and moved straight back to his galge gaming. He was asocial. The forced tasks were simply business with no personal emotions attached. This made him cool, or perhaps even godlike because he was unlike any other spineless romance comedy main characters. This coolness aura was completely swiped away when he fucking BLUSHED IN THE VERY FIRST EPISODE OF THE ANIME. That might sound trivial to you, but that single element alone killed his cool personality. He was reduced to yet another one of the countless male main characters in comedy romances who blush by every little thing the girls say. He was made weak, and it ticked me off. And also, it doesn't help when he has the voice which sounds like every other pussy male main character in comedy romances. By the way he acted in the manga, which is in a godlike, intelligent way, he should have gotten a voice that corresponded to those characteristics. Maybe something like Lelouch (that's not a perfect match, but you get the idea). But back to the blushing. Keima blushed for the first time far into the manga, and that signaled a character development. But since he blushed in the very first episode, he would receive zero character development. Luckily, he wasn't totally stripped of his personality. One example of that is that he is still gaming most of his time in the anime. But that alone isn't very redeeming.\\n\\n\r\nFillers: Really? They had 12 episodes to go on and they dared to use three episodes for fillers. That's just a fuckin' waste when you have shitloads of chapters to use from the manga. I DO NOT WANT TO SEE AN ENTIRE EPISODE DEDICATED TO ELSIE. GOD. And if that wasn't enough, some of the episodes with content from the manga were unnecessarily stretched out, like the Kanon-arc. You know what? In the first chapter of the manga, the first girl Ayumi, kissed Keima of her own will. But in the anime, they fuckin' \"accidently\" fell down the stairs and that resulted in a kiss. That is one of the very many cliches the mangaka wanted to avoid, and here it is in the anime. I suspect that all these decisions on fillers, whether on a smaller or bigger scale, were aimed to please a specific crowd of the audience. And for that, I hate.\\n\\n\r\nVoices and sound: I've already ranted on Keima's voice, so we'll leave that be. However, all the other voices were as I had imagined in the manga, or at least approximately, so that was good. I wasn't too fond of the OP, though. I applaud for making it different than your average comedy romance OPs. I liked the ED more, as it was imaginitive and colorful.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, they followed the story fairly decent. In general, I liked the animation and the colors the studio went for.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY: Fillers, fillers everywhere. Okay, not everywhere, but I had to pull that meme out. Keima was the pillar of the series, and because his personality got butchered, the anime fell apart. Go read the manga. It's so much better.\\n\\n\r\nPS: If you want to dislike my review or whatever, give me constructive critisicm on my page.",

I personally enjoyed KamiNomi as its like watching the ending of your favourite anime, Where the protagonists finally manages to get the girl as to say. and this anime is filled with those \"endings\". 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt : The art style isn't anything new or unique to this anime as is may as well be similar to any other anime out there, But like I would say \"If it's not broken don't fix it\". Animation nice and clean, easy to understand , 8/10 is my standard score for a generally well done animation, 10/10 are usually for the anime's that have their own unique art styles that work, (it gives the studio that sort of recognizable style)\\n\\n\r\nSound : (Original Japanese Dub) Good work done by the voice actors, the characters sound like they should,(as in the voice fits the look of the character).\\n\r\nThe sound effects are nothing special but they work. 10/10 \\n\r\n(May skim through the series again in the English Dub to rate it) \\n\\n\r\nCharacters : The Main characters are mildly developed (personal opinion) there is still a lot of room for the viewers to get to know the characters better, The other characters that our main characters interact have their own back-story's  and the viewers will actually get to know them better then they know the main characters themselves,( really trying hard to not give any spoilers). 7/10 cause I feel more connected to the sub characters than the main. and would like to see more of them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : I personally enjoyed this from the plot to how it was executed, looking forward to watching the second season. It's refreshing to see a sort of harem slice of life anime not be ecchi for once, Looking forward to watching the next season. 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nOverall :- Story was well executed wouldn't have it any other way wish they could have developed their main characters a little more, \\n\r\nArt style nothing new though works well, Sound doesn't need to be any better for the sort of anime it is,voices work well (Japanese Dub). \\n\r\nCharacters we well designed left me wanting to see the sub characters get more screen time in the next season. Enjoyment had fun watching it, lack of ecchi scenes makes it more family friendly, 8/10 could be improved in some areas though is a great anime anyway. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Quick note, considering that there aren't many differences or changes between either of the first two seasons in any category, and it'd be kind of pointless to do two separate reviews that say the exact same thing, this review with be covering the first two seasons of The World God Only Knows. There will however be a separate review for the third season at some point in the future. Now that that's out of the way, please enjoy the review.\r\nYou know, i'm pretty sure that i'd be hard pressed to find many anime fans that aren't also gamers, at least to some degree. After all,the two cultures have always blended well in the past. But right now i want to talk about a specific type of game, visual novels. Visual novels are a type of video game that are basically interactive stories, you play through listening to the story unfold and occasionally you make choices that decide how the story will play out. There are some that are popular on an international level such as the Shin Megami Tensei franchise and Ace Attorney: Phoenix Wright, but it's only in Japan where visual novels have a strong popularity and a wide variety of games taking up the market. So the idea of making an anime/manga series where the concepts of visual novels are a large part of the story and characters doesn't exactly seem so farfetched. In comes The World God Only Knows, which implements the idea of these games into the harem genre to make an anime that has spawned quite a popularity since it's debut. But does it follow the plan that leads us to a happy ending or a dead end? \\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a teenage boy named Keima Katsuragi who is obsessed with games, specifically visual novels of the dating sim variety. He has the uncanny ability to be able to capture the hearts of every girl in his games with ease earning him the title of God of Conquest. One day, however, he receives a strange email asking if he can truly capture the heart of any girl he chooses. Keima, considering it a challenge, replies yes, accepting the challenge, when all of a sudden a young girl named Elucia de Lute Ima, Elsie for short, appears out of thin air claiming that she is a demon from hell and that he has just signed a contract with her. The contract states that he will be her partner in capturing the loose souls that have escaped from hell and have found host bodies in other people, primarily women, and if he refuses to do so then he will lose his head, literally, and Elsie, being bonded with him, will also die. So now Keima has to use his extensive knowledge of dating sims to make these girls fall in love with him, to fill the emptiness in their hearts and kick the invading soul out. And that's basically it for the first two seasons, Keima and Elsie find a girl who's carrying a loose soul, Keima seduces her, they kiss, the loose soul is captured, and through the element of plot convenience, the girl forgets all about the conquest so Keima can move on to the next girl without being considered an adulterous asshole. Throw in a couple filler episodes and that's it. Still, despite it's formulaic and repetitive nature, it's actually quite entertaining. The different heroine arcs are well executed, the humor is always silly, and i was never bored with the show. And i think one thing that makes it all work is that the show is in fact, a parody of visual novels. It kind of pokes fun at just how predictable and unrealistic they can be, but it's never mean spirited, always choosing silly humor over scathing criticism, which makes the show very lovable. However it does bring up some questions. How did Keima get tricked into the contract when he never signed a contract, he just pressed a button on an email? That's not exactly something that would hold up in court hell or otherwise. Also while the girls do lose all their memories, it's kind of hard to not say that Keima is cheating on them when he never actually breaks up with anyone. And it's hard not to say that the show isn't just a bit hypocritical when it says, more than once mind you, that reality and fiction are two separate things, yet Keima always succeeds in seducing women with what he's learned from his games, things that would never really help in the real world. Honestly it's best to not try to use your mind to much during the show, or else you'll be wondering why your laughing at an antisocial teenage boy manipulating women into falling in love with him, only to make out with him, force them to forget their memories, and move on to the next girl to do the same exact thing, and all with the help of a demon ad the powers of hell.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe World God Only Knows along with all of sequels and OVAs were done by studio Manglobe. The thing about Manglobe, is that they're great when it comes to action shows, Deadman Wonderland, Samurai Champloo, and Ergo Proxy are all perfect examples of this. But for everything else, they're mostly just decent. Overall, The World God Only Knows is a good looking show but there's nothing really special about it. The only notable thing is it's style. Despite the fact that the show does have a default style that it uses most of the time, they'll often change the style for the sake of gag humor, which was actually quite nice. I was never bored with the visuals because of their ever changing nature and often times, it tended to work in their favor for more comedic results. One last quick tip, when going into the show, be prepared for bright colors. Seriously, trying to watch this side by side with a show like Texhnolyze like i did, so freaking jarring.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is definitely the most impressive part of the show. They could have easily put in a couple of bouncy catchy j-pop numbers and be done with it, but they put some time and effort into it, resulting in some very nice orchestral pieces. The song that plays during the final stage of a conquest in particular, always left me on a good note. Although you will probably have the song \"Happy Crescent\" sung by the heroine Kanon stuck in your head for a week after watching the first season. Another thing that should be brought up are the openings, both of which are done by a group called Oratorio and are each quite good. But i'd like to specifically mention the opening to the first season, often regarded as the best opening by fans, called \"God Only Knows\", however the part we hear in the show is only a small snippet of a nine minute long epic, which is worth giving a full listen too. To quickly regard sub vs. dub on this, i'm going to suggest going with sub. For the dub, Chris Patton does great as Keima, and Luci Christanson is acceptable as Elsie, but that's about it. Besides, if you choose the dub, then you miss out on the heroine Shiori delivering her famous \"baka/aho\" lines, which i consider to be some of the greatest delivered lines in the Japanese language.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the main pull for a large chunk of fans of the show is the God of Conquest himself, Keima Katsuargi, whose kind of what you'd get if Lelouch Lamperourge was an eccentric otaku. Keima is basically the opposite of what you would expect from a harem protagonist. Where the average harem protagonist is average in every way and only gets girls by being extremely kind, Keima is an intelligent and handsome young man who puts plenty of work and effort into winning over his target. But that also brings up another point of his character, in his eyes, the girls are nothing more than missions that he needs to accomplish. He has been nothing but disappointed by reality and seeks solace in the games that he's so obsessed with, because of this he's an antisocial problem student, and an outcast to his peers. He looks at everything the way he would look at a game, so rather than winning over women with a genuine kindness and understanding, he manipulates them through scripts and planned situations, caring more about getting the conquests over with so he can go back to playing games rather than the girls own happiness. But still, he is still a good person underneath it all and had shown the occasional subtle moment where it seems he does care about the girls he conquers and is also bothered by his own personal situation. Then there's the demon from hell Elsie. I'm not even gonna poke around the bush, Elsie is freaking adorable, everyone who's seen the show knows it and i'm not even going to deny it. She herself doesn't have all that much to do with the conquests, only showing up to capture the loose souls when they're kicked out of the host body. She instead takes the role of Keima's little sister, doing everything in her power to impress him and make him happy just for a little bit of praise, but often fails either because of her own ditzy nature or Keima's stand-offish nature. Also she has a weird obsession with firetrucks. I don'y know why she does or how it's relevant to the series but goddammit it's adorable. The only other character worth mentioning is Haqua du Lot Herminium, Elsie's colleague and friend from hell who also captures loose souls that was introduced in season 2. Haqua is very prideful, not coming from a noble family and instead rises to the top through hard work and determination, but because of this is unwilling to admit her own faults and, at first, doesn't choose to openly acknowledge Elsie as a friend, despite treasuring their friendship. There's not really much to say about the rest of the prominent characters are the heroines and they can basically be summed up with a trope, such as athlete, rich girl, and book worm. Still the show does like to mix things up a little bit by adding new twists to their tropes, like the rich girl is actually poor, or by having the loose souls give the girls powers, like having a personality literally escaping from a girl. But even so, none of the characters outside the heroines really get any development and are basically the same people they were when they were first introduced, and the development that the heroines get are fairly predictable and melodramatic. Still by the end of the series you will most likely have your own favorite heroine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) Overall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nYou know those series that you can never consider a personal favorite for one reason or another, but you still love to death for one reason or another. Well for me, The World God Only Knows is one of those series. Yes it's formulaic and simple, but it's always entertaining, and the characters are still memorable. But you should take to mind that this series is not one to be taken to seriously. It's mostly silly and even the melodrama is there for parody rather than emotion. There's not real drama to be found in this series...at least, not until season 3. But that's a review for another day. Until then, remember to find your ideal route in life, because i can see the ending....No i really can't but that'd be pretty cool though wouldn't it.",

            "content": "It\u2019s funny how a parody somehow has license to nab the actual appeal of its subject matter.  It\u2019s almost unfair, and that\u2019s exactly what Kami Nomi does.  Lets be honest, dating sims are sexist, treating girls like puzzles to be cracked, and those who would never touch such a game can appreciate how this series exaggerates its common character archetypes and lampoons them.  The final romantic moments though are completely straight faced, and at times, somewhat touching as they should be in a dating sim.  A satisfying romance this is not, but it is riotous, with a few sweet moments onthe rare occasion.\\n\\n\r\nKeima is a high school student dubbed \u201cThe God of Conquest\u201d due to his proficiency in beating dating sims.  He is popular amongst dating sim players on the net, but his classmates find him disgusting.  He is issued a challenge by a mysterious sender and as soon as he hits reply, the demon Elsee comes to him telling him he\u2019s already signed a contract.  Keima must displace wandering souls (who only take refuge in high school girls\u2019 hearts?) by inspiring love in the hosts\u2019 heart.  If he fails, both he and Elsee will be guillotined.  To save his life, Keima must become a real pickup artist, even though he\u2019s never even held a girl\u2019s hand.  To avoid complications, the girls he picks up promptly forget about him after the climactic kiss that liberates them, allowing him to move onto the next target without breaking any hearts (except maybe his own\u2026awww).\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough, all his moves in the dating sims work just as well in real life.  Keima isn\u2019t a smooth talker, James Bond type.  He uses a somewhat creepy, perhaps slightly endearing earnestness.  It\u2019s usually an over the top, \u201cthat guy is way too into me\u201d kind of thing.  He also has a great talent in that he can say the cheesiest, cruelest, or most socially unacceptable things with a straight face.  The girls are all overblown clich\u00e9\u2019s with comedic exaggerations or twists thrown in.  A wealthy, slightly sadistic ojousama, an athletic girl, a pop idol, and a quiet librarian are the primary story arcs.  Keima coldly observes them and calculates the best way to wriggle his sleezy self into their hearts.  The girls have some burden that they endure, so Keima tests the waters until he understands their issues, then with his love (bleh!), he resolves it.\\n\\n\r\nThe climaxes are similar to those of dating sims.  In one instant, the girls\u2019 problems are solved, and the romance is sealed with a kiss.  The Ojousama and Idol ones were particularly cute, but the highlight is always the journey itself, which is anything but typical.  Keima often gets shot down in the most hilarious ways.  Unphased and undaunted, he will continue to proceed with his ridiculous plans.  On his very first target, the athlete, he hangs banners of love and praise down the side of the school building, and just stands beside them without the slightest hint of embarrassment.  She beats him, insults him, ignores him, but he persists.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is usually solid.  The character designs are truly generic (as intended no doubt), but the dancing, singing, and soul capturing sequences are all exceptionally well animated.  The playful orchestral piece really adds a lot of romantic atmosphere to the climaxes, and the music overall is good.  There are several pop songs (some of them quite funny) written just for the series but they often insist on playing them for the full duration.  The idol arc itself contains maybe 3-5 music video sequences.  They do drag a bit, but that\u2019s a minor complaint.\\n\\n\r\nKami Nomi is funny in so many ways.  The parody of dating sims and Anime girls in general is just the beginning.  Keima\u2019s campy cheese (one example: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about rank.  You\u2019re already first\u2026in my heart\u201d) is ceaselessly amusing as well.  The hilarity of the side characters, Keima\u2019s mother, Elsee, and others is just a plus.\\n",

            "content": "I present to you: The character most of us wish to be, but never will be due to the fact we lack the funding, and the determination. Katsuragi Keima can be considered a true otaku, a man who has given up on reality and instead focuses on nothing but dating sims and VNs. But of course, that would make for a rather boring premise, so let's add some demons to it. ==(Minor) Spoilers Ahead==\r\nNow, when I first heard about \"The World God Only Knows\", I thought it was going to be about a guy who's addicted to dating sims and nothing else. And when Iheard it includes demon girls and soul hunting, I wasn't very interested. I mean, after all, what kind of plot is that supposed to be? But alas, I was once again shown how wrong I could be, especially after having watched the first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis lovely and silly anime focuses on Katsuragi Keima, a guy with a huge passion for virtual girls, taken to a level where real life girls don't even faze him anymore. Thanks to that, he's known on the net as the \"God of Conquest\", and helps out people with their dating sim-related issues. Until one day, he accepts a \"challenge\" via mail and is suddenly bound by a contract to catch runaway spirits from Hell together with a demon girl named Elsie (or Elucia, or Elle-chan, but oh well). How does one catch these spirits, you may ask? Our lovely otaku has to drive them away from the hearts of people, because these souls look for gaps (weaknesses, emptiness) in them. And with people, I of course mean girls. And with driving away, I mean make them fall in love with him. And he does exactly that, with his dating sim skills, and he somehow manages to make it work.\\n\\n\r\nNow that that's out of the way, let's focus on the main points.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is great. Although it's nothing special, it fits with today's style and is nicely done in general. It doesn't stand out, but it doesn't have to be. It's perfect just the way it is... Yeah, I can't really say anything else. One note: The facial expressions from time to time are amazingly cute, so be careful.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nThe OP. Nuff said, really. But all kidding aside, the OST is great. It fits very well with the atmosphere of the anime, and is a great moodsetter. In the right way, that is. The OP, like I said before, is possibly one of the most intriguing I've ever heard. I wouldn't call it the best, because broken English isn't really my thing, but it's captivating, and I often find myself listening to it again. It also fits the title quite well, along with several other songs from the OST, with their god-like feel mixed into it.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWell, the story is quite unique, in my opinion. Some say that it's a combination of several plots, but it was amazingly executed. There wasn't a single moment where I got bored by the anime, and unlike others I've watched, I didn't even hesitate to watch the next episode... Which ended up in me watching the last episode at 3AM on a wednesday, but oh well. Fact is, it kept me glued to my seat, and the story progression was nice, fluent and not at all repetitive. And as an avid lover of comedies, this sure hit the spot nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nKeima is a character you expect to find in the background. He doesn't care about anything in the real world, and often finds himself frowned upon by fellow students and teachers. He's the typical shut-in without any friends. Putting a character like him in the shoes of an MC, and giving him a partner may be risky, but the author made it work. Not only that, they did an amazing job at it too.\\n\\n\r\nElsie, who has been assigned as his demon partner, is... Well, an airhead. A rather typical one, at that. She's funny, silly, and a bit stupid. Putting her next to a serious and superficial guy like Keima might make for a funny comedy routine, but instead it balanced the pairing up nicely, with one solving the puzzles and keeping a calm mood when necessary, whereas the other is just being herself, acting all goofy, but also providing a hand and helping out at the right time. I haven't seen a pair with a balance that worked well in a while, so it was quite nice to see it again.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the support cast, there's something about them that I love a lot. And that's that they all have unique character traits. This is actually a very important plot element, which is sorta given away in my earlier description of the anime, but it makes it that instead of the usual bland background characters, we get a bunch that actually feel like they add to the story. Nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\n\"The World God Only Knows\" tries to be different by giving us a main character that doesn't care about anyone else, yet is forced to help out others by performing acts that he has never done before. Although this isn't a fresh idea, it's all about how well you play it out. And with this anime, I think they hit it just right, and provided us with some lovely characters, good art, fine music and an overall great experience. It gives us the hope that otakus aren't bound by a fate of screens and the internet, but instead have the ability to communicate with members of the opposite sex... Nah, I'm exaggerating a bit, but you get the point. A shut-in who manages to sway every girl he has set his eyes on is quite the unique concept, in my opinion. And once again, they did a great job executing this concept. It's funny and silly, but at the same time passionate and gripping when it has to be. He lives in \"The World Otakus Dream Of\", you might say.\\n",

Those who try to compare the two are the ones who can't tell the difference.\"\r\nSo I said that to my mom and she called me a stupid kid, but whatever.\r\nIMPORTANT: This is a review (not really a review, more like a PLS WATCH THIS) on the ENTIRE SERIES, not just season 1.\r\nThe World A God Only Knows, a unique series that combines the themes of gaming, otaku nature, dating sims, and real life relationship problems. Add an adorable demon girl into the mix and you get to this thing, a 3 season long ride of awkward and hilarious moments.\\n\\n\r\nI love this show, and I think it's definitely worth the time to watch the entire thing. The interactions between Keima, the otaku and nerdy protagonist, and the real world are definitely a spectacle for your mind. The thing about this show is that the humor is really variable, ranging from awkward ecchi moments, hilarious voice acting, amazing character interactions, Elsie's facial expressions, funny skit-like moments during filler episodes, and more. This show has something for everyone to laugh at, and it's amazing how they fit so much comedy into a show that still has an interesting story with amazing characters that have relatable and beautiful backstories. \\n\\n\r\nThe World God Only Knows isn't perfect. No anime is. But the amount of enjoyment this series brings overshadows any flaw that it has. While some watch anime to analyze them and write reviews, most watch anime for personal enjoyment and experiences. I feel that people read anime reviews to determine which anime will be worth watching. The World God Only Knows brings plenty of enjoyment, and I recommend it to those who want a lovely funny series with some heartwarming and bittersweet moments. Trust me, this show can conduct the feels train pretty well too.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Has humor for everyone. \\n\r\n- Elsie is literally the most adorable thing.\\n\r\n- Cocky protagonist with a lot of personality. He's almost mysterious in a way.\\n\r\n- Episodic (arc-sodic?), with each girl having their own story and their own arc, but it's all still part of a bigger story.\\n\r\n- Each character has a beautiful and relatable backstory, and you will find one to sympathize and relate with.\\n\r\n- A lot of funny references to other animes. I can recall references to The Girl who Leapt Through Time and D-Frag.\\n\r\n- Amazing music.\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Some characters only play a role in their arc, while others go on to contribute more to the main story. That inequality though ;-;\\n\r\n- Elsie ends up playing less and less of a role as the series goes on, which sucks cause she's my favorite character.\\n\r\n- MC sometimes pisses me off xD \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nLike Amagami SS, it's a mainly episodic (arc-sodic) show, but TWGOK still has each arc contributing to the main story. While the background main story isn't really special and isn't really relevant till the last season, each arc is like their own little beautiful tale. They give off their own unique auras, and just like the humor in this show, each different story will suit to different tastes. I personally found enjoyment in all of them.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art isn't especially high quality, but the way they use art for comedic purposes is amazing. For example, changing the art style to parody another anime series, or giving Elsie or another character the most hilarious or adorable face, all of these little gems that the art created really made the show more enjoyable for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe OPs for each season are really unique but still catchy, and since there is an idol character, there are a lot of catchy songs in this anime. But the main piece that really got me hooked into the OST of this series is the \"You may now kiss the bride\" theme that plays in each arc. The shivers it sent down my spine, what a beautiful piece.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThe best part of this anime is the characters. The characters aren't just the bread and butter, they are also the orange juice, fried egg, sausage, and muffin that you have with this glorious breakfast. Every character has likable qualities, and every character has flaws. They all have their own problems and their back stories, and their ways of coping with it. I sympathized with so many of the characters that the end of an arc felt like the end of a long emotional anime to me. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nThis anime was definitely one of my most enjoyable ones. I watched all 3 seasons back to back within a week, and never in the middle have I ever felt like taking a break from it. Each arc made me emotional, and it was an unforgettable experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nWhile this show isn't known for having one big story, which might throw off some people, I believe that the stories of each arc is more than enough to make this show worthy of watching. I already miss seeing Elsie derping around on my screen.",

One day he is given a challenge by an unknown person asking him to conquer a girl accepting this request he actually signed a contract witha demon to help a demon capture loose souls, he meets a girl names Elsie who is the demon he has to help however refuses to capture loose souls when told he has to make them fall in love with him and kiss him (because he hates real girls), he is persuaded when he is told that he will lose his head if he doesn\u2019t cooperate with the contract. So Keima begins his quest to capture the loose souls.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nThe Animation in this anime is quite interesting because it shows certain types, firstly the eyes, there are two kinds of eyes in this anime the hawk eyes which are used mainly for boys and some girls who are either have tough or cold personalities. The other eyes are the moe eyes with are large and round and seen with most girls who have soft, cute, shy or moe personalities. The hair is also another key part, like most anime\u2019s of its time it has little detail in the hair using mainly different shades rather than drawing detail into each strand the actual anime is quite good it use small amount of features and a large amount of digital shading which is clever although when the chibi\u2019s are made it doesn\u2019t work as well, otherwise this is very nice animation and the style although similar to other is still quite unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe audio in this anime varies from the different themes for each character and heroine to the music for chibi characters, Firstly each character has his/her own theme to name each theme would take too long however each theme will show the characters personality or feeling. The chibi music varies from when some does a mistake or if a scene is changing other than that is the opening theme \u2018god only knows\u2019 and the ending theme \u2018koi no shirushi\u2019 both these themes go well with the anime, the op give a view of Keima\u2019s personality as a God of Dating Sims and the ending gives a kind of moe/cute look on the heroine throughout the season also both the opening and ending show all the heroines that are in that particular season so you can get a glimpse of what is to come.\\n\r\nMain Characters:\\n\r\nThe first season of TWGOK (The World god Only Knows) was quite interesting, not many anime\u2019s since this time had looked at an otaku\u2019s point of view, this interested many, with Keima he showed many characteristics and had a very strong view of the world around him as he found it full of flaws and imperfections, realizing this was never to change he lives in the world of his games. If we look at it this started at an early age where he would spend all his time with games (mainly Dating Sims). However even though he lives his life in his games he shows many important lessons to be learnt, he has ideals and shows a large amount of wisdom about this by giving many example to Elsie about dating sims in riddle which she can\u2019t understand, before he met Elsie (Erushi or Elli etc.) he was very happy with his games, he sees the demon as a burden on his as he is steadily dragged into the real world by a demon. However as we see to the conclusion of this season we see that he has changed slightly, he seems more willing however this is mostly to get rid of Elsie. Now we look at Elsie call her what you like however she is a very important character, she sees Keima as a god/brother even though he really isn\u2019t, she shows a large amount of loyalty to him witch is strange when you look a previous demon anime\u2019s who are exactly the opposite, as Keima quotes (in translated English) when you look at her she doesn\u2019t look like a demon but when she does anything it\u2019s like Beelzebub incarnate, this may not be an exact translation but you get the picture. When we look to Elsie\u2019s past we don\u2019t see much if not any during the second season however it seems they were avoiding it in both the manga and anime so that until we got a good glimpse of her character before we went headlong into a backstory (which in my view is a clever ploy to extend the manga and anime). This first season with its heroines is really just mainly setting up for the arc that is to come; it is an overview of the main characters and their respective personalities as well as the current arc\\n",

            "content": "The story is exactly as you'd expect from the synopsis - light-hearted episodic fare (each girl he has to conquer takes 1-2 episodes) with comedic elements. \r\nWith only 12 episodes and having to devote time to building up the personality of the targeted girl up so the audience cares about them, there is very little time for development of the main characters (Keima and Elsie). Character development does not go beyond the minimum required to set up the story as it is a short series, but it is sufficient. (I have since watched season 2 and there is significantly more development of the main charactersthere). \\n\\n\r\nWhat I enjoyed the most was Kami nomi's commentary and insights into the Dating Simulation genre (which are also applicable to anime). As a prodigy at dating sims, the main character periodically explains the characteristics of the various girl archetypes found in these games, what you need to do to win them, as well as the structure of how dating sims function. The girls he has to save usually fall into the typical stereotypes (sporty-type, princess-type, tsundere, etc) with a twist, so that Keima has to use his knowledge of dating sims, but adapt it to fit into the real world. \\n\\n\r\nI also liked how the director changes the pace of different episodes, based on the type of girl being chased: for example, when the target is a bookish-type, the episode is more slow paced with a lot of inner monologue.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think a passing familiarity with harems and Japanese games is needed to appreciate this anime fully. I would not recommend it to someone who has just started watching anime or is unfamiliar with Japanese games as many of the sight gags and plays on tropes would just go over their heads and all you would be left with is a semi-interesting story of a gaming genius using his video game knowledge in the real world.",

            "content": "*Note: this is a review for all 3 seasons. There may be minor spoilers but I'll warn you if I'll be mentioning one. I have also finished the manga as well so there might be some manga influences in my review (I will try to only focus on the anime though).*\r\nAfter watching three seasons of The World God Only Knows (TWGOK), I'm left with one thought: I wish I have Keima's pick-up skills when he is conquering a girl. Maybe I should try picking up dating sims.\r\nHaving watched a few romance anime (and also a fan of the romance genre), it gets tiring to seea relationship just between two people, or occasionally a love triangle. Harems are the answer to that but it's tricky to write a good story juggling so many  characters. Then, we have TWGOK. This anime combines elements from the couple relationship and the harem structure to create a grand act of conquering individual girls at a time. If you came looking for many types of ladies, TWGOK has them all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in the first two seasons are relatively simple. Keima is a good-looking video game God, or rather specifically, a God of dating simulations. Romance is his oxygen and he gets it by breathing in dating simulation after dating simulation. Despite his Brad Pitt-like looks, he adamantly believes the best girls are found in the 2D world. One day while conquering a 2D girl, he is forced into a contract with a demon, (no, not like Death Note demon but a rather much cuter one) named Elsie, to extract wandering souls that have taken refuge inside a human. In order to extract the hidden soul, he must \"conquer\" a girl or, in other words, make her fall in love with Keima. The catch is that each girl he conquers has her memory erased of the conquest. Although there are many girls to conquer, Keima is not short of unique ways to win her heart. So strap yourselves in your seat. You will be taken on one fast romantic ride.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in the third season takes a different approach than the first two seasons. Due to the difference, I'll be marking things about the third season as a light spoiler because perhaps you don't want to know how the story changes. So, feel free to skip down to END LIGHT SPOILER marking. However, I will not spoil anything about the third season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---BEGIN LIGHT SPOILER---\\n\\n\r\nThe third season marks the beginning of the shift in the story. Keima is still conquering the ladies but rather than being all light-hearted like in the first two seasons, this season highlights much more character development for Keima. The story has many more \"feelsy\" moments and more supernatural elements to it. At this point, it definitely shows the writer's own story rather than continuously poking fun at other romance stories. This defining aspect is a reason why the third season is the highest rated out of all three seasons. To provide a little teaser for/incentive to watch the third season, I will say that having conquered so many different types of girls, he is bound to find someone he admires.\\n\\n\r\nBut the bad thing about the third season is that it skips crucial story information. So before starting the third season, I strongly suggest reading the manga, in particular, after you finish season 2, start on chapter 41 in the manga and you can either go all the way to chapter 113, the start of season 3, or watch the OVAs \"Yonin to Aidoru\" (chapter 54-55) and \"Tenri Arc\" (chapter 57-65) and start the manga from there. The manga is a really fun read and covers even more interesting characters that the anime does not.\\n\\n\r\n---END LIGHT SPOILER--- \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes TWGOK stand out for me is that the writer is not afraid to use the standard character types: the quiet type, the athletic, the Tsundere, etc. In fact, there is little to no outstanding characteristics about each of our characters. Further, the anime has a great time poking fun at the romance anime that stretches for, say, 12-24 episodes when the actual romance/action can actually be condensed into 2 episodes. Indeed, TWGOK is a parody of most romance anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nLike I previously mentioned, the characters aren't particularly outstanding, except for Keima and perhaps Elsie. Keima is a relatively normal high school student who plays tons of dating simulators. But when he is on his courting A-game, he becomes a smooth-talking Channing Tatum minus the muscles. I am not sure if I can apply his methods to 3D girls (well, maybe but with a restraining order at the end) but it is damn entertaining to watch. \\n\r\nElsie is a fun but mostly clueless demon partner. What she does is basically identifying where the wandering demon is hiding and securing it in a bottle. Of course, since these demon partners are visible to all mortals, Elsie pretends she is Keima's sister and lives with him. How Keima's mother doesn't mind, well it's pretty comedic, but it's not really important because Elsie is a great cleaner and she is an awesome sister as well.\\n\\n\r\nWe do not learn much about each girl except for some surface details, which is a bummer. They are pretty interesting people if you continue with the manga but probably due to production issues/time constraints, the anime was not able to develop their interesting aspects. So if you are going to stick with the anime, each girl will either be a hit or a miss for you. Nevertheless, the anime does a good job of highlighting the particular traits of each girl. \\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, there is nothing out of the ordinary about the artwork. Keima has a relatively simple character design while Elsie gets a floating pink scarf (a.k.a. a hagoromo) and a cool skull spirit detector as a \"hair pin.\" The what I call \"derpy moments,\" or funny moments, are comically drawn. If you have seen a lot of romance anime, you would know what those climactic kiss moments are like and TWGOK is not lacking any of those. If you do not know what I am referring to, it is basically the moment when the male protagonist takes the hand of the girl and pulls her into his arms in slow mo for that eventful kiss. It's super clich\u00e9 but it's sure darn funny to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is nothing to rave about except maybe for the opening theme of all three seasons. They are sung in English and executed very well. Sung in a monastery style, it definitely reflects the fact that we are watching an episode of God in action. I always watch anime subbed so for the first few episodes of season 1, my ears could not believe that I was listening to an OP sung in English. But I eventually ended up liking the OP, especially the one for season 3. The ending theme was also well done.\\n\\n\r\nTWGOK is one fun ride. It has the laughs, the romance, and most importantly, it has the God. I think I may have picked up a thing or two about getting a girl to like me. Hopefully I didn't miss any disclaimers about the anime, like \"Don't try this at home.\" Anyway, this anime may not be for you if you absolutely loathe clich\u00e9 character types but if you like romance and comedy, or a light-hearted anime, definitely give TWGOK a look (and its manga as well)!\\n\\n\r\nLet me know what you thought of TWGOK! Which girl did you think was the best? Do you have a favourite character type? I would love to hear from you!\\n\\n\r\nP.S. For those who have seen all three seasons of the anime (no manga characters), this is my list of best girl:\\n\\n\r\n1. Ayumi\\n\r\n1. Taylor Swift, whoops!, I meant Kanon\\n\r\n3. Chihiro\\n\r\n4. Shiori\\n\r\n5. Jun\\n\r\n6. Tenri",

            "content": "It's funny how trends, tastes, and even perceptions can change over time. Less than a decade ago being called a geek, nerd or otaku was considered an insult, and while those terms have maintained their derogatory status to a degree (especially in Japan), the steady march of technology has dictated the rise of the \"Beta Male\", and nowhere is this more apparent than in the entertainment industries.\r\nIn 2001 the PC and Dreamcast game Comic Party was adapted and released as an anime, and with it came the birth of a totally new genre - the otaku comedy. Since that time there have been numerous mangaand anime that have utilised the theme in some manner, from the romanticised look at otaku life that is Genshiken, to the insane classical stylings of Nodame Cantabile's heroine, Noda Megumi. These days the number of titles that have some involvement with the genre is on the rise, and while some take a decidedly rose-tinted view of the subject, there are others (NHK ni Youkoso!, Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu (no, seriously), Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd, etc), that allow glimpses into the darker side of otaku life.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also those that approach the subject of otaku in an imaginative, yet decidedly tongue-in-cheek manner.\\n\\n\r\nKami Nomi Zo Shiru Sekai (The World God Only Knows, or KamiNomi), tells the story of Katsuragi Keima, the \"king\" of bishoujo games (galge), and dating sims, who is better known throughout the internet as the \"Capturing God\". He is content to live his life in the virtual world because \"reality is just a crappy game\" where the girls are impossible to deal with. All of that changes when he answers a mysterious e-mail addressed to the God of Conquest (another one of his monikers), and subsequently meets the demon girl Elucia de Lut Ima (Elci).\\n\\n\r\nThe plot attempts to meld several different themes into one continuous narrative, and in order to do this it utilises a number of devices that can sometimes get in the way. Like Amagami SS, the storyline follows the \"short arc for each girl\" format, complete with the \"reset\" at the end. This is accompanied by some fairly typical \"soul possession\" concepts, basic yet still humourous slapstick, and a rather interesting take on dating sims in general.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately it doesn't completely work.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that while KamiNomi is essentially a straight forward otaku comedy, the inclusion of so many disparate themes eventually causes a degree of conflict within the framework of the story. The major issue is the idea that one can use dating sim methodology to form a real world relationship, and while it is possible to learn the basics, this can never replace actual experience. In addition to this is the fact that the viewer is supposed to believe that a notorious game addict like Keima can suddenly turn on the charm when dealing with real girls, many of whom he initially can't stand to be around, and this in itself raises the question of suspicion on the part of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nThere is an attempt to rectify these issues, but this relies on the tried and tested method of memory manipulation rather than an explanation of how a social recluse is easily able to communicate with others. That said, the series utilises some well placed visual gags to divert the viewers attention away from any plot holes or conflicts, and the story is interesting and humourous enough to make it accessible to a much broader audience than one might initially expect.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to looks, KamiNomi is pretty much back to basics in virtually every department, with one area of notable exception (we'll get to that in a moment). That said, while the degree of genericism in the visuals is high, there's also something slightly more subtle at work as well. The character designs are taken directly from the manga by Wakaki Tamiki, and what's interesting about this is that while the mangaka made a conscious effort to allow the comedy to flourish, he also tried to show what each character is, rather than simply trying to define them as individuals.\\n\\n\r\nConfused? I'll explain then.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is partly derived from that of the common or garden dating sim or galge, and as regular players of these games will know, characters of a specific type will share certain visual features. Wakaki has attempted to incorporate some of these into the design of the girls that Keima goes after, and this in turn defines their personalities as they have been created to fit a specific mould. In addition to this, because the player is usually faceless in these games, Wakaki chose to parody a few of the better known \"genius\" characters from anime for his \"God of Conquest\", in particular Lelouch vi Brittania and Yagami Light.\\n\\n\r\nSo don't be fooled by the simplistic looks.\\n\\n\r\nThe area that really stands out is the effects, in particular the variety, timing and imagination that has gone into making them. While the rest of the anime may look colourful yet average, KamiNomi is surprising for the quality of a number of its visual set pieces, but it's the audio choreography that changes those scenes from simply being pretty into something worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nIn anime, as in life, timing is everything, and in this respect Manglobe have a very good pedigree. But then what else would one expect from the studio that brought us Michiko to Hatchin, Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy (unfortunately they're also responsible for the abysmal Sacred Blacksmith, but we won't go there). While this is very clearly a comedy series the studio has made the effort to deliver a quality show, and because there's little that can be done about the design of the visuals, a lot of effort has gone into making this anime sound great.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening sequence is indicative of this ethos at work, and features some clever imagery that is well timed to match the changes in the theme song (God Only Knows, performed by Elisa). The ending sequence is a bit more complicated as there are actually four tracks and sequences on offer. The main ED, Koi no Shirushi, is a fairly average J-Pop track, but for the majority of episodes the female leads take turns singing it (while the rest perform backing vocals). As for the remaining tracks, Tatta Ichi Do no Kisei by Sakurai Tomo (episode four), along with the visuals, is meant to be a play on the average ending sequences of dating sims and galge. On the other hand Happy Crescent by Toyama Nao is supposed to be a \"live\" idol performance, so it's a shame it's such a generic song.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the best of the EDs, is the final one, Shuuseki Kairo no Yume Tabibito, which is sung in a completely amateurish and off key style by the lead man himself, Shimono Hiro (with support from the female seiyuu who apparently are collectively known as Oratorio The World God Only Knows), and is very much in keeping with the slightly delusional and slapstick comedy of the series.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately there's one big flaw in KamiNomi, and that's the lack of character development. Normally this shouldn't really be an issue for what is effectively an otaku comedy/parody, but because of the inclusion of certain plot themes, aspects like characterisation and growth become more prominent.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the more complicated a story is, the better the characters have to be.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there is some development due to the soul possession aspect of the story, it never really impacts on the overall narrative due to the \"reset\" at the end of each girl's arc. This has the effect of nullifying what has gone before, and even though Keima and Elci aren't subject to it as a rule, there is very little given over to their growth over the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe real strength of the characters comes from the comedy side of the show, and in this respect the seiyuu are pretty good. Shimono Hiro (Keima), and Itou Kanae (Elci), are great as the proverbial \"Odd Couple\", and while there are some great skits from the other leading ladies, their timing and delivery, especially with each other, is sometimes a joy to behold.\\n\\n\r\nKami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai is a strangely mixed bag that works on certain levels, but ultimately it would have been better off trying to weave fewer themes into the plot. Individually the concepts behind the series are imaginative and somewhat inventive, but the complications caused by trying to blend several ideas together sometimes creates a quagmire in the storyline, and inserting a joke to brush over it is nothing more than papering over the cracks. That said, the series is enjoyable enough to warrant at least one watch, and viewers should also keep in mind that this twelve episode anime is nothing more than a prelude of things to come, especially as the manga has already gone beyond the 100 chapter mark.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the incomplete nature of the story may put people off, the fact that a sequel is on the horizon may signify that all hope is not yet lost. Then again, they may simply \"cop out\" by ending the series before the real storyline begins.\\n\\n\r\nWe'll have to wait and see.\\n",

            "content": "\"Reality is a shit game!\"\r\n'Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai' ('The World Only God Knows') is about a self-claimed \"Otoshigami (Capture God)\" who can \"capture\" the heart of any 2D girls in dating-sim games. One day, he unknowingly signs a contract with a demon through email, and ends up in a quest to capture real-life (3D) girls in order to collect runaway souls residing within their hearts.\r\nThe first season of 'KamiNomi\" involves the capture of 4 girls, with 3 filler episodes.\r\nKatsuragi Keima is an interesting character. He's full of confidence in front of the PFP screen and calls himself \"Capture God\", backing up his claim withgodly galge gaming and analytical skills. What's more interesting is that he applies eroge logic and theory to real life, disapproving people, objects, and events in reality as having \"unrealistic settings\". Keima is a reluctant hero in this show as he's only interested in 2D girls, and he received very little character development, but that's just fine because it shows how dedicated he is to gaming, and his \"modern samurai\" way of life. Filler ep-4 was a great display of his game philosophy and dedication.\\n\\n\r\nElsea is a demon who looks and behaves like a typical clumsy 2D girl. Her character development was very poor despite having a filler ep-8. Her very existence and costume/accessories is probably more suitable for 'Soul Eater' series, but her character is one of the best eye candy ever, and she's a package that makes the absurd premise possible.\\n\\n\r\nTakahara Ayumi was the first target, a Sporty Cool. She was given only a single episode, but served well as an introduction to the premise.\\n\\n\r\nAoyama Mio is next, a Tsundere Princess. She seemed like an common archetype at first, but our Capture God finds out that she was no longer what she claimed to be. Her arc was an introduction to Keima's standard gaming strategy: Encounter, creating chances to meet often, formation of negative impression, and turning the negative impression into positive impression.\\n\\n\r\nThen comes Nakagawa Kanon, a Yandere Idol. Her insecurity as a solo performer leads to unhealthy obsession with Keima because he shows zero interest in her. Her arc was rather draggy, but features quite a bit of insert songs and slapstick comedy.\\n\\n\r\nBest was saved for the last with Shiomiya Shiori, an introvert librarian. The story's pace suddenly slowed for her arc, which turned from a slapstick-heavy comedy to serious artsy anime. Her character made this a very interesting arc. We as viewers can hear her \"speech in the mind\", but Keima who's used to be in our position suddenly realizes the difficulty in her capture because he had to work to draw out the inner voice. Shiori's character development was done very well with her gradual curiosity in the trouble maker at the library, and Capture God's eventual understanding of his target. It is extremely difficult to make slow, mesmerizing pace work, but the amazing direction and production had done just that. The atmosphere in the library and art house camera movement / perspectives were phenomenal, and painted a world of its own.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode was a filler. While it was somewhat corny, it further establishes the protagonist's character and devotion to video games, and the pure absurdity of it was hilarious. The near-full use of 8-plus-minute oratorio also featured as OP was a nice touch that intensified drama. It also ended with a cliffhanger by introducing a new girl demon character, and hinting a sequel season.\\n\\n\r\nComedy was quite inconsistent. Sometimes intelligent, such as stating 3D girls' flaws with 2D logic, parodies, and God's Teachings. Other times, it's plain stupid, like Elsea tripping randomly.\\n\r\nOverall, the story and characters are very interesting, but as a fantasy comedy, it's filled with improbable situations, gimmicky story developments (like requiring the target to fall in love, girls losing memory after Capture), and the inevitable corniness that comes with it. Character development for all the heroines were done in a frantic speed as an arc-format anime, but every one of them were more than the typical 2D heroines thanks to numerous plot twists, and they were captured in unconventional methods that never gets tiring.\\n\r\nIt is apparent that the ending was produced with another season in mind. In fact, at least 24 episodes may have been decided from the start, so it may still be a bit too early to judge its story and character development just yet.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe OP in 'KamiNomi' can only be described as a \"Masterpiece\". The animation quality, atmosphere, song quality, song choice, originality, transition flow, audio-visual harmony, appropriateness, effectiveness as OP, wow-factor... I would rate 10/10 for every aspect of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this series is generic anime style drawn to perfection. Unique design for the protagonist, and Elsea must be the cutest anime girl ever. The supporting characters are generic but easily distinguishable designs, this works to support the plots where Keima predicts girls' personality based on appearance. Dynamic movements, funny chibi-forms, artistic representations, and great use of CG. The presentation was done exceptionally well with bunch of creative cuts, background effects for comedy and mood setting. Above all, the amount of detail is staggering, with the sheer number of objects in the background, books with pages of real texts, reflections on various surfaces, and attention to imperfections and stains on walls and floors. Characters also have up to 3 degrees of shading versus the typical 2. Despite the generic style, art work in this series is so outstanding that it can no longer be considered ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu cast was excellent. The protagonist's voice had a wide range, from the absolute confidence while talking about eroge theories to humorous screams. Everyone else also sounded like they should, full of emotions.\\n\r\nBGM was really sophisticated and lively, complementing the story by enhancing the atmosphere of every scene. Different sets of BGM were used for each arc.\\n\r\nKanon's insert songs were incredibly well done. Yes, they're moe pop songs, but the level of production was so high that it's hard to believe they were written solely for anime inserts.\\n\r\nRegular ED is a light pop song in good contrast with OP accompanied by a creative theme.\\n\\n\r\n'KamiNomi' had a fantastic pacing and offers comedy, drama, and emotional attachment. All of it was backed by a masterful presentation that was incredible to the point of over-production. Despite its inherent corniness, I found this show to be extremely enjoyable. It is the series with a sense of highest degree of completion among all series I've seen so far. In fact, the production value in this series rivals that of theatrical anime movies.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the way they presented the empty feeling you get after the girls forget Keima's involvement after the kisses. It must be devastating to be the only one having the memory of their time together even if he wasn't interested in 3D girls. Nevertheless, our samurai hero will stand strong and keep the memories of \"The World God Only Knows\" in his heart as he continues on to fulfill his mission of capturing girls' hearts in the second season. I will definitely be there to hear the demon's \"dorodorodoro\" detection of another wandering soul and witness the Capture God`s miracles.\\n",

            "content": "So, this is my first Review on my favorite manga and anime, KamiNomi!\r\nI'll try to keep it short and clean c:\r\n-Story & Overall-\r\nWhat I would like to announce, this is not your regular average harem anime. It has a good plot and idea to it, actually and it does make sense in the world it was created into!\r\nThe way that the main character has to wear consequences and plan out his actions is just entertaining (as are the dialogs) and it definitely made me sit down and read/ watch.\r\nKamiNomi does not try to be more than what it is and keeps going at it's ownpace, always introducing different situations and new challenges the main characters have to face.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\r\nWell, it is drawn by none other than Watanabe Akio - the designs, actually. If you watched and are fan of the Bakemono/Nisemono series, you already noticed this.\\n\r\nIt really depends on the taste, though - I enjoyed watching the Art style for KamiNomi, however being a great SHAFT studio fan, I would have preferred (and as with many other shows I enjoy) if they had put in more visual effects like turning around and basically what Shaft does... *trails off*\\n\\n\r\nThe uniform designs are unique as hell - I seriously haven't seen anything like those before and it makes me want to wear them as well~!\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nMusic wise, can I say that the Openings are epic? Have you seen an anime with Orchestra music yet? I mean really? \\n\r\nWhenever I listen to it, I feel like I am going to watch some church/Religion anime -- But the fact is, the music is heavenly. That s the only way to describe it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Character-\\n\r\nOh the characters...\\n\r\nWe have two main ones, Elsie and Keima.\\n\\n\r\nKeima, your average gamer boy who hates reality to it's last bits. His character is simple - in a way, yet very well handled and developed to make the series to what it originally is. He is a very likeable character (not like some douches from other harem animes *cough*Makoto*cough cough*)\\n\\n\r\nElsie, your kind demon who comes from Hell and guides Keima to fulfill their mission! (Not spoiling much)\\n\r\nVery naive and innocent, Elsie is seen to be closed into people's heart quite easily. She is silly and her obsession with trains-- \\n\\n\r\nScratch that, those were fire trucks, I'm sorry! \\n\r\nA big thank you Zaraquiel99 for pointing that out!\\n\\n\r\n-- is just so out of nowhere, it is almost creative. I never saw a character with such interest, really now.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is not shunned or put into a corner either - they each have their own backstory, flaws and emotions, giving us a deeper, in-depth look to them and not being handled as some harem-element.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nI see quite a lot of people who enjoy and like KamiNomi.\\n\r\nI even buy the volumes that I can get my hands on - it is the most bought manga I have in my room, which consist of 5 vols already. \\n\r\nI really do want to support Tamaki and his work, so I do not regret spending my money on this manga. At all.\\n\\n\r\nHe deserves it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\nAnd that was my short review~ I hope I could convince you at some point... ; - ;\\n\r\nPlease just give it a try at least! >/////",

            "content": "Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai, The World God Only Knows, is an anime that centers on an otaku gamer's life. When I first found this series, I researched on it a bit on Wikipedia, found it somewhat unimpressive in plot, character and art, and didn't even bother reading the manga. I have to say that I was wrong to judge this series by merely the front cover of its Wikipedia article. After the anime came out and my anime savvy friend directly recommended this to me, I found that I was drawn into the story, something that rarely happens for an ardent critic like me.This anime aims to set a standard for humor and adventure, and I believe that it achieves both.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\r\nThe art is great. Although I've seen better and more creatively drawn animes, with regard to the context of this anime, the art is drawn very appropriately. For example, during the comedy scenes, the art is drawn chibi but with some elements that further resonates the humor, whether it be a small action or item in the background. The art never hinders your enjoyment of this anime and even improves the experiences with elegantly drawn characters like Elsie. \\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10)\\n\r\nThe World God Only Knows is about the life of a 2-D \"Game God\" Keima. He is known throughout the web as the conqueror of all visual novel, bishoujo games. One day he unknowingly signs a contract with the devil, mistakenly taking the contract as a challenge to his Otaku God position, to help a demon girl Elsie collect escaped souls from hell that hide within the empty space in girls' hearts. Should he not comply with the contract, both he and Elsie will lose their heads. Literally.To exorcist the evil soul, he must make the girl fall in love with him and kiss him. The only problem is that everyone in real life calls him an otaku and avoids him for his addiction to 2-D girls and games. This story incorporates comedy right into the base and still embodies an objective to be achieved throughout the course of the series... all while giving the viewers some LOLs in the process.  \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nAlthough I do not usually comment on the sounds, I did notice that certain things were outstanding. This anime does not have a particularly \"addictive\" opening and ending theme, but it has creativeness that far surpasses some addictive-themed animes. In episode 4, there is an extra opening and ending that really personifies the storyline and shows diligent planning that went along with it. This ability to creatively adapt to the content of each episode with compatible musical compositions  is what really separates this anime from others and also earns the music producers some well-deserved kudos.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are exemplary. Keima, especially, was someone who really stood out from the mundane, long list of modern anime characters. Although he doesn't embody the cold, taciturn personality that I usually look for in male protagonists, he is clearly distant from the level of backboneless \"male\" (sometimes I really do question their gender) protagonists that get beat around by the females. What I like most about Keima is that he establishes his ideals and is determined to do what he believes in. He overcomes many embarrassments and obstacles and always seems to plan for the worst (I hope some people in real life would learn that). Other times his dedicated assertions, like \"Life is just a crappy video game\" and \"Real life girls suck. 2-D girls are better\", were really similar to mine and gave me some lulz. As someone who likes to relate to male protagonists, I really felt that I could connect with Keima and understand his ideals - part of the reason why this anime drew my attention. Elsie, the pretty female protagonist, was also a very likable character. She embodies the \"kawaaiii\" personally and really tries her best to help Keima (despite the fact that some efforts have opposite effects). She is never arrogant or unpleasant and always tries to care for Keima to act like his \"little sister\" (although there definitely are some love feelings between them). \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nThe World God Only Knows is a great anime overall. It combines humor and adventure successfully into a masterpiece that many previous animes have tried and failed to attain. For someone who had such cynical and critical attitudes before watching, it took only 10 minutes of the first episode to turn me and my ideals 180 degrees into zealous enjoyment. If you're looking for a funny anime that still has a good story played out by likable characters, The World God Only Knows is definitely an anime that you should put on your list.",

            "content": "Unexplainable. It's completely unexplainable how big an approval this anime got from the overall anime fans. There isn't a single reason I can see to that after watching The World God Only Knows 12 episodes (being painfully tortured by the last 5 episodes).\r\nIt's cliche after cliche every single episode. It's true that they tried to cover it up, by coming up with the whole \"I don't get in touch with real girls because the games girls are so much better but I'll use my gaming skills to stereotype girls and it'll work out\" stuff, but while it worked well on the first episode, it gotboring right after it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is really lame. Like, totally lame. Lamest of lamest. The guy is a master on finishing dating games with the heroine. He then, receives a \"challenge\" asking if he really can capture every girl and accepts it. The thing is that the challenge was about real girls, who are possessed by loose souls and to free those souls he has to make them fall in love with him and have a \"happy ending\" with them.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls with whom Keima ends up on each arc are painfully dull. They act exactly as you'd expect from them. No surprises at all. It's like they're actually following a book for cliche girl characters on animes. The hyperactive-strong-tempered girl, the high-and-mighty-tsundere, the popular girl who fears being alone and the freaking annoying silent and shy librarian (god, how I wanted to shoot my screen while she went on about books! The hell was that, some sort of \"go read a book\" brainwashing?) I'm not gonna even bother mentioning Elsea cuz she's just there to add another boring character to the whole set.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack felt out of place during the whole anime! Epic songs, characters suddenly singing, seriously, why? The art was nothing more than you could expect from a harem anime. Even this aspect feels like a cliche.\\n\\n\r\nI was able to enjoy myself a lot in the first episode, and a little bit up to episode 6 or 7. After this, god knows where I gathered strength to watch it till the end.\\n\\n\r\nI really can't understand all the hype behind this anime. There isn't a single trace of originality nor attempt of seeking it. I wasn't this dissatisfied after watching an anime since Shuffle!",

I mean that in the sense that you know it's not necessarily \"deep\" or particularly \"meaningful\", but it makes you happy and satisfied when you watch it.  Hell, it's junk food, but it's damn good junk food.\r\nTWGOK basically runs like a dating sim game, with a new girl basically every chapter/episode.  Even though it's kind of silly, and it's somewhat harem (not in the annoying way, because the girls forget him after he captures them, so there isn't this whole cat-fight thing), but it's fun and interesting, and very pleasing to watch.  It doesn't reallyhave a message, or even a great storyline, but the romance is cheesy and satisfying-- you know he gets the girl in the end, and it's fun to watch him do it, gal-game style.\\n\\n\r\nI've been following the manga for a while now, and I've been really really looking forward to the anime adaptation, and this first episode really was everything I expected, and more.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the anime is pretty high quality, I think.  It's no Advent Children, or even 50cm a second, but it's detailed, pretty and appropriate-- the whole anime basically runs like the CG captures that you \"Get!\" in dating sim games (if you don't play, you have no idea what I'm talking about, but it's just pretty good/sharp art in general). \\n\\n\r\nThe voicing/sound/music is also really good.  The music that's played when Keima does his \"I see it-- the endinguuu~~!\" is pretty epic.  The music is sharp, and the anime has this weird techie/computer/DIGITARUUU feel to it-- pretty neat.  \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I give this anime pretty average scores in storyline and character, but this anime is just fun and enjoyable to watch-- so it's a 9 :D\\n\\n",

            "content": "Expected a twist on harem anime, but was disappointed by how boring and silly it became. Not even funny enough to tolerate.\r\n\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\r\nWhy do I keep being surprised when MyAnimeList gives me another shit recommendation? I saw the 8\u2019s and 9\u2019s (even some 10\u2019s); I saw the 5-stars; and I read the reviews telling me it was funny\u2014that it\u2019s not your typical harem show.\r\nI love a good story that parodies, deconstructs, or puts a twist on clich\u00e9s. And this show sort of, kinda does that? But not really because so much of it falls flat. The premise is actually much better suited for a more seriousstory.\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts funny so I had hopes. I expected to get funnier and wittier, but it actually got more and more dull. It became tedious after halfway through. When a show gets boring I switch over to the dub because I can\u2019t stand being forced to read subtitles for a shit show. It\u2019s a chore. The dub actually made it funnier and more bearable.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has a different girl every few episodes for our main guy to seduce, but the girls are so one-dimensional. It makes no sense when the show\u2019s premise is supposed to be an attack on clich\u00e9s. The girls are supposed to represent typical female archetypes in dating sims, but there weren\u2019t any twists or anything unexpected about them. It was played straight.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character doesn\u2019t even seduce them in a clever or interesting way either. It just happens without any real struggle or conflict so you\u2019re left with the girls\u2019 stories to support the plotting.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character I liked was Elsie, the female sidekick. She was ditzy, funny, and made the show tolerable. She carried half the show for me. Elsie actually cared about the demon contract. She cared about trying to seduce the girls (because her life depended on it).\\n\\n\r\nI wished for a lot more of her because the main character was so uninteresting. I couldn\u2019t relate to him. He was bland and just didn\u2019t seem to care that if he didn\u2019t fulfill his demonic contract he\u2019d die.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise deserved a better story than this. Here\u2019s how it could\u2019ve been much more engaging.\\n\\n\r\n- Take it more seriously.\\n\r\n- Should\u2019ve been a character drama that focused on his growth as a person.\\n\r\n- He\u2019d mature, realizing he shouldn\u2019t have such an unhealthy obsession over dating simulators.\\n\r\n- He\u2019d be forced to interact with real women and find out that real human interaction is far more difficult than a video game.\\n\r\n- You\u2019d see him struggle, you\u2019d see him learn, and you\u2019d see him develop.\\n\r\n- It can still be funny. The 40-Year Old Virgin is somewhat like this. It still had great characters and a character arc while remaining funny.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to bother with season 2. The show was amusing (at first), but it\u2019s not worth sitting through 12 episodes for.",

            "content": "Hello everyone! My name is Austin & I will be doing my FIRST ever review!\r\nAs a big fan of romantic comedies, I fully enjoyed watching this anime & its sequels. \r\n[SUMMARY]\r\nThe story is about a high school boy who is completely obsessed with dating sims & therefore is known as the \"God of Conquest\". Due to his legendary gaming skills, he received a mysterious email asking for his help in conquering girls. Little did he know the message was pertaining to conquering real life girls & that the sender was from a cute demon girl by the name of Elsie. From that point on, hewas obligated (by life) to helping Elsie find & capture loss souls hidden inside these girls.\\n\\n\r\n[STORY] - 10\\n\r\nWhen it comes to RomComs, it's pretty hard for me not to give a high rating due to my love for them. The unique plot of a boy using his gaming skills to make cute girls fall in love with him is something completely unique. This story line probably would come off as very appealing to those who think video games can't help you in life. Each girl he conquers has a very unique & different personality than the rest, which gives new & exciting elements to each episode. So overall, even if I wasn't a RomCom fan, I'd still give this series a very high rating.\\n\\n\r\n[ART] - 9\\n\r\nThe art style of the anime is pretty much the same as many other animes, but that doesn't mean I don't like it. I'll admit, there are not many elements of the artwork that are different from other animes. But then again, sometimes its the best to stick with what's hot. None of the artwork is sloppy & is very well drawn out, so I will give the artwork a 9.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND] - 8\\n\r\nWhen it comes to sound, most animes in my opinion sound very similar, yet good (just like the artwork). The voice actors, though, do a very good job at making the right sound & tone depending on the situation. The intro & outro song are also pretty good, but not so good that I'd put it on my favorite songs list. Overall, voice acting & music is good, but not so different from the rest (which isn't bad).\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER] - 10\\n\r\nLike I said in the story rating, all the characters are EXTREMELY unique. \\n\r\n> Keima - The way he talks sounds very indifferent. Also, even for a person who doesn't socialize very much, he is a very, very smooth talker & acts very cool in a way you wouldn't expect for such an anti-social guy\\n\r\n> Elsie - She is probably one of the most energetic & happy people I've seen in an anime. Always trying to please people & making cute remarks, it's hard not to like her.\\n\r\n> Conquered Girls - Each one has a different attitude, style, & appearance which can appeal to a wide variety of people. Because of these unique aspects, it keeps the story very interesting & makes sure the viewer can't predict what will happen. But due to the fact many of these girls are very lovable, it makes you want to root for one of them but then you realize in the end Keima most likely won't end up with that particular character. \\n\r\n> To sum it up, character design is very unique & appealing to the viewers, including myself.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT] - 10\\n\r\nNot much to say, but the fact that I did & still am enjoying this anime. If you have read my ratings on each topic, then you'll probably know why. But because anime enjoyment varies depending on the person, you'll never truly know how much you'll like it until you try it!\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL] - 10\\n\r\nAs my first review, I decided to skip this since I'm not exactly sure what I should put here.\\n\\n\r\nTHANK YOU for reading my first review if you read it & I promise I will improve my writing & reviewing.\\n\\n\r\n- Austin\\n\\n\r\nPS: I did this at 2 AM",

            "content": "The World God Only Knows, basically, is the world that only Keima knows. Even I, have no idea, what kind of delusion this man is living in, but it sure as hell is pretty funny. The best way to sum up this anime is - a touching, smart and nonsensical comedy, that leaves you feeling happy at the end of it.\r\nTL:DR\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nSound: 7/10\r\nCharacter: 7/10\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\r\nOverall: 7/10 (rounded up from 6.75)\r\nGood Points:\r\n+ Superb comic relief and funny scenes\r\n+ Interesting male lead\r\n+ Cute and irresistible female lead\r\n+ Good emotional / touching scenes\r\n+ Not overboard with the ecchi/harem theme\r\n+ Character growth in the four \"targets\" (Ayumi, Mio,Kanon, Shiori)\\n\r\n+ Great background art and music\\n\\n\r\nBad Points:\\n\r\n- Lack of character development and growth in the main cast\\n\r\n- Some lack of coherence in the later plot arcs\\n\r\n- Lack of overarching plot, or conflict\\n\r\n- Plot is straightforward and generally predictable\\n\r\n- At least 2 filler episodes (in a 12 episode anime? Yep, you bet'cha)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has four main story arcs, namely, the Ayumi arc, the Mio arc, the Kanon arc and the final Shiori arc. All of the arcs are distinct and special, even though the main idea of the anime - to make girls fall in love with Keima, by solving some life problem that they have - is remains consistent throughout. There is another side arc - the one about Sora arc in episode 4 but that only lasts one episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe Ayumi arc was, I have to say this, both funny and touching. I didn't expect much from this anime because it had so much to do with dating sims and the classic \"make a girl fall in love with you\" theme, that I thought it'd be completely unrealistic and stupid. Except that it wasn't. While it was nonsensical at times for the comic relief - most parts did seem realistic - and the way that Keima found out about Ayumi's \"fear\" and \"hesitation\", and the words that he used to move her heart, proved to be a bit of a plot twist in the first arc, and that was what made me continue watching this anime, despite it being a really \"uninteresting\" idea in my opinion. (+1 for coherence)\\n\\n\r\nThe Mio arc completely added onto the comic element of this anime, although it didn't add alot of depth. Mio was the typical tsundere, and it was easy to see how Keima would \"conquer her\", by simply doing transport service for her day after day until her heart softened and he could finally come to terms to talk - and dance - with her, under a romantic moonlit sky (oh the convenience). To be fair though, at this point the anime starts to lose a bit of coherence - especially the chauffeur who was following Mio around for no apparent reason. If her dad passed away just a day ago or something, I might understand, but the chauffeur was likely unemployed for quite sometime already, Mio couldn't possibly have been paying him.\\n\\n\r\nThen comes the Kanon arc where things start to make less and less sense. Kanon is somehow able to hold a rooftop concert everyday in school, without ever contacting any logistics personnel, no sound crew, no light crew, nothing. Just her and a stage, and somehow all the music and lights come on and things start playing - that's an absolute no go. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, so the idea that she turns \"invisible\" is linked to her characterization as feeling \"invisible\" all the time. I get it, but then why is it that she randomly turns from \"invisible\" to slightly translucent, so often? Is there a rule saying that you need to look harder or closer enough for her to be visible? Does she randomly vary between degrees of invisibility? Because she isn't completely invisible, she should be able to be seen based on the distortions of the background, and if she IS completely invisible, Keima shouldn't EVER be able to see her.\\n\\n\r\nNext, Kanon carries these stun guns that are completely for comic effect. Sure thing. But again - this made no sense, and she seems to have carried these guns for absolute fun and only ever uses them on Keima. I know it's for comic relief - but still - at least humour me by explaining it in a funny way, it was never really mentioned at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe Kanon arc was slightly deeper in nature though, than the previous two. The idea of an idol who feels lonely despite having so many fans - this is a real phenomena that felt completely natural. The way Keima realizes this is not very \"fascinating\", but the anime really put quite a lot of thought into developing the plot around Kanon - from all her fansign events, to her dramas, to her voice-acting schedules, as well as to her actual concerts. It felt like there was a deeper meaning behind just \"making Kanon fall in love with Keima\" it moved on to \"making Kanon believe in herself\" - especially when rejecting the kiss from Kanon - even though he still got it at the end, though. (+1 for depth)\\n\\n\r\nThe Shiori arc, the final arc as well, was slightly convoluted, but was I thought, the most interesting of all the arcs. A girl who doesn't talk at all, how the heck do you communicate with someone like that? While Keima's method - pissing her off, essentially - wasn't completely revolutionary, it was also mixed in with being sensitive, and understanding the shy girl under the pile of books. The deeper meaning is trying to understand the thoughts behind people's faces, even if they don't talk - it's possible to feel, to get a sensing of what the person behind the mask is thinking - by simply judging their actions and the way they act. (+1 for interest, +1 for depth)\\n\\n\r\nI can't say that any part of this arc is coherent though - from locking down an entire library that happens to have only 1 entrance, to drilling a hole through the roof, to the sheer scale of the library in comparison to the number of people inside it at any one particular time, why Shiori doesn't carry around a notebook with her to write down what she is trying to communicate - so I can't give it any points for that. Also, the resolution of the arc wasn't very substantial - all Keima really did was accompany her, then kiss her, and that should creep Shiori out, honestly, rather than make her fall in love with him - it was all too sudden and unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nThen we finally come to talk about the side arc - Sora's arc, about a buggy game tha Keima must, absolutely must, complete. No matter how many bugs there are in the game - Keima persists in completing it because it's not Sora's fault that the game she's stuck in sucks so bad that everyone else gave up on it. While it may merely just be a characterisation arc - the plot itself is interesting enough - when things seem impossible, will you try every possible way - until you beat it or you realize it really is impossible? Coherence is slightly out of the window - and Keima is honestly wasting his time on some stupid game - but that's how life is - we have options as choices, though not very clear-cut, the decisions we make determine our \"route\", and perhaps, just perhaps, there's always a way \"out\" of our problems, a way to reach our goals, if only we have the perseverance to try and try again. (+1 for depth)'\\n\\n\r\nAnd so to sum up, the story does have an overarching plot, but it is hardly developed. Elsie ends up catching 4 runaway spirits - but progress is unknown, and we're not sure how many more Keima must complete until he's finally free of the death collar. The plot itself though, if you look at it from a deeper perspective, is quite deep, though it fails on both coherence and level of interest - plot is generally predictable and not very ingenious.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Scene 0/2 - Nothing too exciting, but covers most of the characters\\n\r\nED Scene 2/2 - Interesting use of the paint to form a colourful picture of Keima\\n\r\nAnimation 3/3 - Absolutely love the cute animations used throughout the anime\\n\r\nAesthetics 3/3 - I really like the cute theme that the use, as well as all the bubbles and all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Theme 0/3 - Didn't like the OP theme at all, it's in poor english and wasn't catchy.\\n\r\nED Theme 3/3 - Absolutely loved the ED theme - it was happy, uplifting and catchy\\n\r\nBackground Music 2/2 - Some parts were annoying and repetitive, but mostly well done\\n\r\nAdditional themes 2/2 - Definitely enjoyed the Kanon arc's theme songs. Although they were cliche idol songs, they were great to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization is definitely pretty good in this anime - since it's quite character-centric. We'll start with the two main characters - Keima and Elsie.\\n\\n\r\nKeima is not your average hikkikomori/otaku character. Everyone treats him like a loser - and he kinda is a loser for excelling only in dating sims - but he's actually pretty smart, he's logical, he's also a thinker and there is a lot more to his moral / emotional side than just his cold exterior. His multi-faceted nature is what I really like about him. He tries to look cool, but he constantly loses it when Elsie drives him crazy. He doesn't have much of a back story though, and honestly shows very little growth throughout the anime - except from the fact that he accepts the fact that he can conquer real life girls as well as those in games. Keima doesn't come to any self-realization in this first season of the anime. (+1 for interesting, +1 for depth)\\n\\n\r\nElsie is your average, typical, hyperactive cute girl who does anything to make Keima happy. She puts in lots of effort - cleaning the house, making breakfast, even making a cake (lol) - not trying to win Keima's favour because she likes him or anything, but simply because she wants to be a good little sister to him (imouto). She's completely, cute innocent and irresistible. However, as a character, she doesn't have much depth to her at all. She doesn't show much growth - and we don't know much about her backstory - other than that she has an older sister who is WAAAY better than her.\\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters are not the focal point though, the girls in the arcs are. Ayumi, starts off as a girl who really wants to win in the track and field meet - and turns out to doubt herself, and her own ability to run. She hates Keima because he's a loser, and feels embarrassed whenever Keima puts up banners to support her. She feels like he is mocking her, but in the end, Keima shows that he understands her more than anyone else - and he shows legitimate care for her by buying her hampers and a pair of running shoes. (+1 for growth)\\n\\n\r\nMio Aoyama, at first pulling of the rich lady feel - suddenly turns around to actually being a poor girl living a rich lifestyle (in a shoddy apartment). She gets abandoned by her chauffeur, ends up having to use Keima Transport Services, and eventually picks up the will to use small change when buying things. Unfortunately, none of these changes/ character development is substantial enough to warrant any points - they are all very trivial and minor in nature. Her backstory, is also underdeveloped. We know that her father died and she isn't rich anymore, and that she enjoyed her time with her father, but her father didn't seem to teach her much, and we don't know exactly how she lived in the past when her father was around either, we can only assume she lived like a princess (in which case, wouldn't her mum start educating her that she can't live that way anymore?).\\n\\n\r\nKanon, the idol and rising star, who is only 16 years old, but probably is one of the best and youngest idols ever known, still struggles with identity and confidence issues ever since her earlier girl group - Citron - broke up (for very lame reasons, actually). Her character development and depth has got to be the most out of all the arcs - because her backstory is much more comprehensive and rich. It's not just random flashbacks like the previous few arcs - it's relationships that come back to find her as well - her former bandmates sent her flowers to congratulate her on performing on the stage, Citron always wanted to perform. Also, much character growth from always being unconfident - to having new found confidence in herself. (+1 for depth, +1 for growth)\\n\\n\r\nThen lastly, we have Shiori, who is the quiet, shy girl who is really, really hard to understand. They did spend a lot of time trying to develop her character though - there were many, many scenes of her and her past encounters with books and the library in general. It was basically her monologue-ing to herself about how she loves books, about why she loves books and why she can't live without books. What a bookworm. The growth she shows is quite apparent - she moves from being a shy, untalkative, loner, to becoming slightly more assertive, and more able to communicate with others. Still, her backstory is vague and unconvincing, and as a character, she's naive and uninteresting, given the number of books she has read - she must have learnt something from those books, but it looks like her maturity of thinking is nowhere near \"developed\" in anyway. (+1 for growth)\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, the character growth that is lacking in the main characters, are found in the supporting characters - but hopefully, the main characters get more character development in the coming few seasons. Also, most of the characters are rather \"cliched\" except for the main character, but it is likely that they are meant to be this way - following the dating sim idea. Character interactions though, are definitely solid. Though they may be very exaggerated, it was always enjoyable how the two main cast, and their \"mother\" clicked together. (+1 for interaction)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the most funniest animes I've watched. I couldn't stop laughing from episode 1-4, and those were definitely enjoyable. The comic element died down slightly from then on, but there were always so many absurd and nonsensical situations and really funny reactions between Keima and Elsie and their mother, that it definitely made for a very enjoyable watch. (+3 for comedy) \\n\\n\r\nInitially, I was pretty interested and excited to find out how Keima would convince / smooth talk / strategize to win over the girls he encountered, namely because of the first arc. But this excitement died down over time - and I found myself simply watching for the comic element, and nothing much else. It seemed like it was already a given that Keima would be successful in capturing all the girls that he was tasked to - and there were little problems / conflict doing so, so after the first two arcs, things became a lot less interesting. But, I did feel that all the kissing scenes involving Keima were all touching in their own special way, so  I thought that the anime played those out pretty well.\\n\r\n(+1 for excitement, +1 for emotion)\\n\\n\r\nPacing was definitely okay, although I thought that the first arc could be extended. If only the first episode could have been 45 mins or so - that would have been better than the very abridged first Ayumi arc that we had. The emotional bits were well emphasized, although I thought that for the final arc, the book scenes were abit too overwhelming. By the first series of Shiori flashbacks of her reading books - I basically got the gist of it \"she's a bookworm, I get it already! Can we move on now?\" (+2 for pacing)\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I have to give a miss for 1 point for the filler episode that is basically episode 8, and arguably, episodes 4 and 12, because all of these advanced the plot line in no reasonable way or fashion, and seemed completely out of the blue.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.75/10",

            "content": "This show is a really good one that has alot of rewatch value. Im still watching it but im in the middle, close to the end of the 3rd Season so its enough to give you a review especially since i cant spoil the ending of the last season, however at the end of the first and second seasons they let you know a following season is in the works, so i dont know if a 4th season is coming or not but it would be great if it was!\r\nSo this anime is based on the main character who is Keima Katsuragi. He is basicallythe Otaku of Video games, but the video games are only dating sims and Nothing Else! Hes a master at this genre of games.\\n\\n\r\nHe basically shut himself from the \"Real World\" but to understand what i mean by that you gotta watch it :P\\n\\n\r\nKeima....or Katsuragi as they call him, is a student who gets straight A's, so he plays his dating sim games during class and he gives no f***s,  and this pisses off his teachers, but he has his smarts to back him up.  Boss Level: ITS OVER 9000-\\n\\n\r\nOk lol, So one day hes playing his PFP (Shows version for a PSP) and he gets this message that gives him a contract and he accepted it. However this wasnt just an in game contract. \\n\\n\r\nAnd after this, a demon named Elsie: The cute girl with the skull shaped thing on her head, tells him the contract was to help her collect \"Loose Souls\" that have escaped from the depths of hell. These loose souls are located within various girls and in order to get rid of the souls he has to make those girls fall in love with him. \\n\\n\r\nHe does this one by one so it isnt a swarm type of harem and the love doesnt feel forced which is why i like it. Oh and if he doesnt do it both him and Elsie would die because when he accepted the contract, an explosive collar got attached to both of their necks. \\n\\n\r\nSo the story starts off with them both working together to capture these loose souls. Its pretty much like this in all the seasons so far but the 3rd season is a little different. And the information in this review is based on what i remember from the first season, and all of this happens in the first episode. The really good stuff starts during the episodes so i HIGHLY guarantee you to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nSounds like a boring review? Thats because i havent spoiled that much. The show is awesome and really funny so i guarantee you watch it. :)\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "Manga adaptations are, by and large, a double-edged sword.  On one hand they can be a guaranteed-profit venture for the production company, while on the other it can be incredibly difficult to capture the charm of the original work and can often leave us fans bitterly disappointed.  Being an avid fan of the original manga, it is needless to say that I expected a lot from the anime adaptation of The World God Only Knows (or TWGOK).  Unfortunately, it joins the long list of manga-turned-anime that have fallen just short.\r\nThe plot centres around Katsuragi Keima, known on the internet as the \u201cCapturingGod\u201d of galges (dating sims), who has no interest in the real world.  But this all changes when he accidently signs a contract with Hell, meaning he has to go around catching runaway spirits with the (admittedly cute) demon-in-training, Elsie.  These spirits hide inside the hearts of real girls and it is up to Keima to \u201ccapture\u201d their hearts and drive out these spirits.\\n\\n\r\nThe story overall is refreshing and unique.  Some of the situations that Keima and Elsie get into are genuinely hilarious, as are all the parodies of eroge stereotypes.  It is also quite faithful to the original manga.  However, it suffers from a major setback, and that is the short 12-episode container.\\n\\n\r\nYes, it has been confirmed that there will be a second season starting April 2011, but where does this leave the first season?  All in all it is an entertaining watch, but it\u2019s hard to look past the fact that by itself it is just a series of random \"captures\" with little-to-no plot development bar the first episode.  Some of the arcs seem unnecessarily dragged out, making the pacing a bit awkward.  Furthermore, Manglobe insisted on throwing filler episodes into the mix which completely bewildered me.  While it\u2019s true that these fillers (or breaks, or whatever you want to call them) are present in the original manga, in the anime they just served to intensify the shortfalls in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAs readers of the manga know these initial captures are just the introduction to the greater underlying storyline, and it\u2019s unfortunate that the anime adaptation had to finish a whole season without even touching on it.  For an anime series whose length will be determined by DVD/Blu-ray sales, Manglobe didn\u2019t do the franchise any favours with the 12 episode format and the fillers.\\n\\n\r\nAs looks go TWGOK is not too bad, but it\u2019s not great either.  The character designs are a little inconsistent, but they hold up to a good standard overall.  The colour palette is the standard comedy fare, as is the animation.  Some of the scenes seem overdone and there is very little use of light and shade.  But there are some good bits; the animation of Keima\u2019s theory scenes always got a laugh out of me and Kanon\u2019s concert sequences are also a highlight.  The final result is a slightly better than average looking anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe music one of the strengths of this anime.  The opening, composed especially for the show by Tenmon, is perfectly suited.  The full song being 8 minutes long, the parts not used for the opening sequence are used for background music in addition to some other instrumental tracks to add to the atmosphere.  While the soundtrack is a bit lacking in variety it suits the mood of the show very well.  The cast of seiyuu also do a surprisingly good job of portraying the characters despite there being no real standout performances.\\n\\n\r\nThe diverse range of characters is what really makes the TWGOK manga really stand out.  Katsuragi Keima is the enigmatic anti-hero, obsessed with his game world and disillusioned with the real world.  Wakaki subtly pokes fun at practically every single galge stereotype with Keima\u2019s flawed personality and the vast range of girls that Keima captures; tsunderes, yanderes, kuuderes, every other type of \u2013dere you can think of, and many more.  These elements have been retained in the anime, and Keima still shines though as a unique and thoroughly entertaining protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Elsie, who takes the role of the cute and quirky sidekick.  While it is always fun to see more of Elsie, sometimes a disproportionate chunk of screen-time is given to her and the capture targets.  The extra character development that this screen-time allows is welcome but it tends to unbalance the whole show.  The story should revolve around Keima, and at times the writers at Manglobe seem to lose sight of that fact.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the curse of the 12 episode container strikes again, meaning that we don\u2019t get to see any other recurring characters besides Keima and Elsie.  The lack of variety in the recurring cast hurts this anime pretty badly, which is a shame since more of these characters are due to be introduced right after the point where the season ended.  The lack of episodes also means that the anime fails to address Keima's motivation in all but the first episode, which trivializes his character somewhat.\\n\\n\r\nNow I have been fairly critical of TWGOK, though that is not to say that I didn\u2019t enjoy watching it.  It is, if nothing else, entertaining, and I recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good rom-com with a twist.  However, the simple fact is it could have been much better had they done a few things differently.  The current format does very little to attract new people to the franchise, and it will be a huge shame if the series is axed after the second season because of the mistakes they made in the first.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, bring on season two.  Here\u2019s hoping Manglobe learns from their mistakes.  Overall score: 7.2/10 (rounded to 7)",

            "content": "This anime adaptation is a fucking disgrace to the manga.\r\nI have followed the manga since its very start and have enjoyed it very much. I'll stretch out as far as saying it is a masterpiece, ranking as one of my favorite mangas of all time. Then there is the anime.\r\nAs you have already noticed, I'm already annoyed how the anime turned out. I'm gonna rip and analyze one point of the time, and we're gonna start straight on...\r\nKeima: This is the main character. He is, as the title implies, a God. The God of Galge Gaming, or that's at least what he should be. Inthe manga, he was bitchin' cold to everyone else and showed no interests for real girls. Because 2D-girls was his thing, due to his world consisting ONLY of galges. So when he got forced by Else to do all the captures, he simply accomplished his tasks and moved straight back to his galge gaming. He was asocial. The forced tasks were simply business with no personal emotions attached. This made him cool, or perhaps even godlike because he was unlike any other spineless romance comedy main characters. This coolness aura was completely swiped away when he fucking BLUSHED IN THE VERY FIRST EPISODE OF THE ANIME. That might sound trivial to you, but that single element alone killed his cool personality. He was reduced to yet another one of the countless male main characters in comedy romances who blush by every little thing the girls say. He was made weak, and it ticked me off. And also, it doesn't help when he has the voice which sounds like every other pussy male main character in comedy romances. By the way he acted in the manga, which is in a godlike, intelligent way, he should have gotten a voice that corresponded to those characteristics. Maybe something like Lelouch (that's not a perfect match, but you get the idea). But back to the blushing. Keima blushed for the first time far into the manga, and that signaled a character development. But since he blushed in the very first episode, he would receive zero character development. Luckily, he wasn't totally stripped of his personality. One example of that is that he is still gaming most of his time in the anime. But that alone isn't very redeeming.\\n\\n\r\nFillers: Really? They had 12 episodes to go on and they dared to use three episodes for fillers. That's just a fuckin' waste when you have shitloads of chapters to use from the manga. I DO NOT WANT TO SEE AN ENTIRE EPISODE DEDICATED TO ELSIE. GOD. And if that wasn't enough, some of the episodes with content from the manga were unnecessarily stretched out, like the Kanon-arc. You know what? In the first chapter of the manga, the first girl Ayumi, kissed Keima of her own will. But in the anime, they fuckin' \"accidently\" fell down the stairs and that resulted in a kiss. That is one of the very many cliches the mangaka wanted to avoid, and here it is in the anime. I suspect that all these decisions on fillers, whether on a smaller or bigger scale, were aimed to please a specific crowd of the audience. And for that, I hate.\\n\\n\r\nVoices and sound: I've already ranted on Keima's voice, so we'll leave that be. However, all the other voices were as I had imagined in the manga, or at least approximately, so that was good. I wasn't too fond of the OP, though. I applaud for making it different than your average comedy romance OPs. I liked the ED more, as it was imaginitive and colorful.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, they followed the story fairly decent. In general, I liked the animation and the colors the studio went for.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY: Fillers, fillers everywhere. Okay, not everywhere, but I had to pull that meme out. Keima was the pillar of the series, and because his personality got butchered, the anime fell apart. Go read the manga. It's so much better.\\n\\n\r\nPS: If you want to dislike my review or whatever, give me constructive critisicm on my page.",

I personally enjoyed KamiNomi as its like watching the ending of your favourite anime, Where the protagonists finally manages to get the girl as to say. and this anime is filled with those \"endings\". 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt : The art style isn't anything new or unique to this anime as is may as well be similar to any other anime out there, But like I would say \"If it's not broken don't fix it\". Animation nice and clean, easy to understand , 8/10 is my standard score for a generally well done animation, 10/10 are usually for the anime's that have their own unique art styles that work, (it gives the studio that sort of recognizable style)\\n\\n\r\nSound : (Original Japanese Dub) Good work done by the voice actors, the characters sound like they should,(as in the voice fits the look of the character).\\n\r\nThe sound effects are nothing special but they work. 10/10 \\n\r\n(May skim through the series again in the English Dub to rate it) \\n\\n\r\nCharacters : The Main characters are mildly developed (personal opinion) there is still a lot of room for the viewers to get to know the characters better, The other characters that our main characters interact have their own back-story's  and the viewers will actually get to know them better then they know the main characters themselves,( really trying hard to not give any spoilers). 7/10 cause I feel more connected to the sub characters than the main. and would like to see more of them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : I personally enjoyed this from the plot to how it was executed, looking forward to watching the second season. It's refreshing to see a sort of harem slice of life anime not be ecchi for once, Looking forward to watching the next season. 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nOverall :- Story was well executed wouldn't have it any other way wish they could have developed their main characters a little more, \\n\r\nArt style nothing new though works well, Sound doesn't need to be any better for the sort of anime it is,voices work well (Japanese Dub). \\n\r\nCharacters we well designed left me wanting to see the sub characters get more screen time in the next season. Enjoyment had fun watching it, lack of ecchi scenes makes it more family friendly, 8/10 could be improved in some areas though is a great anime anyway. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Quick note, considering that there aren't many differences or changes between either of the first two seasons in any category, and it'd be kind of pointless to do two separate reviews that say the exact same thing, this review with be covering the first two seasons of The World God Only Knows. There will however be a separate review for the third season at some point in the future. Now that that's out of the way, please enjoy the review.\r\nYou know, i'm pretty sure that i'd be hard pressed to find many anime fans that aren't also gamers, at least to some degree. After all,the two cultures have always blended well in the past. But right now i want to talk about a specific type of game, visual novels. Visual novels are a type of video game that are basically interactive stories, you play through listening to the story unfold and occasionally you make choices that decide how the story will play out. There are some that are popular on an international level such as the Shin Megami Tensei franchise and Ace Attorney: Phoenix Wright, but it's only in Japan where visual novels have a strong popularity and a wide variety of games taking up the market. So the idea of making an anime/manga series where the concepts of visual novels are a large part of the story and characters doesn't exactly seem so farfetched. In comes The World God Only Knows, which implements the idea of these games into the harem genre to make an anime that has spawned quite a popularity since it's debut. But does it follow the plan that leads us to a happy ending or a dead end? \\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a teenage boy named Keima Katsuragi who is obsessed with games, specifically visual novels of the dating sim variety. He has the uncanny ability to be able to capture the hearts of every girl in his games with ease earning him the title of God of Conquest. One day, however, he receives a strange email asking if he can truly capture the heart of any girl he chooses. Keima, considering it a challenge, replies yes, accepting the challenge, when all of a sudden a young girl named Elucia de Lute Ima, Elsie for short, appears out of thin air claiming that she is a demon from hell and that he has just signed a contract with her. The contract states that he will be her partner in capturing the loose souls that have escaped from hell and have found host bodies in other people, primarily women, and if he refuses to do so then he will lose his head, literally, and Elsie, being bonded with him, will also die. So now Keima has to use his extensive knowledge of dating sims to make these girls fall in love with him, to fill the emptiness in their hearts and kick the invading soul out. And that's basically it for the first two seasons, Keima and Elsie find a girl who's carrying a loose soul, Keima seduces her, they kiss, the loose soul is captured, and through the element of plot convenience, the girl forgets all about the conquest so Keima can move on to the next girl without being considered an adulterous asshole. Throw in a couple filler episodes and that's it. Still, despite it's formulaic and repetitive nature, it's actually quite entertaining. The different heroine arcs are well executed, the humor is always silly, and i was never bored with the show. And i think one thing that makes it all work is that the show is in fact, a parody of visual novels. It kind of pokes fun at just how predictable and unrealistic they can be, but it's never mean spirited, always choosing silly humor over scathing criticism, which makes the show very lovable. However it does bring up some questions. How did Keima get tricked into the contract when he never signed a contract, he just pressed a button on an email? That's not exactly something that would hold up in court hell or otherwise. Also while the girls do lose all their memories, it's kind of hard to not say that Keima is cheating on them when he never actually breaks up with anyone. And it's hard not to say that the show isn't just a bit hypocritical when it says, more than once mind you, that reality and fiction are two separate things, yet Keima always succeeds in seducing women with what he's learned from his games, things that would never really help in the real world. Honestly it's best to not try to use your mind to much during the show, or else you'll be wondering why your laughing at an antisocial teenage boy manipulating women into falling in love with him, only to make out with him, force them to forget their memories, and move on to the next girl to do the same exact thing, and all with the help of a demon ad the powers of hell.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe World God Only Knows along with all of sequels and OVAs were done by studio Manglobe. The thing about Manglobe, is that they're great when it comes to action shows, Deadman Wonderland, Samurai Champloo, and Ergo Proxy are all perfect examples of this. But for everything else, they're mostly just decent. Overall, The World God Only Knows is a good looking show but there's nothing really special about it. The only notable thing is it's style. Despite the fact that the show does have a default style that it uses most of the time, they'll often change the style for the sake of gag humor, which was actually quite nice. I was never bored with the visuals because of their ever changing nature and often times, it tended to work in their favor for more comedic results. One last quick tip, when going into the show, be prepared for bright colors. Seriously, trying to watch this side by side with a show like Texhnolyze like i did, so freaking jarring.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is definitely the most impressive part of the show. They could have easily put in a couple of bouncy catchy j-pop numbers and be done with it, but they put some time and effort into it, resulting in some very nice orchestral pieces. The song that plays during the final stage of a conquest in particular, always left me on a good note. Although you will probably have the song \"Happy Crescent\" sung by the heroine Kanon stuck in your head for a week after watching the first season. Another thing that should be brought up are the openings, both of which are done by a group called Oratorio and are each quite good. But i'd like to specifically mention the opening to the first season, often regarded as the best opening by fans, called \"God Only Knows\", however the part we hear in the show is only a small snippet of a nine minute long epic, which is worth giving a full listen too. To quickly regard sub vs. dub on this, i'm going to suggest going with sub. For the dub, Chris Patton does great as Keima, and Luci Christanson is acceptable as Elsie, but that's about it. Besides, if you choose the dub, then you miss out on the heroine Shiori delivering her famous \"baka/aho\" lines, which i consider to be some of the greatest delivered lines in the Japanese language.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the main pull for a large chunk of fans of the show is the God of Conquest himself, Keima Katsuargi, whose kind of what you'd get if Lelouch Lamperourge was an eccentric otaku. Keima is basically the opposite of what you would expect from a harem protagonist. Where the average harem protagonist is average in every way and only gets girls by being extremely kind, Keima is an intelligent and handsome young man who puts plenty of work and effort into winning over his target. But that also brings up another point of his character, in his eyes, the girls are nothing more than missions that he needs to accomplish. He has been nothing but disappointed by reality and seeks solace in the games that he's so obsessed with, because of this he's an antisocial problem student, and an outcast to his peers. He looks at everything the way he would look at a game, so rather than winning over women with a genuine kindness and understanding, he manipulates them through scripts and planned situations, caring more about getting the conquests over with so he can go back to playing games rather than the girls own happiness. But still, he is still a good person underneath it all and had shown the occasional subtle moment where it seems he does care about the girls he conquers and is also bothered by his own personal situation. Then there's the demon from hell Elsie. I'm not even gonna poke around the bush, Elsie is freaking adorable, everyone who's seen the show knows it and i'm not even going to deny it. She herself doesn't have all that much to do with the conquests, only showing up to capture the loose souls when they're kicked out of the host body. She instead takes the role of Keima's little sister, doing everything in her power to impress him and make him happy just for a little bit of praise, but often fails either because of her own ditzy nature or Keima's stand-offish nature. Also she has a weird obsession with firetrucks. I don'y know why she does or how it's relevant to the series but goddammit it's adorable. The only other character worth mentioning is Haqua du Lot Herminium, Elsie's colleague and friend from hell who also captures loose souls that was introduced in season 2. Haqua is very prideful, not coming from a noble family and instead rises to the top through hard work and determination, but because of this is unwilling to admit her own faults and, at first, doesn't choose to openly acknowledge Elsie as a friend, despite treasuring their friendship. There's not really much to say about the rest of the prominent characters are the heroines and they can basically be summed up with a trope, such as athlete, rich girl, and book worm. Still the show does like to mix things up a little bit by adding new twists to their tropes, like the rich girl is actually poor, or by having the loose souls give the girls powers, like having a personality literally escaping from a girl. But even so, none of the characters outside the heroines really get any development and are basically the same people they were when they were first introduced, and the development that the heroines get are fairly predictable and melodramatic. Still by the end of the series you will most likely have your own favorite heroine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) Overall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nYou know those series that you can never consider a personal favorite for one reason or another, but you still love to death for one reason or another. Well for me, The World God Only Knows is one of those series. Yes it's formulaic and simple, but it's always entertaining, and the characters are still memorable. But you should take to mind that this series is not one to be taken to seriously. It's mostly silly and even the melodrama is there for parody rather than emotion. There's not real drama to be found in this series...at least, not until season 3. But that's a review for another day. Until then, remember to find your ideal route in life, because i can see the ending....No i really can't but that'd be pretty cool though wouldn't it.",

            "content": "It\u2019s funny how a parody somehow has license to nab the actual appeal of its subject matter.  It\u2019s almost unfair, and that\u2019s exactly what Kami Nomi does.  Lets be honest, dating sims are sexist, treating girls like puzzles to be cracked, and those who would never touch such a game can appreciate how this series exaggerates its common character archetypes and lampoons them.  The final romantic moments though are completely straight faced, and at times, somewhat touching as they should be in a dating sim.  A satisfying romance this is not, but it is riotous, with a few sweet moments onthe rare occasion.\\n\\n\r\nKeima is a high school student dubbed \u201cThe God of Conquest\u201d due to his proficiency in beating dating sims.  He is popular amongst dating sim players on the net, but his classmates find him disgusting.  He is issued a challenge by a mysterious sender and as soon as he hits reply, the demon Elsee comes to him telling him he\u2019s already signed a contract.  Keima must displace wandering souls (who only take refuge in high school girls\u2019 hearts?) by inspiring love in the hosts\u2019 heart.  If he fails, both he and Elsee will be guillotined.  To save his life, Keima must become a real pickup artist, even though he\u2019s never even held a girl\u2019s hand.  To avoid complications, the girls he picks up promptly forget about him after the climactic kiss that liberates them, allowing him to move onto the next target without breaking any hearts (except maybe his own\u2026awww).\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough, all his moves in the dating sims work just as well in real life.  Keima isn\u2019t a smooth talker, James Bond type.  He uses a somewhat creepy, perhaps slightly endearing earnestness.  It\u2019s usually an over the top, \u201cthat guy is way too into me\u201d kind of thing.  He also has a great talent in that he can say the cheesiest, cruelest, or most socially unacceptable things with a straight face.  The girls are all overblown clich\u00e9\u2019s with comedic exaggerations or twists thrown in.  A wealthy, slightly sadistic ojousama, an athletic girl, a pop idol, and a quiet librarian are the primary story arcs.  Keima coldly observes them and calculates the best way to wriggle his sleezy self into their hearts.  The girls have some burden that they endure, so Keima tests the waters until he understands their issues, then with his love (bleh!), he resolves it.\\n\\n\r\nThe climaxes are similar to those of dating sims.  In one instant, the girls\u2019 problems are solved, and the romance is sealed with a kiss.  The Ojousama and Idol ones were particularly cute, but the highlight is always the journey itself, which is anything but typical.  Keima often gets shot down in the most hilarious ways.  Unphased and undaunted, he will continue to proceed with his ridiculous plans.  On his very first target, the athlete, he hangs banners of love and praise down the side of the school building, and just stands beside them without the slightest hint of embarrassment.  She beats him, insults him, ignores him, but he persists.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is usually solid.  The character designs are truly generic (as intended no doubt), but the dancing, singing, and soul capturing sequences are all exceptionally well animated.  The playful orchestral piece really adds a lot of romantic atmosphere to the climaxes, and the music overall is good.  There are several pop songs (some of them quite funny) written just for the series but they often insist on playing them for the full duration.  The idol arc itself contains maybe 3-5 music video sequences.  They do drag a bit, but that\u2019s a minor complaint.\\n\\n\r\nKami Nomi is funny in so many ways.  The parody of dating sims and Anime girls in general is just the beginning.  Keima\u2019s campy cheese (one example: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about rank.  You\u2019re already first\u2026in my heart\u201d) is ceaselessly amusing as well.  The hilarity of the side characters, Keima\u2019s mother, Elsee, and others is just a plus.\\n",

            "content": "I present to you: The character most of us wish to be, but never will be due to the fact we lack the funding, and the determination. Katsuragi Keima can be considered a true otaku, a man who has given up on reality and instead focuses on nothing but dating sims and VNs. But of course, that would make for a rather boring premise, so let's add some demons to it. ==(Minor) Spoilers Ahead==\r\nNow, when I first heard about \"The World God Only Knows\", I thought it was going to be about a guy who's addicted to dating sims and nothing else. And when Iheard it includes demon girls and soul hunting, I wasn't very interested. I mean, after all, what kind of plot is that supposed to be? But alas, I was once again shown how wrong I could be, especially after having watched the first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis lovely and silly anime focuses on Katsuragi Keima, a guy with a huge passion for virtual girls, taken to a level where real life girls don't even faze him anymore. Thanks to that, he's known on the net as the \"God of Conquest\", and helps out people with their dating sim-related issues. Until one day, he accepts a \"challenge\" via mail and is suddenly bound by a contract to catch runaway spirits from Hell together with a demon girl named Elsie (or Elucia, or Elle-chan, but oh well). How does one catch these spirits, you may ask? Our lovely otaku has to drive them away from the hearts of people, because these souls look for gaps (weaknesses, emptiness) in them. And with people, I of course mean girls. And with driving away, I mean make them fall in love with him. And he does exactly that, with his dating sim skills, and he somehow manages to make it work.\\n\\n\r\nNow that that's out of the way, let's focus on the main points.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is great. Although it's nothing special, it fits with today's style and is nicely done in general. It doesn't stand out, but it doesn't have to be. It's perfect just the way it is... Yeah, I can't really say anything else. One note: The facial expressions from time to time are amazingly cute, so be careful.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nThe OP. Nuff said, really. But all kidding aside, the OST is great. It fits very well with the atmosphere of the anime, and is a great moodsetter. In the right way, that is. The OP, like I said before, is possibly one of the most intriguing I've ever heard. I wouldn't call it the best, because broken English isn't really my thing, but it's captivating, and I often find myself listening to it again. It also fits the title quite well, along with several other songs from the OST, with their god-like feel mixed into it.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWell, the story is quite unique, in my opinion. Some say that it's a combination of several plots, but it was amazingly executed. There wasn't a single moment where I got bored by the anime, and unlike others I've watched, I didn't even hesitate to watch the next episode... Which ended up in me watching the last episode at 3AM on a wednesday, but oh well. Fact is, it kept me glued to my seat, and the story progression was nice, fluent and not at all repetitive. And as an avid lover of comedies, this sure hit the spot nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nKeima is a character you expect to find in the background. He doesn't care about anything in the real world, and often finds himself frowned upon by fellow students and teachers. He's the typical shut-in without any friends. Putting a character like him in the shoes of an MC, and giving him a partner may be risky, but the author made it work. Not only that, they did an amazing job at it too.\\n\\n\r\nElsie, who has been assigned as his demon partner, is... Well, an airhead. A rather typical one, at that. She's funny, silly, and a bit stupid. Putting her next to a serious and superficial guy like Keima might make for a funny comedy routine, but instead it balanced the pairing up nicely, with one solving the puzzles and keeping a calm mood when necessary, whereas the other is just being herself, acting all goofy, but also providing a hand and helping out at the right time. I haven't seen a pair with a balance that worked well in a while, so it was quite nice to see it again.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the support cast, there's something about them that I love a lot. And that's that they all have unique character traits. This is actually a very important plot element, which is sorta given away in my earlier description of the anime, but it makes it that instead of the usual bland background characters, we get a bunch that actually feel like they add to the story. Nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\n\"The World God Only Knows\" tries to be different by giving us a main character that doesn't care about anyone else, yet is forced to help out others by performing acts that he has never done before. Although this isn't a fresh idea, it's all about how well you play it out. And with this anime, I think they hit it just right, and provided us with some lovely characters, good art, fine music and an overall great experience. It gives us the hope that otakus aren't bound by a fate of screens and the internet, but instead have the ability to communicate with members of the opposite sex... Nah, I'm exaggerating a bit, but you get the point. A shut-in who manages to sway every girl he has set his eyes on is quite the unique concept, in my opinion. And once again, they did a great job executing this concept. It's funny and silly, but at the same time passionate and gripping when it has to be. He lives in \"The World Otakus Dream Of\", you might say.\\n",

            "content": "\"Games are games. Reality is reality. Those who try to compare the two are the ones who can't tell the difference.\"\r\nSo I said that to my mom and she called me a stupid kid, but whatever.\r\nIMPORTANT: This is a review (not really a review, more like a PLS WATCH THIS) on the ENTIRE SERIES, not just season 1.\r\nThe World A God Only Knows, a unique series that combines the themes of gaming, otaku nature, dating sims, and real life relationship problems. Add an adorable demon girl into the mix and you get to this thing, a 3 season long ride of awkward and hilarious moments.\\n\\n\r\nI love this show, and I think it's definitely worth the time to watch the entire thing. The interactions between Keima, the otaku and nerdy protagonist, and the real world are definitely a spectacle for your mind. The thing about this show is that the humor is really variable, ranging from awkward ecchi moments, hilarious voice acting, amazing character interactions, Elsie's facial expressions, funny skit-like moments during filler episodes, and more. This show has something for everyone to laugh at, and it's amazing how they fit so much comedy into a show that still has an interesting story with amazing characters that have relatable and beautiful backstories. \\n\\n\r\nThe World God Only Knows isn't perfect. No anime is. But the amount of enjoyment this series brings overshadows any flaw that it has. While some watch anime to analyze them and write reviews, most watch anime for personal enjoyment and experiences. I feel that people read anime reviews to determine which anime will be worth watching. The World God Only Knows brings plenty of enjoyment, and I recommend it to those who want a lovely funny series with some heartwarming and bittersweet moments. Trust me, this show can conduct the feels train pretty well too.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Has humor for everyone. \\n\r\n- Elsie is literally the most adorable thing.\\n\r\n- Cocky protagonist with a lot of personality. He's almost mysterious in a way.\\n\r\n- Episodic (arc-sodic?), with each girl having their own story and their own arc, but it's all still part of a bigger story.\\n\r\n- Each character has a beautiful and relatable backstory, and you will find one to sympathize and relate with.\\n\r\n- A lot of funny references to other animes. I can recall references to The Girl who Leapt Through Time and D-Frag.\\n\r\n- Amazing music.\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Some characters only play a role in their arc, while others go on to contribute more to the main story. That inequality though ;-;\\n\r\n- Elsie ends up playing less and less of a role as the series goes on, which sucks cause she's my favorite character.\\n\r\n- MC sometimes pisses me off xD \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nLike Amagami SS, it's a mainly episodic (arc-sodic) show, but TWGOK still has each arc contributing to the main story. While the background main story isn't really special and isn't really relevant till the last season, each arc is like their own little beautiful tale. They give off their own unique auras, and just like the humor in this show, each different story will suit to different tastes. I personally found enjoyment in all of them.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art isn't especially high quality, but the way they use art for comedic purposes is amazing. For example, changing the art style to parody another anime series, or giving Elsie or another character the most hilarious or adorable face, all of these little gems that the art created really made the show more enjoyable for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe OPs for each season are really unique but still catchy, and since there is an idol character, there are a lot of catchy songs in this anime. But the main piece that really got me hooked into the OST of this series is the \"You may now kiss the bride\" theme that plays in each arc. The shivers it sent down my spine, what a beautiful piece.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThe best part of this anime is the characters. The characters aren't just the bread and butter, they are also the orange juice, fried egg, sausage, and muffin that you have with this glorious breakfast. Every character has likable qualities, and every character has flaws. They all have their own problems and their back stories, and their ways of coping with it. I sympathized with so many of the characters that the end of an arc felt like the end of a long emotional anime to me. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nThis anime was definitely one of my most enjoyable ones. I watched all 3 seasons back to back within a week, and never in the middle have I ever felt like taking a break from it. Each arc made me emotional, and it was an unforgettable experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nWhile this show isn't known for having one big story, which might throw off some people, I believe that the stories of each arc is more than enough to make this show worthy of watching. I already miss seeing Elsie derping around on my screen.",

            "content": "The World God Only Knows Season 1\r\nStory:\r\nThe World God Only knows follows the life of an avid \u2018dating simmer; called Keima Katsuragi aka The God of Conquest (because there is no dating sim he cannot beat,) although he is known as The God of Conquest on the net he is a dweeb or nerd in school (otoumegane a derogatory term mixed with otaku and glasses) who sees the world he lives in as imperfect choosing his games over reality. One day he is given a challenge by an unknown person asking him to conquer a girl accepting this request he actually signed a contract witha demon to help a demon capture loose souls, he meets a girl names Elsie who is the demon he has to help however refuses to capture loose souls when told he has to make them fall in love with him and kiss him (because he hates real girls), he is persuaded when he is told that he will lose his head if he doesn\u2019t cooperate with the contract. So Keima begins his quest to capture the loose souls.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nThe Animation in this anime is quite interesting because it shows certain types, firstly the eyes, there are two kinds of eyes in this anime the hawk eyes which are used mainly for boys and some girls who are either have tough or cold personalities. The other eyes are the moe eyes with are large and round and seen with most girls who have soft, cute, shy or moe personalities. The hair is also another key part, like most anime\u2019s of its time it has little detail in the hair using mainly different shades rather than drawing detail into each strand the actual anime is quite good it use small amount of features and a large amount of digital shading which is clever although when the chibi\u2019s are made it doesn\u2019t work as well, otherwise this is very nice animation and the style although similar to other is still quite unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe audio in this anime varies from the different themes for each character and heroine to the music for chibi characters, Firstly each character has his/her own theme to name each theme would take too long however each theme will show the characters personality or feeling. The chibi music varies from when some does a mistake or if a scene is changing other than that is the opening theme \u2018god only knows\u2019 and the ending theme \u2018koi no shirushi\u2019 both these themes go well with the anime, the op give a view of Keima\u2019s personality as a God of Dating Sims and the ending gives a kind of moe/cute look on the heroine throughout the season also both the opening and ending show all the heroines that are in that particular season so you can get a glimpse of what is to come.\\n\r\nMain Characters:\\n\r\nThe first season of TWGOK (The World god Only Knows) was quite interesting, not many anime\u2019s since this time had looked at an otaku\u2019s point of view, this interested many, with Keima he showed many characteristics and had a very strong view of the world around him as he found it full of flaws and imperfections, realizing this was never to change he lives in the world of his games. If we look at it this started at an early age where he would spend all his time with games (mainly Dating Sims). However even though he lives his life in his games he shows many important lessons to be learnt, he has ideals and shows a large amount of wisdom about this by giving many example to Elsie about dating sims in riddle which she can\u2019t understand, before he met Elsie (Erushi or Elli etc.) he was very happy with his games, he sees the demon as a burden on his as he is steadily dragged into the real world by a demon. However as we see to the conclusion of this season we see that he has changed slightly, he seems more willing however this is mostly to get rid of Elsie. Now we look at Elsie call her what you like however she is a very important character, she sees Keima as a god/brother even though he really isn\u2019t, she shows a large amount of loyalty to him witch is strange when you look a previous demon anime\u2019s who are exactly the opposite, as Keima quotes (in translated English) when you look at her she doesn\u2019t look like a demon but when she does anything it\u2019s like Beelzebub incarnate, this may not be an exact translation but you get the picture. When we look to Elsie\u2019s past we don\u2019t see much if not any during the second season however it seems they were avoiding it in both the manga and anime so that until we got a good glimpse of her character before we went headlong into a backstory (which in my view is a clever ploy to extend the manga and anime). This first season with its heroines is really just mainly setting up for the arc that is to come; it is an overview of the main characters and their respective personalities as well as the current arc\\n",

            "content": "The story is exactly as you'd expect from the synopsis - light-hearted episodic fare (each girl he has to conquer takes 1-2 episodes) with comedic elements. \r\nWith only 12 episodes and having to devote time to building up the personality of the targeted girl up so the audience cares about them, there is very little time for development of the main characters (Keima and Elsie). Character development does not go beyond the minimum required to set up the story as it is a short series, but it is sufficient. (I have since watched season 2 and there is significantly more development of the main charactersthere). \\n\\n\r\nWhat I enjoyed the most was Kami nomi's commentary and insights into the Dating Simulation genre (which are also applicable to anime). As a prodigy at dating sims, the main character periodically explains the characteristics of the various girl archetypes found in these games, what you need to do to win them, as well as the structure of how dating sims function. The girls he has to save usually fall into the typical stereotypes (sporty-type, princess-type, tsundere, etc) with a twist, so that Keima has to use his knowledge of dating sims, but adapt it to fit into the real world. \\n\\n\r\nI also liked how the director changes the pace of different episodes, based on the type of girl being chased: for example, when the target is a bookish-type, the episode is more slow paced with a lot of inner monologue.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think a passing familiarity with harems and Japanese games is needed to appreciate this anime fully. I would not recommend it to someone who has just started watching anime or is unfamiliar with Japanese games as many of the sight gags and plays on tropes would just go over their heads and all you would be left with is a semi-interesting story of a gaming genius using his video game knowledge in the real world.",

            "content": "*Note: this is a review for all 3 seasons. There may be minor spoilers but I'll warn you if I'll be mentioning one. I have also finished the manga as well so there might be some manga influences in my review (I will try to only focus on the anime though).*\r\nAfter watching three seasons of The World God Only Knows (TWGOK), I'm left with one thought: I wish I have Keima's pick-up skills when he is conquering a girl. Maybe I should try picking up dating sims.\r\nHaving watched a few romance anime (and also a fan of the romance genre), it gets tiring to seea relationship just between two people, or occasionally a love triangle. Harems are the answer to that but it's tricky to write a good story juggling so many  characters. Then, we have TWGOK. This anime combines elements from the couple relationship and the harem structure to create a grand act of conquering individual girls at a time. If you came looking for many types of ladies, TWGOK has them all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in the first two seasons are relatively simple. Keima is a good-looking video game God, or rather specifically, a God of dating simulations. Romance is his oxygen and he gets it by breathing in dating simulation after dating simulation. Despite his Brad Pitt-like looks, he adamantly believes the best girls are found in the 2D world. One day while conquering a 2D girl, he is forced into a contract with a demon, (no, not like Death Note demon but a rather much cuter one) named Elsie, to extract wandering souls that have taken refuge inside a human. In order to extract the hidden soul, he must \"conquer\" a girl or, in other words, make her fall in love with Keima. The catch is that each girl he conquers has her memory erased of the conquest. Although there are many girls to conquer, Keima is not short of unique ways to win her heart. So strap yourselves in your seat. You will be taken on one fast romantic ride.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in the third season takes a different approach than the first two seasons. Due to the difference, I'll be marking things about the third season as a light spoiler because perhaps you don't want to know how the story changes. So, feel free to skip down to END LIGHT SPOILER marking. However, I will not spoil anything about the third season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---BEGIN LIGHT SPOILER---\\n\\n\r\nThe third season marks the beginning of the shift in the story. Keima is still conquering the ladies but rather than being all light-hearted like in the first two seasons, this season highlights much more character development for Keima. The story has many more \"feelsy\" moments and more supernatural elements to it. At this point, it definitely shows the writer's own story rather than continuously poking fun at other romance stories. This defining aspect is a reason why the third season is the highest rated out of all three seasons. To provide a little teaser for/incentive to watch the third season, I will say that having conquered so many different types of girls, he is bound to find someone he admires.\\n\\n\r\nBut the bad thing about the third season is that it skips crucial story information. So before starting the third season, I strongly suggest reading the manga, in particular, after you finish season 2, start on chapter 41 in the manga and you can either go all the way to chapter 113, the start of season 3, or watch the OVAs \"Yonin to Aidoru\" (chapter 54-55) and \"Tenri Arc\" (chapter 57-65) and start the manga from there. The manga is a really fun read and covers even more interesting characters that the anime does not.\\n\\n\r\n---END LIGHT SPOILER--- \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes TWGOK stand out for me is that the writer is not afraid to use the standard character types: the quiet type, the athletic, the Tsundere, etc. In fact, there is little to no outstanding characteristics about each of our characters. Further, the anime has a great time poking fun at the romance anime that stretches for, say, 12-24 episodes when the actual romance/action can actually be condensed into 2 episodes. Indeed, TWGOK is a parody of most romance anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nLike I previously mentioned, the characters aren't particularly outstanding, except for Keima and perhaps Elsie. Keima is a relatively normal high school student who plays tons of dating simulators. But when he is on his courting A-game, he becomes a smooth-talking Channing Tatum minus the muscles. I am not sure if I can apply his methods to 3D girls (well, maybe but with a restraining order at the end) but it is damn entertaining to watch. \\n\r\nElsie is a fun but mostly clueless demon partner. What she does is basically identifying where the wandering demon is hiding and securing it in a bottle. Of course, since these demon partners are visible to all mortals, Elsie pretends she is Keima's sister and lives with him. How Keima's mother doesn't mind, well it's pretty comedic, but it's not really important because Elsie is a great cleaner and she is an awesome sister as well.\\n\\n\r\nWe do not learn much about each girl except for some surface details, which is a bummer. They are pretty interesting people if you continue with the manga but probably due to production issues/time constraints, the anime was not able to develop their interesting aspects. So if you are going to stick with the anime, each girl will either be a hit or a miss for you. Nevertheless, the anime does a good job of highlighting the particular traits of each girl. \\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, there is nothing out of the ordinary about the artwork. Keima has a relatively simple character design while Elsie gets a floating pink scarf (a.k.a. a hagoromo) and a cool skull spirit detector as a \"hair pin.\" The what I call \"derpy moments,\" or funny moments, are comically drawn. If you have seen a lot of romance anime, you would know what those climactic kiss moments are like and TWGOK is not lacking any of those. If you do not know what I am referring to, it is basically the moment when the male protagonist takes the hand of the girl and pulls her into his arms in slow mo for that eventful kiss. It's super clich\u00e9 but it's sure darn funny to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is nothing to rave about except maybe for the opening theme of all three seasons. They are sung in English and executed very well. Sung in a monastery style, it definitely reflects the fact that we are watching an episode of God in action. I always watch anime subbed so for the first few episodes of season 1, my ears could not believe that I was listening to an OP sung in English. But I eventually ended up liking the OP, especially the one for season 3. The ending theme was also well done.\\n\\n\r\nTWGOK is one fun ride. It has the laughs, the romance, and most importantly, it has the God. I think I may have picked up a thing or two about getting a girl to like me. Hopefully I didn't miss any disclaimers about the anime, like \"Don't try this at home.\" Anyway, this anime may not be for you if you absolutely loathe clich\u00e9 character types but if you like romance and comedy, or a light-hearted anime, definitely give TWGOK a look (and its manga as well)!\\n\\n\r\nLet me know what you thought of TWGOK! Which girl did you think was the best? Do you have a favourite character type? I would love to hear from you!\\n\\n\r\nP.S. For those who have seen all three seasons of the anime (no manga characters), this is my list of best girl:\\n\\n\r\n1. Ayumi\\n\r\n1. Taylor Swift, whoops!, I meant Kanon\\n\r\n3. Chihiro\\n\r\n4. Shiori\\n\r\n5. Jun\\n\r\n6. Tenri",

Events of which he would've never dreamt of and never will. \r\nKeima's whole life changes when Elsie (she has a to long name to remember) enters his daily life. \r\nThe mother of Keima has an ehh.. pretty outstanding character while the father is kinda the opposite. Keima on the other hand is both. Not 50/50 but 100% of each. This character of his makes the events in this anime ridiculously hilarous. I truelly enjoyed the events thatoccured.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is actually pretty well developed! Something I wouldn't expect (honestly). At the beginning I thought it would be an anime full of fan service. This anime is full of fan service, however it is story wise. This makes the overall plot very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nWhile he struggles with his trial and error his personal growth increases, making his character more interesting. And he isn't the only one. Most of the other characters were pretty interesting aswell!\\n\\n\r\nI really don't want to spoil anything about the story/plot so I will leave that for as it is.\\n\\n\r\nI found the opening track so.. so... sooooo good! You probably won't realise how acurate the opening song actually is after watching a few episodes. All the other sound tracks are also well developed. After thinking about it I realized that the company must've put quite some time into the developing of these soundtracks. I mean most of the anime sound tracks reflect on the anime it is about for 40-60% but this one has the full 100%. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall art looked great, loved the chibi-ish moments when it could be used. Even the back ground characters look decent. \\n\\n\r\nAs you might've noticed, I rushed quite a bit at the end of my review. That is because I just realised how epic this series actually are.. brb rewatching... overall 10/10.",

The song and the art are sensational. So well done. That being said the animation and sound throughout the whole thing is great.\r\nI wouldn't give the story a 10/10, but the concept behind it certainly deserves 10/10. The idea that a boy who  lives to  woo the women of the 2D world is suddenly forced to win the hearts of the \"inferior\" 3D women is hysterical. The execution of this concept is, for themost part, good. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I would say the writers had a little trouble deciding on how much time to spend on each of the 3D girls he \"saves\". At first it seems like each girl is going to be extremely important later on, but they really aren't and I found myself wanting him to quickly just finish up with each new girl. I didn't want to take the time to get to know every single new character. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I must say that episode 12 of season 1 is one of the best things I have ever seen.

We start with a runner girl then a tsundere after an idol finally a dandere . This are the girl types we see always in animes . TWGOK is actually takes this cliches and serves us like mini stories ina no goal story . This is actually is a bad thing because when you start an anime and then it changes it's whole plot in a very fast way . It's actually pretty confusing . While following this character cliches the repetitiveness takes out on a very high level . 3 episode of romance then 1 ep. filler . Anime always follows this path and it is actually boring .

            "content": "Sadness is a state of mind that can often strike us when we least expect it. Seeing as how we have no control over 3rd party factors, which are usually the cause for these emotions, we all come face to face with these feelings. The World God only knows, written by Mamizu Arisawa, takes these metaphysical emotions, and gives them a corporeal and physical form as \u2018lost souls\u2019. Interestingly enough, the term lost soul is also referencing a person who has perhaps lost their way, or is not of right mind. This further compounds on the idea that these supposed lost souls are the resultof the amalgamation of both the human sentiment of longing, as well as well as our despair. Despair is the result of an unrequited desire to succeed or achieve; and as seen in TWGOK there are only two options for those who face this problem. The first is to be rescued and freed of your strife by a Katsuragi Keima (the symbol for salvation), or to unfortunately meet your own self destruction due to these emotions. Hidden beneath this colorful and fun show lies a very depressing issue which presents itself worldwide, the topic of clinical depression and its effects on an individual.\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------- Analysis -------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThe show is labelled as a harem anime, however I see it as more than just that, I see it as a deconstruction of the harem genre. The show underhandedly mocks the absurdity behind most dating Sims, and the logic they use relating to romance. Similarly this show, acting as a comedy tells us the story of a boy with literally no experience with girls, using his knowledge of video games in order to woo several handful of girls, and do so successfully. However the show realizes how ridiculous of a premise it has, and rides the idea all the way home. At this point the show also has no fear of creating a multitude of plot devices to further push forward this inane harem trope. The prime example of this is how at the end of each and every one of Keima's captures, after removing the lost soul, the girl loses any memories regarding her capturing, an extremely convenient idea which is made obvious and even questioned by the show\u2019s own protagonist. The show understands that it is making a fool of itself and embraces these plot holes, but does so gracefully. While it is a show that shouldn\u2019t and can\u2019t really be taken too seriously, there are still some underlying ideas brought forth by the show, introducing much heavier sub plots which the viewer is free to explore and ponder on their own. The story while simple and seemingly plain is actually quite elegant in that while avoiding pointless over-complications of its story (at least for the first half of the show) it manages to create a world and characters that will intrigue and interest you.\\n\r\nAmong the many points of interests that TWGOK presents to us, a many sub plots serve to further draw us into the story (these examples are based solely off of the first season, seeing as how future seasons do draw light on some of these subjects); the demon world that gets mentioned and explained just enough to make us want to learn more of its existence, but not enough to solidify its form, leaving us with a sort of mystifying world that we don't fully understand and can try to piece together ourselves. The lost souls themselves, we are told that they are the escaped souls of dead powerful demons, however if they escaped that implies that they were imprisoned, does this mean that they were evil, and if so what were the wrongs they were convicted of, and who were they. Further on the lost souls, if they were imprisoned that implies the existence of a complex society with set moral standings in the demon world, in that case does the demon world contain a political system similar to that of the human world, and if so is it mere coincidence are have there been past ties that linked both worlds together. We often associate the term demon with negative qualities, however in TWGOK it is quite the opposite and in fact the demons go out of their way to help humans, why is this. By simply opening up our mind and looking past the simplistic nature of the show, we can see a more complex and layered world that has been brought to life.\\n\r\nThe story begins with the introduction of the main character Keima Katsuragi, also known by his online name: the legendary \"God of Conquest\". He is well renowned online as the man capable of taming any girl's heart, any girl from a dating sim at the very least. Unfortunately for Keima this information is available to anyone, and falls into the hands of Elsie, a young girl and demon from hell who has been tasked with saving those who have been affected by 'lost souls'. These lost souls are evil spirits that once dwelled in hell, old spirits of great power who settle into the emptiness in a heart created by negative emotions, and feed off of their host's negative emotions. Elsie, not the brightest crayon in the box, misunderstands Keima's abilities, and sends him an e-mail containing a contract asking him to \"conquer\" these girls who have been inhabited by lost souls. Unaware that the request was making reference to real life girls he agrees to the terms, however after finding out the truth he rejects his assigned mission, and as such he is faced with a difficult decision: attempt to actually interact with real girls (whom he has next to no experience in dealing with), or go out in an explosion due to is inability to comply with his contract. Unhappily, Keima decides to make the only rational choice, and try to use the skills he has honed through his years of dating sim experience in real life, in order to make real life girls fall in love with him, thereby saving them.\\n\r\nFurther analyzing how this show acts as a deconstruction of harems in general, we must look at what most of your average harem shows might contain. At its simplest formula, the show will contain an average and boring main protagonist who for no reasonable explanation draws the attention of all the show's girls. When comparing Keima Katsuragi to this copy and paste character persona, several key points must be noted. Firstly Keima our protagonist is known as the ultimate otaku/nerd. Seeing as how a large portion of the demographic for harem shows consist, not surprisingly, of normal people who are still in middle or high school. Now in response one might find it odd to make the main character one with which most people don't want to relate to. He is supposed to initially appear to be a character with which many of the shows viewers can't relate to, this disparage in relatability acts as a catalyst for one of two reactions in the viewer. The intended response is that of fondness, however the other response which a lot of people seem to feel is a strong dislike of his character. Luckily both of these responses create a tie between the viewer and the protagonist. Secondly, unlike most harem shows, instead of the girls instantly falling for him for no rational reason, most of the time he imposes on them until they eventually develop some semblance of emotions or interest towards him, at which point he exploits the weakness in their heart (lost soul) in order to make them grow fond of him.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------- Review --------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nI am split when it comes to the cast, there are many characters in the main cast who I care for dearly, and who are well written. At the same time however there are also plenty of uninteresting and bland characters that populate the supporting cast. While I do not give as much weight to the supporting cast (especially not in this case as they are supposed to be representative of a typical harem stereotype), it still annoys me the lack of individuality among a lot of the secondary characters. Thankfully the protagonist makes up for what they are lacking. It is in my strong belief that Katsuragi Keima is what authors should aim to create, he is an interest individual with character, and real emotions. He is not a lovable main character, in fact it is quite to the contrary, while he may be helping the females of the show, he never adopts the image of a white knight you would typically expect, and for that I commend the writers with the creation of an actual person rather than a cardboard cut-out with a stereotype plastered on. The next character, and my personal favorite is Elsie, she is quite simple to be honest. A kind and sweet girl who is personified by her small quirks. She will easily put a large grin on your face, and can certainly increase your enjoyment of the show easily.\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 9\\n\r\nCharacter development is the concentration of the show to say the least, the story takes us through the lives of the many characters (unfortunately some of the story lines are quite bland to say the least), and we get to see the characters grow and overcome their problems tanks to Keima\u2019s help. While the concentration for development is obviously on the heroines of the show, we also see slight changes in Keima himself as his actions lead him to make personal assessments, a lot of which he ends up retracting.\\n\r\nPlot: 8 (series as a whole would be a 9)\\n\r\nPleasantly simple plot with small twists on the typical harem tropes, while keeping an original feel to the show, it never really tries to go beyond its boundaries, and for that I find that the story suffers, that is at least, until after the first season.\\n\r\nPacing: 8 (series as a whole would be a 9)\\n\r\nA good amount of time is spent on each individual heroine, unfortunately however, due to time restraints the show never manages to cover all of the girls seen in the manga. While that may have been unavoidable, it did feel at times that certain arcs were dragged on for too long (cough cough second arc).\\n\r\nMusic: 10\\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry if you did not find yourself enjoying the music, you weren\u2019t trying hard enough (or you really just don\u2019t enjoy that genre I guess). An enjoyable intro sung beautifully in Engrish, accompanied by a total of eight ending songs. While most of the ending songs are quite generic, there are two (ED3 and ED8) which really stuck out. While the third was simply enjoyable, the eighth seemed to add to the feel of the show. The song is sung by the voice actor for the main protagonist, in an off key and just plain terrible way, however it manages to put a smile on your face it fits the quirky and fun feel of the show. Otherwise the show has a nice selection of soothing background music which help draw in the viewer.\\n\r\nAnimation: 9\\n\r\nThe animation, like the story is simple at its base, however is also endearing at the same time. It\u2019s the subtle emotion changes, and enjoyable style that really gives the drawings life, and makes us care and feel connected to the characters of the show.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nEasily one of my top 10 favorite shows, and definitely my favorite harem show (Noucome trailing far behind as my second), the show doesn\u2019t try to be more than it is, a harem show. Yet it still manages to draw a line between itself and other shows akin to it. I have seen all three seasons a total of 2 or three times, along with the occasional odd episode, I truly enjoyed the experience that came with watching it, so much so that I went on to read the manga. Today I look forward with hope to seeing the announcement of a fourth season. I guarantee that anyone can enjoy this show, while they might not like it as much as I do, I promise that giving this show a try is not a waste of your time. And after saying that I award it with my highest score to date.\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 90/100 (series as a whole would be 93/100)\\n",

He has the ability to play 12 games at once, he doesn't need to sleep, he doesn't need to eat, ok he needs to do both, but that's just reality tugging him back into what he refers to as \"a crappy game.\"\r\nIf you would have told me 1 year ago that I would be watching and reviewing a romance/comedy/SoL show, i would have right high kicked  you.  Never mindthat now,\\n\\n\r\nThe story you can read in the synopsis, its a little wacky but they sell it well and the first episode is so good it sets the tone for the entire season.  On the surface the show is goofy, aloof and maybe even pedestrian, i can assure you it has substantial depth, but more importantly the first season is amazingly fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is solid all the way through, nothing breathtaking, but nothing horrible either.  The OP and ED aren't my cup of tea, but the background music fits the mood perfectly thorughout the show.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the best part, aside from my glowing review of the MC, the supporting cast are all very strong, except one, who can be kinda annoying, but like all events, annoyance can be turned into endearment, so says the Date Sim philosophy.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part, and as a person whose hobby is writing (not editing, shoo grammar nazis shoo!!), must be the writing.  Never a wtf moment that isn't perfectly well thought out, it delivers on the dialogue, it delivers on the plot(s), it delivers in the payoff.  The infamous \"kiss scene\" in romance genre is like the Kamehameha in action anime.  In this show, they are interchangeable.  That is how awesome the climaxes are.\\n\\n\r\nCheck it out, its keeps you off balance so well I think its a show that breaks across genres and sucks you in.",

            "content": "Lately, harem anime seem to really bore me, although i wasent expecting much from this anime, i was surprised to actually discover a quite decent anime in the end. Of course, it could have been better, but it was actually quite good for a harem and acceptable as a romance/comedy. \r\nstory (6/10): the story of this anime is quite acceptable, but not that original or developed in the anime. the story is about a guy who has to charm girls to send the evil spirits out of their hearts and save them, if he fails to do so, he loses his head, literally. The wholestory was not that original for it goes straight to the harem part, plus the romance part is quite undermined, focusing too much on a gamer approach of the thing and quite frankly not being as original as i could be. \\n\\n\r\nArt (710): I was actually quite surprised by the art in this anime since it was surprisingly good at times. for instance in the eleventh episode there was a scene where the library kinda exploded, and it was a quite beautiful sight. the anime could have taken advantage from more scenes as those, but quite sadly, it didn't\\n\\n\r\nsound (6/10): the sound in this wasn't half bad, the voice acting was okay , though somewhat annoying at times but was good in the end. But the background music wasn't all that good, relying on excessive piano use to jerk some feelings out, but it doesn't work. either was, the sound was okay. \\n\\n\r\ncharacter (6/10): the characters were actually fine, but they lacked character development. By that I mean since they adopt the ''amnesia'' way of doing things, they destroy their only way to give some character developments to the secondary characters since they forget everything and the main characters actually didn't have that much development in their personalities. Plus, a lot of characters were quite clich\u00e9d , not offering an intense uniqueness. \\n\\n\r\nenjoyment (5/10): I cant say I have enjoyed this as much as i could have enjoyed it, i think it had some great potential on many levels and that it failed to exploit it, it was entertaining, but not much than your average harem anime. \\n\\n\r\noverall (6/10): it was okay, but nothing more than that. It was acceptable for a harem anime, but it failed to become more than that. they had a good idea and a good base, but they failed to push it further and let it become better, lets hope they can get that in the second season. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I came into this show expecting the worst, another boring and dumb harem anime without any real substance to it. But, after watching I was pleasantly surprised, and would like to challenge the shows classification as a harem show as well. The show is presented much like a visual novel or dating sim where the main character can date a girl and then move on to the next once he's done. There is no interaction between the girls he dates, and he does not interact with them afterwards due to demonic magic and the like. I would classify this as a multi-arc romance show, thathas been condensed into 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story is pretty average, Keima is a master of dating sim games and because of his confidence he accepts a challenge from a demon. This challenge is to use romance to remove loose spirits from girls hearts and send them back to hell. With the help of a spunky cute demon and his dating sim skills Keima does just that. The story moves quickly, and each girls arc is short, 1 or 2 episodes per girl. This gives the story a rushed feeling and makes me think that the show would have been better as a 24 episode season that expanded on each story line more.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is good. The style is nothing new but the designs are good and the visuals do accentuate the style of the scene that they are in. The style adapts to the tone and can create hilarious or beautiful atmosphere.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nEvery character has a good voice actor and the music fits every scene well. The idol arc has really catchy songs that I caught myself humming along to and one in particular stuck in my head for the day after I watched the episode. The opening song is one of my top 5 as well. The music and sound overall is really good.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nEach character is varied and has a personality trait of their own that they have to overcome in their respective story arc. The girls Keima romances have good personalities and through his interactions with him they change for the better, it shows great character development. Especially during the idol and librarian arcs, they are genuinely good stories and the romance is very good in them. I did feel genuinely sad during some parts of the last two romance arcs. I do have one problem with the characters. The leads are not very well developed, both Keima and Elsie are good characters but have little to no development and I feel that it detracts from the show overall.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI liked the anime, overall I wasn't bored and enjoyed the romance and wanted longer more fleshed out arcs because I liked the girls that Keima romanced.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to anyone who wants something short that has a good blend of comedy and romance.\\n\r\n7/10",

            "content": "This review is for both seasons. I'll probably write a separate review for Megami-hen if it differs enough\r\nStory: 9\r\nThis is a very well-paced anime, the story is made of about four arcs every season each of which is usually followed with a breather episode serving as filler which are a good change of pace but I would of personally cut straight to the next arc. It was very heartwarming and a very good variation on the harem romcom. I would've preferred a better executed Season 1 finale but I'll let it slide because Season 2's ending was pretty sweet even though it was still amind-screw.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation: 8\\n\r\nThe animation is rather average, nothing really sticks out as good or bad. But it looks very good. I definitely applaud the character designs, they are very well-done. Keima, especially, has a very good mix of charming ladies-man and insufferable dork in him. I do like the normal design for the demons. Who knew a demon like Elsie could be so ADORABLE (though she really reminds me of Lala from To Love-Ru.) The lighting is very well-done though not as good as series like Fate/Zero and Angel Beats. Overall, the presentation is very good\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very good, using rather detailed orchestra pieces that fit well with each situation, though I don't really remember any of them besides the theme played at the climax of each arc. Otherwise, it's kinda forgettable. The OP and ED deserves mention for being very well animated (though that's another show) and written. Though I could of stood for actual Japanese lyrics for the OP instead of Engrish lyrics. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThe real meat of the show is for the most part, spot-on. It's good that they went for quality over quantity because the only major characters are Keima, Elsie, and the heroine of the arc. The heroines were mostly all very well-developed for 1-3 episodes of screen time. Though I thought Chihiro was pretty weak, and I would've preferred more than one episode for Ayumi. \\n\r\nKeima is a very interesting character. As he learns about the heroine, he find out more clearly how to win her heart through his vast experience with visual novels. This leads to very heartwarming scenes, though some awkwardly funny ones as well. Elsie is a very good source of comic relief, but really shines in the Haqua arc, where Keima is practically useless in. The side characters are a mixed bag, from the hilarious multi-personality mother, to the annoying douchebag Kodama. Others are just really forgettable. Still, the mains are very strong. \\n\\n\r\nVERDICT\\n\r\nIt's a hilarious yet heartwarming tale of a guy and his virtual chicks who is forced into picking up girls in \"meat space\". \\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION: HIGH\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my favorite anime of all time, so I apologize if I come off as being long winded. \r\nWhere to begin? Well I suppose I should start with the characters. I'll admit, the premise of the story actually made me overlook this anime 3 separate times because I thought the main character was going to be a gigantic pervert. But not only was I wrong, I was completely off the mark. Katsuragi Keima (who is my second favorite anime character of all time by the way) has little to no interest in real girls, preferring the girls in his game, claiming that reality isjust a crappy game. Everything about him, from the way he presents himself to the way he speaks comes off sounding so cool. In reality if he we're real he would be a huge nerd, but his presence is so cool that he can be talking about \"parsley\" and give an incredibly well structured and well formed speech that you can't help but agree with. Not only is Katsuragi cool, but extremely intelligent, but what most people see as him squandering his talent playing games, we see as his greatest asset. Accompanied by Elsie the exact opposite of his character, being clumsy with no tact, relatively stupid, popular, and very moe at times . All the other characters who serve as his \"conquests\" are also very good characters in their own rights. While not nearly as well developed as Katsuragi, they all are stereotypes we have seen in one anime or another, but are done so well, that you forget that they are supposed to be a stereotype, that is until Katuragi reminds you by saying that they are just like a character from his game.\\n\r\nThe story itself is just a simple set up for what would seem to be a lame Harem anime is done so well that you actually believe the story they are telling. Also, unlike most other Harem anime, the girls aren't there to give fan-service and to chase the main character, in fact its actually his job to make them fall in love with him. \\n\r\nAnother that that I ought to mention is the opening song. My goodness is it good. When I first started watching the anime I was so blown away by just the opening song that I couldn't believe that the anime could possibly live up to it. Lucky for me I was very wrong. The composition sung by ELISA is so well done that the song itself tells a story that draws you in. \\n\r\nThis anime is my favorite, and is well deserving of that spot. From music to characters, The World God Only Knows has it all.\\n\r\nI'd recommend this anime to anyone who is willing to sit down and give it a try. Personally I'd watch this any day no matter the circumstances.\\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned The World God Only Knows, is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, and I'd recommend it to anyone, any day.",

            "content": "Story: Inside Kami no mi zo Shiru Sekai, or The World God Only Knows, lives the God of Conquest name Keima Katsuragi. He is called the God of Conquest because there is no girl that he cannot conquer. His reputation reach all the way to Hell, which makes a contract with him, believing that he can help them capture run away spirits, which resides in girls heart.To capture a run away spirit he needs to make girls with the run away spirit in their heart to fall in love with him. What the people from Hell didn't know is that he is the God ofConquest in the game world, while in reality he just looks like a dork that is addicted to games. This proves to be a challenge for him because he dislike 3D girls and prefers 2D girls, but has no choice but to help because if he does not, it will cost him and his partner Elsie, their heads. So Keima now has to balance his time between conquering real girls and game girls, how long can this last?\\n\\n\r\nArt: The characters design are quite simple. There is not much detailed put into it, and there are many scenes that are quite humorous. Like how Keima constantly throws in random comparisons between real girls and game girls to prove his point that game girls are superior. These short scenes are quite entertaining even though it has nothing to do with the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening theme in my opinion is quite catchy and I like it. There aren't any theme songs in the series though that help make the mood, because most of the tone/mood are seen in their conversation and facial expressions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The main character Keima and his partner Elsie are quite funny. Keima is constantly playing his PFP(looks just like a PSP) while Elsie is easily distracted by almost anything. I really like Keima's determination and his passion for dating sims, especially those scenes where he explains about the games.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This review was probably really bias, because I have read the manga, and I loved it. So when I watched the anime I was not disappointed at all. The anime stuck completely to the story line of the manga, and it included a lot of the random game explanation scenes just like the manga. I though have to admit that this series have a really weak plot, so if you want something more solid/serious I suggest do not bother watching this series. But  if you want to watch something with alittle randomness and humor, then I suggest this series. Well hope you enjoy this series as much as I did!",

            "content": "I liked The World God Only Knows. It was a nice little comedy-lite anime. I call it comedy-lite because it was laugh out loud, going for a joke style of comedy. For example Katsuragi is constantly playing dating sims on his PFP (PSP) even during class. When one of his teachers gets on to him about he says fine I\u2019ll get 100 on all the next tests, and of course he does. Or when Elsie incorporates herself as Katsuragi\u2019s sister she tells his mom that\u2019s she\u2019s Katsuragi\u2019s father\u2019s illegitimate daughter (he\u2019s over seas the entire anime). This makes Katsuragi\u2019s ex-biker mom a little upset let\u2019ssay. But she does completely accept Elsie as a daughter. I did need a nice calm anime to bring me down after watching Future Dairies (Note to self: write Future Dairies review ;-) ). I was disappointed that the OVAs were not on Crunchyroll because they take place between seasons 2 and 3 and it assumes you\u2019ve seen them and new characters were added and the series narrative did a brief, enough to let you know that you\u2019ve missed something. But I blame that on Crunchyroll not the series itself.\\n\r\nLike most anime it left me wanting another episode just to see how the characters deal with the aftermath. I would be very surprised if there was another season because how Katsuragi felt at the end unless he plays it off as a moment of madness and denies his feelings. Overall I really thought this was a pretty decent anime.",

            "content": "*Warning: Possible spoilers here and there*\r\nI don\u2019t like harem anime. I personally think that most harems are nothing but filled with pointless fanservice. If so, then why do I love a show like The World God Only Knows. It\u2019s simple, it\u2019s not focused on fanservice for once! No wonder why it\u2019s the highest rated female harem on MAL (well the 3rd season that is). Even though it\u2019s very underrated compared to other harems like High School DxD or Rosario + Vampire, it is, in my opinion, the best female harem anime ever. This is also one of the few shows that are special to me,since it has my favorite anime character ever, Keima Katsuragi and it was the first manga series I\u2019ve ever completed. I may be focusing more on the first season, but I might mention the other seasons and the manga too. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8/10\\n\r\n17-year-old Keima Katsuragi prefers immersing himself in the 2D world, chasing digital girlfriends. However, after answering a mysterious email he finds himself bound by a contract helping the demon Elsie capture 'lost souls' from the underworld. He must now win over these real-life ladies in order to fill the void in their hearts which these souls have entered, releasing the souls and allowing for their capture. Also, if he does not perform this 'duty' a collar around his neck will explode.\\n\r\nThe story is basically like a visual novel turned into reality. It is a very interesting and a unique concept. In fact, I\u2019ve never heard of a story like that before, which is the reason why it\u2019s a great harem series. It makes fun of not just visual novels, but also character tropes (like the sporty girl or the shy girl) and the otaku culture. The idea of the girls losing their memories after the spirits were captured making it look less a straightforward harem and the fact that Keima and Elsie has to deal with one girl per arc are pluses as well. \\n\r\nThe series would have been a masterpiece if it weren\u2019t for one thing. Constantly switching tones. At one point, there\u2019s scene involving supernatural elements like in Hell or the 2 leads successfully capturing a soul; then the next moment it focuses on school bullcrap like exams, bands and all; and then finally switching to a gaming-related problem. The story doesn\u2019t know how to focus on one theme, whether if it\u2019s about gaming, school or exorcising loose souls, it can be a bit confusing. Also, some parodies and jokes can also be a bit out of place, unexpected and probably only ones that most visual novel experts can get. It\u2019s definitely not a show for anime noobs. There were also a few fillers too, but unlike the great shonen gods, at least they\u2019re in the manga. Needless to say, the story is fun, unique and hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\r\nFirst, let\u2019s start off with the female targets. When you look at the female characters at first, you\u2019ll think that they\u2019re just a bunch of one-dimensional girls. But no. What makes them more than being one dimensional characters is that they are played for being one-dimensional by Keima, as well as having their own issues and problems as well. There\u2019s Ayumi Takahara the sporty girl, the spoiled yet broken Mio Aoyama, Kanon Nakagawa the lone idol (bonus points for being a stun gun badass) and the shy Shiori Shiomiya (aka Miss AhoBaka), who has the best arc out of the bunch. There are also the supporting characters like the teachers and Keima\u2019s mom. You\u2019ll either love them, but they\u2019re mostly forgettable.\\n\r\nNext is the immortal demon that is Elucia de Lute Irma, aka Elsie, whom I think, is one of the most misspelt anime characters to ever exist. I mean, Wakaki-san, can you please tell me what\u2019s the actual spelling of her name is?! Cause a lot of fans do not know the right why (even I\u2019m not sure if I got it right). Back to her as a character, she is one of the most adorable things I\u2019ve ever seen despite how ditzy she can be. Her bond with Keima (whom she calls Kami-niisama or Divine Brother if you watched the dub) is quite strong and does her best to help him along the way.  Probably the best imouto character I\u2019ve seen. Also, do you know any other fictional character out there who\u2019s obsessed with fire trucks! Well looks like Elsie\u2019s the only one.\\n\r\nAnd now, the best part of the series, The Capturing God himself, Keima Katsuragi. Also known as my personal favorite anime character ever. Now what makes a unique character like Keima? At first, he appears to be your average anti-social nerd who hates real girls, does nothing but play visual novels and has a god complex (like 2 other men I know). But on the other hand, he is a great strategist who can solve any kind of problem with his video game knowledge. He\u2019s even one of the smartest person in his class despite his unhealthy video game addiction. Up to the point that his intelligence can even rival other smart, god-like characters like Light Yagami or Lelouch vi Britannia. But the reason why I love Keima the most is his relatability. He\u2019s against real life thinking that \u201creality is just a crappy game\u201d. But as the series progresses, he starts to develop and think that reality is not that bad, so he socializes a bit more. This is more shown in the manga though. Many otakus like myself are trying to be like him and to think that reality is as good as the digital world. And that\u2019s what makes Keima my favorite anime character ever. Also, he\u2019s quite a good husbando if you love nerdy characters with glasses.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\r\nIt is pretty surprising for Manglobe (a studio known for darker shows like Samurai Champloo, Ergo Proxy and Deadman Wonderland) to do something that looks, well, generic. But that doesn\u2019t make the show look bad (on the other hand, they also did produce a season of Hayate the Combat Butler). Despite how generic it does look (especially the characters which is the reason why many people forget about them), The World God Only Knows features very bright animation. And at times, it does look very nice. I also like it how when it\u2019s parody time, they can get very creative with the characters turning into other characters whether if it\u2019s anime or not. Heck, I remember at one point, Elsie goes South Park. Probably one of the best parodies of the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC: 9/10\\n\r\nWhat happens when you mix digital music with heavenly music? One hell of an amazing soundtrack. The World God Only Knows\u2019 soundtrack can range from being digital to classical music, and each one of them is very unique. Even Kanon\u2019s songs are pretty damn catchy, even if they can be generic Jpop songs. Also, in the last episode of the season, I will never forget at how hilariously bad Keima sings with 2d girls. The ending song, Koi no Shirushi, sung by the female characters\u2019 seiyuu sounds cutesy yet nice. Not the worst ending but not the best either. But do you know what\u2019s the best song in not just the series, but also happens to be one of my favorite anime songs ever? The opening. Sung by one of my favorite singers Elisa. I now many people hate because the song is entirely in Engrish, but the lyrics makes complete sense, matches the show very well and mixes heavenly and digital music like a badass would do. I really love the opening as much as I love Keima!\\n\\n\r\nDUB: 7/10\\n\r\nHmmmm\u2026 What an interesting topic we have in here. I know many people hate the dub because 1, it\u2019s from Sentai Filmworks whose dubs can be either a hit or miss, 2, Ayumi sounds very awful compared to the Japanese (which I sorta agree with) and 3, they changed a lot of voices throughout the seasons (poor Chihiro has to suffer from 3 VAs). As a dub watcher myself, it is safe to say that the dub is, surprisingly not that bad. In fact, I think it\u2019s one of Sentai\u2019s best dubs. Other than Ayumi (whom obviously has the worst performance), I think everyone else sounds good with some popular actors such as Hilary Haag (Mio and Shiori) and Britney Karbowski (Kanon). But the reason why I decided to watch the dub is because of two people. First, there\u2019s Luci Christian, who is absolutely adorable as Elsie. Probably one of her best performances yet. And then there\u2019s Chris Patton as Keima himself. As you can see, he\u2019s one of my favorite dub VA\u2019s. And him voicing my favorite anime character is absolutely perfect! Chris does an amazing performance as Keima. I already know the fact that Chris and Luci are always together (like in Full Metal Panic, Princess Tutu and Black Bullet), but they\u2019re one of the best dub VA pairings ever. And they continue that trend by voicing the main duo.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\r\nThe series may not interest everyone with it\u2019s somewhat generic art and it\u2019s constant shifting tones. But to me, The World God Only Knows is the greatest harem anime I\u2019ve ever seen with its unique story, a diverse cast, beautiful sounding music, fun parodies and one of the best protagonists that anime has to offer. It is indeed, one of the shows that are special to me because of that. I highly recommend this anime if your finding a great harem or a great rom-com show. No screw that, the anime can be a bit disappointing, so I can also highly recommend the manga which is indeed, my favorite manga series ever.\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n+ A unique harem story filled with twists\\n\r\n+ A fun cast that makes fun of their own tropes\\n\r\n+ Bright and colorful animation\\n\r\n+ Great music that can range from digital to classical\\n\r\n+ Great parodies here and there\\n\r\n+ A surprisingly ok dub from someone like Sentai Filmworks\\n\r\n+ One of the best anime openings ever\\n\r\n+ Keima... nuff said\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n- Doesn\u2019t know what theme to focus on (whether it can be a supernatural, a school or a gaming anime)\\n\r\n- The art can be a bit generic\\n\r\n- Some jokes are only for visual novel experts\\n\r\n- If you\u2019re an anime newbie then this show ain\u2019t for you\\n\r\n- The dub needs a little bit of fixing\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI can see the ending!

            "content": "In five words : cliche, repetitive, clever, different,enjoyable.\r\nStory : the storyline for this series is EXTREMELY repetitive. Keima and Elsie track down a escapee demon soul (who just happens to be inhabiting an attractive, yet strange girl), Keima uses his sim dating skills to woo the girl, she falls in love. Copy, paste then repeat. Thankfully the series is short which, in a way, balances out the predictability (however it becomes almost unbearable in the second season). You can expect your cliche twists and such but don't expect much major plot development. 5/10\r\nArt : the art is reasonably good, the character designs tend to bewell thought through and depicted well with much detail. The animation is pretty good and even the fight scenes are quite well executed however as the series isn't action based don't expect spectacular brawling. Overall the art is a high of the series and pleasant to view. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound : personally I really enjoyed the opening which was a well needed deviation from the regular high pitched squeaking of a very cutsie sounding girl (in fact it was the opening which attracted me to this series..). The ending was a bit bland however wasn't unbearable. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : I have to admit, characters aren't the strong point of this show. Keima is an arrogant loser who spends his life playing on video games and is frankly the best character in my opinion. The rest of the cast ,which are notable, are mostly girls and all VERY irritating, stubborn or just plain stupid. Take for example Kanon who is egotistical, constantly worrying that people don't know who she is, and clingy, constantly needing reassurance from Keima. Some of the girls peronalities will have you cringing and banging your head off the wall. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: despites it's many plot holes the basic idea of this series is quite inventive and entertaining for most of the series. As I have mentioned this series is very predictable and boring however I did enjoy this series for the most part and would recomend this series for m/f aged between 13-18. 7.5/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"The world is just a crappy game\"\r\n\"2d girls are better than 3d(Real)girls\"\r\n-Keima Katsuragi, the protagonist of this anime\r\nStory\r\nKeima Katsuragi, being the geekest of the geek, the 'God of gaming' has been dragged into a world of harem like no other. In this anime, the main protagonist gets forced to play a reality game in which he needs to conquer real girls.\r\nWell for me, I can see myself as a gamer too but without the harem. lels \r\nOne day, he received an email containing a message in which he was challenged as a 'God' to conquer girls. This is the time when his devil assistant Elsie/Elseacame to his side. They were ordered to capture girls with runaway spirits, otherwise they'd get their head cut-off. The only way to capture these girls is to make them fall in love with Keima.\\n\\n\r\nTHE SETTING\\n\r\nThe whole story sets in Maijima school. Keima studies there and is later on accompanied by Elsie after she gets to transfer. Yes it's the typical school setting where the main guy gets chased by other girls but there's just one difference here in TWGOK, because fantasy was also integrated into the setting. Keima gets a devil (Elsie) by his side to help him conquer the girls. I expected that this kind of story will be short as it is not a very complicated one and the story has only one route it follows: GUY-->CONQUERS GIRLS--> SUCCEEDS-->FINISH. *Spoiler* This might be true for the first and second season of TWGOK, but as far as I know, there are many changes and added arcs in the manga which are not shown in S1 & S2 but I think those arcs (Goddesses,Vintage) will be shown in S3 of TWGOK which was announced to be realeased soon.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was medium-paced and there\u2019s a proper time for a break after Keima succeeds with a girl. Though for me, the story was interesting enough to hook you up. One main thing that you\u2019ll love in this anime is Keima teaches his \u2018conquering\u2019 techniques, and he acted like they were still in a game, thus he computes all the routes and decides what personality and action he would take depending on the girl. These actually taught me techniques that I can use in real life! Interesting indeed. I would rate the story 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nOk so for our main protagonist we got Keima Katsuragi. He is a pro gamer who obviously doesn\u2019t want anything else but his games. The reason why he is like that? The anime didn\u2019t bother to give much information in his history, family background, and life. Hell I don\u2019t even know who his father was nor how did he become a professional, apathetic, unsociable gamer. Don\u2019t bother knowing about his past as this would not be shown in the anime. Though his mother was shown in season 2 if I\u2019m not mistaken but not much detailed information was given about their family background. All in all, his definite role in the was to be this self-proclaimed \u2018God\u2019 of conquer, dating sims etc. who was forced (apparently) to help capture the spirits. This was nice because all throughout, he didn\u2019t change his role nor swayed his personalities. And as for our Elsie, she was a\u2026hmm clumsy all the time, she was worthless\u2014for Keima. Some may find her annoying for she likes to butt in into somebody else\u2019s affairs, kinda irritating once in a while when she gets to bug Keima with that childish mind of hers. Well, Elsie\u2019s voice fits her right, teenish voice which for me is kinda cute and childish at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nHEROINES\\n\r\nAll of them I\u2019d say, earned the right to be a heroine. Well I don\u2019t play dating sims etc. and I don\u2019t date that much. But to me, these heroines definitely will be loved if you look into their personalities more. And yes, they are not the same, each of them have their own uniqueness and character. Some are typical tsundere type, shy, conservative, the athletic ones, and etc. I would say they are distinguishable to each other by their own characteristics but if you\u2019d compare them to other girls in other anime, they\u2019re pretty much the same. But one thing I liked in this anime is that it doesn\u2019t focus only on the \u2018conquering\u2019 part, we also get to know the heroine\u2019s background, and her history. That is enough to make this story held in together and into full pieces. \\n\r\nAs for characters, I\u2019d go for a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime pretty well, definitely a harem worth watching. I was not satisfied enough with the whole anime series though, it was short and I expected more so I continued TWGOK in the manga. And trust me, it\u2019s worth reading the whole manga too. But as I\u2019ve said earlier, if you\u2019re looking for Keima\u2019s background or history, give up..not gonna be there. Well, it\u2019s one of the best harem anime out there for me. And I\u2019ve learned some girl techniques too!So 10/10 for enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nAnd overall, sorry if I didn\u2019t include a review for the sound and art for I have difficulty comprehending Arts and sound. Dunno why but I look at anime more with their story and plot rather than how they\u2019re presented and done. So\u2026 for me it\u2019s an 8.8/10 ^^ any feedback, suggestions or comments feel free to post on my profile! Thank you!\\n",

            "content": "I have been very impressed by this show, once I saw the first three episodes of the Anime, I caught up with the Manga in a matter of days. The first season of the Anime covers the first four captures. Ayumi the track star, Mio the \u201crich\u201d girl, Kanon the Idol, and Shiyori the librarian. \r\nStory 10/10:  The story is VERY original and is Unlike any harem Anime out there. It parody's girl stereotypes in Games, Manga and Anime and also modern pop culture.  I was very interested from the start and I cannot wait to see more. I'm really hoping the makeseason 2 longer than 13 eps. They have so much material they can use.\\n\\n\r\nArt: -/-\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: The series did a really good job on the music of the series. The opening \u201cGod Only Knows\u201d is really amazing. I fell in love with the song right when I heard it. It fits the series perfectly. The full version of the song is actually 8 min's long surprisingly. The opening is at 2:20 in the song. The rest of the song is used in the last episodes a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme Koi no Shirushi isnt the best ED theme ever but was good.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a couple inserts songs (besides using the op theme near the end as stated above) from the Kanon arc. Only once has been released so far (Dec 22 2010) and that is Happy Crescent. It is a pretty good song that fit the Kanon arc so well. The Kanon arc was my favorite because there was so much insert songs. I am a sucker for insert songs in Anime and music anime in general lol\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10 as stated through the review, each girl has like their own personality so it is very diverce. Keima has got to be the best character in the show. He is hilarious and is like the Light Yagami of the gaming world. His saying \u201cI can see the ending\u201d is one of the best sayings ever. The most impressive thing about him is his room. Once you see the last episode you will realize why his is called the capturing god. There isnt much character development tho only small bits here and there.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall 10/10: Great series, I would recommend this series those that love video games and know all about those girl sterotypes. This show will make you laugh and smile every episode. I highly recommend it! You will not be disappointed!",

            "content": "This. Is. Amazing. One of if not THE best anime I have ever watched. It was just...my kind of anime. There was never a dull moment for me, although there were some bits that I didn't enjoy as much as others. At first I didn't know why I liked the anime so much, but then I re-watched the series over about 3 times and then it CLICKED. But you'll find out why with the rating section.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nCompletely original from what I've read and seen up to this point. I'm a good amount upset that they don't have season three out yet, but I understand withthe availability of voice actors and processing and editing and many many other factors to consider. But, i digress. The plot. Right. At times, the story seems to be absolutely serious, and then you're thrown a comedic curveball from nowhere. It also has much abundant comedy woven into it, and the main story is never forgotten among all the hilarity, as it has been in other animes. The one filler episode where it shows different points of view in one day was the only no-go for me, but hey, no one's perfect. The first episode is perfectly paced to get the viewer used to the concept of the anime, with it's fantastical outlandish story telling. Not much is truly explained, but it is in the second season, so just wait it out. Well, I can't think of anything else for this section, so moving on...oh, wait, the main character does go on random tangents where he will bash on real girls and say why video game girls are the best, and also has little story lessons when he explains why he's doing what he is, and all the while being totally hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nClean. Crisp. Beautiful. Everything feels like it's in soft lighting, so it's easy to see and understand what's going on. Nearly every scene is hilarious, and is sometimes portrayed in the art with a lack of shading, a scene cut out, or bubbly, cutesy drawings. Not graphic intense whatsoever, like with some animes where so much is going on that you can't see anything you understand, like with the Transformers movie (no copyright infringement intended), when the robots were fighting, there was so much going on I didn't know who was winning. Anyways, back to this. The art is detailed in little, subtle places, but is overall simple, so it just works.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is it. What made me love it. I didn't know at first because it's so subtle. I only realized it after listening to the ost on Youtube (again, no copyright infringement intended) and hearing all the tracks that I never noticed. I then re-watched the anime and fell in love. Not with the girls, though, that's Keima's thing. Anyways, that's all I have to say. That and that words are not enough to describe all my feelings. Each piece was a masterpiece. Each and every second. That's the closest I'm getting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe only reason I'm doing this is because for the anime (wink wink, nudge nudge), once one girl is done, she's just gone. Poof, never a major part of the story. Until the second season, then...nevermind, I won't ruin it. I'll just say that if the anime caught up with the manga, then this section would be a 10 as well. By the by, the character interaction is hilarious, yet most of them actually have a slightly complex buildup, although I think that's only if you see it that way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI think that all my previous things say why I enjoyed it, but if you just skipped all that, then I'll do this for your sake. The comedy is seamlessly woven in, except for the moments where there is a completely serious atmosphere only to shatter like glass in all the perfect ways. The art is not graphic intense at all, allowing the viewer to enjoy in leisure, and the sound is...well, you'll have to read that section. Just wow. The character development is great for as long as they last...you'll understand when you watch the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nIf I could, then this would receive a 15/10. The story is original, the art is beautiful and simple at the same time, each subtle BGM that's played is a masterpiece that's unappreciated, the characters are hilarious in their interactions but complex at the same time. At least most of them. Enjoyment, all the time. I'm getting tired of typing, so here's the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nSorry if this is bad, it's my first review. I figured if I wrote about something I like, it would be easy, but wow. That was a lot. Well, time to finish my homework. That's right, I was bored of homework so I typed this whole review instead. Pointless, I know, but I was always bad at time management and staying on task. Oh well. Hope you watch and enjoy this anime like I have. \\n\\n\r\nWith love, \\n\r\nThe Asian",

            "content": "This is my first review, so... be gentle, s-s-senpai. :$\r\nHaving watched all three seasons of \"The World Only God Knows\", I can safely assume this is, perhaps, one of my favorite animes I've ever watched until now! Sometimes, it will kill you with laughter, while others, it will rip your emotions mercilessly; sometimes, it will make your heat race, upon a \"conquest\", but, all the times, if will certainly tie you to the show. You will inevitably want to know what will happen next, after a certain episode, and, thus, occupy all your time, until you realize you're laughing maniacally at 3 am if frontof your display, scaring your whole neighborhood! This anime, will, undoubtedly, keep you entertained!\\n\\n\r\nBut, now, let's analyse the anime a bit more carefully:\\n\\n\r\nThe Story's Rating: 8\\n\r\nIt was nothing spectacular (albeit hilarious) until the third season, when things really took off without you even noticing. Unless you have read the manga, or watched an OVA, you'll be completely confused at the first few minutes of the first episode, but you'll catch on, don't worry.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art's Rating: 9\\n\r\nSeriously, it was spectacular. It allowed you to truly enjoy the most romantic moments, live the most dramatic ones, or laugh your butt off at the childish drawings provided by the many hilarious scenes of this anime!\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound's Rating: 7\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the anime was fine, really, but it didn't leave that much of an impression, except for the song that played at the end of each \"conquest\" (seriously, people who don't know what that is, just watch the damn anime!). That song will never leave my head (okay, maybe I already forgot about it). :D\\n\\n\r\nThe Character's Rating: 10\\n\r\nEach and every character has an important role in this anime. Seriously, you'll get attached to them immediatly, and, as such, you can conclude they are very enjoyable, pulling you to the series, as they each have their own particular trait and personallity. During the third season, the viewers will have some pleasant surprises, which makes me raise their rating to the max.\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment's Rating: 10\\n\r\nOh my lord Kami-nii-sama, please, don't make me repeat myself: this anime will provide you some solid hours of entertainment and laughter. Trust me, I'm a doctor. :'D\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 9\\n\r\nAs I've previously mentioned before in this review, this is now one of my favorite animes around. I'll be keeping in touch with the manga, to follow the rest of the story. Please do the same, I'm sure it'll be worth it. :)",

I think the main reason i love this anime so much is the main character anyone who says \"reality is justa crappy game\" is an instant winner in my book. Try watching the first few episodes this anime didn't hook me at first but by the time i got  further in i really loved it episode 12 of season one is one of my favorite standalone episodes of an anime iv'e ever seen once i watched to that point i instantly watched the next two seasons .   This anime is amazing.",

            "content": "The World God Only Knows is strangely entertaining and surprisingly good for a twelve episode romantic-comedy. I\u2019ve been having bad luck lately with finding a romantic-comedy that isn\u2019t crap and thankfully The World God Only Knows has some decent merits that pushes it above some of the competition. It has great comedy elements, a good idea for a plot, and interesting characters that are really enjoyable to watch. While this is not a genre defining or fresh series, it is good for what it is.The series is about Keima Katsuragi, a guy obsessed with dating simulation games. He carries his PFP around, always playing something.He is considered the God of Conquest for his ability with these games and his continual updating of a website chronicling his exploits leads to his getting a message from Satan. He is hired to capture loose souls and meets his partner in this mission: Elsie, a cute, clumsy demon girl. Using his dating simulation knowledge, Keima actually has to interact with real girls, solving their insecurities or issues in order to release the loose soul. This always involves his making the girl fall in love with him.  The thing is, after he releases the loose soul, the girl will forget what happened.\\n\\n\r\nThere are four girls that he gets together with through the course of the twelve episodes. The first half of the series isn\u2019t as good as the second. The two girls Keima attempts to conquer in the first half aren\u2019t all that exciting and the series seems to be a generic mish-mash of characters trying to get together. The second half isn\u2019t much different in the character department, but the two girls Keima saves are a lot deeper and much more likeable. While the second half does contain a terrible filler episode, the two conquests are enjoyable to watch and the final episode is freaking hilarious. I\u2019ll dig deeper into the four girls Keima goes after later on, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty damn good. There are some scenes in the show that are breathtaking. The library scene where Shiori is being crushed by the books in the building was quite beautiful. There was a lot going on, and the animation flowed. The metaphoric scenes are typically the most awe-inspiring. Characters look nice and animation is smooth.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good. The opening grew on me, at first I didn\u2019t much like it but I guess it isn\u2019t that bad. The ending is meh. During the show the sound is pretty excellent. The voice actors are great. There is an idol character that Keima helps out and she sings about three songs. Her first song is meh, her second Happy Happy Crescent song grew on me, and her last, slow song that she sings during her big concert was really good. Overall though, it had some pretty good J-pop relegated to a minor character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, TWGOK excels. Keima is decent, but I always found him to be a complete asshole. He always plays his games and doesn\u2019t pay much attention to anyone. I mean, he is a good guy and does some genuinely nice things, but his actions toward Elsie, who eventually becomes his sister, are horrible. Elsie is a good character, sweet and cute. She\u2019s the opposite of a demon, which goes without saying from the moment you lay eyes on her. She gets treated so badly by Keima though, and she doesn\u2019t do anything to him. In fact, she\u2019s always trying to help him and really seems to care about him. I just found myself really hating him whenever he interacted with Elsie but liking him anytime he interacted with other girls.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of Elsie she is not a new character but she is so much fun that it doesn\u2019t matter. She\u2019s cute, funny, and really likeable. She has some problems of her own that she needs to fix and those I am sure will come into play in future additions to the series. The only part about her I didn\u2019t like was the cooking. Of course the moment she said she was going to cook a meal I knew it would be God-awful and lead to some generic running gag. And it did.\\n\\n\r\nThe conquests start with Ayumi. She is an athlete and there really was nothing to her. Her issue wasn\u2019t all that exciting and she didn\u2019t even get as much attention as the future conquests. After her is Mio who is the generic rich girl. Again, she doesn\u2019t get as much attention as the next two girls. Her part is funny but her character isn\u2019t worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s the point about the series is that the characters are supposed to represent those you see all the time in dating simulations and visual novels. It is effective, and I have a really hard time rating characters because they are supposed to be generic.\\n\\n\r\nKanon, the idol, is different though. I\u2019ve never seen an idol used in an anime (that\u2019s not to say they aren\u2019t in anime, I just have never seen one with an idol) and I quite enjoyed her. Now, this may have to do with my everlasting love of Miku Hatsune and her autotuned Japanese chipmunk pop. Kanon was really, really cute and her arc was my favorite of the show. Her character was a little vain, but I understand her problem and emotions. And I also, as stated, liked her singing sections, especially the last one.\\n\\n\r\nFinally there is Shiori, who is my second favorite of the conquest girls (Elsie is my favorite character of the whole series). She loves to read. She\u2019s read every book in the school library and will protect the books at all costs from being thrown out so a media room can be built. She is the typical shy girl who can\u2019t speak or have a conversation without getting scared. Her character isn\u2019t bad and she develops nicely, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel like I was watching a PSA about how wonderful books are when she talked about her love for them. \u201cThey take you to new worlds and let you be a different person\u201d sounds like something my first grade teacher told me. On top of that, the section where she grows wings and flits about, opening books reminded me of the timeless lyrics \u201cButterfly in the sky, I can fly twice as high\u201d and LeVar Burton telling me about how pyramids were constructed. But that\u2019s just me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters fit the show well, and the fact that each character goes through some development, though forced, is decent pay off. None of them are outstanding, but they are all good.\\n\\n\r\nThe World God Only Knows isn\u2019t bad at all, in fact it is very entertaining. It has a decent plot, great animation, good music, and some fun characters. There is not a deep or long-standing romance, but the romantic moments are effective and the drama of the different conquests is good. It\u2019s a fun ride. The first half may be a bit rocky for some, but the second is where the series hits its stride. It may have one episode of filler that is bad, but that is negated by the final conquest.",

            "content": "The World God Only Knows\r\nMain Story:\r\nThe World God Only Knows is about a boy names Keima Katsuragi who playes video games (Visual Novels). Keima Katsuragi is a very skilled player when it comes to women, he's so skilled that people on the internet seek for his advice on women and call him \"The Capturing God\".  However, Keima is only a capturing god to 2D women (Girls in games). One day, a demon from hell sends Keima Katsuragi a challenge, the challenge Keima receives says \"If you're a real capturing God, and can capture any women, then try and capture this girl\" Or something likethat (Sorry if i'm not accurate on the dialogue). Keima accepts this challenge not knowing that it was a contract from a demon from hell causing Keima to meet the demon Elsie. Elsie tells Keima that they must collect these things called Loose Souls which are located into girls and can only be brought out by making them fall in love with you. (This is where Keima's visual novel skills come in handy). Keima, however does not wish to make all these girls fall in love with him, for his world only belongs to 2D girls in his games. However, if Keima refuses and does not get all of the Loose souls in the area, he will die.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nThe World God Only Knows to my knowledge does provide an Original Story that's not cliche, this is very nice to hear since most animes are mostly ordinary slice of lifes. I especially loved the OST/OP/END for the anime. Both openings were flawless to me, the music, the animation, the everything made me feel like this anime was going to be a terrific anime. The OST in the anime were terrific aswell, they provided a nice atmosphere in the anime where it was either serious time and decide which route to take, or when the kiss scenes happen where the atmosphere gets all nice. TWGOK definitely had me with their sound and animation. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\nAs good as TWGOK (The World God Only Knows) may seem and how good the story is, it does have some flaws. Since the main story is Keima just chasing girls and making them fall in love with him, the ending will seem impossible. I'd say TWGOK doesn't have an ending is because since the main story really is Keima just chasing loose souls after loose souls, it would start to get repetitive and unfortunately have its fans loose all interest into the Anime. This is the biggest flaw I've found in this anime causing me to put a 6 in the story category. There are some minor flaws too that have to do with the heroines, however, they aren't that big to me.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I did find myself enjoying this anime and eventually loving it as well. To be honest, The anime doesn't need to be perfect to be enjoyed.",

            "content": "Usually I would get bored when a show follows a formula that makes things typically predictable \u2013 especially when it comes to the mystery and thriller genres. I am an avid psychological mystery thriller fan who loves gore and violence. When I happened to stumble upon this show, my first thoughts were, the title sounds like something a psychological series. Consequently, my instincts were incorrect. First impressions are everything; when I first saw the trailer, it did not really show any affection to me. Good thing that I would try almost anything and gave this a shot and to my surprise, words alone could notexpress the god-like comedy experience that you get from watch this series.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it is repetitive and follows a formula, every single episode was done delicately and will give you a different kind of amusement every time. This was meant to be a parody type of show so it is meant to imitate another show, company, and so on and turn it into something funny \u2013 in a way, a mocking manner.  The satires, the irony, the stereotypes and the exaggerations are never-ending. \\n\\n\r\nThis is how to do a show with a repetitive plot. It gives the viewers a kind of sensation that, nonetheless of the predictability of the series, makes people hold on and not to give up on the show and would actually expect more and want more. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art suits the style of the anime with all the exaggerated scenes \u2013 to the point of actually feeling to be inside a fantasy within a fantasy. They did a great job in the character designs; especially the girl with a skull hair clip. As mentioned, it is a parody anime so some characters may appear stereotypical or looks like something you have seen before. The demon girl, if you look close enough, looks somewhat like the girl from Elfen Lied. The guy looks like a typical intelligent nerd in a fantasy. The rest, looks like a typical girl that you see in a fantasy or harem anime. Despite of the uncanny resemblance, it suited the theme of the show \u2013 a show with a divine comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nEverybody has their own taste in music. The show has a combination of modern and operatic twist to it. If you are an opera or Victorian fan, you will find yourself addicted to its music. The themesong would start out as something modern and techno and it would seamlessly shift into something operatic. Furthermore, the music suited the god theme in the series. Listening to the music will make you shiver down your spine and feel like the feeling of being a god flow into your bloodstreams. Other than that, the show has a couple of modern pop sounding song. It was not really special nor is it that bad. It just suited the scene of a typical modern pop culture.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art, the story and the music are great but what makes anime or any kind of show stand out is the characters. A gloomy intelligent nerd who does not care about the 3D world and shows no real emotions towards the girls in real life despite the fact of making them fall in love with him, an innocent childish sibling that is trying hard to make his big brother happy and endless stereotypes of girls.\\n",

            "content": "[Story]\r\n\"Reality is just a crappy game\"- Katsuragi Keima. One of the famous quote from the anime.\r\nTWGOK is not your typical harem anime, like girls falling inlove with the MC for no reason. What\u2019s also good is that the story is smart and stays consistent with itself. It stays interesting despite it's returning premise of capturing a girls heart. It focuses more to catching loose souls, make a girl fall inlove with him. At first, I don't like it that all the girls memories while they're being conquered were all gone but after watching both s1 and s2 I gotten used to it.\r\nWAIT~!!! A single kissmade you happy!? Why not sixteen kisses!?, Took a week to make that girl fall in love with you!? Why not a day!?, Can't make a decision because of so many different types of girls!? Why not all of them!? That's our GOD OF CONQUEST KEIMA for you. But of course, making the heroine fall inlove is not an easy task, he needs to plan it well and execute it perfectly, or the loose soul will get even more powerfull and difficult to conquer.\\n\\n\r\nI watched all the seasons of TWGOK in one go, and all I can say is that both first and second season are good but the third season is a masterpiece, the story became more interesting, serious and really entertaining.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\\n\r\nCharacters treat each somewhat like you\u2019d expect them to in real life. Their reactions to the strange situations the story present them with have a kind of \"real\" feeling to them. What\u2019s funny is how Keima is very unpopular at school, just like you\u2019d expect him being an extreme otaku and all.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being that, Keima (THE GOD OF CONQUEST) became one of my favorite characters. He only date girls in games and wouldn\u2019t know how to in real life, nor does he care. This kind of making fun of it's own premises, is what makes TWGOK feel so real, while being amazingly imaginative at the same time. He's one of the best MC and the reason why TWGOK became an amazing anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, I found them mostly interesting and likeable. Although they don\u2019t feel altogether original they manage to avoid the typical personality types. Each heroines (I personally like Kanon and Tenri) has different personalities, that makes Keima's task more interesting.\\n\\n\r\n[Animation]\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty decent, not really great but not bad too. In my opinion, the animation and art style is pleasant to look at.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound/Music]\\n\\n\r\nThe music is awesome and memorable (the original OP song \"God Only Knows\", and the Love theme are two of my favorite songs of all time.\\n\\n\r\nI watched the both versions(dub and sub) and I prefer you to watch the sub, mostly because of the amazing voice acting of Hiro Shimono(Keima) and Kanae Itou(Elsie).\\n\\n\r\nRating:\\n\\n\r\nStory = 9 \\n\r\nCharacters = 9\\n\r\nAnimation = 8\\n\r\nSound/Music = 9\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment = 10\\n\r\nOverall = 9",

That's what keima the protagonist of the story did and it worked out pretty well for him despite his life being on the line and all.\r\nI wasn't expecting much from this anime when first watching it but what's really funny is  that I was a big nerd like Keima in high school without all the smarts sadly. I kind of used his strategy with my own twist of course to pick up girls and it actually worked to mysurprise. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I learnt is any relationship is built on the amount of encounters and how strong they are to get too a strong bond with each other. So maybe the same will work for you if you need a boost but just be smart and careful or s*** could end up like school days real fast. If you haven't seen school days or it hasn't been ruined for you, go check it out. You'll be in for a treat... \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is a nice ride that will make you laugh and keep you engage with funny scenes, witty banter, and overall a dope soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nIts a definite must watch. So watch it and enter a new world because when it comes too it, \"life's just a crappy game.\"\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm all for rom-coms, and I did choose to watch this anime because I wanted to see a little romance, and this came somewhat fairly recommended by a YouTuber I subscribe to who shall remain nameless.\r\nOverall, it's not a bad show, in fact, it's an average, enjoyable show with a different turn out then I was expected. It's kind of a magical girl twist on itself with a otome game sort of angle. It's interesting, though I felt like the idea itself was grand and could have been executed far better than it was. I guess perhaps I could say it's a little predictable withit's narrative, when it could have very easily, and to greater effect, broken convention and made for a far better and much more interesting development. But that's neither here or there, it just speaks to my disappointment since I saw potential in it's premise.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does bother me, though, very, very much \u2014 this coming from someone who binged all the seasons on Crunchyroll \u2014 was the demon girl's (whose name I neither remember nor care to look for) voice. Oh, how I grew to loathe it. At the beginning it wasn't so intensely insufferable, after all, I'm accustomed to the japanese trope of loud, strident female characters. It's part of the medium. But how she hindered my experience! She's at least twice louder than any other character, and needlessly so. One needn't screech in order to convey cheery. That's something one watching in increment probably wouldn't notice, but since I followed one episode with the next, the thought of being subjected to the demon girl's voice became... Harrowing, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of the anime that somewhat colored my experience was the way the main character was treated by his peers (or conquests, depending on the episode). I understand the use of derision and disgust towards him, it's part of the plot to convince us that, just like he doesn't appreciate reality, reality, in return, doesn't appreciate him. That doesn't bother me, I know why it was done this way. What bothered me was the frequent physical aggression directed to a character who presents no ill intention towards anyone. He's neither violent nor perverted, if anything, the opposite is true. He's rude at times and insensitive, but that doesn't merit a punch in the face or a kick or something akin to that. This kind of extreme punishment is the usual anime girl response to either true or perceived sleights, usually of the sexual variety, and we, the audience, often side with the woman in some instances because whether it was intentional or accidental, sexual harassment should be punished. But this is not the case here. He doesn't deserve this, and I grew tired of seeing him become a punching bag, no, I pitied him. A lot.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Katsuragi is a solid, interesting character that's not usually seen front and center in a rom-com. The show was not ecchi, and in the opportunities where it could have been raunchier, it took the high road, which I appreciated. I mainly stuck around because of him and his incredible mother. I would recommend this show for people who would appreciate a somewhat adolescent take on the genre, with a few warnings. Such as demon girl's loud voice.",

            "content": "In the past couple of days I watched season 1 and 2 of The world god only knows or Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai. Yes I watched all of it back to back over the period of 2 days (thats probably around 10 hours worth of footage give or take so that's about 5 hours per night).Every now and again I will come across an anime that really makes me want to immediately start the next episode, and this is one of them. So let me get down to what this anime is about.\r\nLets start with the protagonist. He is known as the capture god,and he gained that name from always playing visual novels and being able to capture any and every heroine. Literally about 90% his screen time shows him playing on his \"PFP\". His actual name is Katsuragi Keima. As you can imagine he is branded as a nerd by his classmates. Although this doesn't matter to him as real life is just a bad game (I agree with this statement). I kind of like this character as he represents the ultimate gamer. Whats more is that he doesn't seem to play games as an escape from real life. In fact he is able to ace all his exams whilst also playing games at the same time. I think this is a goal many gamers would like to achieve. In fact it kind of makes me jealous. Life is a bad game indeed.\\n\\n\r\nNext is de Lute Ima Elucia. She is a demon. Although there is very little \"demon\" about her. She is your typical sidekick character.\\n\r\n I'll need to discuss the story a little before I continue. So down in Hell it is actually more civil than you would expect. All the evil demons were sealed away to bring peace to hell. However the souls of these demons have escaped into the living world to hide inside the hearts of humans with empty hearts. So to counteract this threat Hell has put together a team to capture these \"loose\" souls.\\n\r\n De Lute Ima Elucia is part of this team.     In order to find a \"buddy\" to help take care of loose souls, Elucia came to Keima under the impression that his ability to \"capture\" any girl. This is because the best way to get a loose soul out of hiding is too fill the heart with something else, like love. However Elucia didn't know that Keima's ability to capture any girl only applied to games,  and he has never attempted to capture a real girl. Unfortunately Keima had already unintentionally signed a contract that meant if he didn't complete the contract he would lose his head.\\n\\n\r\nSo that about summaries the setting of the story. Keima has to capture real girls or he'll be headless (and dead). All the heroines in this story are actually quite similar to the girls inside games giving Keima all the knowledge he needs to capture the girls. I quite like most of the heroines in this story. There were a couple of heroines who I didn't really like but I found them interesting never the less. Each heroine does have a bit of an in depth story or problem which Keima ends up solving.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 pretty much follows the same setting of find loose soul, quality time with the heroine, capturing the loose soul and then adding in a filler to break the ice a little. Despite this simple layout it still stays just as good. Behind each heroine is a different story so it isn't really repetitive and could effectively keep going.\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWell that was more of summary than a review so please let me know what you think. As my first review I'm a bit worried that is bad or whatever.\\n\\n\r\nI have a blog at http://kenofthoseguys.blogspot.co.uk/",

            "content": "Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai, The World God Only Knows, is really better than it should be. From only reading the simple plot description, it may seem like just another romantic harem comedy, but it's quite unique in execution. It takes advantage of the tropes of both it's genre and it's subject matter to create  a really entertaining, and light weight ( in a good way) anime.\r\nStory: (7) \r\nThe concept is pretty simple. Keima Katsuragi is an obsessive otaku gamer known as the God of Conquest due to his skill at Gal Games (dating Sims). There's no virtual girl that he can't win, butin real life he is antisocial and views the world as flawed and annoying. One day, he unknowingly answers a message from Hell and ends up being forced to help the cute demon girl, Elsie, hunt down loose souls that have hidden in the hearts of various real life girls. He is reluctant to help at first, but is forced due to the contractual obligation of he and Elsie losing their heads from the magical collars on their necks in the event that he chose not to help. To capture the lost souls, he has to make each of the affected girls fall in love with him, and get a kiss from each to break the spell. So, he and Elsie proceed to pretty much play a real life dating sim. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a very deep concept and might seem rather shallow when taken at face value, but it proves to be an effective one. This is due to how it's executed. It is great fun to watch Keima and Elsie research each girl and then apply Keima's gaming strategies. Plus the harem element is addressed in an interesting  way due to the fact that each girl forgets Keima after the soul leaves them, so there's no drama between girls or anything like that. Just like choosing different routes in a dating sim. Surprisingly, this doesn't feel cheap or exploitative. Keima really doesn't get anything from the girls except a kiss, and the girls move on with their lives improved. The \"captures\" even tend to be the on the sweet side of romantic and usually feels genuine. \\n\\n\r\n12 episodes is certainly not enough to contain this story, but that's okay because it had more seasons planned from the start. (Just recently a 3rd season was announced)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: (7) \\n\r\nThe animation is smooth, the character designs are pleasing and the art is nice all around. It's not anything really special, but is above proficient. Where it excels is the sight gags and style. It takes advantage of it's subject matter and uses a nice and humorous combination of \"god, heaven, and gaming imagery; Especially when Keima is lecturing Elsie (and the audience) over the various types of girls, and his different philosophies on gaming and romance.As a fan of video games I was also impressed at the amount of detail at into the gaming aspect.  All the games Keima played were realistic and detailed The series really knows its material.  The attention to detail and all the over the top symbolism/comedy gags (even some anime references) makes up for the perfectly normal art.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8)\\n\r\n  The music is good, and used effectively throughout. One of the high points is the epic opening; it sets the tone perfectly for the series and is even used throughout. It's just great. There is also an arc dealing with idols that features some nice, appropriate performances. As for the voice acting: it's also above average. All the voices match the characters' personalities and/or archetypes. Nothing outstanding but also nothing weak either. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (8)  \\n\r\nKeima is an excellent protagonist. As opposed to the vague \"dense male lead\" or \"self insert\" types usually seen in romantic comedies and harem shows, he is very defined. He is an arrogant, intelligent, analytical, anti hero along the lines of Lelouch Lamperouge (Code Geass) except he is also a delusional otaku gamer that has no ambitions or plans for the real world and only focuses on being \"god\" of his niche obsession. He applies game rules to all parts of real life and especially this job of capturing the souls.(This is often used for comedy)\\n\r\nAlthough he is calculating and temperamental, at times you can see he has caring and honest side when he's helping the girls deal with their problems. \\n\\n\r\nElsie is a cute, clumsy, air headed demon girl who is  charged with collecting the souls along with Keima.She isn't a very complex character, but she isn't annoying (except to Keima) and is well meaning and funny. Her ignorance of the human world is a major element of the humor in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe conquest heroines are also interesting. Even though they are all gaming and anime archetypes, (tsundere, idol, athlete, etc,) they are charming in their own way. This lends well to Keima's explanations of the personality types, and gives the show the same vibe as a gal game\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8)\\n\r\n Very enjoyable. A perfect watch for when you just want to watch something entertaining but not complex. Pretty much just quality entertainment, but with some clever themes, concepts, and parody for added flavor.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (8)  \\n\r\nThough I enjoyed it, I was going to give this a 7 because it isn't all that deep and had a few fillers that weren't up to par with the capture arcs. What made me upgrade it to an 8 is the fact that during the capture arcs I would immediately rush to each following episodes just to see how it resolved. Even when I finished it, I went straight into the next season.This made me realize how much I enjoyed it, and how effective it was at hooking the viewer. Well worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nKami nomi zo Shiru Sekai, The World God Only Knows, is a really nice, non-typical romantic comedy that often shows surprising attention to detail.",

            "content": "I went into The World God Only Knows because of the recommendation of a friend who considered it one of the best anime/manga out there. Just 1 season of the anime into it, and I already find it hard to disagree with this. So right now, I feel like doing all I can to tell people why I consider it an amazing anime that you should totally check out.\r\nThe story of this anime is about a handsome nerd named Keima, who has a sense of superiority over humanity because he understands the fictional girls in his dating sims. However, because he has considered himself amaster of conquering these fictional girls, the underworld decides that he can do the same in real life. So a cute demon girl name Elsie shows up to reveal that he must capture spirits that have trapped themselves in the bodies of different girls. In order to avoid death for both of them, he must now win the hearts of these girls and kiss them so that Elsie can capture these lost spirits. And this begins what I can only describe as a unique twist on the usual \"____ of the week\" type of story. While not literally every week, Keima continues to find girls he has to have fall for him for the sake of his life. These girls range from a supposed rich girl to a pink haired pop idol, each with their own distinct personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe main thing that shocked me was how much I really cared about these girls, especially the ones given the most focus. Now Elsie is more the sweet fake sister of Keima instead of a love interest but she might be my favorite. Her main purpose seems to be the naive, cute girl who learns about Keima and the human world. And despite that not being the most deep or creative character (at least in theory), it all seemed more genuine than most attempts at a similar character, and she genuinely put a smile on my face when she was on screen, especially because of her endearing actions throughout this part of this series.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also Kanon and Shiori. Kanon is a pop idol teen who is increasingly annoyed at Keima's apathy towards her and her performing and Shiori is (to an almost absurd degree) a shy girl who loves reading above all else. Both have fairly similar yet different arcs that involve them overcoming their insecurities, one involving a need for attention, and one coming from a fear or inability to speak out against anything. In both cases, Keima eventually figures out a plan based on what he knows of girls in games in order to slowly but surely get these girls to fall for them. However, he seems to slowly gain some respect for real life girls through these events and while his guesses are shockingly accurate, the girls tend to surprise him despite that. It seems like the series is trying to say a lot of things about stereotyping and assuming things about people and about nerds. One thing I've at least gotten out of it is how many elements of the story could be considered sexist and yet it never feels that way. The series seems more than self-aware enough so that it avoids this being about how a guy can conquer women and is more about a guy discovering things about the world while also using his incredible nerd knowledge to help teenager girls' insecurities. It seems to be on this impressive line that most writers wouldn't be able to stay on and its intelligence is one of the things that elevates it to greatness. Despite being based on the cliche of a teenage girl who is also a pop idol, I found Kanon's story to be the most believable. Just the idea of a famous teenage girl so desperate to always be the center of attention is very sad and real to me based on how real life celebrities can end up like. Shiori's was arguably the most over-the-top and silly but her character I also found the most sympathetic. I'm already sympathetic to this type of character but it being written as well as it was made it even more so.\\n\\n\r\nIt is really astounding how much I cared about these characters. Like more than I usually expect, even from a lot of great anime. But unlike many anime I've seen in recent years where it had to be overly depressing for that to happen, this series is uplifting and always ends with a happy ending that genuinely makes you feel glad you watched it. It's the type of thing I wish a lot of fiction understood about emotion. And while the serious stuff is great, the other thing that makes this such a joy to watch is the comedy. This series made me laugh pretty hard a few times, and I was consistently laughing throughout the series, which is really rare. I'm kinda interested in how these scenes were in the manga, because transitioning comedy from one medium to another seems like a difficult process to get down. But this one makes that look effortless, because the timing is brilliant in this series. They always know, when to start a joke, when to end it and how long to keep it going. There's just enough obvious ones or built up jokes along with stuff that is random enough that it makes you laugh but not random enough (or too frequently random) that it gets old like certain wacky series. The shocking amount of western pop culture references were also great. Elsie in particular got a lot of laughs from me, which is a big reason why she's my favorite character right now. And this comedy is what helps make the sad and dramatic stuff even better, because you get this sense of likability and fun from the comedy so that you care when sad stuff happens. It is so simple, yet so great.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are both really solid. They're nothing you're gonna praise as brilliant like I just did for the rest of this, but it does what it needs to do and does it quite well and that's basically all I ask for. It's nice, colorful, didn't have any mistakes I noticed, was animated decently, was fun to watch as an animated series. It's cool. The music though is great. The composer of the background music has done mostly work in JRPGs and similar titles and you can tell. There's this one scene in particular that tries to make how many different types of books there are into this grand, epic, emotional scene and it works because the music is epic in all the right ways. And that's fairly consistent with the series, just great compositions all around. The Opening too (Ending's pretty good too). It starts out as a fairly typical but extremely well done J-Pop song but then turns into this more holy sounding (only way I can describe it) mixed with I think hints of auto-tune, which is perfect for a series about a game nerd God like the protagonist in this series. Just love that. Voice acting is great too. Pretty every performance is as believable and fun as it needs to be.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had one very minor complaint, is that the last episode of the first season didn't feel amazing enough for the series it was in. It was still really good and there are more seasons so whatever, but it could've ended that a bit better I feel...\\n\\n\r\nSo I genuinely love this series and I can assume that it stays as good in the sequel seasons or the manga. It is pretty much a masterpiece and if I can, I'd like as many people as possible to give it a chance.",

            "content": "This is a really fun show. I actually really like it even if it\u2019s about something I\u2019m not very interested in, dating sims... Now, I understand the leer that people have to them, guy gets girl with simple questions and answers. Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t real life, and so I can never understand those that are stuck within the gaming world. That\u2019s why this show is so hilarious to me and makes me want to keep watching this.\r\nKeima is rather strange and interesting character, only interested in video game girls instead of real ones. The strange thing is, when he actually goes for getting the heartof real girls, he actually gets them. I guess it helps that he lives in the anime world anyway because most of what he pulls actually wouldn\u2019t work. It\u2019s funny because of all the cheesy lines that he uses and stocking the girls around to see their lives. I don\u2019t know about you but if a guy dressed like a young Austin Powers reject was following me around, I would call the cops. \\n\\n\r\nElsie is\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to explain her really. She is childish and crazy; most of the time she messes things up when she tries to do anything. The only thing she is really good at is cleaning.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s like his world itself is a dating sim because no girl in our world would ever go for the cheesy things he does from banners to strange stockings that he does. All the girls are pretty unrealistic stereotypes but it actually works for the story plot. The only episode that felt really bothersome was episode 4 with the loop. It only felt like it was there to show Keima\u2019s personality a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork seems rather good although it is really bright and \u2018chubby.\u2019 A lot of times, they seem like chibi\u2019s or plastic doll. The ghosts look like strange blobs and seem odd. There\u2019s not much I can say about the artwork since its pretty much like any other slice of life that has come out this around this time.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices are really interesting, and its fun hearing the English Sosuke Sagara from Full Metal Panic talking about dating sims! That\u2019s right; Chris Patton is the voice of Keima Katsuragi. And his supporting character is Luci Christian\u2019s voice, which also is the voice of Kaname Chidori from Full Metal Panic as well. She plays the Spirit Hunter by the name of Elucia de Rux Ima. Its strange hearing there voices in here because they the characters here are almost complete opposite the characters they did play in Full Metal Panic. Another opposite is Hilary Haag who not only plays Tessa from Full Metal Panic, but Mio Aoyama, the rather short and prideful rich girl in this, and the shy Shiori Shiomiya who is more like Tessa in a sense. Basically, if you love the English voices of Full Metal Panic, you\u2019re probably going to like the English voices here. \\n\r\nI actually really like the opening song; it has a rather nice beat. The ending is alright, though not as good as the beginning.\\n",

In any other show, our delusional hero would be confronted with the stark glare of reality, learn a very special lesson about the true meaning of friendship, put down his Playfation Portable and go play softball or something.  But while logic zigs, The World God Only Knows zags.  Instead of confronting fantasy with reality, it takes fantasy and ladles on more fantasy by having a magical demon girl swoop in and confirming that girls in the real world do in fact behave as theydo in video games.  Well played, anime.  Well played.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of fantasy bending reality to its will, the show is somehow better than its premise.

            "content": "I was looking forward to this show this season as i found the manga to be really enjoyable and having a pretty cool protagonist at the same time. Kami Nomi is about Keima, an otaku and a super gaming otaku at that, he's known as the Capturing God who can capture any girls heart as long as the in a video game. Keima soon receives an email that peeks his interest only to find he's signed a contracts with a demon. He is now tasked with capturing loose souls that reside in girls hearts by filling in the gaps with love.\r\nThe show is split upinto arcs that feature the four girls. The first two only take up an episode each but these are used to introduce our main characters and show us what this Anime is going to be like. but the other two girls take up a few episodes each split up by filler episodes before and after that give us more insight as to how dedicated Keima is to gaming, like how many he can play at once, i just feel sorry for who ever pays the electricity bills.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good, better than a lot of shows by a long way but does lack a little originality that other shows do have, i tends to use odd expressions frequently and even forms chibi versions of a character to highlight and make the comedy more funny. The animation is a decent part, its pretty smooth and really helps when certain scenes are completely exagerated for comedic effect.\\n\\n\r\nSound is one of the better areas, the opening is great and original, the full song is something like 8 minutes in length and as well as opening the show parts of the full song are used as background music. One of the featured girl characters is an idol and her singing is nice, the voice actor is new to voice acting but you can really tell she excells at singing. The voice acting in general is pretty tame, its outstanding but they portray their characters personality perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are wonderful though not exactly new. Keima is an excellent protagonist, he has no interest in the 3D world or reall girls he only has eyes for video game yet still mangaes to get perfect scores at school, he is forced into a contract and then forced into dealing with real girls and uses his knowledge of conquering a girls heart from games and puts it into use in capturing souls. Elsea is the demon that contracts Keima and is genrally a clumsy girl who tends to be completely useless as she either just watchs Keima or gets him into difficult situations, she also has a scarf that can transform into anything, how conveniant. Ayumi is the first girl to be captured and is a typical athlete character and is bullied by sempai. Mio is a rich snob and acts accordingly but only in appearence. Kanon is an idol and is afraid of disapearing and has issues when people don't pay attention to her on stage and was once part of a music group. Shiori is the quite library girl who does all her talking inside her head and has trouble expressing how she feels because of this. All other characters don't really offer anything and are pretty stereotyped like Kanons manager, Keimas teacher, library chairman, Keimas Mother does have a few funny moments too.\\n\\n\r\nThe show as a twelve episode series is not that great, its a show that needs a lot more episodes to really flesh the characters out more and thankfully a second series is being made. It has enough funny moments to keep you interested but does unfortunately leave you a little underwhelmed, as a fan of the manga it is a bit disappointing but is by far not the worst show you could watch that incorparates romance and comedy.",

            "content": "Before I being my review, I want to say that I am not the most serious critic. I only state my opinions in my reviews, and I don't shove false facts down peoples throats saying the show is bad. With that out of the way, let me start the review.\r\nIt's been quite a while since I watched the TWGOK series, and I have only started reading the manga a few weeks ago. During that time, I've read 198 chapters, and also in the middle of that, I started watching Hunter x Hunter (2011). But, after a while, I decided to finally review the entire series,starting with the first season.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Story:8/10[/b]\\n\\n\r\nThe story is great. It's not that simple, and it's not that complex. A seventeen-year old high school student who does nothing but play video games all day is visited by a demon from Hell, Elucia de Lute Ima, better known as, Elsie. Elsie comes to him saying that he must capture runaway spirits, which are spirits from Hell that hide in the gaps of peoples hearts. The people who they hide in are... odd girls. He must fill the gap in their hearts with love, and, yeah. That's pretty much the show. But, it's entertaining, nevertheless.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Art: 9/10[/b]\\n\\n\r\nI'm not usually too worried about art style and animation in anime anymore, I just stopped caring. I just try and not watch things that were before 1990. But, in this anime, the animation and the art style is perfect, whoever done the animation should be congratulated. I forgot which studio it was, Manglobe, was it?\\n\\n\r\n[b]Sound: 7/10[/b]\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great, opening is okay. Every opening in TWGOK, well, ALMOST every opening is English, but, one of the very few English songs I've heard that are actually good. So, if you know me, I absolutely despise English songs, I think they sound like garbage, and they taint the music industry. Sorry, just how I feel.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Character: 9/10[/b]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great, not one of them are hate-able at all. This season covers three arcs of the manga, which is the Ayumi Takahara arc, the Rich Girl arc (Mio Aoyama) and the Librarian arc (Shiori Shiomiya) and I say they did a good job of covering all of those characters. They were all done pretty perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Overall: 9/10 [/b]\\n\\n\r\nThis anime series is a great start to the TWGOK series, and so far, after reading 198 chapters I feel like it will become one of my favorite manga series, and I haven't read much manga so I don't know what I can say.\\n\r\n(Haven't read much manga = around 50). That's my logic, aight? Have a great time.",

Throw away everything you know about Harem anime. normally the protagonist is some kind of either cool guy or a jerk surrounded by girls and he must pick one/survive them. \r\nThis couldn't be more different! Keima is an total otaku who wants to do nothing but play eroge on his PFP. He survives purely on gaming and it is rare to see him without it. he calls himself \"The God of Conquest\" because he conquersevery girl in his video games. One day he receives a challenge with a girl he could not possibly conquer. so he accepts while simultaneously and unwittingly enters a contract with the Demon Elsie, a cute, cheery, dojiko girl who truly believes in Keima's abilities. He must now help Elsie collect all of the Escaped Souls inhabiting humans. Surprisingly, all of these humans are girls! the only way to remove a demon soul from his target is for him to \"play her route\" and replace the demon in her heart with himself, a task he loathes, with none other than a kiss. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime so different is that the girls still don't flock to him after he has kissed them. Rather the soul leaves them and they completely forget the encounter. This makes each capture all the better since he doesn't have to deal with fan girls hounding him the whole time. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea behind this anime is fantastic because rather than restart the story line, like in Amagami SS, and do a whole bunch of story arcs, he effectively plays every girl's route in a connected flow that makes it fun to watch and enjoy.",

            "content": "I'll try to keep this as spoiler-free as possible. This is my first review, but it's less a professional review and more like my thoughts about why this anime is worth a shot at watching. I'll try to keep it short as well. \r\nAnime needs to have memorable moments. After you've watched it, and when you turn back to reminisce it, what is it that stuck with you the most? If you ask yourself that question, this is how you'll realize if it was a good series or not. \r\nThe World God Only Knows is a memorable anime with the good sense of the word,mainly because it manages to earn your empathy about its characters. I saw a piece of myself in every girl and their worries, and even in the protagonist. The fear of failing to meet everyone's expectations. The way you have to deal with the loss of a loved one and the inevitable changes it brings into your life. The fear of blundering where it counts, in the most important moment and missing your biggest chance. Being unable to offer your own opinion in fear of rejection, not being able to stand up for yourself properly and finding refuge in a different world. Even though in the long term it will make you miserable, you plow yourself into your hobby as a defense mechanism in order to avoid all the things you consider unpleasant. \\n\\n\r\nLots of series have tried this, but Kaminomi manages to really drive the message home by using likable characters and a fitting pacing in its mini arks. It uses humor correctly and knows when to be serious and make the right impact on the viewer. Though not all episodes are of equal quality, the series nails it where it counts, leaving a memorable impression, making you think and teaching you a lesson or two. \\n\\n\r\nObjectively, and taking into account all factors, (like some useless and childish stand-off episodes, or some arks taking a bit long to come around) this series is probably a 7/10. However, taking into account all I said before, I give it a 8/10 rating because I think it's something you should definitely try to watch once and that has important things to say.\\n\\n\r\nPeace~!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I do like him in some ways . \r\nReally if i had to make one complaint about the show. It's that i wish we got more of the Demon assistant. I really like her.\r\nI was expecting the show to do more comedic routes. Such as having the MC make a Trap fall in love with him or having to make his mother fall in love with him. I feel that they missed some funny chances.\r\nThe Music is also pretty good tbh. I waskind of surprised by it.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls that the MC has to get to fall in love with are pretty interesting. My favorite is the Blonde girl that used to be super rich but is now poor. \\n\\n\r\nI wish they did more with her. Such as at the end of her story arch have her get the goal to actually do well in school so she can take over her fathers former business when she's older. Have her actually try to be a successful person in the future and become wealthy on her own merit. Also i kind of wish she wasn't having to live in a r run down apartment barely making ends meet while her mother is having to work every hour  of daylight just to make a living. The blonde hair girl's entire story arch i feel could have been it's own anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlso can we get a parody series of this where it's some girl that accidentally signs the contract and has to go around making other girls fall in love with her ?  That would be really funny to see. Obviously keep the cute female demon assistant. \\n\\n\r\nOverall a really fun show that i ended up binge watching in one day.",

In contrary to the most of harem anime where the love feelings are created by the place they live, in this anime, the love feelings are created by duty. Each love is a mission and the main characterhas to work hard to succeed it, whereas kindness is enough in classical harem.\\n\\n\r\nThe other good point is that each girl has her personality, that makes the anime really pleasant to follow and discover other girls. It's not object woman who loves everything from the main character.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is really original but above all, it is really fun and you will laugh a lot.\\n\\n\r\nPS: the VF is good.\\n\r\nPPS: the second season and the third are really good and really fun.

I mean basically this is about a smart kid who does nothing but play dating games, and applies the same methods that he uses in his game with real girls.  This may seem a bit confusing as you are reading this, but trust me it makes sense if you watch it.  If I try to explain about the sprits and how that plays into a part of the anime,you might get confused.  The first EP does a good job a explaining the plot behind it, so if you are actually taking the time to read this, PLEASE at the very least go watch EP 1 is you haven't seen it. \\n\\n\r\nI am not a fan of chibi artwork, but the usage of chibi is to put more emphasis into the scene.  It was always used at the right times so I am not going to complain about something was meant to be there.   \\n\\n\r\nPersonally I think that the OP theme has a nice melody, but gay lyrics.  That is all I wanted to say.\\n\\n\r\nThe different variety of girls is really what makes this such an interesting anime.  Athletic, rich, popular, and shy.  The other thing that I liked about all the characters is that when they are first introduced \"Kami sama\" always points out the traits of the girl.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the reason why I enjoyed watching this so much was because I also don't like the real world and the fact that I am an avid gamer.  I don't play dating sims, but I do spend a fair amount of time in front of a screen playing some kind of game.  If only the real world was like this anime?... that's what I was thinking as I was watching this.  \\n\r\nThis is only one of the few anime that I have watched that I got so into it that I had to and read the manga for it.  \\n\r\nOn a side note if the \"PFP\" was real I would buy that thing as soon as it comes out. ^_^",

            "content": "'Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai' is a decent anime with an interesting take on romance and harem genres. That said however there are a few shortcomings in this series such as poor character development and occasionally, use of bland humour. \r\nLet's start with the plot. The main protagonist Katsuragi Keima is an avid dating sim gamer and as such is disconnected with reality and the people around him. One day he receives a message from a fellow gamer, a message that turns out to be a contract between him and a female demon called Elsie. Through a certain condition of the contract, our young Katsuragiis now faced with a prospect of capturing loose souls that reside within girls' hearts. The setting - your average Japanese high school in some city, with the characters occasionally appearing elsewhere in \"one-off\" locations.\\n\\n\r\nElsie and Katsuragi set off on a quest to capture all the loose souls and the story focuses on those two and the girl they're attempting to \"capture\" most of the time. The overwhelming majority of secondary characters (there aren't many of those) are just there either for fanservice or humour purposes. The first shortcoming is that Katsuragi's female companion Elsie, is  a bit of a shallow character. While certainly having distinct personality traits which differentiate her from other shallow fanservice-ish characters here, this season doesn't give us enough background information on her. She's a demon... sent down to collect souls and that's pretty much it. The first season could have given her a bit more time.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, I felt that the humour at times was a bit cliche. Katsuragi's mother and his targets are the perfect examples. The good mother with an evil side and teenage girls pelting affectionate guys with various objects? These are known archetypes and this type of humour is a bit overused these days. That's not to say that this series completely lacks good humour. There were moments of brilliance and novelty such as Katsuragi's gaming shenanigans in the 12th episode which managed to squeeze a few laughs out of me.\\n\\n\r\nNow the highlight of this anime and perhaps the quality that truly sets it apart from piles of other bland harem&romance series is how it's all presented. Katsuragi has to use his gaming knowledge and apply it to real life situations which often has awkward results at first. An introverted dating sim geek capturing girls is something new in the harem&romance genre, as I usually expect the male lead in this kind of a story to be confident and suave, or at the very least perverted. Katsuragi is neither of those and treats it all more as a profession. Especially interesting was Katsuragi's capture of the librarian ( Shiori Shiomiya ) as both him and her are fairly timid and reserved. What followed had actually more to do with philosophy and psychology than romance and the way Katsuragi helped her to open up to the world and challenge her fears was genuinely intriguing and it was the part that I enjoyed the most. In fact that was the single greatest chapter in this entire season of this anime as it engaged the viewer intellectually rather than emotionally which is something you'd not expect out of a romance. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it is absolutely staggering. The characters are all drawn precisely and the light effects on Katsuragi's PFP ( a play on the 'PSP' handheld console) and how his games are presented while he's playing is extremely authentic. All the static objects, buildings etc. were nicely done and you can see that a lot of effort went into the visual aspect of this anime. Likewise the music was enjoyable; some of this series' OST pieces feature classical music so it gives the viewer a soothing and enjoyable experience. The opening song was very catchy and in sync with the atmosphere of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nSumming up, a good anime with a decent story and certainly plenty of originality but plagued by shallow characters and perhaps also being a bit dull in the humour department, save for a few episodes. However, it's still a recommended watch considering the plot's originality and the more interesting, intellectual take on romance. \\n\\n\r\n'Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai' gets 7 points from me. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've never heard of this series until, well, I actually started to watch it during the season.  I gotta say though, I enjoyed it way more than I thought it would, nor did I think that I stayed watching it as I did. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe anime centers around a middle schooler named Keima, known to the sim-dating game community as the \"God of Conquest\".  He doesn't give a damn about the real life, so he dwells in his 2-D games. This was until he received  an email asking him to prove that he is the God of Conquest, which he arrogantly accepted.Little did he know that it would mean the conquest itself was in real life.  With this new contract, he receives aid from a Demon named Elsea, which briefs him on the contract and what his goals are: He must release wandering souls that embed themselves into someone's heart by kissing them; if he fails he dies. From here on, he encounters 4 girls in his school that have those souls in their hearts. That's basically the anime.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you think this was a harem anime, like I initially did, well I would say you were very wrong.  This is because, sure, it had arcs about each girl, but in the end, when they kissed Keima, and got the souls out, they end up not remembering anything that he did. Not only that, NONE of the girls were initially interested in him, AT ALL, unlike the other harem series. I also found it very to be very creative in that it's a story about a putting the actions used in Keima's games, it is reflected to his real world.  I really enjoyed that\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe first thing I noticed about the character art was their ears!!  they were HUGE! Though, strangely enough, they seem to befit the characters very well. In terms of facial structure, they were smooth, and the women did look pretty typical, not too much details applied.  Thought I still think Elsea is very kawaii.",

The third season though, that was when the story finally topped dragon ball z. After an initial confusion of the first couple of episodes of season 3, mostly because I hadn't watched the ova's yet, I becamepossessed by the story, with a constant feeling of suspense keeping me hooked through out the entire season, which I binge watched in a single day.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was very natural feeling, and the transformation was part of what kept me hooked, truly one of the best developed shows I've seen. Not only that but I feel in love with so many of the characters, their interactions were perfectly mixed with realism and classic anime comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending though really got me, it was perfect but it got me more than any show ever has. I shed a couple tears, which is more than I have for a show before and I'm not even sure if it was more because of the way the show ended or if I was sad that it was over. I didn't even cry at the end of Angel Beats, that fact making me feel alittle bit like an awful person. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway I highly recommend the series to anyone looking to fall in love with most of the cast of a show. \\n",

Kick back and relax folks as I unwrap this bad boy!\r\nStory: 9\r\nWe follow our main protagonist of the story Katsuragi Keima as he tries to make sense of a problem thrust upon him by a curious, cute little demon by the name of Elucia.  I found the overall story very interesting and simple to follow.  The comedy in the anime is appropriate and at times hilarious, especially the chemistry between Keima-kun and Elucia.  Itwas also great watching Keima come up with ways to get the female leads to fall in love with him.  Yep call me a romantic! \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is crisp and very appealing and has excellent character design.  I recommend you watch the anime in 720p or 1080p for a great immersive experience.  Yep IMAX!\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9\\n\\n\r\nYou can have a superbly written anime with astonishing artwork but if the soundtrack isn't to standard it could sully the entire experience.

            "content": "Note: This \"one\" review is technically a review for all three seasons. So if you are TL;DRingly scrolling through this, look at the last paragraph of each section (each section is separated by a sentence) to find the much simpler version of these reviews.\r\n....\r\nStill TL;DR? Here's the even shorter review for y'all:\r\nAll in All, The World God Only Knows is a fun and creative new outlook on the romance genre, it blends it all in perfectly, with likable characters, new twists and turns, and great character development all wrapped in a light-hearted bundle of kawaii as fuck.\r\nShould you watch this show? Honestly, I wouldn't sayyou should put it at your utmost top, but it's definitely a great show, I would say it's for those times where you want a care-free, free-spirited romance show where the MC actually fucking grows a pair for once... Oh, and he's also not bound to any one girl during the show as they lose their memories (say whaaat!?). Also for when you have nothing to watch that you were looking forward to, I feel that is truly when this show shines. \\n\\n\\n\r\nActual Review:\\n\\n\r\nDo you like random scenes of romance?\\n\\n\r\nDon't you wish there was a show that was just about romance and cutesy moments?\\n\\n\r\nDon't you wish there was a Visual Novel where you could choose EVERY GIRL possible rather than just being confined to one choice (Except this Visual Novel is an anime)?\\n\\n\r\nDon't you want Romance, more Romance and nothing but Romance?\\n\\n\r\nCAN'T YOU JUST WAIT FOR THE DAY THAT ROMANCE DOMINATES THE WORLD AND TAKES OVER THE UNI-\\n\\n\r\nOkay let's get started with the review. \\n\\n\r\nThe World God Only Knows is about a dude who has to \"conquer\" girls (like in Visual Novel's) because they're feeling a little down on life and bad demons inhabit them by taking over these negative emotions. A good demon girl comes to \"help\" this person conquer girls. Oh right did I mention? When he conquers these girls by having them kiss him and feel an overflow of romance the evil demons leave their body because I guess they think \"EW! THIS PERSON'S ACTUALLY HAPPY!\" And after which the girls COMPLETELY lose all memory of their interactions with him.... WAIT WHAT!?\\n\\n\r\nYes you heard me, the girls lose ALL memory of their interactions with him. Ah-hah, so here's where the show gets interesting. This is where you get to why this show is just a straight up ROMANCE where you always wanted that annoying Main Character Harem Protagonist to just pick all the girls instead of the winner being \"virgin\" every time. Well now it's possible! This show sort of brings out the wish you've always had when you were watching that harem show and that's what was enjoyable about it. \\n\\n\r\nWhomever had made this show was honestly pretty clever... they brought out the simplicity of what every romance anime watcher wanted (I think that's what you want, right? Cus if you don't want that then why are you still reading this). They brought out that moment where a guy and a girl are together and that dude actually grows the nuts to just f*ckin grab her by the shirt collar and kiss her for f*cks sake.... now this doesn't happen in the show but I am simply demonstrating the amount of frustration the usual romance shows can cause by forcing the story to go in only one direction (picking one girl).\\n\\n\r\n Now I understand that I've been using the word \"Romance\" a lot but that's not what romance is. I guess what I mean to say is those cuddly moments in romance, rather than two people sharing a deeper bond than friends. Don't get me wrong, if there was ever a romance anime that shows the depth of what a relationship actually is and all the nuances behind it please tell me. But as far as I know, the usual \"RomCom Winning Formula\" right now is: Guy meets girl, guy falls for girl, girl doesn't exactly like him yet, story proceeds and girl likes guy now, guy asks girl out on last episode, and of course, whatever other slight variations there are to that. But basically, those RomComs get dull because there is no depth to them. So as I see it, this show is the sort of \"Boom, you want some cuddly cuddly stuff to happen and not have to wait for around 6 hours to see it? Well then here ya go kid,\"\\n\\n\r\nSo as I see it, this is your classic simplistic show that simply brings out what you wanted for so long in this irritating romcoms, that get straight to the cuddly cuddly and not having to wait 6 hours for it, if you're ready for some doki doki ai fucking shiteru then hop aboard the VN Conqueror anime, 10/10 would watch again.\\n\\n\r\nwait what..... there's a second season? Uh, um, okay...\\n\\n\r\nSo the second season, I wouldn't say is a rinse wash repeat, honestly I felt it was \"perfect\" as to what the audience might want in a way. It had given the audience a feeling of fulfillment, that the anime wasn't cut off short, that it was fleshed out as much as possible. After the first season, you sort of feel like, \"okay, that was nice, I enjoyed that! I want a lil' bit more though...\" The second season delivers that with a red carpet...  however... it is pretty much the same thing as the first season, with a few different settings (and of course, girls) and the introduction of a few new characters (not including girls to be conquered). It's pretty much the same as what you're going to get the first season.\\n\\n\r\nBut the second season also introduces a new element into the show, it looks more deeply into the every day person's life. Even one of the girls he conquers thought herself to be the most average girl, and even her life was beautifully interesting and intriguing. Just the fact that it was \"average\" in itself was intriguing. They displayed and represented a good lesson, saying, \"Hey, everybody's got their own story, likes, dislikes, personalities and whatnot. You're all interesting.\" And the story does well to portray this perfectly. As a kid who had went through something like this, this is a powerful message to be sending out, especially since surely the people who made this knew who their target audience was for this show. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that I noticed all throughout this show was the character development between each character and how it dove deeper into just the \"Kawaiiiii desuuuuuuu~\" generic chick with apparently no struggles in her life. They show that this animated character had a life and emotions during all of this as well. I mean, they really did a good job of doing this, even the supposed \"side character\" got her own story as well.  The character that you BARELY saw, the one who would once in a while give the main character's side kick a magazine, had her own beautifully woven together story. I don't think any other show has accomplished this as well as The World God Only Knows. \\n\\n\r\n If you enjoyed the first season this is pretty much what you're going to get. And after this season, you should feel satisfied. Okay, that was enough girls to conquer, that's all done, it was enjoyable, let's not rinse wash repeat anymore, 10/10 great anime should totally wa-......... \\n\\n\r\nThe World God Only Knows: Megami-hen\\n\\n\r\n.....\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so your favorite series that you wish had just stopped because it was fine where it had left, has just created a new series, what do you do? Well you know what, screw it, you went this far, might as well go the extra mile, and I'm telling you you are going to love the fact that you did. The third season offers a completely new and different twist to the story that you never thought possible, and it does it within reasonable bounds. It takes a completely new look and adds puzzling elements to it all, and by the end of the show you would have wished that the show had continued.\\n\\n\r\nAll in All, The World God Only Knows is a fun and creative new outlook on the romance genre, it blends it all in perfectly, with likable characters, new twists and turns, and great character development all wrapped in a light-hearted bundle of kawaii as fuck.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this show? Honestly, I wouldn't say you should put it at your utmost top, but it's definitely a great show, I would say it's for those times where you want a care-free, free-spirited romance show where the MC actually fucking grows a pair for once...

            "content": "\"Activate! God of Conquest Mode!\" \r\nKeima, the main character, has spent nearly his entire life playing Dating Sims and acquired the nickname, The God of Conquest, his fame in the Dating Sim world is unparalleled, yet a mistake happens that throws him into the world he was striving to escape from. Through the meeting of a Demon named Elucia, and the introduction of loose souls throughout Japan, Keima is forced to conquer girls that transcend the unchangeable patterns of the 2D realm, using his experience from gaming, Elucia and Keima set out to make girls fall for him to stop the destruction of his hometown. \\n\\n\r\nThis review is not going to contain spoilers (I will try my very best), and will most likely be influenced by my personal opinion and experience on anime that I have viewed thus far.\\n\\n\r\nHow should I put this? The reason I first got hooked into this series was the implication of comedy and gaming that I encountered during the first episode. Since I'm kind of an otaku myself, I found connections to the main character Keima. The comedy that was implemented into Kaminomi was standard at some times yet new for me because of the elements that Kaminomi provided that I have yet to see. \\n\\n\r\nThis is an unusual romantic/harem anime, but it works in a couple ways. To start off, one thing that I would argue about would be the way this anime is popularly tagged. Instead of being a shounen themed anime, I would rather recommend a minor theme of netorare, and slice of life. My reasons for this, I choose the slice of life theme because of the daily things that go on in the anime, although I can't reveal any major part of the plot, little plot development happens while Keima \"rescues\" each girl from their loose soul. In fact the anime plays out more in a loop pattern, each girl does have their respective differences in personality, yet the main base origin of the arc is the same, I would have liked to have seen some changes in the plot. The reason I would choose the tag Netorare, is because of what affects Keima at the end of each \"conquest\", although I can't reveal what it is, you'll have to watch the anime for yourself and see if my claim for that tag is justified.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story & Characters: In my experience of harem/romance anime, Kaminomi was a unique one, to my surprise, the anime failed to follow the standard boring procedures of harem anime, and proceeded to introduce each character whether they would return or not in a different way that I found pleasing. Tying in the typical Dating Sims personalities of girls, and making somewhat similar characters appear in front of Keima that resemble them made the journey of romance pull me along. Though Keima can never fully commit after conquering the girl, I would say that the comedy in his attempts were the best. It seems as though the second season was immediately released and I hope through that some loose ends and questions will be resolved. That being said, the story never left me bored, or wasted time (maybe a bit during each girl's individual background story) but the anime nonetheless made up for lost time. \\n\r\nThe characters as I see in most harem romance anime are the main reason the plot develops (if it did at all). Keima, an otaku, Dating Sim gaming freak, is the main character, and through his quirky ways of getting women to like him, the anime thrives in the comedic and slice of life aspect. The only other main character to me seemed to me Elucia, a demon from hell who is assigned to capture loose souls that escaped from hell. Elucia is one of the common air-head characters that adds to the main characters personality and their common goal that brings them together. The beginning did present a more serious life or death situation, but to my disappointment never mentioned it again. Thus the anime lost some serious, \"sense of major purpose\" feel to it.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: Though the music wasn't something I would immediately say in my head \"I gotta Youtube convert this\", it contributed nicely to the anime and made many scenes flow better than without it. I've never had to complain about art and music in the series. TV Tokyo, Geneon Universal Entertainment, Manglobe, Sentai Filmworks did a good job with the art aspect, since there wasn't any action at all that required the sharp picturesque feel. The average smooth drawings of characters suited the anime's pace well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I enjoyed this anime mainly because of the main character and his journeys with Elucia, not because of possible plot development. Although in the second season I do expect some questions to be answered, this anime is definitely worth a look if you find yourself similarly attracted to anime such as Date a Live, Oreshura (Look up for synonyms), and IS:Infinite Stratos.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\r\n-Nebarto\\n",

            "content": "\"Hello there devine one\"\r\nHow does it feel to be a god? A god who can conquer any woman, regardless of diffulculty? One who has the power to change the girl's heart! But wait a minute! What if I tell you that this guy name Keima Katsuragi, can do just that.. Well he can, only to 2-D girls of course. Hey it takes alot of work and dedication to conquer a girl in those dating sims so don't bash! But what if you were to be those gaming skills to the test? Against oh I don't know.. Real girls maybe? Well that's up to you tofind out.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nWell apart from being a nerdy gamer who is obsess with conquering 2-dimensional girls, this story is rather unique, not like any other anime has ever went in the same direction, but somehow this one just feels different. The nerdy gamer of course is the guy I mentioned before Keima Katsuragi, and the story goes like this. Keima, agrees to a contract in which he misunderstood (he should had kept an open mind but oh well), from there a demon appears known as Elucia de Lute Ima a.k.a. Elsie (I will direct her as Elsie throughout the review). Why does she appear? Well it's her job to gather souls, not everyone souls, just the bad that escaped from the demon world and took residence within girls, in specific the girl's heart, now Keima against his will must using his gaming skills to wooh those girls who are possessed thus releasing the souls and everything returning back to normal, if he fails to do so, well as the Monarch leaders during the medieval ages \"off with his head!\" Sorry this is sounding more like a summary... Back on track, this story is a bit mediocre but it works! And that's why we're drawn to it, because of the otaku dating sim gamer, it's relatable to current japanese citizen who are too addict to these games, so this story draws out the relatebility of that. (Gosh I hope that made sense).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nArt/animation style its ehhh tolerable, not wow, but then again not awful. However the anime draws in the typical disproportional element of anime, like chibi characters, eyes that are all circle white when surprise or sad, stuff you mainly see in comedy anime of course. Does it fit well with the anime? Yes, but something felt odd about it somehow and that I can't ged my head wrapped around it.. The appearence of the characters normally animated looks well as well as the color though some character should have gotten a lighter saturation, but the again it could've just been the computer.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nSound, well if you're talking about voice acting the sub wins in this one, however in the dubbed version listening to Elsie's voice makes it worth it and that's where the 4 comes in. As for the soundtrack its not that appealing and the opening just makes you want to turn away, the ending is kawaii however, so it contrast each other between negative and positives... Some sounds are bliss and some just are not.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nNow this part I can get into, the characters in this series are well made. Each girls besides Chihiro, have a backstory that helps you better understand the girls and why they act the way they do, it just gives the character more depth, and that as viewers is what we like to see a way to know who the character truly is. As for character change, well don't expect them from the main characters of Keima and Elsie cause they don't need change, however all the girls that was conquered haven changed in somewhat, either by attitude, or communication, just in someway.. Finally supporting characters get the love they deserve, cause without them there is no story, so good job. However the character that draws you into this anime the most is the happy-go lucky, loving, moe-ish girl Elsie, she's just the most adorable thing ever! I was more drawn into her then Keima.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 7\\n\r\nThere were some dull moments especially towards the ending but let me stop it right. But there was funny moments and that is what we got to look at, there's more positives than negatives in this anime, and letting those negative aspect affect you, will in fact get in the way of you actually enjoying this anime, just let it go at first and you'll like this anime, then complain about it afterwards, it appeals to a wide-broad of audience, it's innocent enough for younger audience, romantic for lovey-dovey audience, and relatable for the gamer audience. It appeals to all and that's what makes this anime so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nYeah it seems low especially for how much praise I give it, but like i've said there are some negatives to it that may interfere with your judgement. However it's good, relatable besides the parts of catching souls, and thrilling as you get glued into the story. Especially for a harem that isn't ecchi, it's a B average material, but hey give it a try regardless, I hope most you enjoy this as much as I had, and let me know what you think!",

First, the most common harem main character is the \"harem recipient\" who just seemingly charm all girls and receive a harem. The World God Only Knows have the second type of main character, quite rare though, who actually have the ability to make girls fall in love with them consciously. Katsuragi Keima is that harem master. The most similar to this is Itsuka Shidou from Date A Live. \r\nStory:9\r\nI like how they actually show the different types of personality of girls and explain how to conquer them.

Maybe being western made the concept behind the anime a little tricky, but i caught on to the idea of dating simulation pretty quickly. Also, the story had its positives, especially the way it was divided into arcs of just the right length. The problem with the story is there is no overriding plot, nothing that spans the entire season, there all really self inclusive plot arcs. This is the weakness of the show. Art was very good and the sound was good to. The main characters did not undergo muchdevelopment but the relationship dynamic between the two mains was very funny and very enjoyable. Actually, this anime is at times laugh out loud funny, and sometimes moderately serious, or deep so to speak. I wish the relationships that occur were developed more across the course of the series, it would have made for a much better show. That being said, i had a lot of fun with this anime, and will watch the second and third seasons at some point!",

            "content": "The World God Only Knows is a comedy about a high school boy named Keima who is forced to help a demon girl named Elsie catch loose souls that have escaped from Hell. However, loose souls possess the hearts of girls and the only way to exorcise a loose soul is to make the girl fall in love; it\u2019s a good thing Keimas the master of dating simulations then. \r\n6/10 Story: The anime is divided into a series of mini-arcs, about 2 to 3 episodes long, with each one involving Keima having to conquer the heart of a different girl. Every arc is pretty muchthe same, however, where at first the token girl hates Keima but is slowly seduced by him until she is finally in love with him at which point Elsie can come in and capture the loose soul. It is predictable, but remember this is a comedy so the story isn\u2019t really as important as the humor and this anime really is hilarious; I always laughed when one of these girls beat Keima up. Furthermore, the anime does develop an over-arching plot later on, but sadly it\u2019s REALLY under developed and not focused on enough which really disappointed me. \\n\\n\r\n8/10 Characters: I really like all the characters in this anime, but the biggest problem I have with them is that they\u2019re too one-dimensional. For example, Elsie is a really cute and funny character, but the problem is that\u2019s all she is, she\u2019s cute and funny with no other personality traits. The same can be said for Keima; Keima is a hardcore gamer who hates reality and that\u2019s basically all he is. Overall, I like both Keima and Elsie, but neither of them really experience any kind of development.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, although she doesn\u2019t appear until season 2, Haqua is my favorite character and she has the most complex personality of all the characters. I love how she is the only girl not seduced by Keima\u2019s charm and when you get to the climax she really steps up to the plate and shows just how strong she is. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I wish was different though would be if there was more focus on some of the girls in Keima\u2019s harem. After Keima conquers them, the girls are basically written out of the show which is sad because I wanted to know more about these girls. For example, in one episode it\u2019s mentioned that Tenri wants to be a magician, but this is never brought up again; I would have loved to know more about that and see more of Tenri. \\n\\n\r\n7/10 Overall: This was a really funny anime with good characters and an interesting premise, but the story was a little too unfocused and there was almost no character development from the main characters, Elsie and Keima. This anime is definitely worth watching because it did get a lot of laughs out of me; however, it could\u2019ve much better and there were some characters I wish I could\u2019ve seen more of. \\n",

            "content": "Preface: I have to write this review for the sake of those who love romance. THIS ANIME SHOULD NOT FALL UNDER ROMANCE.\r\nThe story wasn't given much thought I must say and it was rushing to get the main point of the story - Keima getting girl after girl to fall in love with him. At this point you should realize. There is no real romance in this story. Unless love lasts for 1 - 2 episodes and jumps to another person. I was really hoping it would be a good one cos my friend recommended this popular love comedy. I have to say, it wasenjoyable. Funny and touching maybe. But then, where's my romance...\\n\\n\r\nArt is pretty decent. The songs were good. Not so much of the openings and endings but more like the songs sung in the episodes. Kanon and her friends had great harmony haha. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters... Keima is quite an interesting character I guess. He had no contact with girls prior to the actually \"story\" and all he has is his galges. To a certain extent I can understand the desire to escape into the virtual world. I think. He gets quite a bit of the development. He's pretty much the only main character anyway. The rest of the girls just come and go... Sure they are cliche characters, but that's the point people... He uses the cliche information from his games about the cliche girls... Elsie is just an airhead. Fairly irritating I must admit. Sweet. But irritating.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it. It's an anime. It's hard not to honestly. How much...? Wasn't too awfully funny and it wasn't too cleverly made. It was just alright. But then again, WHERE'S MY ROMANCE. FYI, the sequel is very much the same with regards to romance. Tsk.\\n\\n",

Having a uniquely different kind of hero and main character of the anime, being very nerdy and some what a very anti-social person clearly shows a major difference in the typical 'prince' or obvious outstanding hero the main character is usually played out to be. This was most likely the main pros for this anime as it works very well, using this unique character that is somewhat comical and relatively average looking non-socialist to play the lead role. With each harem or female sub maincharacter, they are created somewhat typically, however each somewhat different, therefore suits perfectly into this anime (must watch to know what i mean).\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, a great anime which incorporates good comical humor that we all love as well as the romance and characters that make me want to see more and more of this anime.",

Personally i watched the first season which made me watch the second season so just like the first season i it was pretty much the same and i got bored but finished the season and the ova s anyway just when i thought this was it for the series the goddess arc comes  out and hell yes this is a major turn around for the series which shows an even better scenarios but that's for you to decide I can't have too many spoilers now can I\\n\r\n but let me advice you this is one epic series which you shouldn't drop because of the second season being alright per all I would rate this 9/10 for the first season , 7/10 for the second and 9 1/2 /10 for the 3rd season maybe even a 10 if it weren't so small :)",

But when it comes down to story there is not much; with each episode pretty much being Keima trying to conquer a girl with a loose soul making it seem like there is no story tobegin with. both sound and art are great earning a 9/10 respectively (has one of the best opening songs in my opinion) and enjoyment getting an 8/10 as it is funny, and looks and sounds great, Yet story is barely there. So i give The World God only Knows Season 1 an overall 7/10",

Keima has to free the troubled girls from the monsters inside them that feed off their negative emotions. It's definitely a bit of tearjerker, but also quite funny as well.\r\nArt: The art is nice and has a wayof making all of the characters look very cute.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The character voices are great and there's a lot of variety in the OST.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Probably where the show shines the most is its variety and complexity of each character.

Being the only show if its season i had read & enjoyed, it was my most anticipated\r\nExpected: 8-9\r\nEpisode Scores: -,-,-,-, 7, 7, 10, 7, 8, 10, 9, 9\r\nActual: 9 (Excellent)\r\nWhat happens when an obsessive galge player is tasked to live his life as the character he plays or face death? A satire of the cliches of the industry, and this can apply to any anime ormanga too since many are adaptions of these games. Now, the comedy is pretty subjective if you enjoy this type of humor and it is a good part of the story as well. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, they were able to weave the emotions of the heroines in their respective arcs very well. I sympathized and related to them, they changed from characters i instinctively disliked to ones i loved by the end. Each 'conquest' was able to get me to love the character by the end. Even the rich, short, twin tailed, snobby, ojou-chan whom i typically despised won my adoration through this show. Keima sets off to solve their problems which are generic to a point to allow satire, and infuses comedy and dramatic elements perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThis show runs in small segments, heroine arcs cushioned by pure comedy segments. It is a shame that the story completely resets most of the time, but it is a good thing that the plot does well to make Keima into a respectable lead instead of one with a large harem.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as i lavished this show with praise it is a good watch especially if you are a fan of the romance genre, or are sick of watching an endless stream of failure relationships. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. The soundtracks are awesome.",

As for the characters I have no qualms about their make up, but the enjoyment is kinda frustrating  co'z the episode were divided into parts, I guess the spoiler here is that for a 12 episode anime there were only 4 girls who are target of  Else and Keima for the mission of capturing the run away spirits that reside within them. The enjoyment, I say it's very good since each anime is made up of plot that were divided by parts it kinda make you wanna watch for it because the waiting itself provides the climax of each  episode.",

            "content": "Ok- first off the series itself shows absolute comedy. The plot is almost drowned out by what the main character is doing and his ignorance to the actual mission at hand. \r\nThis series, like a few others, show the otaku male delving deeper into obsession and somehow obtaining skills that are useful when put into the right way but seem utterly useless and creepy during other times. The female protagonist that plays an equally important role to keep the gamer otaku in check this time is merely a bumbler who either also ignores her duties or can't seem to find a common ground with hermale partner.\\n\r\nThe story's plot is established right off the bat in the first episode, and so is the minor problems that stop the plot from progressing quicker. This just added to the comedy element, and as much as romance should have played a big part into the story, it was slightly overshadowed- which wasn't to bad. \\n\r\nWhat this series started off doing was introducing characters one by one; giving the girls their \"time in the spot light\". It was unfortunate that after each girl's segments they all but disappeared from the main character's life and seemed to leave little impact but he does seem to show just a bit of humanity throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds/music was a mix between decent and hilarious. The fact that opening and ending sounds were good and fit into the story very well and showed how the girls were taken by the \"God of Conquest\" and how his skills are actually important just made it fitting. I do however think his singing is not the best- and again added to the comedy.\\n\r\nThe artwork is on the same levels as Comic Party, Happy Lesson, and as far to go with \"Is This A Zombie?\". It had its moments, especially when it came to the capture scenes and the main character's skills as the \"God of Conquest\".\\n\r\nEnjoyable, will make the audience laugh, or at least comment on how odd the series is. Some will find it- interesting to see the hard to reach dark side to anime lovers and into the world of deep otaku. But overall it was good.",

            "content": "First, some notes: 1) This is the first ACTUAL review that I have ever done. And 2) This review will include both of the two seasons of the anime. \r\nIf you are very aware of the 'Harem' genre, then you may know how a harem anime works. They're mostly about a guy who is faced with a situation of sorts that leads him into perveted situations with various stereotypical girls who eventually join in on the guy's ever growing harem while only makng slow story progression throughout the show. This is not the case in this particular anime, actually.\r\nThe World God Only Knows is aboutKeima Katsuragi, a 17-year old highschooler who is known throughout the internet as the \"God of Conquest\"for his success in dating sims, while in the real world, he is known as a Dating sim otaku, who has no interest towards anything concerning the real world. One day, he recieves an email that asks him to capture a girl for the emailer. Interpreting this as a challenge, he accepts the supposed challenege, but unknowingly, he has signed a contract with the devil, who asks him to capture the loose souls that escaped from hell, and have hidden themselves inside of a girl's heart. If he were to fail on his mission or violate the contract, he will then lose his head.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the anime is simple and somewhat plain, but it also has an interesting feel. The show's common theme of it is obviously dating sims, and it parodies the common sterotypes of dating sim girls from the athletic, track-and-field girl, to the quiet and shy librarian, to even a student-teacher. But I do have to point out that the anime only has covered up like about up to 40 chapters of the manga, while the manga is currently at the 200s right now. And the real story development doesn't start until around chapter 60.\\n\\n\r\nFor the artwork, well, this is first for me since I never really focused on the art styles of animes, but I do have to say that the art looks great. I don't really know what else to say about the art, but I guess the animation on the show is great too.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very likeable, especially the main character, Keima. Everytime the show goes into a new arc (or a new girl), I always thought to myself \"How in the world is he going to capture this one?\" The reason why I like Keima so much is that he isn't like most harem leads of other animes. He isn't completely stupid and useless like most leads, but instead, he is a very cool-headed person when it comes to his captures, and he has character development as well. His devil partner, Elsie, is the one who is in charge of the cutesy stuff on most of the show, and each girl has their own reasons on why they have a loose soul inside of their, making them more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nI just loved the music of The World God Only Knows. I actually sat through the openings and endings of both seasons and have listened to the various versions of the endings many times. The OST is also my favorite, especially the music when Keima is about to capture a girl. The music is incredibly fitting on each scene on the show, whether it'd be funny or dramatic, I just loved it so much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed The World God Only Knows very much. Although if you were to read the manga (which I highly recommend), then you may have noticed that some of the arcs were either extended or shortened for the sake of the 12 episode mark on both seasons. But all in all, the anime is a good watch for those who would like to step back from the various, repetative harem animes, and watch a harem anime that is completely different. \\n\\n\r\nWelcome to The World God Only Knows!",

On the internet he is well known as the god of conquest, for his amazing skill to complete every dating sim and the ability to make every virtual girl fall in love with him. On school he is known as anoutsider, which seems logical because that is what happens when you're intelligent and different in high-school. He games all day even in class and it's the only thing he does. One day he gets a message asking him if he wants to conquer more girls, and he answers yes. It turns out to be a contract with the devil, to haunt for evil spirits which hide themselves in the heart of girls. The only way to get them out is to open up their heart (no guys, not literally) and make them fall in love with him. Elsie (a demon and supposedly your comic relief) is send to guide him through his tasks, although she has a hard time getting around in the real world. Keima can't refuse the contract, as it will be his death.\\n\r\nThe story is a bit weird, but it does not take away from the fun. The Anime kinda knows the idea is weird and handles that well by not going on to serious about the whole demon Elsie thing. The only problem is with that though, that the Anime also tries to get a message across, which is hard when you aren't to serious. However this Anime just masters it, it completely balances serious stuff with stuff that isn't that serious. The comedy works, the morals work, Elsie's character works, Keima works and even the romance works (yeah, it made me give the awh that's cute smile). Perfect balance in my opinion. Oh yeah, and at the end they give something away about next season, and really it is promising.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nThe visuals are spectacular by times, but have some flaws too. Sometimes the animation feels a bit sloppy, while other times the amount of details you are able to see is just amazing. To bad it's sloppy at times, otherwise the visuals certainly would have had a 10. Also they tend to put text on-screen and signs, those work very well to.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting (sub).\\n\r\nThe voices are good to. Not the best I've heard but certainly acceptable. Elsie is a bit annoying, but Keima is great as his voice can stay calm at all times (although he is able to sound like a maniac). He kinda reminds me of Light.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe sound has its ups and downs. At times it's way to much in the background and you don't pay attention to it at all. At the romantic moments the music is great though and it really adds to the certain atmosphere and switch from fun to serious business.\\n\\n\r\nRe-watch value.\\n\r\nYou are probably going to watch this a time or 3, it's epic and very funny. The episodes are also really well watchable alone, although some eps are combined.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________ ______________________________\\n\r\n(c) of review @ DVH.

It's pretty much a search and gather mission with a really good twist. the subplots however are on a completely different level and never do I feel cheated out of my time following them. Don't get me wrong. It's extremely well done.\r\nArt - 8\r\nNot what I wanted it to be from reading the manga. But let's not compare. It's a good style and they get the art just right for the comedy scenes.\r\nSound - 7\r\nNot much here for music except the OP and ED themes, let's skip the Kanon songs...\r\nOP - Really good and notthe average Pop crap you get. The fully version is kind of meaninglessly long...\\n\\n\r\nED - Didn't feel like anything special at first but it's the song that grows on you. There are many versions to the full one and it's fun to try and explore the various takes of the same song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe main character (Katsuragi Keima) is perfect for what it's trying to do. There's not much that you can dislike about him. He has just the right strengths and just the right weaknesses and is good at what he does which makes him a gaming badass.\\n\\n\r\nHis side kick (de Lute Irma Elsea AKA Elsie) is an amusing alien character who come from hell is new to the real world. She tries her best to serve her Divine One sometimes ending in good results, other results may vary.\\n\\n\r\nthe other Heroines are to be watched not to be read in a review. I can only say that there's four in all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\\n\r\nI was kinda peeved at some part of the series where there were too many scenes of just singing and nothing much happening. I wouldn't mind if the songs were exceptionally good but I'm sure that these are the type that grow on you, not the type you listen and go \"Omg I must download that song\" having one song sequence is alright, don't over do it like they kind of did here. (the last one for the finale of the arc was worth listening to mostly because it was the one to finish the story with, it's also a soothing slow song)\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nKickass and i expected nothing less. I'm pumped up for the second season.\\n",

The concept's original; its refreshing to finally see something that breaks out of the normal harem/mecha/slice-of-life/fantasy/ecchi/5,000-episode-long shows that are all over the place these days.  The show is so original you'd be hard pressed to fit it into any category.  Its great because the protagonist is not the same old kid who's either a ball-less wimp or a perverse creep, and the story is very, very fun to watch.  \r\nThank god for these other reviews, so you don't just have my quick thoughts togo on, but rather than reading all the details, just take 22 minutes and watch the first episode.  You will get the gist of everything by then and know if its right for you or not.",

However, I hated the filler episodes, which contained no story at all.\r\nThe art was fair and sound was good. There's actually some pretty beautiful orchestral background music. I would definitely recommend listening to some of the OST. My favorite was that great track that plays at the moments when Katsuragi \"completes\" his conquests \"Kuchizuke Made no Kyori.\" I liked it a lot!\r\nKatsuragi himself is a simple character with definedtraits. His value that he adds to the anime is not his character development, but rather his \"genius-level\" intellect when it comes to gal conquesting. It was entertaining to see how he would handle each new situation. Elsie is a static character for the most part. The heroines themselves were each different and interesting in their own ways. Most of them had realistic problems that weren't TOO cliche.\\n\\n\r\nThe World Only God Knows is similar to One Punch Man in the fact that you know exactly what's going to happen in the end, but you don't know how and when it'll happen. A fair anime with an interesting premise allows for a score of 7.",

            "content": "Review: Episodes 1-3\r\nAs a show that presents character's flaws and how they overcome them, The World Only God Knows hit near dead-center.\r\nThe concept is interesting, but not the best. It is not the best because, first, The World Only God Knows is based on spirits, a very popular concept among Japanese cartoons. This shaves away some of the show's originality. There is mainstream Bleach, masterpiece Spirited Away, also-masterpiece Princess Mononoke, and a lot more. Because of the number of spirit-based shows, The World Only God Knows would be shelved as one of the many spirit-based shows. The story should have based its itself on somethingmore original, which could have made the concept more interesting. But even though the concept is at a loss in terms of originality, the story's focus on the flaws of characters is a plus. Today, many Japanese cartoons are based on a character being pushed into a conflict, receiving a special power, or being the cause of a conflict, etc., and a chosen few are based upon characters. Death Note, Code Geass, and again Bleach are some of the many examples of shows not based on characters (I chose these shows because they are famous and easily to relate). The focus on character is highly original, and outweighs some of the show's unoriginality. In summary, the show's concept is not the best because of a hint of unoriginality, but very interesting because of its originality in a different field. In terms of story, The World Only God Knows hits near dead-center. (Story 8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis show's artwork is pretty, a bit too pretty. The art is not a pain to look at, but its lack of real-ness is a turnoff. Lighting in this show is simply too bright and lacks in shadow and definition. The background is bland, compared to 5 Centimeters Per Second. The World Only God Knows' artwork is a thumbs up, but lacks two things: 1) Effective shadows 2) Detail. To effectively showcase characters, a show's art is vital. (Art 7/10)\\n\\n\r\nMusic that is played in this show are not distracting nor do they stand out. (Sound 7/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in this show are interesting, but some are not used to their full potential. Each heroine's personalities are shallow (excluding the demon). On the case of the first heroine, we couldn't make out a distinct personality. What we did notice, however, was her dilemma. On the case of the second heroine, we noticed a cliche personality (self-explanatory). In the end, the heroine characters (excluding the demon) are not the best personalities one can think of. The better personalities in this series are the male protagonist and the demon. By their interactions with each other (the male protagonist and the demon), we can easily tell that he wants to move on with a dull life, and that she is highly curious and eager-to-please. These two characters' personalities shine. Being a show that focuses on the flaws of characters, The World Only God Knows does a decent job. (Character 7/10)\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the intriguing concept, The World Only God Knows is highly enjoyable when coupled with humor. (Enjoyment 8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is great with some flaws, which is why this show hits near dead-center. (Overall 8/10)",

NOTE: I based this review on the first two seasons of the anime since they're quite similar\r\nSTORY: 7/10\r\nI may find the story of this anime to be quite an original work, but I don't really find it all that great. Here you have a protagonist who is a gamer yet rejects reality and later finds himself tasked to find and seal loose souls by being romantically intimate with the possessed victim - which are allgirls. It's clear that this is a harem. But I don't dislike it because of that. I'm quite dubious about the main concept here. Nonetheless I was amused by the show by its humor which at some points are clear reference to other anime shows. The story has direction and the romance between characters are depicted very nicely. Oh, there is also some fan-service here and there and were executed adequately. So I assure you that the story won't leave a bad taste in your mouth.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 7/10\\n\r\nI really found the characters here lovable. They have colorful personalities and has great development as the story progresses - even our anti-reality protagonist. My personal favorite is Haqua by the way.\\n\\n\r\nVISUAL AND AUDIO QUALITY: 8/10\\n\r\nThe visual quality didn't astound me that much as I've seen many iterations of it in different anime shows of the same genre. Nonetheless I found it pretty and the animations run very well in all scenes.\\n\r\nIn audio; the seiyuus and their roles are nothing to complain about as they did their jobs well if not perfect. The soundtrack is pleasant and memorable as well\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\r\nIt may not be outstanding that it overshadows many anime shows, KamiNomi is still a great anime. It has comedy, romance, lovable characters and a story that will really get your attention. And I can tell that will have a fun experience watching this. But the final verdict is up to depending your preferences.",

            "content": "It is really hard to tailor a romance anime.\r\nEvery other romance anime I've watched seems to think that romance equates to lust and those aforementioned anime fill scenes with flopping breasts instead of actual material. That being said, Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai (The World God only Knows) goes for the tingling sensation within our hearts and not our no-nos.\r\nThe anime is more or less viewed in arcs or small episode series dedicated to individual girls that the main character(Katsuragi Keima) conquers. This idea is a double-edged sword where the pro's are that each girl gets highlighted and the key messages are beautifully projected butthe con is that every time he finishes(haha...stop) we are wanting a little bit more (which is how the author meant it to be). So in a metaphorical sense this anime is a firework not a symphony and for a romance anime that is unheard of because there is very little development of the female(but they do develop the main characters).\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, they very it from normal to detailed to super un-detailed to the tone of the anime to inject either humor or passion. However, they really stand out in their sound. Being in a oddly holy and gaming genre, they use choir and house music which when combined which is oddly enjoyable. The endings are sung by the different girls he conquers and variation like that is fantastic. \\n\\n\r\nAs a gamer myself, I appreciate the gaming references along with the many other references they make in the anime. Although the anime is far from realistic its not absurd which wins lots of Microsoft points from me, too many anime go from funny to stupid and I am proud to say this is not one of them. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the anime hits a lot of good points from being innovative to hitting the right points. The authors deserve a nice car or a fire engine.",

Everything is imperfect, even us humans, there is imperfection in us. But the opposite of everything imperfect is the 'Ideal'. Ideals are the vast imaginations of a being that thinks that is the perfect one, such as movies, anime, games and etc.\r\nKeima Katsuragi is the protagonist of this anime and the most developed character. He is the smart one and the galge gamer in his class by his way holding the PFP, cool in a way; but this is his wayto deny the real world and live in the gaming world when he is out of his room. Keima's ideal is that the girls of his games are supposed to be in reality. But in fact, the world is imperfect. \\n\\n\r\nElsie is the deuratagonist of this anime, the one who interrupted from Keima to do something for the real world and Keima's little sister, even though he's pissed off because of her actions that made her 'an illegitimate sister'.\\n\\n\r\nAyumi Takahara, Mio Aoyama, Kanon Nakagawa and Shiori Shiomiya are the hosts of the loose souls, very different and has her own distinct. Ayumi, a track and field runner; Mio, a rich daughter whose lifestyle is rich; Kanon, a convenient star; And Shiori, a bibliophile. Very different parameters, a very good factor of that even them can be a 2-D character in most galge games.\\n\\n\r\nThis story has a very interesting hysteria behind its dramatic scenes, even Keima just act for the sake of the girls. The impact of Elsie on the first episode, a sudden event of having loose souls being escaped to the whole world, just very splendid. Even the sound and music, english translations of songs about love, just made this anime an ideal of romance.\\n\\n\r\nEven this anime is a excellent one, a perfect anime must have issues. My issue of Elsie. Yes, she does cooperate at most times, but she never helps Keima of having the loose souls out of the hosts (Except on Rieko's conquest, but that's on the manga). The partner should help the leader, well, I think that partnership is not mostly applied to that.\\n\\n\r\nI was surprised that the first season is finished, seems kinda short (well it is anime) but it is a long journey, I strongly recommend this for most otakus who love romance.",

            "content": "So I've been following the Kaminomi manga for quite a while. However, this review is about the anime and not the manga, so therefore I'll try not to be too biased (and probably fail miserably).\r\nStory - 8/10.\r\nI like the premise for this series. It's original (from what I know) and it's amusing. Despite this, it's quite... hard to explain to people. In a way, it makes no sense unless you actually watch it. It's not complex or anything, but it's just hard to summarise. Or maybe I'm just stupid.\r\nArt - 9/10.\r\nThe art style is lovely. I love the colouring. Also, I didn't spot any majorQUALITY moments so that's good.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is brilliant. From the theme songs (God only knows is one of my favourite anime openings of 2010) to the BGM to the character songs -- it's all amazing. The voice acting is good, too. The only way they could have improved the voice acting was if they replaced everyone with Wakamoto Norio.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, several of the characters bored me. I don't like Ayumi's type of character, Elcea is annoying and Shiori is too clich\u00e9 (gotta agree with Keima on the librarian-type girls here). It wasn't horrible writing or anything, but they just didn't interest me. On the other hand, Keima is AWESOME, as is his mum. I also love Mio. And, in a surprise turn of events, I liked anime!Kanon more than manga!Kanon.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nI looked forward to a new episode every week. I liked pretty much all of them, except for a couple (but you get that with every series so it's okay). I got several laughs out of this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of my favourites. Okay, sure, it's not in my list of favourites, but it's up there. Depending on how season 2 is, it might earn a place. I'm highly anticipating season 2 (is it April yet?), because the next few girls are awesome. Especially Tsukiyo.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: Go and watch this. It's totally worth it.",

            "content": "The World God Only Knows is about a high school boy who is a god of the gaming world (specifically dating sims) and repels reality.  He one day unknowingly signs a contract with the demon world that requires him to get girls to fall in love with him to capture loose souls.  This is ironic because Katsuragi has only ever captured the hearts of digital or 2-D girls.\r\nThere is no plot to be  heavily invested in other than the overall premise.  The plot focuses more on individual stories of the girls that Katsuragi encounters.  These divided story lines reflect onreal world themes and personal issues that a viewer can empathize with.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to characters, I love them all, and they're all extremely entertaining but I  feel as if the main protagonist could be developed a little more.  The priority of character development goes to the numerous girls that Katsuragi has to captivate, therefore it doesn't leave much space for main character growth.  Although saying that, the different story lines subtly reflect of Katsuragi's perspective of the real world.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is actually pretty high quality for an anime that doesn't really need intense animation at all.  It's nice and appealing to watch and some scenes that diverge from reality are just beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, I loved the full soundtrack.  The opening was great, and the ending song was amazing as well.  There's nothing I can really say except the music was phenomenal and fit in the with the anime extremely well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed The World God Only Knows.  It's something that's fun and interesting to watch, not something you have to become invested in.  It's entertaining and funny due to the hilarious insights of the characters and their antics, but also in a way enthralling and emotional in its underlying personal issues and themes.  \\n",

I was actually pretty excited when I first found out that there was an anime for it and immediately went to go watch it.\r\nStory - 5/10\r\nThe plot in the anime is pretty bland because it ended so quickly. The 12 episodes only consists of a few plotless episodes here and there and the rest focused on Keima capturing females with runaway spirits in them. Still, the story will get some merit because of the whole runaway spirit concept and its originality. Asa reader of the manga, I felt a little disappointed since it ended with only 12 episodes, none of which containing any thick plot at all which only begins to appear later on in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good, not much that I would complain about. The opening is pretty nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlso pretty good, there isn't really many ways you can screw up on sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nSimilar comments given to the story. There's minimal character development because there was such little time to develop it at all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nHowever, having said all that, I quite enjoyed seeing the first few chapters of the manga in color and sound. I can't say that it was terrible to watch, and it's a little like a collection of one-shots.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI guess if you're planning to watch something short and refreshing, you'd probably enjoy this anime.",

            "content": "-~Story 5/10~-\r\nSo, assuming you read this anime's synopsis here on MAL, you know the basic jist of things. For me, the story seemed straightforward and understandable, but bland and far too simple at the same time. \r\nHere's how I saw the story and plot of the whole anime: Kiema romances girl every two episodes using his skills derived from dating sims, cute nii-san captures \"loose souls.\" And then you just repeat that for 12 episodes.\r\n-~Art 8/10~-\r\n-~Sound 6/10~-\r\nGenerally, I'm not ever good with explaining why I \"liked the art\" or why I \"liked the sound\" of an anime >.>. I mean, there's no real reason asto why I liked the style of drawing, or style of music used in an anime -- it's all personal preference, and let's be honest, these two don't have that much of an impact on the actual anime, they aren't that important. So, moving on.\\n\\n\r\n-~Character 5/10~-\\n\r\nI'm not so sure I liked a lot of the characters in this anime. I'm also not so sure this anime could be considered a harem either, each girl Kieta meets doesn't stick around for more than two episodes, they just disappear off the face of the world. This means there isn't much room for any development of feelings towards 60% of the vital characters for the anime. The only characters in this anime that you might start to get a feel for is Kiema, Kiema's mom, and cute nii-san.\\n\r\nNow, that being said, I'm sure some people will start to get minor emotion towards one of the female roles, but those would quickly be replaced by new emotions after you finish 2 sets of episodes (each pertaining to a different female).\\n\\n\r\n-~Enjoyment 7/10~-\\n\r\nFor my personal enjoyment of this anime, I give it a low 7/10. The story's blandness, the lies of harem (grr, was pretty angry about that), and the lack of character build up really made a hard impact on how much I enjoyed the anime. That being said, each episode had me laughing pretty hard -- from Keima being tazed, to baking a cake by sticking it in an oven and cooking the oven over a medieval camp fire. Probably one of the funnier animes I've seen, right next to Kureha Zombie Desuka.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a high 7/10.\\n\r\nIf you're into anime with cheesy romance, lots of blushing, cute little sisters, and a lot of comedy, I'd say this is for you.",
