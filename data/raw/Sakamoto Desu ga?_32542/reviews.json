            "content": "\"Every man wants to be like him and women named their vibrators after him\"\r\nIn a world riddled with cringe humor, Sakamoto Desuga? is here to bless us with an alternative, yet rarely utilized type of comedy; \r\nSuave humor. Known also by it's street name \"Swag humor\" this sort of comedy depicts the complete opposite of social awkwardness where the main character is the embodiment of social perfection.\r\nThe show is completely contrarian in nature. Perfect characters are often frown upon but now and then, someone would find someway to challenge such sentiments. Sakamoto, the complete opposite of a certain popular cringe character named Bean (even witha slightly elevated mole position), revolves around the story. I mean the story revolves around Sakamoto and his interaction with daily life and the people whom just so happened to be sharing the world with him. \\n\\n\r\nDue to his character already being flawless in nature, the show's premise relies on the development of other character that directly interacts with him. Almost every episodic segment promotes an obvious \"moral of the story\", Sakamoto \"kakoi-ness\" inspires his fellow students to strive to be better, in somewhat roundabout comedic way. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening song of the anime serves as a fitting \"bard's song\" singing heroic praises, commemorating Sakamoto's existence. The jazzy tune played at every instance of \"Sugoi-ness\" amplifies Sakamoto's position as a cult of personality in his own show. I sincerely wished there were more varieties for this composition (musical instrument wise) otherwise I would have given it a \"Sakamoto\" rating (That's a perfect score). \\n\\n\r\nA major risk with the show's premise is that it constantly needs to redefine it's \"Kuru-ness\" as it needs to persistently impress viewers so that the humor does not run dry. Being constantly bombarded by his \"sugoi\" antics, viewers may sense a feeling of repetition and familiarness. Thus, an unimpressive side character was eventually introduced as Sakamoto's comrade in order the contrast the blatant difference between them. The show is capable of inducing a few chuckles here and there but it's short of being anything revolutionary. Whether you are impressed or just find his roundabout ways amusing, Sakamoto does capture our imagination of an almost perfect human being (Clearly because he has to wear glasses, his eyesight isn't that perfect).\\n\\n\r\nPS: Apologies for all the wapanese terms, just an afterthought of how cringey it is when non-Japanese speakers use Japanese word but it is somewhat \"cool\" for Japanese people to use English terms. Such is life. But not for Sakamoto.. Stay Cool Kids. Don't do Anime, not even once. \\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cWho.. are you?\u201d\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? I\u2019m Sakamoto.\u201d\r\nYou\u2019d almost wish it started out like this, there\u2019s that perpetual gnawing going on in the obscured depths of your conscience that bugs you for some normality, some profound simplicity in going about an anime you might never have even heard of. This auxiliary introduction to this mysterious, clean-looking man, unfortunately, doesn\u2019t exist. \r\nWhy, of course, would there be such a need?\r\nOne does not introduce Sakamoto.\r\nOne does not simply require the induction of any mainstream preface to unveil such a magnificent being.\r\nIt is without question, almost as splendidly visceral as how the gleam in his eyes decimates the wobblyheart of every female and non-asshole male in his vicinity, for everyone to instantly fathom that this man right here, Sakamoto, superabounds over what it takes to be the chef d'oeuvre of all characters, a resounding existence amongst those who don\u2019t exist, in an even more resounding, deafness-impelling, heaven-shattering pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance that goes by the splendid title: Sakamoto desu-ga?\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s quite simple, especially for a thoughtful Solomon who would scrutinize and deeply consider the 2nd last, 6th and 6th last letter of every title of every anime before concluding on a score, to assign Sakamoto desu-ga an objective semblance of pure perfection. While the masses do revere icons and symbols of divinity, others of heuristic agnosticism, few can appreciate the enrapturing coalescence of the two. Such is the misappropriation of the essence and cachet withheld by some for Sakamoto desu-ga. Allow me to hereby inscribe the holy scripture of seraphic diagnosis with respect to Sakamoto, and why any of this information should be not be reprised. \\n\\n\r\ni) Story - Simple, yet revolutionary\\n\r\nConsign GTO\u2019s Onizuka Eikichi and his biker-educational-reformation to oblivion. It\u2019s a simple explanation in real life, really: Panty and Male equals to, well, Jail. Forget One Punch Man\u2019s Saitama just like how everyone he\u2019s saved belittles his bald existence. You\u2019d be fighting incredulous monsters every second and be damned to well, a bald existence. \\n\r\nThis story\u2019s premise doesn\u2019t stink with excessive quixotical nihilism, or a spectrally-antithetical cosmic flamboyance, nor is it ostentatious in budget-cramped explosions or drenched in senseless sexual innuendo. \\n\r\nInstead, this story presents that of one we have all experienced, through sweat and tears, through journeying a school life so mundane and arduous, through all those lonely and embarrassing moments, and to this day we still ponder what had ruined it all. That\u2019s right, the omission of a Sakamoto in our lives. Someone, who epitomizes vigor, strength and intellect, that inspires and unbounds the coolness deep within our own individuality. With the absence of such a character, our stories were tasteless, and this story, just like ours had been, would be so too, with a convolution of archetypical dense leads as dense as lead, busty brainless \u201csupports\u201d, conventional franchise-driven, product-advertising, cash-grabbing studios dragging sideways an unrealistic rendition of what COULD have happened in our youths, hence pandering to the lowest, albeit commonly sought-after pubescent demographic. Lay everything bare with your eyes, and you\u2019ll see how all this dirt and grime have long since insidiously buried the savior to all this banality, the deity and student of class 1-2, Sakamoto, and how HE truly deserves to lead us back to a path of greatness that anime has long since been led astray.\\n\r\nThis story, is how it all begins. \\n\\n\r\nii) Characters - Sheer, harmonic opulence\\n\r\nWhy have characters when there are no characters at all? With the respectable, sensible judgment upheld by numerous veteran critics, the characters of animes in vogue are plethorically referred to as \u201ccardboard cutouts\u201d, \u201clifeless\u201d, \u201cfictitious\u201d, \u201cnot-Sakamoto\u201d. There are no supporting characters in Sakamoto desu-ga, simply because Sakamoto himself supports everyone else. He never imposes; he does not instruct; he only exemplifies the genuity of coolness, and he blows both the animated plebeians and you away with way more than whatever renewed apocalyptic jutsus in Naruto Shippuden are ever canonically capable of achieving. Sakamoto need not amateurish fillers, what for? He is filled to the brim with untainted swag, and instead of receiving fillers he fills everything around him with nothing but the truth. Critics lament and exhort producers and animators to fix their messed-up characters. Well then, Sakamoto\u2019s very much heard enough, so he fixes his own goddamn characters, he gives the very meaning to life as it should be, it\u2019s the raison d'\u00eatre of his existence. What else, then, are the characters in Sakamoto desu-ga but an ethereal assemblage of life itself, with all its beauty and flaws intact?\\n\\n\r\niii) Production - A team of legends\\n\r\nAnimation: Studio Deen\\n\r\nThe beginning of Sakamoto heralds what will be known as the timely Olympian peroration of Deen-animation jokes. \u201cDeenimation\u201d budget might have once been a joke. However, this very production itself, is factually no joke. Sakamoto visualized in motion picture spells an unequivocal merchandisable disaster for financially acclaimed studios such as Madhouse and ufotable; Sakamoto\u2019s rendition is simply too gorgeous, invoking too paradisiac an animation quality requirement for even the likes of so-called Unlimited Budget Works to sustain. Before Unlimited Sakamoto Works, everything else\u2019s reduced to a marginal and pathetic joke. \\n\\n\r\nDirector: Shinji Takamasu\\n\r\nSuperseding School Rumble, Gintama and Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, comes a man of wit almost as cool as Sakamoto himself. One can only admire his wisecracking craft as much as Sakamoto desu-ga is to be admired for its gag-propitiated comicality. Accordingly, I place utmost value on discerning the first, third last, seventh, fifth last and fourth letter of the names of every director before contrasting it to the former analysis of the very title of that anime. Naturally, you can barely even perceive how powerful this matchup is; what else, would Sakamoto be deserving of if not the best?\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting: Hikaru Midorikawa as Sakamoto\\n\r\nHeck, you might have watched Gintama, some Great Teacher Onizuka, maybe Code Geass, perhaps Angel Beats, or Fate/Zero, with an off-chance of Mononoke, and this guy\u2019s been in all of them and more. You\u2019ve probably never even heard of him, he\u2019s never been in the spotlight, but now that \u201csupporting role\u201d entirety is gonna change. As Sakamoto himself, he holds nothing less than the God\u2019s Tongue and the voice of heaven, auralizing an indescribably lustrous overtone that defines perfection. What more can you ask for? Beethoven? That's on appallingly divergent levels. Sakamoto\u2019s voice entails the ascension of every composed and uncomposed orchestral symphonic masterpiece to date. Right here, it\u2019s Sakamoto Flows In You. Beethoven, on the other hand, has long since been decomposing. \\n\\n\r\nOpening/Ending Songs by Customi Z and Suneohair:\\n\r\n22 times. That\u2019s the total number of different stances that Sakamoto has stylishly taken in the opening sequence, COOLEST. It\u2019s almost as if the song was made just for Sakamoto. Can you believe that? Simply amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nUnabridged and sporting a melancholic transience, Suneohair\u2019s exemplar of an ending song is contemporary to that of an angel\u2019s hymn. With luster and class, Sakamoto is splashed with an aural paint of sublimity in an everlasting interlude between his work days of delivering more COOL to the mortal realm and heightening levels of SPECIAL in the progression of civilization. In the lateness of day, even the sun begins to shy away from overexposure to Sakamoto\u2019s dignified existence. It is thanks to this hymn in great taste, that we can observe Sakamoto in his natural habitat, partaking in elegant recreation alongside a beauteous sunset. \\n\\n\r\niv) Ultimatum\\n\r\nShould you watch Sakamoto desu-ga?\\n\r\nI am afraid I would have to say no. \\n\r\nIt is beyond tangible excruciation for me at this point of writing to even delineate the consequences of watching the first episode of Sakamoto desu-ga, which include: \\n\r\n1)\tSentience\\n\r\n2)\tAdmiration\\n\r\n3)\tKiller moves\\n\r\n4)\tAnother reason to watch Sakamoto\\n\r\n5)\tMacrocosmic indulgence\\n\r\n6)\tObstruction of negativity\\n\r\n7)\tTitular charisma\\n\r\n8)\tOver-the-top greatness\\n\r\nVery much 8 tragic mortal weaknesses, withal the 8 tenacious symptoms of perfection. \\n\r\nShould you be slightly confused or bewildered at this point, I greatly sympathize with the below philosophical postulation:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cDo you think God stays in heaven because he, too, lives in fear of what he has created here on Earth?\u201d\\n\r\n-Robert Rodriguez\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto however, parades the mortal realm with no fear of himself. \\n\r\nUndoubtedly, you should fear and stray away from such an absurdly brilliant creation. You should fear perfection, when perfection perfectly clones itself and stares at it like it\u2019s nothing.\\n\\n\r\nUnless, you, are different?\\n\r\nMight you have actually embraced the abstraction altogether, pieced en masse the very construct of valuation and grasped perfection since the start, from the very first moment?\\n\r\nNo, how could this be?? \\n\r\nWho.. are you?\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n~\\n\r\nHaven't you heard? I'm Sakamoto\\n",

            "content": "Long before my life on this earth began, my family's lineage has been devoted to studying and teaching the ancient manuscript of Swag: a primordial order committed to deciphering the body's hidden aura, in an attempt to understand what makes some people \"Da COOLEST.\" As per custom, this responsibility is passed on to the next of kin, and in order to uphold this age-old tradition, my long rigorous undertaking of Swag began.\r\nThrough the deepest depths of the Amazon rainforest and the scorching heat of the Sahara desert, I traversed the lands in search of answers. Learning the forbidden tapestry of the Maasai tribe, as wellas dedicating 5 years of discipleship to the Caribs and Arawaks natives of Trinidad, I've gathered up enough information through extensive research and careful analysis to finally end this ancestral task. And so, after much deliberation, I've come to the conclusion that Sakamoto is, without dispute, the swaggiest character in all the land.\\n\\n\r\nSWAGMOTO (often misspelled as \"Sakamoto desu ga?\") or \"Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto\" in English, is the story of a Gary Stu maneuvering his way through high school, as he deals with the everyday pressures of growing up, as well as the burden that comes with having an excessive amount of swag and being absolutely fabulous. \\n\r\nWith no one else to turn to, Swagmoto is forced to carry this heavy burden of \"COOL\" all by his lonesome, constantly being pestered into appeasing lesser beings by humoring or aiding them in their daily dilemmas. He's a God among men, our Lord and savior sent from the heavens to guide the uncultured plebeians. And when he isn't indirectly seducing men, women and grown-ups alike, Swagmoto is teaching his fellow man life lessons in absurd ways that only a true SwagLord of his caliber is capable of doing. \\n\\n\r\nSakamoto is what happens when you take an observational approach to an overused trope, while also deciding to view it through a comedic lens. And in this case, the overused trope being examined is Mary Sue/Gary Stu characters. With portrayals that often border on the implausible due to the nature of these type of characters being flawless, Sakamoto purposely pushes pass the already thin threshold of practicality associated with them, to enter a realm beyond logic or reason. It exaggerates an archetype that's already exaggerated, to begin with, resulting in what would usually be seen as idealistic features and feats in any other show, into laughter inducing comedic mishaps. \\n\\n\r\nAny given episode sees the titular SwagLord modestly demonstrating his unparalleled COOLNESS in daily tasks at school and around his town, while also occasionally introducing other opposing characters that try to dethrone his position as the swaggiest character on campus. These naysayers often try desperately to outdo SwagJesus in some kind of task, only to have their plans backfire in their faces when his swag is proven to be 2COOL4them. And like everyone else that comes face to face with Swagdaddy, they too are assimilated into the fold as one of his disciples, admiring his fabulousness from afar, while desperately seeking out his attention and approval. \\n\\n\r\nThe story structure of Sakamoto is similar to that of comedies like Cromartie High School, but where that over-exaggerates the actions of high school delinquents, Sakamoto switches its focus to idealized characters. And while it should go without saying that comedy is highly subjective, it's still safe to say that if you like comedic stories with this kind of structure, then there's a good chance that you would find Sakamoto's offerings to be up to snuff. The protagonist's deadpan delivery, coupled with the range of reactions given by his peers, is the selling point of the show. But with no other offerings besides this joke, it doesn't take long for the misadventures of Swagmoto to border on lackluster. Like any other gag comedy with a central gimmick carrying it, there will come a point where the punchline doesn't hit as hard as it did before, and Sakamoto wasn't immune to this occurrence. \\n\\n\r\nA joke that's become par for the course runs the risk of growing dull. You could always spice it up with different scenarios, but when the core reasoning behind the joke remains the same, it ceases to deliver the same results after some time. This is usually why most comedy shows have something other than its signature style of humor to keep the viewer's attentiveness. With a limited repertoire of comedic quips and material to worth with, Sakamoto often found its level of impact fluctuating on regular intervals. And while the scenarios are different, the jokes all center around the same comedic gag, which of course is Sakamoto's unnervingly perfect execution of everything he does. \\n\r\nBut even when the show doesn't bring the laughs, you could still depend on Swagmoto to swoop in and save the day. If it doesn't hit its target on the first try, there's usually a follow-up attempt that does. This doesn't mean that our messiah was always successful at salvaging a dying joke, but his efforts did keep the show from becoming a chore to watch. With Jesus on your side, anything is possible. Even a measly comedic attempt is still capable of making you smile when Swagmoto is behind it. The Lord is truly great and worthy to be praised. \\n\\n\r\nAnother key feature of Sakamoto's sense of humor is just how upfront it is. It never feels mean-spirited about how it goes about masquerading any of these characters. Even when accounting for the fact that these type of characters presented are usually taken in a negative light. Mary Sue/Gary Stu characters are often detested by viewers, and rightfully so. Their presence usually indicates a sign of cheap writing on the creator's behalf. So when Sakamoto views this detracting feature as a glass half full, it opens up an avenue for a new look on the subject.  \\n\\n\r\nEven when Swagmoto appears to be giving someone the cold shoulder, in reality, he still has their best interest in mind. As stated by fellow reviewer RogerSmith2004, \"Even when the other person loses, they never actually lose. Their encounter with Sakamoto is always a beneficial one. By the end of the segment, no matter how crazy it may seem... Sakamoto, through some means, helps them out.\" The lighthearted nature of Sakamoto gave the show a feel-good quality about it. It was ever-pleasant and always endearing, making it one of my favorite entries from 2016's Spring season.   \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the potency of his swag, many often found themselves enraptured by SwagLord's presence. I found myself being one of those people. Just the memes and inside jokes the show generated around it kept me entertained. I couldn't scroll through a Sakamoto comment section without busting out in a fit of laughter. This saying nothing about the show itself, which constantly had me tearing up with just how funny it was. While the only progression that happened was him winning over the characters introduced one by one, I was never bored by it. No, the jokes weren't always as funny. No, it isn't going to be funny for everyone. But for my personal experience, Sakamoto was a title I looked forward to every week. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile the run-on joke didn't always remain fresh, there was certainly enough moments of comedic brilliance that kept the show afloat. As you would expect, it didn't take long before the shortcomings of basing an entire show around a Gary Stu to quickly become apparent. Even with that being said, it doesn't take away the moments when the show delivered a comedic home run. Had it been given a longer run-time, it would have inevitably crumbled under its own weight. Sakamoto was a novelty act that narrowly avoided mediocrity status, thanks to the antics of the titular character. Every time I thought the show finally ran its course, it was immediately saved by Swagmoto and some new absurd life lesson. And honestly, how could I not love SwagLord? He made me a believer. PRAISE HIM, PRAISE SWAGJESUS! And for those readers that haven't experience the bountiful blessings of our Lord and savior, I implore you to seek him out, for he is worthy to be praise. Amen. \\n",

If you watched the first 3 episodes, whether you liked it or not, you've seen everything the show can offer.\r\nThere is no story, no characters, just Sakamoto swagging around, overcomes his opponents effortlessly. It becomes repetitive and boring real quick. There are some minor plot twists in every one or two episodes, when you along the rest of the cast thinks Sakamoto doing something extraordinary, but it turns out, it's just a regular thing, like making noise or hail a taxi. It's creative and funny, at least the first 2 or 3 times, butnot enough. The sound and music are decent, fits to the series, but that's all. There is literally nothing to talk about this series because it's completely blank.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end the biggest flaw of the series is that how flawless the main character is. There is no excitement, no tension and the blunt jokes couldn't keep up my attention. It's bad show and a boring which is one a mistake a comedy series can not afford to make.",

Introduced as Perfect but then starts making Mistakes as the shows on\\n\r\nor\\n\r\n3. a Character who is in a show which clearly Ridicules that type of Character/Makes jokes surrounding his/her perfection in such a way that the show is at least Fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHere Enters \"Sakamoto Desu ga?\" with the Character of Sakamoto, or as we call him Swagamoto because he is \"Cooler\" but in most cases \"Coolest\".\\n\r\nHis Character basically Screams out \"GARY STUUUU!\" because he is so Perfect,\\n\r\nWhile all the other Characters just Bask in his glory.\\n\r\nSo did the Show do the 3 things I mentioned earlier?\\n\r\nWell it only did the 3rd one and then Fully embraced it like it should.\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto desu ga? is an episodic show where Every episode is Actually 2 episodes spread over 24 Minutes equally.\\n\r\nin each episode, Swagamoto has to put up with Other students who (Like me) Dislike Gary Stu Characters or Help out fellow Students who need his help Resulting in him Getting into Various Situations where his Perfection is Needed.\\n\r\nThese Situations work very well with Swagamoto's perfection which then Results in Comedic High-jinx.\\n\r\nI like that kind of humor because it is Just Ridiculous, makes fun of my most hated Arch-type the Gary Stu and Above all, is Actually Funny in my Opinion.\\n\r\nHowever, these kinds of Situations are putting the Side Characters at the Background while Sakamoto is perfectly in the spotlights and they don't get much screen-time and they are Just average students and nothing more just like Students are in Reality Minus the Animeness which is sad because they could have been Interesting characters.\\n\r\nHowever, I See the train of thought of these Characters, like they were Observing Sakamoto Just like I the watcher was Observing him. The side Characters are also more of a Main characters in The skits that involve them and Sakamoto, Making Sakamoto more of a Side Character while he is The main character because I see the Story through the eyes of the Side Characters.\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto desu ga? is Clearly a Comedy Show that Looks Nicely Animated for that type of show and just Makes fun of Swagamoto's Ridiculus perfection and the Character of Swagamoto Could not work if the Show was not a Comedy but something else instead like an Serious Action show Because well You might know why.\\n\\n\r\nBut the wonders of Comedy shows is that it is already Considered Enjoyabe if just the Jokes alone are funny Because Comedy to me just has to Rely on being funny.\\n\r\nand That is what Sakamoto desu ga is, A really funny show.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you are looking For a good laugh then at least check out this show.\\n\r\nI can guarantee you that it will at least make you laugh once or many times.\\n\\n\r\nI give this Comedic show at this point, an well Deserved 8 (score might change overtime because it is still airing)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI haven't reviewed something in a long time so I might have made some pretty Critical errors so feel free to point them out in my Face at my profile if you want to.\\n\\n\r\nHave a Nice day Readers",

            "content": "**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**\r\nWell, Sakamoto desu ga? doesn\u2019t have an interesting and complex storyline. It has a cool guy named Sakamoto who swags his way through every situation he\u2019s ever faced with.\r\nCharacters are made interesting through their complexity, with them coming to deal with their flaws, accept them and improve upon them where they can. That\u2019s what makes an interesting and complex storyline.\r\nIn a lot of ways, Sakamoto Desu Ga? is the One Punch Man of school-life anime. One Punch Man is about a hero named Saitama who destroys every enemy he faces with one punch and zero effort.\r\nSakamoto Desu Ga? is about a kidnamed Sakamoto who has similar results against his foes. But instead of fighting giant monsters, he\u2019s going up against school bullies and manipulative girls.\\n\\n\r\nAnd instead of defeating them with a punch, he defeats them with sheer charm and charisma.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by \u201cdefeat,\u201d I mean \u201cmake them like him and also make them better people overall in the process\\n\\n\r\nThe really impressive thing about Sakamoto Desu Ga? so far is the ability it has to take a simple concept and keep it fresh in a number of situations.\\n\\n\r\nThe negative thing about the anime is that there is no character development, no plot development. Each episode basically just sums up the same way: \u201cSomeone is going to try to make Sakamoto look bad, let\u2019s see how it ultimately backfires and makes him look way cooler.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n Despite all this, it\u2019s so weird and quirky that it\u2019s ultimately still quite enjoyable. Despite it just featuring the same gag, playing out in different ways, it\u2019s still a ton of fun. That\u2019s incredibly impressive to me, and speaks to the quality of the gag. But I have to wonder just how long it can keep up.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters in the series are practically non-existent. The few that are recurring aren\u2019t especially interesting, even down to their names. such as :\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s \u201cpopular girl who tries to seduce Sakamoto for the sake of status, but keeps getting hilariously foiled.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t list all of the  names, because honestly, they\u2019re not important to the series. Sakamoto Desu Ga? is a one-man show, and the other characters are little more than props to further the legend of Sakamoto.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEven the opening credits feature all of exactly one character.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to see Sakamoto Desu Ga? is made on a budget. The very first episode opens with a wide shot of three guys tossing a volleyball around in the school yard in the most minimal, circular animation imaginable.\\n\\n\r\nThe action sequences rely heavily on dressed-up still shots, simple circular animation patterns, and motion blur. They do a good job of hiding the lack of funding where they can, but suffice to say there aren\u2019t any sequences that are going to leave you slack-jawed in awe and appreciation.\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nEpisode 6 was really terrible due to the fact that Sakamoto and three kids was walking in a white line which took most of the time consumption on the episode which was rough about 10minutes \"WASTED\" footage. This episode really lacked being entertaining aswell being enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all: \\n\r\nAnimation: 5/6\\n\r\nCharacter development : 3\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/5\\n\r\nOverall : 4\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review if you got this far and i hope you found it useful and take in ideas on what is to come when you watch this series.",

            "content": "\"And on that day, no fucks were given... only swag\".\r\nMake room for our new lord and savior... Sakamoto. Despite how much I enjoyed Sakamoto desu ga? I can fully understand this anime is not for everyone. However, I love comedy shows that don't take themselves seriously. Sakamoto took a similar approach to Nichijou in the fact that it didn't give a shit. It wasn't trying to cater towards a specific category of viewer and stuck to its repetitive yet effective style of humor, with its over exaggeration of daily, normal events. In doing so, it became the unsung hero of the season for me, andmade me appreciate the whimsical side of normalcy. For now, despite whether or not you agree with me, depress your mute button and let me explain Sakamoto's greatness to you.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes less is more, and I couldn't think of a better phrase to sum up this show. Sakamoto desu ga? flew onto the scene this season headed by the well known director, Shinji Takamatsu (Gintama, School Rumble). The setting is simple, a standard Japanese high school with your pranksters, babes and nerds. But what makes this high school different is that it's enrolled the embodiment of perfection that is Sakamoto. He's tall dark and handsome, and can do no wrong. He performs every task quickly and concisely, emulating a smirk that would drop panties from a mile away. Whether he's an alien or robot doesn't really matter, since it would only add confirmation to the ridiculousness that this anime contains. Countless people wish to disrupt Sakamoto's greatness for one reason or another but constantly fail in doing so. The methods in which their feeble attempts are vanquished always seem to have me rolling. One minute Sakamoto is fighting a bee with a protractor and the next he's attacking people with soft drinks. The \"Secret Techniques\" employed in some episodes were a riot, most specifically the ones in the adult video episode. Some of those scenes were pure comedic gold. The important thing to remember here is that Sakamoto desu ga? was produced on a rather low budget, and although it doesn't do many things, what it does it nails. It truly embodies greatness through simplicity.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing Sakamoto does well is the accurate transposition of its source material. If you're anything like me (being a primary anime viewer), you get tired of the phrase \"oh, that's not how it is in the manga!\" So when an adaptation executes well and I don't have to hear that talk, everyone is happy. Well done Studio Deen! They've been responsible for some rather big budget titles over the years (Fate series etc.), so to see them succeed with something on the contrary is impressive. With some anime the season, I went into each episode unaware of what I was going to get. Since I watched the series as it aired, I'm looking for something consistent that will bring me back excited each week. By the end of the first four or five episodes of Sakamoto, I sort of knew what to expect from it every Saturday. If I don't have the luxury of binge watching it, give me something to look forward to in each episode!\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly to the comedy, the negatives in Sakamoto are mostly preferential. For cultural reasons there were some jokes that went over my head but didn't necessarily deter me from finding them amusing. Also, episode six was an absolute bore. Watching a bunch of kids follow Sakamoto down a white line for 10+ minutes is not my idea of a good time. The elicit one-sided love affair with Sakamoto's friend's mom kind of made me nauseous at times. Fortunately enough, Sakamoto's tireless acts of evading countered my disgusted emotions quite well. As much as I hate to say it, this series could fall flat at times which probably hindered it from being an 8/10 for me. As previously stated, I can understand why people don't like the show. I can usually find most comedy styles humorous in anime, but slapstick and stupid humor are some of my favorite sub-genres. And although most of the jokes were way out of left field, instead of getting the forced vibe I did accept it as commonplace given Sakamoto's flawless behavior. Non-comedy fans may not \"get\" Sakamoto, and that's fine.  This show was not geared towards everyone's perspective of what qualifies as funny. I do admit, even as someone who is a fan of this comedy style, I could feel myself losing interest in the last two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, Sakamoto is really the only thing that matters in this show.  Sure, there are supportive cast mates strewn about, but none of them really make or break the show.  Our lord and savior, Sakamoto sweats perfection, and makes even the manliest of men blush with a mere smile.  Sometimes I'm not sure if I should laugh or be entirely creeped out by some of the character's reactions to Sakamoto's escapades.... But I'm not sure that it makes any difference.  There has been a debate among the forums of whether he's an alien or not. Again, the over-analytic approach some anime fans have grown accustomed to will not translate well into this show.  Coming from a reasonable critic, shut your brain off while watching this series and just enjoy the senseless comedy. Sakamoto is sort of a one trick pony, so there really isn't much development in him, and there weren't any instances of internal monologue or breaking the fourth wall.  I think adding too much or maybe any development to his character would've been detrimental to the show's atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't anything special in Sakamoto desu ga? Any slightly seasoned anime fan could notice the show's lower budget in its art.  Aside from the OP, there aren't many instances of bright or vivid color schemes, and the character models are dull and slightly cloned (although you could argue that this was intentional). I did find the students who were drawn to look like they were in their 20's or 30's rather amusing, even more evidence that the writers didn't take the show seriously.  The backgrounds are often recycled and bland, but in an anime mostly shown in a school, you can't expect much else.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP as mentioned above was my favorite of the season.  The small animations were all to accentuate Sakamoto's greatness, and the music was powerful and triumphant.  I loved watching the various props he'd use to sing with or use as musical instruments.  The ED was a calming way to end the comedy from each episode, and it grew on me the longer I watched the series.  The rest of the soundtrack consisted of a couple of recycled songs, most notably the ditty that played prior to each time Sakamoto swooped in doing something mesmerizing. I enjoyed it every time. Sakamoto's voice actor, Hikaru Midorikawa was quite brilliant in his classy portrayal.  Kubota, played by Akira Ishida, was phenomenal.  He was a large reason the character gave off such a creepy vibe.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to be fair, Sakamoto desu ga was the anime of the season for me.  Its inflated representation of the \"perfect\" guy at school made me laugh constantly, and there was no way I could guess what he would do next.  This anime is certainly not for everyone, and my score is entirely dependent on my preference.  I'd recommend Sakamoto to fans of shows like Nichijou, Gintama or Chromartie High School, but if you're not a fan of mindless comedy I'd stay away.  Unlike its main protagonist, it's not perfect by any means, and sometimes ventures too far to get a laugh, but overall I found it to be highly enjoyable.  As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out the rest of my Spring 2016 reviews!\\n",

            "content": "This is truly a horrible anime. This thing barely worked in manga format because you could read it quickly(and even THEN you tired after 5 chapters when the novelty wore off because it was just a repeat thing with no jokes or anything every damn chapter, while the latter half was barely worth reading despite only having a few chapters over 20), but when it's endlessly dragged out in anime format and no new parts or innovations which adds to the experience? Yeah, you have a dreadful or even pathetic piece of crap that you just shouldn't waste your time watching.\r\nThis anime has pathetic characters,pathetic story and offers ridiculously low amounts of enjoyment. You might even go minus on the enjoyment part and just wish to kill yourself while watching this. It might be slightly better if you haven't read the manga, but I don't see this thing being worthy of anything above 3 stars even then.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the side characters have any soul or special part about them, at most they're all kind of obnoxious. The whole thing is just about sakamoto showing that he's got a bigger d*ck than anyone else and amaze everyone with his rather impossible actions as he flawlessly avoids every possibly negative thing for himself, dumbfounding people over and over again. This is all this anime is. Sakamoto isn't even interesting as a character, just like in the manga, he's a soulless shell with no clear emotions, no goals and no parts that stand out other than the fact that he can't be screwed over because he's so \"amazing\". We don't know who he is, we don't know what he is, we don't know his real goals, we don't know what he feels about anything. How could such a character be likable, especially when he needs to prop up the show by himself since none of the side-characters have anything to offer other than being retarded and way too eager to kiss his arse?\\n\\n\r\nJust spare yourself from the frustration and never, ever watch this. If you really feel like you want to know what is going on, read the manga instead, it's much faster and way more enjoyable thanks to that. Nothing really happens in the anime that doesn't happen in the manga anyway.",

            "content": "This is gay? No, it's Sakamoto. An epic comedy anime that I will never forget. I don't know how much I am watching over and laugh at each episode. The anime will always leave a memorable moment after watching.\r\nSakamoto. Sakamoto. Sakamoto. Popular guy in the school, if generally popular guy has a cold nature, arrogant and confident high level. Sakamoto give the other side of the 'cool guy'. Are cool synonymous with luxurious appearance? Stylish? Or do things differently?\r\nNo, Sakamoto give the other colors of the term \"cool\" itself. By becoming a popular guy in school, of course like that is predictable, \"they will behated or harassed by people who don't like it\". Cliche, but that the different is how the mangaka bring the story becomes more interesting and spices comedy is enough to make you surprised, smiled strangely even laugh out loud. Boring story? Don't worry, there are times where there will be a change in the story. But don't expect the conflict is complicated, this anime doesn't say so.\\n\\n\r\nThe major point of this anime is flamboyant and elegant nature of Sakamoto himself. Even so, he ended up just a simple man. I was quite touched by the scene where she was feeding the baby bird in the school hallway. It made me think, we will not know what Sakamoto do with things that are going on around him. Unpredictable and he's always doing a scene that is enough to make me wonder. But this anime attract enough women (in my estimation), because he was handsome, and if he has shown a cool side, maybe not just me, I'm always laughing loudly and shouting at the same time. *fangirls mode*\\n\r\nIn addition, talk about other characters in this anime. Not bad. Many of the characters are popping up with oddities that support the story.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, most men would complain or feel disgusted when watching this one. But no, this is what makes this anime is different. I am very satisfied with Studio Deen who produce this, due to the art style, this is the advantage of this studio. Not easy to find manga that will be used as anime. The taste of Studio Deen is able to provide a spectacle that will attract the attention of many people. Even from surveys that have been done, it's become the number one popular anime in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is my number one this season. Because epic, funny and exciting. Why is this anime? Is not there anything else? Yes, probably from the effects, coloring and everything is different from Re: zero or Kabaneri which is the top anime this season. I'm not saying it was bad anime, but maybe I prefer this anime. But I also can't say if Sakamoto has cuteness level with Gintama. No, they have their own proportions, you can't discriminate.\\n\\n\r\nFor the opening song is very cool. If usually and mostly I was always pressing the \"Skip\" button on the screen and directly into stories. Different with this one, I don't do what I used to do!

That's the anime. Here is some cool, infallible guy WHO DOESN'T CHANGE EVER.\r\nIf Sakamoto had maybe developed in some way - i.e. become more human, hell had turned out not to be a human - I might have liked this anime.

            "content": "If I asked you what came to mind when I mentioned the words \"cool,\" or perhaps \"suave,\" what would your answer be? For the students at Gakubun Prefectural High School the answer would most definitely be \"Sakamoto.\" \r\n\"Sakamoto desu ga?\" is an anime which focuses around our main character Sakamoto. The niche of this anime is that Sakamoto is the coolest guy around; always figuring out the best answer to any given situation. Now, the plot of this show may not seem extraordinary, nor do I proclaim it to be; but the show manages to grasp your attention with it's own unique style. This showcouples easy to follow scenes with a nice jazz-styled OST to create a calming vibe. The anime does a perfect job of creating an atmosphere where the viewer has time to sit back and unwind. \\n\\n\r\nTo follow, there's another element of the show that I felt made it worth watching. The show inspires you. Sakamoto throughout the duration of the series always manages to find the best answers to even the trickiest situations; a trait which is inspiring and admirable. Watching Sakamoto pull off the feats that he does leaves the viewer with a sense of wanting to do the same in their own lives. It gives you the initiative to live like Sakamoto, without fear or regret, finding the best answer to all questions; which I feel alone is enough to make the anime enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nTo add to the inspiring atmosphere that the show creates there's also the comedy, which of course is meant to be the focal point of the show. The comedy wasn't phenomenal, but there were very few points in the show where I was not laughing or at least cracking a smile. The anime does not pull off too many hysterical jokes (that's not to say there aren't any), but it does pull off consistent quality ones; a feat which will leave you happy and laughing throughout each episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST, I have to mention, is also very well done. The aesthetic of the music develops a calming and fanciful environment in which we can watch each character live their life. The OST is truly fitting of the anime's genre and purpose; and for that I must give it high regards. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very-well done, surprisingly so for a show that doesn't involve any extensive fight scenes or breath-taking scenery. There was even a \"fight scene\" at one point during the show that was animated better than some of the big fights I've seen in animes with extensive budgets - that, to me, says a lot about the quality of the work that went into the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe only downfall I'd have to mention about the anime is there's no evident story-line to follow. If you're a sucker for a good story, then this anime may not intrigue you. The purpose of the show is to follow the comical school life of the coolest guy you may ever know, Sakamoto; but at the same time that's all it is. There is not meant to be a story to follow simply because that's how the show was constructed. There is, however, a small underlying plot device that defines the show and is the reason I am giving it such a high mark. This underlying plot device is hinted at in the anime itself, and I will make a point not to spoil it here. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude this review; I hold \"Sakamoto desu ga?\" in high regards and I loved sitting down to watch the show each week. It's relaxing, fun, consistently funny, and a great show for anyone who wants to unwind and laugh. I would definitely recommend this anime.",

He lives in a world of style, cool, and swag. Every movement he does is bleeding cool. Sakamoto does not live in a world... The world IS Sakamoto. Sakamoto makes our lives have so much more meaning. Sakamoto helps us through tears and sorrow.\r\nSakamoto-kun does not fear the trials and tribulations ahead.\r\nRather, they fear him.\r\nSakamoto inspires in all of us a desire to better a situation, no matter how tough. \r\nSakamoto-kun is the story.\r\nSakamoto-kun isthe world.\\n\r\nSakamoto-kun is... Cool.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto-kun was only made possible by a team of godly animators. Why is that? Because Sakamoto-kun is our master, and our master only invokes the gods of animation themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is that of a heavenly angelic chorus singing to us from the heavens. Only the most ultimate forms of swag are invoked in these timeless pieces.

COOLEST this godlike entertainment is, with the ending song bringing the audience to tears once the perfection that is the \"episodes\" of the show ends.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is only that of top-dollar actors. Sakamoto's voice actor has reached his heavenly ascension through his role as the physical embodiment of our master, Sakamoto-kun, which is of course a joyous occasion for all of the human race as we all wish to reach enlightenment through Sakamoto-kun.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nOur cast of characters are all very likeable as they are all faithful followers of our Sakamoto-kun.

Cooler... COOLEST!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nWatching Sakamoto and his pure, utter perfection at everything happen in motion will bring anyone to tears of joy. Sakamoto is perfect. We are not worthy to be in his presence, however he has made it so, bringing pure enjoyment to everyone who witnesses.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nI do not believe that I am worthy enough to describe how perfect Sakamoto is.\\n\r\nSakamoto should be witnessed and followed by every being.\\n\r\nSakamoto is cool\\n\r\nCooler\\n\r\nCOOLEST!\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nIn all seriousness this show is pretty great.

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI would not consider myself a cool person. Nerdy, sure. Handsome, why not. (At least, that\u2019s what my grandmother tells me whenever I see her.) But not cool.\r\nI\u2019m not even kidding. Snowboarding is probably my coolest trait, and, even then, I cannot perform any tricks off ramps or rails for fear of hurting myself unnecessarily. (Falling on my bum is enough pain for me).\r\nAlthough, after watching Sakamoto desu ga?, I may not be as uncool as I once thought.\r\nSTORY\r\nSakamoto has only one star: Sakamoto. In short, he is beyond stylish. And that\u2019s what the animealmost exclusively focuses on. For twelve straight episodes, Sakamoto (the show) proves why Sakamoto (the man) is the coolest dude to ever live.\\n\\n\r\nHe doesn\u2019t just play an arcade whack-a-mole game; he plays Bach as he hits the different heads.\\n\\n\r\nHe gets himself sent out into the hall while in class \u2013 to feed and protect a dying baby sparrow.\\n\\n\r\nHe picks up a girl\u2019s eraser, uses it furiously, then gives it back, allowing the girl to calm down her nerves and warm her hands from the heat created by the intense friction.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, there are way too many instances to list because, to reiterate, the anime is literally all about Sakamoto being insanely cool ad infinitum. Which leads into the show\u2019s most arguable aspect: the main joke itself.\\n\\n\r\nOn the one hand, the audience always \u201cknows\u201d what\u2019s going to happen. It doesn\u2019t matter if the situation looks completely grim, if Sakamoto is doing something weird, or if nothing is happening at all. The show will make sure that the coolest guy ever is the coolest guy ever. In this way, the anime loses out on suspense and intrigue since the outcome is already \u201cknown\u201d beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, this joke is the whole point of the show. It\u2019s obvious that the anime will not be doing more than making Sakamoto out to be a cool cat, so it is almost unfair to expect anything else to happen. Plus, the anime does a nice job of spinning the mundane scenarios that Sakamoto finds himself in with crazy yet plausible coolness.\\n\\n\r\nDisregarding the contention of repetition, Sakamoto does choose to follow some questionable routes.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, the entire subplot with Fukase is odd. Having this antagonist appear way too late into the season is one issue, but it is his conclusion and relation that creates the biggest head-scratcher.\\n\\n\r\nAs has been mentioned many a time already, Sakamoto is an anime about a super-cool dude. By extension, it\u2019s also about how everyone else views him as cool, too. But not Fukase. He never actually concedes to Sakamoto\u2019s coolness, \u201closing\u201d by trickery and betrayal. In other words, the anime fails to fulfill its promise that Sakamoto is, in fact, the coolest dude around (to everybody else).\\n\\n\r\nThe show also has the problem of regressing on its already-finished outcomes. Characters that were helped, such as Atsushi and Yuuya, are affected by Sakamoto\u2019s cool aura, but the anime will later choose to have these same people go against Sakamoto again, removing the purpose or impact of their earlier interactions with the king of cool.\\n\\n\r\nAmbiguity in the ending also does not help the anime\u2019s execution. His leave comes out of nowhere, and his sentimental appeal is lost on the audience since he never really seemed to connect with any of the other students emotionally\\n\\n\r\nBut when all is said and done, Sakamoto has an underlying message that may not be clear since it is hidden behind the comedy and these problems.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, Sakamoto is no doubt a cool guy. But what makes him cool? Is it those quirky moves that he employs from time to time? Is it those girls that constantly flock around him? Is it his general demeanor?\\n\\n\r\nNo. It is none of those qualities.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s true that Sakamoto kicking a rock along a slanted ramp while defying gravity is cool. Him defeating one of the bigger punks of the school at a game of pushing sumo makes him cooler than most. But what makes him the coolest is his friendship with Kubota, his way of inspiring others to be better people, and his general sense of selflessness.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, what\u2019s coolest is being a genuinely good person. And that, if nothing else, makes the narrative a meaningful one.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nMuch of Sakamoto finds itself with mixed art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nArt-wise, the show succumbs to its boring setting. The school and nearby town do not lend themselves to immense creativity and, as a result, the anime fails to be captivating visually.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, it does what it can. Sakamoto\u2019s different \u201csecret techniques,\u201d such as \u201cSleepover PE\u201d or \u201cWind with No Destination (Straw Cigarette)\u201d, add some much-needed flair with sparkles, colors, and a display of words. Furthermore, a lot of Sakamoto\u2019s different actions are given better lighting, accentuating the \u201choliness\u201d that Sakamoto seems to exude.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs likewise meet a mixed fate. To be fair, they are what they should be: realistic, plain people. But they don\u2019t do much to appeal to the audience. The exception, of course, is Sakamoto. The mole near his eye, his toned physique, his proper outfit, his tallness, and his sharp features turn him into the attractive, cool man he is supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair again, the other characters are not without their own physical traits. Indeed, Kubota\u2019s squat face or Yuuya\u2019s big belly highlight Sakamoto\u2019s design that much more. But it is hard to see their designs as anything more than passable.\\n\\n\r\nActual-animation-wise, Sakamoto performs similarly. Perhaps obviously, the anime reserves most of its movement and resources for Sakamoto\u2019s various exploits. Jumping onto debris in a swift river, competing in a snowball fight, and parachuting out of a window using a makeshift device are just some the many events involving Sakamoto that get animated throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nMeaning, everyone who isn\u2019t Sakamoto has seen better days. Lots of streaky backgrounds, non-moving bodies, and general nuance (such as eye and hair shifts) are hardly seen from the side characters.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough even Sakamoto cannot evade the low-quality animation hammer. Cleaning the ceiling while avoiding the dust that falls is given multiple still shots to mirror movement, and creating centrifugal wind through a video-rental store sees a similar effect. These examples, however, can be forgiven since they are used for cool, comedic effect.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not a whole lot to say about Sakamoto\u2019s characters. And this void leads to both intentional and unintentional outcomes.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the side characters first, they are more or less a single trait, missing out on characterization let alone development. Kubota is the loner. Kakuta is the mean teacher. Kuronuma is the popular girl. And so on and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nTheir singular purpose is to demonstrate that Sakamoto cannot be phased, cannot be thrown for a loop, and cannot be anything but cool.\\n\\n\r\nWhich works. It\u2019s fun seeing Sakamoto one-up the college students, and it\u2019s hilarious to watch the mean ring-leader unable to cope with Sakamoto\u2019s insane attention to servitude.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the anime pays a price for only having its side cast exist under the same category: severely unengaging personalities. They simply lack the necessary intrigue to make them worthwhile characters \u2013 both for the audience and for the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Sakamoto, surprisingly, next to nothing is given about him. Kubota even makes a comment about this \u2013 that he barely inquired about the coolest dude in the world. Because he didn\u2019t, the audience likewise knows very little about Sakamoto. His family. His interests. His overall feelings as a person. Nothing is given.\\n\\n\r\nThis lack of information creates mystery surrounding his origins and self in general, fueling his cool flame further. Plus, the adage \u201cactions speak louder than words\u201d work wonders here to visually demonstrate who and what makes up Sakamoto.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other tidbit about the characters that could be said is through the reversal in their juxtaposition.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate, almost all the side characters exist to make Sakamoto look cool. Simultaneously, Sakamoto exists to make the side characters also look cool.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Sakamoto using his \u201cgun\u201d to diffuse the balloon situation allows the two male students who framed him to reveal their true feelings. Another example is Sakamoto taking the time to not only serve as Hayabusa\u2019s arms and legs but also to act as the face-forward decoy. Yet another example is Yuuya undressing himself to take embarrassment away from Yagi after his shoelace-tying plan against Sakamoto worked a little too well.\\n\\n\r\nIn this way, the anime is essentially expressing the notion that everyone can be cool. Obviously, nobody can be as cool as Sakamoto, but, after what they see of him, how they are affected by him, it becomes clear that being cool is not just reserved for the NASA-aspiring man.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nArguably speaking, the opening track of Sakamoto is its strongest facet. The triumphant tone of the piece, created by the resounding drums and loud guitar, fits easily amidst the triumph that Sakamoto so regularly champions. The chanting of \u201ccooler, coolest\u201d, the rising lyrics in the middle, and the overall catchiness of the piece make it a (appropriate enough) cool OP.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track should not be overlooked, however, for it is just as strong of a song. The slow, calm pacing contrasts with the OP but coincides with many parts of the anime. Because coolness, both in action and in name, entails a sense of chill. The vocalist does well, and, once again, the track is quite catchy (and fun to whistle to), so the ED ends up as another solid addition to the musical lineup.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the original soundtrack is unlike the OP and the ED in that the tracks themselves are not all that interesting. But they do follow the main motif of the show: coolness. Lots of jazzy tracks and rich tunes, filled with saxophones, trumpets, wind instruments galore, inject even more coolness into the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, voice acting sees no notable performances except for perhaps Hikaru Midorikawa as Sakamoto and Akira Ishida as Kubota. While neither of them have any stand-out moments, the former\u2019s composed delivery and the latter\u2019s nasally voice fit their respective characters well.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhile the repetition in the joke was evident, I never felt as though it were an issue.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, I was laughing at the silliness of it all. Sakamoto riding a mop-and-bin like a Segway. All the girls during art class rushing to get near his side to draw and be drawn by him. The insane ability for him to create subliminal effects in fractions of a fraction of a second. Yes, it was \u201call the same,\u201d but I still smiled regardless.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t all smiles. I do wish there was more to Sakamoto than what was given. Maybe exploring that romance angle or maybe showing more of his thoughts in general. To be fair, having him end up with anyone would, in some sense, take away part of his coolness, and monologuing would defeat the surprise in the solutions he comes up with. But I still would have liked to have seen more.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest gripe, however, was Kubota\u2019s mom. Simply put, I was not a fan. At all. She was a creepy character who got too much screen time (time that could have been used to introduce another new person instead) for my liking.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, she wasn\u2019t enough on her own to completely take away how entertaining it was to see these slice-of-life moments taken to the \u201cextreme.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto desu ga? gives an answer to its question. The story\u2019s theme on coolness, the strong OP and ED, and the comedy itself are positives worth noting. But the lack of an interesting side cast, the low animation, and a certain mom are negatives also worth noting. Still, it\u2019s a cool time nonetheless (even without any snowboard tricks).\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, while problems exist in terms of the content and its delivery, the overall message on what is actually the coolest makes the show into more than just a comedic outing\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, mixed artistic direction, character designs, and actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, the side cast are severely unengaging, but Sakamoto\u2019s lack of details strangely helps, and the theme on everyone having the potential to be cool is not lost\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, good ED, okay OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, Kubota\u2019s mom was creepy, but the \u201cextreme\u201d slice-of-life events were still a lot of fun\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "What happens when you take a high school setting and add perfection itself, only second to God? Haven\u2019t you heard? Sakamoto happens. \r\nThis short but sweet comedy anime focuses on one gimmick only. Sakamoto being absolutely perfect in every situation, and his interactions with his classmates. It may seem like after some time, the anime loses its charm as the plot keeps on repeating, but fear not. The 12 episode limit keeps the pace steady. The story never gets boring or stale. Good soundtrack which incorporates jazz (obviously) keeps the anime smooth. The comedy is going to have you question \u201chow does Sakamoto get outof this one\u201d in second half of the anime. And it\u2019ll keep surprising you and make you laugh. A lot. My only complaint is that the show for me lacks rewatching value once you\u2019ll see how Sakamoto overcomes his situations in the most perfect manner possible. But for one time only it\u2019s a great ride. \\n\\n\r\nProduction remains good. Animation looks great. Only flaws I saw were some CGI shots later in the series but they are so brief that you have to search for them in order to find them. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is on point on the male side. The female side lacks a little but considering context of the show (females being mainly fangirls of Sakamoto and not having any MAJOR role in the story outside of trying to get his heart I can understand that producers weren\u2019t trying to have vast and diverse cast)\\n\\n\r\nBefore you\u2019ll know it, it\u2019s going to be over. So don\u2019t blink. You may miss some of this anime's awesomeness. \\n",

            "content": "Sakamoto Desu Ga is a gem that shines brilliantly in the Spring 2016 season. Its an amazing comedy that is definetly worth investing your time in. While I wasnt expecting much from this show Its become my favorite series of all time and one I highly reccomend\r\nSTORY: Sakamoto is the coolest kid at school who can do everything in the most stylish way possible. While the series follows Sakamoto but its really the story of how he helps everyone grow around him. Sakamoto Desu Ga is episodic and follows the narrative of hilarious short stories of everyone's interactions with Sakamoto. Wether his classmates are tryingto foil him or help him Sakamoto solves any problem often with the other chracter in that short story becoming a better person because of meeting Sakamoto. The story is amazingly creative in the everyday tasks Sakamoto and  co. face wether they're excorsizing a ghost, walking all over the town, or having a sumo match the show presents any task they face in the most hilarious way possible. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nART: The way you know if a series is well animated is if you dont notice the animation at all and it feels like a living breathing series. SDG does just that it's very well animated with its fluid motions and nice character design. The series isnt meant to be the most amazingly animated work of art like a Psycho Pass or Fate/Zero but it is very nice to look at, and the art especially shines whenever Sakamoto is on screen as the lighting is shown to portray Sakamoto as the Flashiest and most amazing person as possible and they easily succeed. The Sakamoto scenes can easily make you buy into the idea that Sakamoto is the coolest person alive because of how amazingly hes presented.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: The cast of Sakamoto is very large but offers a very memorable selection of them. I could be here all day talking about how amazing Sakamoto is and thats because I truly believe he is. Studio Deen goes out of their way to make Sakamoto the coolest whether it be their amazing visuals when hes on screen, the Suave music that always plays when hes around, or his amazing feats he is the best character of the series and is absolutely hilarious. Kubota sakamoto's sidekick is absolutey hilarious and serves as the kind of ugly sister to sakamoto. The Three delinquents always get into some mischief, Hayabousa is an absolute badass, Aina is a dual faced flirtatious psycho who is one of the many girls fawning over Sakamoto, Sera is just completely hilarous (ill come back to him in a second). These are all characters ive grown fond of in my 12 ep. run of SDG because they have human emotions and feel like people I could actually meet and be friends with and those are a limited number to not make this review too long. Sakamoto helps all these characters grow inderiectly and it is rewarding too see them do so. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The soundtrack is amazing and very Suave reflecting the feel of the series. From the high powered OP to the Cool soundtrack around Sakamoto the soundtrack. Yasuhiko Fukuda  gives a great OST  and im excited to see what he brings us in the future.\\n\\n\r\nCOMEDY: The series is hialrous and is always bringing a great sense of humor. If I had to compare how funny it is to other anime id say its up there with Gintama and Barakamon two of my favorite anime series. The show has great execution and always brings us the most simple situations in a hilarous manor. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Sakamoto Desu Ga was a pleasure to watch and is easily one of my favorite series of all time. From the comedic execution to the great characters there is little not too love. SDG earns a 10/10 for me and a strong reccomendation",

            "content": "People always said that \u201cPerfection is not always easy to achieve\u201d\r\nReally!!!!  Let me tell you about \u201cThe Legend of Sakamoto\u201d\r\nAlong time ago, in class 1-2 of Gakubun Perfectual High School. One student had the entire school\u2019s attention from the very first day. Carrying out class duties in STYLE, eating his lunch in STYLE, standing in the hall in STYLE, studying in STYLE, walking in STYLE, talking in STYLE, and even singing in SYLE. Every single move he makes is COOL! COOLER! COOLEST! And the name of the student is Sakamoto. There was nobody is PERFECT being except Sakamoto. Nobody can defeat him. In fact,all of girl student love him and certain of the boy student jealous at him. Furthermore, Sakamoto is the only PERFECT person in the world and he\u2019s the CHOSEN ONE. \\n\\n\r\nOut of the blue \u201cDeus Ex Machina\u201d is finally here. Oh thank you!!!!! \\n\r\n-\tSakamoto can help you pass in exam\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto can help you to defeat any gangster\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto can help you how to deal with the problem\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto inspired us how to became a fabulous person\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto can woo any girls with his fabulous face and his charisma\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto has a lot of idea to make something become wonderful\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto is our greatest HERO\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto is really \u201cBADASS\u201d in martial arts\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto\u2019s an extremely capable (of) all the things in \u201cSTYLE\u201d\\n\r\n-\tContact number 010-xxxxxxxx\u2026\u2026if you have any problem, just call Sakamoto \\n\r\n-\tAll the people always say \u201cWOW & SUGOI\u201d when Sakamoto show something incredible\\n\\n\r\nThe moral of the story is :\\n\r\n-\tHumorous\\n\r\n-\tYou can be a calm person\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto taught us about never intimidated by thugs\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto show us, about forgive someone is really important, even someone doing bad things to him \\n\r\n-\tOur confident will rise and its taught us never give up on something and don\u2019t be indecisive person  \\n\r\n-\tSakamoto show about justice is really paramount\\n\\n\\n\r\nRemember this \u201cPrecious Phrase\u201d \\n\\n\r\n\u201cKeep Calm and Watch Sakamoto desu ga?\u201d \\n\\n\r\n\u201cThis is Sakamoto. Sakamoto has everything \\n\r\n   and he\u2019s always rescue people. \\n\r\n   Sakamoto never complain about his classmate \\n\r\n   even certain people try to tricks him. \\n\r\n   Sakamoto is nice person. Be like Sakamoto\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cTHE END\u201d\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow about the \u201cseiyuu\u201d Midorikawa Hikaru, He was cast as a Sakamoto in the story and his voice is really unique and suitable. Next, a charismatic Sakamoto who attracted girls and a few guy also admired him. He\u2019s always calm down, never flustered & not afraid, even in an emergency. I really like his appearance and kindness. Sometime, we can called him as \u201cKUUDERE\u201d person or fabulous guy. When Sakamoto has purpose on something, he will do whatever it takes.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series is really great, especially Opening theme, COOLEST by Customi Z. Its include a motivation words like a COOL, COOLER, COOLEST, OH YEAH !, YEAH !, YOU ARE SPECIAL, BREAK OUT !, WAKE UP ! Seriously, I got such spirit when I heard this song and the music is really catchy and great. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the story gave me a lot of enjoyment. Truthfully, Nami Sano create a bizarre story. I think the creator try to teach us, how to become stylish person and brilliant person. In fact, I could call a masterpiece work. I laughed like a drain when I watched the story. In nutshell, Sakamoto desu ga? One of the most successful sitcom takes place in spring 2016. For the whole of the story Sakamoto desu ga? is magnificent & I have absolutely no doubt about Sakamoto desu ga? Is a masterpiece. In fact, Sakamoto desu ga? Is quite similar narrative with Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou & Gintama.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, it\u2019s Sakamoto desu ga? results !!!!!\\n\\n\r\nWhat I watched\\n\r\nSakamoto desu ga?\\n\\n\r\nWhat I Expected\\n\r\nI will become a FAMOUS person\\n\\n\r\nWhat I Got\\n\r\nI have total confidence, when I do something\\n",

Not every story is top notch, but this anime has so many ideas that you will be entertained most of the time.\r\n9/10\r\nArt:\r\nSakamoto is a pretty boy, but everybody else is pretty...pretty (I should have used a thesaurus there) as well.

I really loved that piece of music that plays every time Sakamoto does something amazing. The voices are all very stereotype, but that's part of the charm.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nDid I mention already just how awesome Sakamoto is? Because he's awesome. Somehow he manages to overshadow everybody else without coming off as a jerk. The other characters do what they are supposed to, the only one who kinda stands out a little is Hayabusa. Oh, and Fujita is a sweetie.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, not every story is a hit, but most of them are. Sakamotos antics are always hilarious and incredible to witness. I'm not sure if they would have been able to keep this up for more than 12/13 episodes though. But for a weekly dose, it was absolutely worth it.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n8.2/10",

            "content": "\"Every man wants to be like him and women named their vibrators after him\"\r\nIn a world riddled with cringe humor, Sakamoto Desuga? is here to bless us with an alternative, yet rarely utilized type of comedy; \r\nSuave humor. Known also by it's street name \"Swag humor\" this sort of comedy depicts the complete opposite of social awkwardness where the main character is the embodiment of social perfection.\r\nThe show is completely contrarian in nature. Perfect characters are often frown upon but now and then, someone would find someway to challenge such sentiments. Sakamoto, the complete opposite of a certain popular cringe character named Bean (even witha slightly elevated mole position), revolves around the story. I mean the story revolves around Sakamoto and his interaction with daily life and the people whom just so happened to be sharing the world with him. \\n\\n\r\nDue to his character already being flawless in nature, the show's premise relies on the development of other character that directly interacts with him. Almost every episodic segment promotes an obvious \"moral of the story\", Sakamoto \"kakoi-ness\" inspires his fellow students to strive to be better, in somewhat roundabout comedic way. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening song of the anime serves as a fitting \"bard's song\" singing heroic praises, commemorating Sakamoto's existence. The jazzy tune played at every instance of \"Sugoi-ness\" amplifies Sakamoto's position as a cult of personality in his own show. I sincerely wished there were more varieties for this composition (musical instrument wise) otherwise I would have given it a \"Sakamoto\" rating (That's a perfect score). \\n\\n\r\nA major risk with the show's premise is that it constantly needs to redefine it's \"Kuru-ness\" as it needs to persistently impress viewers so that the humor does not run dry. Being constantly bombarded by his \"sugoi\" antics, viewers may sense a feeling of repetition and familiarness. Thus, an unimpressive side character was eventually introduced as Sakamoto's comrade in order the contrast the blatant difference between them. The show is capable of inducing a few chuckles here and there but it's short of being anything revolutionary. Whether you are impressed or just find his roundabout ways amusing, Sakamoto does capture our imagination of an almost perfect human being (Clearly because he has to wear glasses, his eyesight isn't that perfect).\\n\\n\r\nPS: Apologies for all the wapanese terms, just an afterthought of how cringey it is when non-Japanese speakers use Japanese word but it is somewhat \"cool\" for Japanese people to use English terms. Such is life. But not for Sakamoto.. Stay Cool Kids. Don't do Anime, not even once. \\n\\n",

This auxiliary introduction to this mysterious, clean-looking man, unfortunately, doesn\u2019t exist. \r\nWhy, of course, would there be such a need?\r\nOne does not introduce Sakamoto.\r\nOne does not simply require the induction of any mainstream preface to unveil such a magnificent being.\r\nIt is without question, almost as splendidly visceral as how the gleam in his eyes decimates the wobblyheart of every female and non-asshole male in his vicinity, for everyone to instantly fathom that this man right here, Sakamoto, superabounds over what it takes to be the chef d'oeuvre of all characters, a resounding existence amongst those who don\u2019t exist, in an even more resounding, deafness-impelling, heaven-shattering pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance that goes by the splendid title: Sakamoto desu-ga?\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s quite simple, especially for a thoughtful Solomon who would scrutinize and deeply consider the 2nd last, 6th and 6th last letter of every title of every anime before concluding on a score, to assign Sakamoto desu-ga an objective semblance of pure perfection. While the masses do revere icons and symbols of divinity, others of heuristic agnosticism, few can appreciate the enrapturing coalescence of the two. Such is the misappropriation of the essence and cachet withheld by some for Sakamoto desu-ga. Allow me to hereby inscribe the holy scripture of seraphic diagnosis with respect to Sakamoto, and why any of this information should be not be reprised. \\n\\n\r\ni) Story - Simple, yet revolutionary\\n\r\nConsign GTO\u2019s Onizuka Eikichi and his biker-educational-reformation to oblivion. It\u2019s a simple explanation in real life, really: Panty and Male equals to, well, Jail. Forget One Punch Man\u2019s Saitama just like how everyone he\u2019s saved belittles his bald existence. You\u2019d be fighting incredulous monsters every second and be damned to well, a bald existence. \\n\r\nThis story\u2019s premise doesn\u2019t stink with excessive quixotical nihilism, or a spectrally-antithetical cosmic flamboyance, nor is it ostentatious in budget-cramped explosions or drenched in senseless sexual innuendo. \\n\r\nInstead, this story presents that of one we have all experienced, through sweat and tears, through journeying a school life so mundane and arduous, through all those lonely and embarrassing moments, and to this day we still ponder what had ruined it all. That\u2019s right, the omission of a Sakamoto in our lives. Someone, who epitomizes vigor, strength and intellect, that inspires and unbounds the coolness deep within our own individuality. With the absence of such a character, our stories were tasteless, and this story, just like ours had been, would be so too, with a convolution of archetypical dense leads as dense as lead, busty brainless \u201csupports\u201d, conventional franchise-driven, product-advertising, cash-grabbing studios dragging sideways an unrealistic rendition of what COULD have happened in our youths, hence pandering to the lowest, albeit commonly sought-after pubescent demographic. Lay everything bare with your eyes, and you\u2019ll see how all this dirt and grime have long since insidiously buried the savior to all this banality, the deity and student of class 1-2, Sakamoto, and how HE truly deserves to lead us back to a path of greatness that anime has long since been led astray.\\n\r\nThis story, is how it all begins. \\n\\n\r\nii) Characters - Sheer, harmonic opulence\\n\r\nWhy have characters when there are no characters at all? With the respectable, sensible judgment upheld by numerous veteran critics, the characters of animes in vogue are plethorically referred to as \u201ccardboard cutouts\u201d, \u201clifeless\u201d, \u201cfictitious\u201d, \u201cnot-Sakamoto\u201d. There are no supporting characters in Sakamoto desu-ga, simply because Sakamoto himself supports everyone else. He never imposes; he does not instruct; he only exemplifies the genuity of coolness, and he blows both the animated plebeians and you away with way more than whatever renewed apocalyptic jutsus in Naruto Shippuden are ever canonically capable of achieving. Sakamoto need not amateurish fillers, what for? He is filled to the brim with untainted swag, and instead of receiving fillers he fills everything around him with nothing but the truth. Critics lament and exhort producers and animators to fix their messed-up characters. Well then, Sakamoto\u2019s very much heard enough, so he fixes his own goddamn characters, he gives the very meaning to life as it should be, it\u2019s the raison d'\u00eatre of his existence. What else, then, are the characters in Sakamoto desu-ga but an ethereal assemblage of life itself, with all its beauty and flaws intact?\\n\\n\r\niii) Production - A team of legends\\n\r\nAnimation: Studio Deen\\n\r\nThe beginning of Sakamoto heralds what will be known as the timely Olympian peroration of Deen-animation jokes. \u201cDeenimation\u201d budget might have once been a joke. However, this very production itself, is factually no joke. Sakamoto visualized in motion picture spells an unequivocal merchandisable disaster for financially acclaimed studios such as Madhouse and ufotable; Sakamoto\u2019s rendition is simply too gorgeous, invoking too paradisiac an animation quality requirement for even the likes of so-called Unlimited Budget Works to sustain. Before Unlimited Sakamoto Works, everything else\u2019s reduced to a marginal and pathetic joke. \\n\\n\r\nDirector: Shinji Takamasu\\n\r\nSuperseding School Rumble, Gintama and Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, comes a man of wit almost as cool as Sakamoto himself. One can only admire his wisecracking craft as much as Sakamoto desu-ga is to be admired for its gag-propitiated comicality. Accordingly, I place utmost value on discerning the first, third last, seventh, fifth last and fourth letter of the names of every director before contrasting it to the former analysis of the very title of that anime. Naturally, you can barely even perceive how powerful this matchup is; what else, would Sakamoto be deserving of if not the best?\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting: Hikaru Midorikawa as Sakamoto\\n\r\nHeck, you might have watched Gintama, some Great Teacher Onizuka, maybe Code Geass, perhaps Angel Beats, or Fate/Zero, with an off-chance of Mononoke, and this guy\u2019s been in all of them and more. You\u2019ve probably never even heard of him, he\u2019s never been in the spotlight, but now that \u201csupporting role\u201d entirety is gonna change. As Sakamoto himself, he holds nothing less than the God\u2019s Tongue and the voice of heaven, auralizing an indescribably lustrous overtone that defines perfection. What more can you ask for? Beethoven? That's on appallingly divergent levels. Sakamoto\u2019s voice entails the ascension of every composed and uncomposed orchestral symphonic masterpiece to date. Right here, it\u2019s Sakamoto Flows In You. Beethoven, on the other hand, has long since been decomposing. \\n\\n\r\nOpening/Ending Songs by Customi Z and Suneohair:\\n\r\n22 times. That\u2019s the total number of different stances that Sakamoto has stylishly taken in the opening sequence, COOLEST. It\u2019s almost as if the song was made just for Sakamoto. Can you believe that? Simply amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nUnabridged and sporting a melancholic transience, Suneohair\u2019s exemplar of an ending song is contemporary to that of an angel\u2019s hymn. With luster and class, Sakamoto is splashed with an aural paint of sublimity in an everlasting interlude between his work days of delivering more COOL to the mortal realm and heightening levels of SPECIAL in the progression of civilization. In the lateness of day, even the sun begins to shy away from overexposure to Sakamoto\u2019s dignified existence. It is thanks to this hymn in great taste, that we can observe Sakamoto in his natural habitat, partaking in elegant recreation alongside a beauteous sunset. \\n\\n\r\niv) Ultimatum\\n\r\nShould you watch Sakamoto desu-ga?\\n\r\nI am afraid I would have to say no. \\n\r\nIt is beyond tangible excruciation for me at this point of writing to even delineate the consequences of watching the first episode of Sakamoto desu-ga, which include: \\n\r\n1)\tSentience\\n\r\n2)\tAdmiration\\n\r\n3)\tKiller moves\\n\r\n4)\tAnother reason to watch Sakamoto\\n\r\n5)\tMacrocosmic indulgence\\n\r\n6)\tObstruction of negativity\\n\r\n7)\tTitular charisma\\n\r\n8)\tOver-the-top greatness\\n\r\nVery much 8 tragic mortal weaknesses, withal the 8 tenacious symptoms of perfection. \\n\r\nShould you be slightly confused or bewildered at this point, I greatly sympathize with the below philosophical postulation:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cDo you think God stays in heaven because he, too, lives in fear of what he has created here on Earth?\u201d\\n\r\n-Robert Rodriguez\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto however, parades the mortal realm with no fear of himself. \\n\r\nUndoubtedly, you should fear and stray away from such an absurdly brilliant creation. You should fear perfection, when perfection perfectly clones itself and stares at it like it\u2019s nothing.\\n\\n\r\nUnless, you, are different?\\n\r\nMight you have actually embraced the abstraction altogether, pieced en masse the very construct of valuation and grasped perfection since the start, from the very first moment?\\n\r\nNo, how could this be?? \\n\r\nWho.. are you?\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n~\\n\r\nHaven't you heard? I'm Sakamoto\\n",

            "content": "Long before my life on this earth began, my family's lineage has been devoted to studying and teaching the ancient manuscript of Swag: a primordial order committed to deciphering the body's hidden aura, in an attempt to understand what makes some people \"Da COOLEST.\" As per custom, this responsibility is passed on to the next of kin, and in order to uphold this age-old tradition, my long rigorous undertaking of Swag began.\r\nThrough the deepest depths of the Amazon rainforest and the scorching heat of the Sahara desert, I traversed the lands in search of answers. Learning the forbidden tapestry of the Maasai tribe, as wellas dedicating 5 years of discipleship to the Caribs and Arawaks natives of Trinidad, I've gathered up enough information through extensive research and careful analysis to finally end this ancestral task. And so, after much deliberation, I've come to the conclusion that Sakamoto is, without dispute, the swaggiest character in all the land.\\n\\n\r\nSWAGMOTO (often misspelled as \"Sakamoto desu ga?\") or \"Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto\" in English, is the story of a Gary Stu maneuvering his way through high school, as he deals with the everyday pressures of growing up, as well as the burden that comes with having an excessive amount of swag and being absolutely fabulous. \\n\r\nWith no one else to turn to, Swagmoto is forced to carry this heavy burden of \"COOL\" all by his lonesome, constantly being pestered into appeasing lesser beings by humoring or aiding them in their daily dilemmas. He's a God among men, our Lord and savior sent from the heavens to guide the uncultured plebeians. And when he isn't indirectly seducing men, women and grown-ups alike, Swagmoto is teaching his fellow man life lessons in absurd ways that only a true SwagLord of his caliber is capable of doing. \\n\\n\r\nSakamoto is what happens when you take an observational approach to an overused trope, while also deciding to view it through a comedic lens. And in this case, the overused trope being examined is Mary Sue/Gary Stu characters. With portrayals that often border on the implausible due to the nature of these type of characters being flawless, Sakamoto purposely pushes pass the already thin threshold of practicality associated with them, to enter a realm beyond logic or reason. It exaggerates an archetype that's already exaggerated, to begin with, resulting in what would usually be seen as idealistic features and feats in any other show, into laughter inducing comedic mishaps. \\n\\n\r\nAny given episode sees the titular SwagLord modestly demonstrating his unparalleled COOLNESS in daily tasks at school and around his town, while also occasionally introducing other opposing characters that try to dethrone his position as the swaggiest character on campus. These naysayers often try desperately to outdo SwagJesus in some kind of task, only to have their plans backfire in their faces when his swag is proven to be 2COOL4them. And like everyone else that comes face to face with Swagdaddy, they too are assimilated into the fold as one of his disciples, admiring his fabulousness from afar, while desperately seeking out his attention and approval. \\n\\n\r\nThe story structure of Sakamoto is similar to that of comedies like Cromartie High School, but where that over-exaggerates the actions of high school delinquents, Sakamoto switches its focus to idealized characters. And while it should go without saying that comedy is highly subjective, it's still safe to say that if you like comedic stories with this kind of structure, then there's a good chance that you would find Sakamoto's offerings to be up to snuff. The protagonist's deadpan delivery, coupled with the range of reactions given by his peers, is the selling point of the show. But with no other offerings besides this joke, it doesn't take long for the misadventures of Swagmoto to border on lackluster. Like any other gag comedy with a central gimmick carrying it, there will come a point where the punchline doesn't hit as hard as it did before, and Sakamoto wasn't immune to this occurrence. \\n\\n\r\nA joke that's become par for the course runs the risk of growing dull. You could always spice it up with different scenarios, but when the core reasoning behind the joke remains the same, it ceases to deliver the same results after some time. This is usually why most comedy shows have something other than its signature style of humor to keep the viewer's attentiveness. With a limited repertoire of comedic quips and material to worth with, Sakamoto often found its level of impact fluctuating on regular intervals. And while the scenarios are different, the jokes all center around the same comedic gag, which of course is Sakamoto's unnervingly perfect execution of everything he does. \\n\r\nBut even when the show doesn't bring the laughs, you could still depend on Swagmoto to swoop in and save the day. If it doesn't hit its target on the first try, there's usually a follow-up attempt that does. This doesn't mean that our messiah was always successful at salvaging a dying joke, but his efforts did keep the show from becoming a chore to watch. With Jesus on your side, anything is possible. Even a measly comedic attempt is still capable of making you smile when Swagmoto is behind it. The Lord is truly great and worthy to be praised. \\n\\n\r\nAnother key feature of Sakamoto's sense of humor is just how upfront it is. It never feels mean-spirited about how it goes about masquerading any of these characters. Even when accounting for the fact that these type of characters presented are usually taken in a negative light. Mary Sue/Gary Stu characters are often detested by viewers, and rightfully so. Their presence usually indicates a sign of cheap writing on the creator's behalf. So when Sakamoto views this detracting feature as a glass half full, it opens up an avenue for a new look on the subject.  \\n\\n\r\nEven when Swagmoto appears to be giving someone the cold shoulder, in reality, he still has their best interest in mind. As stated by fellow reviewer RogerSmith2004, \"Even when the other person loses, they never actually lose. Their encounter with Sakamoto is always a beneficial one. By the end of the segment, no matter how crazy it may seem... Sakamoto, through some means, helps them out.\" The lighthearted nature of Sakamoto gave the show a feel-good quality about it. It was ever-pleasant and always endearing, making it one of my favorite entries from 2016's Spring season.   \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the potency of his swag, many often found themselves enraptured by SwagLord's presence. I found myself being one of those people. Just the memes and inside jokes the show generated around it kept me entertained. I couldn't scroll through a Sakamoto comment section without busting out in a fit of laughter. This saying nothing about the show itself, which constantly had me tearing up with just how funny it was. While the only progression that happened was him winning over the characters introduced one by one, I was never bored by it. No, the jokes weren't always as funny. No, it isn't going to be funny for everyone. But for my personal experience, Sakamoto was a title I looked forward to every week. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile the run-on joke didn't always remain fresh, there was certainly enough moments of comedic brilliance that kept the show afloat. As you would expect, it didn't take long before the shortcomings of basing an entire show around a Gary Stu to quickly become apparent. Even with that being said, it doesn't take away the moments when the show delivered a comedic home run. Had it been given a longer run-time, it would have inevitably crumbled under its own weight. Sakamoto was a novelty act that narrowly avoided mediocrity status, thanks to the antics of the titular character. Every time I thought the show finally ran its course, it was immediately saved by Swagmoto and some new absurd life lesson. And honestly, how could I not love SwagLord? He made me a believer. PRAISE HIM, PRAISE SWAGJESUS! And for those readers that haven't experience the bountiful blessings of our Lord and savior, I implore you to seek him out, for he is worthy to be praise. Amen. \\n",

If you watched the first 3 episodes, whether you liked it or not, you've seen everything the show can offer.\r\nThere is no story, no characters, just Sakamoto swagging around, overcomes his opponents effortlessly. It becomes repetitive and boring real quick. There are some minor plot twists in every one or two episodes, when you along the rest of the cast thinks Sakamoto doing something extraordinary, but it turns out, it's just a regular thing, like making noise or hail a taxi. It's creative and funny, at least the first 2 or 3 times, butnot enough. The sound and music are decent, fits to the series, but that's all. There is literally nothing to talk about this series because it's completely blank.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end the biggest flaw of the series is that how flawless the main character is. There is no excitement, no tension and the blunt jokes couldn't keep up my attention. It's bad show and a boring which is one a mistake a comedy series can not afford to make.",

            "content": "Sometimes, A show comes along with one Character who can do Everything Right and thus is perfect an all Categories.\r\nThat kind of Character is what most ppl Including me Call an \"Gary Stu\" if the character is a male character or \"Mary Sue\" if the character is a Female.\r\nThese Characters however for me more often Transform into Characters who are so poorly written that they might have been written by a person who only has 5 seconds to Create a character because said person is a bit to lazy al while having no Idea what a Human is.\r\nThey are Mostly poorly written because, well Theyare to perfect for the Situation where the show takes place in because Most of the Situations Rely on Tension \"will Character X survive or win?\" and that Tension is just gone when I know that the Character is Perfect or has Gary stu plot Armour.\\n\r\nI like Characters who have Clear mistakes like a Ninja who is poorly skilled in Ninjitsu and the art of Silence or A guy who made Mistakes in his past which Costed him a arm and a leg.\\n\r\nI like these Characters because I can see them Grow and overcome their Flaws.\\n\r\nWith Gary Stus, I hardly see them overcome their flaws because They \"OFCOURSE!\" have no Flaws to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nSo can a Gary Stu character work Good in a show?\\n\r\nWell, it can as long as that character either is:\\n\r\n1. a Interesting and Compelling Character to me who Actually Grows and Develops\\n\r\n2. Introduced as Perfect but then starts making Mistakes as the shows on\\n\r\nor\\n\r\n3. a Character who is in a show which clearly Ridicules that type of Character/Makes jokes surrounding his/her perfection in such a way that the show is at least Fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHere Enters \"Sakamoto Desu ga?\" with the Character of Sakamoto, or as we call him Swagamoto because he is \"Cooler\" but in most cases \"Coolest\".\\n\r\nHis Character basically Screams out \"GARY STUUUU!\" because he is so Perfect,\\n\r\nWhile all the other Characters just Bask in his glory.\\n\r\nSo did the Show do the 3 things I mentioned earlier?\\n\r\nWell it only did the 3rd one and then Fully embraced it like it should.\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto desu ga? is an episodic show where Every episode is Actually 2 episodes spread over 24 Minutes equally.\\n\r\nin each episode, Swagamoto has to put up with Other students who (Like me) Dislike Gary Stu Characters or Help out fellow Students who need his help Resulting in him Getting into Various Situations where his Perfection is Needed.\\n\r\nThese Situations work very well with Swagamoto's perfection which then Results in Comedic High-jinx.\\n\r\nI like that kind of humor because it is Just Ridiculous, makes fun of my most hated Arch-type the Gary Stu and Above all, is Actually Funny in my Opinion.\\n\r\nHowever, these kinds of Situations are putting the Side Characters at the Background while Sakamoto is perfectly in the spotlights and they don't get much screen-time and they are Just average students and nothing more just like Students are in Reality Minus the Animeness which is sad because they could have been Interesting characters.\\n\r\nHowever, I See the train of thought of these Characters, like they were Observing Sakamoto Just like I the watcher was Observing him. The side Characters are also more of a Main characters in The skits that involve them and Sakamoto, Making Sakamoto more of a Side Character while he is The main character because I see the Story through the eyes of the Side Characters.\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto desu ga? is Clearly a Comedy Show that Looks Nicely Animated for that type of show and just Makes fun of Swagamoto's Ridiculus perfection and the Character of Swagamoto Could not work if the Show was not a Comedy but something else instead like an Serious Action show Because well You might know why.\\n\\n\r\nBut the wonders of Comedy shows is that it is already Considered Enjoyabe if just the Jokes alone are funny Because Comedy to me just has to Rely on being funny.\\n\r\nand That is what Sakamoto desu ga is, A really funny show.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you are looking For a good laugh then at least check out this show.\\n\r\nI can guarantee you that it will at least make you laugh once or many times.\\n\\n\r\nI give this Comedic show at this point, an well Deserved 8 (score might change overtime because it is still airing)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI haven't reviewed something in a long time so I might have made some pretty Critical errors so feel free to point them out in my Face at my profile if you want to.\\n\\n\r\nHave a Nice day Readers",

It has a cool guy named Sakamoto who swags his way through every situation he\u2019s ever faced with.\r\nCharacters are made interesting through their complexity, with them coming to deal with their flaws, accept them and improve upon them where they can. That\u2019s what makes an interesting and complex storyline.\r\nIn a lot of ways, Sakamoto Desu Ga? is the One Punch Man of school-life anime. One Punch Man is about a hero named Saitama who destroys every enemy he faces with one punch and zero effort.\r\nSakamoto Desu Ga? is about a kidnamed Sakamoto who has similar results against his foes. But instead of fighting giant monsters, he\u2019s going up against school bullies and manipulative girls.\\n\\n\r\nAnd instead of defeating them with a punch, he defeats them with sheer charm and charisma.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by \u201cdefeat,\u201d I mean \u201cmake them like him and also make them better people overall in the process\\n\\n\r\nThe really impressive thing about Sakamoto Desu Ga? so far is the ability it has to take a simple concept and keep it fresh in a number of situations.\\n\\n\r\nThe negative thing about the anime is that there is no character development, no plot development. Each episode basically just sums up the same way: \u201cSomeone is going to try to make Sakamoto look bad, let\u2019s see how it ultimately backfires and makes him look way cooler.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n Despite all this, it\u2019s so weird and quirky that it\u2019s ultimately still quite enjoyable. Despite it just featuring the same gag, playing out in different ways, it\u2019s still a ton of fun. That\u2019s incredibly impressive to me, and speaks to the quality of the gag. But I have to wonder just how long it can keep up.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters in the series are practically non-existent. The few that are recurring aren\u2019t especially interesting, even down to their names. such as :\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s \u201cpopular girl who tries to seduce Sakamoto for the sake of status, but keeps getting hilariously foiled.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t list all of the  names, because honestly, they\u2019re not important to the series. Sakamoto Desu Ga? is a one-man show, and the other characters are little more than props to further the legend of Sakamoto.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEven the opening credits feature all of exactly one character.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to see Sakamoto Desu Ga? is made on a budget. The very first episode opens with a wide shot of three guys tossing a volleyball around in the school yard in the most minimal, circular animation imaginable.\\n\\n\r\nThe action sequences rely heavily on dressed-up still shots, simple circular animation patterns, and motion blur. They do a good job of hiding the lack of funding where they can, but suffice to say there aren\u2019t any sequences that are going to leave you slack-jawed in awe and appreciation.\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nEpisode 6 was really terrible due to the fact that Sakamoto and three kids was walking in a white line which took most of the time consumption on the episode which was rough about 10minutes \"WASTED\" footage. This episode really lacked being entertaining aswell being enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all: \\n\r\nAnimation: 5/6\\n\r\nCharacter development : 3\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/5\\n\r\nOverall : 4\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review if you got this far and i hope you found it useful and take in ideas on what is to come when you watch this series.",

            "content": "\"And on that day, no fucks were given... only swag\".\r\nMake room for our new lord and savior... Sakamoto. Despite how much I enjoyed Sakamoto desu ga? I can fully understand this anime is not for everyone. However, I love comedy shows that don't take themselves seriously. Sakamoto took a similar approach to Nichijou in the fact that it didn't give a shit. It wasn't trying to cater towards a specific category of viewer and stuck to its repetitive yet effective style of humor, with its over exaggeration of daily, normal events. In doing so, it became the unsung hero of the season for me, andmade me appreciate the whimsical side of normalcy. For now, despite whether or not you agree with me, depress your mute button and let me explain Sakamoto's greatness to you.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes less is more, and I couldn't think of a better phrase to sum up this show. Sakamoto desu ga? flew onto the scene this season headed by the well known director, Shinji Takamatsu (Gintama, School Rumble). The setting is simple, a standard Japanese high school with your pranksters, babes and nerds. But what makes this high school different is that it's enrolled the embodiment of perfection that is Sakamoto. He's tall dark and handsome, and can do no wrong. He performs every task quickly and concisely, emulating a smirk that would drop panties from a mile away. Whether he's an alien or robot doesn't really matter, since it would only add confirmation to the ridiculousness that this anime contains. Countless people wish to disrupt Sakamoto's greatness for one reason or another but constantly fail in doing so. The methods in which their feeble attempts are vanquished always seem to have me rolling. One minute Sakamoto is fighting a bee with a protractor and the next he's attacking people with soft drinks. The \"Secret Techniques\" employed in some episodes were a riot, most specifically the ones in the adult video episode. Some of those scenes were pure comedic gold. The important thing to remember here is that Sakamoto desu ga? was produced on a rather low budget, and although it doesn't do many things, what it does it nails. It truly embodies greatness through simplicity.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing Sakamoto does well is the accurate transposition of its source material. If you're anything like me (being a primary anime viewer), you get tired of the phrase \"oh, that's not how it is in the manga!\" So when an adaptation executes well and I don't have to hear that talk, everyone is happy. Well done Studio Deen! They've been responsible for some rather big budget titles over the years (Fate series etc.), so to see them succeed with something on the contrary is impressive. With some anime the season, I went into each episode unaware of what I was going to get. Since I watched the series as it aired, I'm looking for something consistent that will bring me back excited each week. By the end of the first four or five episodes of Sakamoto, I sort of knew what to expect from it every Saturday. If I don't have the luxury of binge watching it, give me something to look forward to in each episode!\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly to the comedy, the negatives in Sakamoto are mostly preferential. For cultural reasons there were some jokes that went over my head but didn't necessarily deter me from finding them amusing. Also, episode six was an absolute bore. Watching a bunch of kids follow Sakamoto down a white line for 10+ minutes is not my idea of a good time. The elicit one-sided love affair with Sakamoto's friend's mom kind of made me nauseous at times. Fortunately enough, Sakamoto's tireless acts of evading countered my disgusted emotions quite well. As much as I hate to say it, this series could fall flat at times which probably hindered it from being an 8/10 for me. As previously stated, I can understand why people don't like the show. I can usually find most comedy styles humorous in anime, but slapstick and stupid humor are some of my favorite sub-genres. And although most of the jokes were way out of left field, instead of getting the forced vibe I did accept it as commonplace given Sakamoto's flawless behavior. Non-comedy fans may not \"get\" Sakamoto, and that's fine.  This show was not geared towards everyone's perspective of what qualifies as funny. I do admit, even as someone who is a fan of this comedy style, I could feel myself losing interest in the last two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, Sakamoto is really the only thing that matters in this show.  Sure, there are supportive cast mates strewn about, but none of them really make or break the show.  Our lord and savior, Sakamoto sweats perfection, and makes even the manliest of men blush with a mere smile.  Sometimes I'm not sure if I should laugh or be entirely creeped out by some of the character's reactions to Sakamoto's escapades.... But I'm not sure that it makes any difference.  There has been a debate among the forums of whether he's an alien or not. Again, the over-analytic approach some anime fans have grown accustomed to will not translate well into this show.  Coming from a reasonable critic, shut your brain off while watching this series and just enjoy the senseless comedy. Sakamoto is sort of a one trick pony, so there really isn't much development in him, and there weren't any instances of internal monologue or breaking the fourth wall.  I think adding too much or maybe any development to his character would've been detrimental to the show's atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't anything special in Sakamoto desu ga? Any slightly seasoned anime fan could notice the show's lower budget in its art.  Aside from the OP, there aren't many instances of bright or vivid color schemes, and the character models are dull and slightly cloned (although you could argue that this was intentional). I did find the students who were drawn to look like they were in their 20's or 30's rather amusing, even more evidence that the writers didn't take the show seriously.  The backgrounds are often recycled and bland, but in an anime mostly shown in a school, you can't expect much else.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP as mentioned above was my favorite of the season.  The small animations were all to accentuate Sakamoto's greatness, and the music was powerful and triumphant.  I loved watching the various props he'd use to sing with or use as musical instruments.  The ED was a calming way to end the comedy from each episode, and it grew on me the longer I watched the series.  The rest of the soundtrack consisted of a couple of recycled songs, most notably the ditty that played prior to each time Sakamoto swooped in doing something mesmerizing. I enjoyed it every time. Sakamoto's voice actor, Hikaru Midorikawa was quite brilliant in his classy portrayal.  Kubota, played by Akira Ishida, was phenomenal.  He was a large reason the character gave off such a creepy vibe.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to be fair, Sakamoto desu ga was the anime of the season for me.  Its inflated representation of the \"perfect\" guy at school made me laugh constantly, and there was no way I could guess what he would do next.  This anime is certainly not for everyone, and my score is entirely dependent on my preference.  I'd recommend Sakamoto to fans of shows like Nichijou, Gintama or Chromartie High School, but if you're not a fan of mindless comedy I'd stay away.  Unlike its main protagonist, it's not perfect by any means, and sometimes ventures too far to get a laugh, but overall I found it to be highly enjoyable.  As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out the rest of my Spring 2016 reviews!\\n",

            "content": "This is truly a horrible anime. This thing barely worked in manga format because you could read it quickly(and even THEN you tired after 5 chapters when the novelty wore off because it was just a repeat thing with no jokes or anything every damn chapter, while the latter half was barely worth reading despite only having a few chapters over 20), but when it's endlessly dragged out in anime format and no new parts or innovations which adds to the experience? Yeah, you have a dreadful or even pathetic piece of crap that you just shouldn't waste your time watching.\r\nThis anime has pathetic characters,pathetic story and offers ridiculously low amounts of enjoyment. You might even go minus on the enjoyment part and just wish to kill yourself while watching this. It might be slightly better if you haven't read the manga, but I don't see this thing being worthy of anything above 3 stars even then.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the side characters have any soul or special part about them, at most they're all kind of obnoxious. The whole thing is just about sakamoto showing that he's got a bigger d*ck than anyone else and amaze everyone with his rather impossible actions as he flawlessly avoids every possibly negative thing for himself, dumbfounding people over and over again. This is all this anime is. Sakamoto isn't even interesting as a character, just like in the manga, he's a soulless shell with no clear emotions, no goals and no parts that stand out other than the fact that he can't be screwed over because he's so \"amazing\". We don't know who he is, we don't know what he is, we don't know his real goals, we don't know what he feels about anything. How could such a character be likable, especially when he needs to prop up the show by himself since none of the side-characters have anything to offer other than being retarded and way too eager to kiss his arse?\\n\\n\r\nJust spare yourself from the frustration and never, ever watch this. If you really feel like you want to know what is going on, read the manga instead, it's much faster and way more enjoyable thanks to that. Nothing really happens in the anime that doesn't happen in the manga anyway.",

            "content": "This is gay? No, it's Sakamoto. An epic comedy anime that I will never forget. I don't know how much I am watching over and laugh at each episode. The anime will always leave a memorable moment after watching.\r\nSakamoto. Sakamoto. Sakamoto. Popular guy in the school, if generally popular guy has a cold nature, arrogant and confident high level. Sakamoto give the other side of the 'cool guy'. Are cool synonymous with luxurious appearance? Stylish? Or do things differently?\r\nNo, Sakamoto give the other colors of the term \"cool\" itself. By becoming a popular guy in school, of course like that is predictable, \"they will behated or harassed by people who don't like it\". Cliche, but that the different is how the mangaka bring the story becomes more interesting and spices comedy is enough to make you surprised, smiled strangely even laugh out loud. Boring story? Don't worry, there are times where there will be a change in the story. But don't expect the conflict is complicated, this anime doesn't say so.\\n\\n\r\nThe major point of this anime is flamboyant and elegant nature of Sakamoto himself. Even so, he ended up just a simple man. I was quite touched by the scene where she was feeding the baby bird in the school hallway. It made me think, we will not know what Sakamoto do with things that are going on around him. Unpredictable and he's always doing a scene that is enough to make me wonder. But this anime attract enough women (in my estimation), because he was handsome, and if he has shown a cool side, maybe not just me, I'm always laughing loudly and shouting at the same time. *fangirls mode*\\n\r\nIn addition, talk about other characters in this anime. Not bad. Many of the characters are popping up with oddities that support the story.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, most men would complain or feel disgusted when watching this one. But no, this is what makes this anime is different. I am very satisfied with Studio Deen who produce this, due to the art style, this is the advantage of this studio. Not easy to find manga that will be used as anime. The taste of Studio Deen is able to provide a spectacle that will attract the attention of many people. Even from surveys that have been done, it's become the number one popular anime in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is my number one this season. Because epic, funny and exciting. Why is this anime? Is not there anything else? Yes, probably from the effects, coloring and everything is different from Re: zero or Kabaneri which is the top anime this season. I'm not saying it was bad anime, but maybe I prefer this anime. But I also can't say if Sakamoto has cuteness level with Gintama. No, they have their own proportions, you can't discriminate.\\n\\n\r\nFor the opening song is very cool. If usually and mostly I was always pressing the \"Skip\" button on the screen and directly into stories. Different with this one, I don't do what I used to do! Synopsis of the narrator, passionate songs, lyrics, and an opening-colored. Make this opening song became my favorite. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, a brief message: \"Be cool, cooler, coolest like Sakamoto\".\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10\\n",

For the students at Gakubun Prefectural High School the answer would most definitely be \"Sakamoto.\" \r\n\"Sakamoto desu ga?\" is an anime which focuses around our main character Sakamoto. The niche of this anime is that Sakamoto is the coolest guy around; always figuring out the best answer to any given situation. Now, the plot of this show may not seem extraordinary, nor do I proclaim it to be; but the show manages to grasp your attention with it's own unique style. This showcouples easy to follow scenes with a nice jazz-styled OST to create a calming vibe. The anime does a perfect job of creating an atmosphere where the viewer has time to sit back and unwind. \\n\\n\r\nTo follow, there's another element of the show that I felt made it worth watching. The show inspires you. Sakamoto throughout the duration of the series always manages to find the best answers to even the trickiest situations; a trait which is inspiring and admirable. Watching Sakamoto pull off the feats that he does leaves the viewer with a sense of wanting to do the same in their own lives. It gives you the initiative to live like Sakamoto, without fear or regret, finding the best answer to all questions; which I feel alone is enough to make the anime enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nTo add to the inspiring atmosphere that the show creates there's also the comedy, which of course is meant to be the focal point of the show. The comedy wasn't phenomenal, but there were very few points in the show where I was not laughing or at least cracking a smile. The anime does not pull off too many hysterical jokes (that's not to say there aren't any), but it does pull off consistent quality ones; a feat which will leave you happy and laughing throughout each episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST, I have to mention, is also very well done. The aesthetic of the music develops a calming and fanciful environment in which we can watch each character live their life. The OST is truly fitting of the anime's genre and purpose; and for that I must give it high regards. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very-well done, surprisingly so for a show that doesn't involve any extensive fight scenes or breath-taking scenery. There was even a \"fight scene\" at one point during the show that was animated better than some of the big fights I've seen in animes with extensive budgets - that, to me, says a lot about the quality of the work that went into the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe only downfall I'd have to mention about the anime is there's no evident story-line to follow. If you're a sucker for a good story, then this anime may not intrigue you. The purpose of the show is to follow the comical school life of the coolest guy you may ever know, Sakamoto; but at the same time that's all it is. There is not meant to be a story to follow simply because that's how the show was constructed. There is, however, a small underlying plot device that defines the show and is the reason I am giving it such a high mark. This underlying plot device is hinted at in the anime itself, and I will make a point not to spoil it here. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude this review; I hold \"Sakamoto desu ga?\" in high regards and I loved sitting down to watch the show each week. It's relaxing, fun, consistently funny, and a great show for anyone who wants to unwind and laugh. I would definitely recommend this anime.",

He lives in a world of style, cool, and swag. Every movement he does is bleeding cool. Sakamoto does not live in a world... The world IS Sakamoto. Sakamoto makes our lives have so much more meaning. Sakamoto helps us through tears and sorrow.\r\nSakamoto-kun does not fear the trials and tribulations ahead.\r\nRather, they fear him.\r\nSakamoto inspires in all of us a desire to better a situation, no matter how tough. \r\nSakamoto-kun is the story.\r\nSakamoto-kun isthe world.\\n\r\nSakamoto-kun is... Cool.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto-kun was only made possible by a team of godly animators. Why is that? Because Sakamoto-kun is our master, and our master only invokes the gods of animation themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is that of a heavenly angelic chorus singing to us from the heavens. Only the most ultimate forms of swag are invoked in these timeless pieces. Bach and Beethoven quake with awe in the presence of Sakamoto's beautiful chorus.\\n\r\nSakamoto's muse clearly states in the opening how... Cool... Cooler... COOLEST this godlike entertainment is, with the ending song bringing the audience to tears once the perfection that is the \"episodes\" of the show ends.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is only that of top-dollar actors. Sakamoto's voice actor has reached his heavenly ascension through his role as the physical embodiment of our master, Sakamoto-kun, which is of course a joyous occasion for all of the human race as we all wish to reach enlightenment through Sakamoto-kun.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nOur cast of characters are all very likeable as they are all faithful followers of our Sakamoto-kun. The audience is moved to tears while watching our wonderful leader Sakamoto help our poor souls reach enlightenment through his ways. \\n\r\nHowever, I am afraid I cannot grade the perfection itself that is Sakamoto-kun himself.\\n\r\nHe is untouchable.\\n\r\nHe is swag.\\n\r\nHe is cool... Cooler... COOLEST!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nWatching Sakamoto and his pure, utter perfection at everything happen in motion will bring anyone to tears of joy. Sakamoto is perfect. We are not worthy to be in his presence, however he has made it so, bringing pure enjoyment to everyone who witnesses.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nI do not believe that I am worthy enough to describe how perfect Sakamoto is.\\n\r\nSakamoto should be witnessed and followed by every being.\\n\r\nSakamoto is cool\\n\r\nCooler\\n\r\nCOOLEST!\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nIn all seriousness this show is pretty great. Go watch it.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI would not consider myself a cool person. Nerdy, sure. Handsome, why not. (At least, that\u2019s what my grandmother tells me whenever I see her.) But not cool.\r\nI\u2019m not even kidding. Snowboarding is probably my coolest trait, and, even then, I cannot perform any tricks off ramps or rails for fear of hurting myself unnecessarily. (Falling on my bum is enough pain for me).\r\nAlthough, after watching Sakamoto desu ga?, I may not be as uncool as I once thought.\r\nSTORY\r\nSakamoto has only one star: Sakamoto. In short, he is beyond stylish. And that\u2019s what the animealmost exclusively focuses on. For twelve straight episodes, Sakamoto (the show) proves why Sakamoto (the man) is the coolest dude to ever live.\\n\\n\r\nHe doesn\u2019t just play an arcade whack-a-mole game; he plays Bach as he hits the different heads.\\n\\n\r\nHe gets himself sent out into the hall while in class \u2013 to feed and protect a dying baby sparrow.\\n\\n\r\nHe picks up a girl\u2019s eraser, uses it furiously, then gives it back, allowing the girl to calm down her nerves and warm her hands from the heat created by the intense friction.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, there are way too many instances to list because, to reiterate, the anime is literally all about Sakamoto being insanely cool ad infinitum. Which leads into the show\u2019s most arguable aspect: the main joke itself.\\n\\n\r\nOn the one hand, the audience always \u201cknows\u201d what\u2019s going to happen. It doesn\u2019t matter if the situation looks completely grim, if Sakamoto is doing something weird, or if nothing is happening at all. The show will make sure that the coolest guy ever is the coolest guy ever. In this way, the anime loses out on suspense and intrigue since the outcome is already \u201cknown\u201d beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, this joke is the whole point of the show. It\u2019s obvious that the anime will not be doing more than making Sakamoto out to be a cool cat, so it is almost unfair to expect anything else to happen. Plus, the anime does a nice job of spinning the mundane scenarios that Sakamoto finds himself in with crazy yet plausible coolness.\\n\\n\r\nDisregarding the contention of repetition, Sakamoto does choose to follow some questionable routes.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, the entire subplot with Fukase is odd. Having this antagonist appear way too late into the season is one issue, but it is his conclusion and relation that creates the biggest head-scratcher.\\n\\n\r\nAs has been mentioned many a time already, Sakamoto is an anime about a super-cool dude. By extension, it\u2019s also about how everyone else views him as cool, too. But not Fukase. He never actually concedes to Sakamoto\u2019s coolness, \u201closing\u201d by trickery and betrayal. In other words, the anime fails to fulfill its promise that Sakamoto is, in fact, the coolest dude around (to everybody else).\\n\\n\r\nThe show also has the problem of regressing on its already-finished outcomes. Characters that were helped, such as Atsushi and Yuuya, are affected by Sakamoto\u2019s cool aura, but the anime will later choose to have these same people go against Sakamoto again, removing the purpose or impact of their earlier interactions with the king of cool.\\n\\n\r\nAmbiguity in the ending also does not help the anime\u2019s execution. His leave comes out of nowhere, and his sentimental appeal is lost on the audience since he never really seemed to connect with any of the other students emotionally\\n\\n\r\nBut when all is said and done, Sakamoto has an underlying message that may not be clear since it is hidden behind the comedy and these problems.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, Sakamoto is no doubt a cool guy. But what makes him cool? Is it those quirky moves that he employs from time to time? Is it those girls that constantly flock around him? Is it his general demeanor?\\n\\n\r\nNo. It is none of those qualities.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s true that Sakamoto kicking a rock along a slanted ramp while defying gravity is cool. Him defeating one of the bigger punks of the school at a game of pushing sumo makes him cooler than most. But what makes him the coolest is his friendship with Kubota, his way of inspiring others to be better people, and his general sense of selflessness.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, what\u2019s coolest is being a genuinely good person. And that, if nothing else, makes the narrative a meaningful one.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nMuch of Sakamoto finds itself with mixed art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nArt-wise, the show succumbs to its boring setting. The school and nearby town do not lend themselves to immense creativity and, as a result, the anime fails to be captivating visually.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, it does what it can. Sakamoto\u2019s different \u201csecret techniques,\u201d such as \u201cSleepover PE\u201d or \u201cWind with No Destination (Straw Cigarette)\u201d, add some much-needed flair with sparkles, colors, and a display of words. Furthermore, a lot of Sakamoto\u2019s different actions are given better lighting, accentuating the \u201choliness\u201d that Sakamoto seems to exude.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs likewise meet a mixed fate. To be fair, they are what they should be: realistic, plain people. But they don\u2019t do much to appeal to the audience. The exception, of course, is Sakamoto. The mole near his eye, his toned physique, his proper outfit, his tallness, and his sharp features turn him into the attractive, cool man he is supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair again, the other characters are not without their own physical traits. Indeed, Kubota\u2019s squat face or Yuuya\u2019s big belly highlight Sakamoto\u2019s design that much more. But it is hard to see their designs as anything more than passable.\\n\\n\r\nActual-animation-wise, Sakamoto performs similarly. Perhaps obviously, the anime reserves most of its movement and resources for Sakamoto\u2019s various exploits. Jumping onto debris in a swift river, competing in a snowball fight, and parachuting out of a window using a makeshift device are just some the many events involving Sakamoto that get animated throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nMeaning, everyone who isn\u2019t Sakamoto has seen better days. Lots of streaky backgrounds, non-moving bodies, and general nuance (such as eye and hair shifts) are hardly seen from the side characters.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough even Sakamoto cannot evade the low-quality animation hammer. Cleaning the ceiling while avoiding the dust that falls is given multiple still shots to mirror movement, and creating centrifugal wind through a video-rental store sees a similar effect. These examples, however, can be forgiven since they are used for cool, comedic effect.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not a whole lot to say about Sakamoto\u2019s characters. And this void leads to both intentional and unintentional outcomes.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the side characters first, they are more or less a single trait, missing out on characterization let alone development. Kubota is the loner. Kakuta is the mean teacher. Kuronuma is the popular girl. And so on and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nTheir singular purpose is to demonstrate that Sakamoto cannot be phased, cannot be thrown for a loop, and cannot be anything but cool.\\n\\n\r\nWhich works. It\u2019s fun seeing Sakamoto one-up the college students, and it\u2019s hilarious to watch the mean ring-leader unable to cope with Sakamoto\u2019s insane attention to servitude.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the anime pays a price for only having its side cast exist under the same category: severely unengaging personalities. They simply lack the necessary intrigue to make them worthwhile characters \u2013 both for the audience and for the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Sakamoto, surprisingly, next to nothing is given about him. Kubota even makes a comment about this \u2013 that he barely inquired about the coolest dude in the world. Because he didn\u2019t, the audience likewise knows very little about Sakamoto. His family. His interests. His overall feelings as a person. Nothing is given.\\n\\n\r\nThis lack of information creates mystery surrounding his origins and self in general, fueling his cool flame further. Plus, the adage \u201cactions speak louder than words\u201d work wonders here to visually demonstrate who and what makes up Sakamoto.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other tidbit about the characters that could be said is through the reversal in their juxtaposition.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate, almost all the side characters exist to make Sakamoto look cool. Simultaneously, Sakamoto exists to make the side characters also look cool.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Sakamoto using his \u201cgun\u201d to diffuse the balloon situation allows the two male students who framed him to reveal their true feelings. Another example is Sakamoto taking the time to not only serve as Hayabusa\u2019s arms and legs but also to act as the face-forward decoy. Yet another example is Yuuya undressing himself to take embarrassment away from Yagi after his shoelace-tying plan against Sakamoto worked a little too well.\\n\\n\r\nIn this way, the anime is essentially expressing the notion that everyone can be cool. Obviously, nobody can be as cool as Sakamoto, but, after what they see of him, how they are affected by him, it becomes clear that being cool is not just reserved for the NASA-aspiring man.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nArguably speaking, the opening track of Sakamoto is its strongest facet. The triumphant tone of the piece, created by the resounding drums and loud guitar, fits easily amidst the triumph that Sakamoto so regularly champions. The chanting of \u201ccooler, coolest\u201d, the rising lyrics in the middle, and the overall catchiness of the piece make it a (appropriate enough) cool OP.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track should not be overlooked, however, for it is just as strong of a song. The slow, calm pacing contrasts with the OP but coincides with many parts of the anime. Because coolness, both in action and in name, entails a sense of chill. The vocalist does well, and, once again, the track is quite catchy (and fun to whistle to), so the ED ends up as another solid addition to the musical lineup.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the original soundtrack is unlike the OP and the ED in that the tracks themselves are not all that interesting. But they do follow the main motif of the show: coolness. Lots of jazzy tracks and rich tunes, filled with saxophones, trumpets, wind instruments galore, inject even more coolness into the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, voice acting sees no notable performances except for perhaps Hikaru Midorikawa as Sakamoto and Akira Ishida as Kubota. While neither of them have any stand-out moments, the former\u2019s composed delivery and the latter\u2019s nasally voice fit their respective characters well.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhile the repetition in the joke was evident, I never felt as though it were an issue.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, I was laughing at the silliness of it all. Sakamoto riding a mop-and-bin like a Segway. All the girls during art class rushing to get near his side to draw and be drawn by him. The insane ability for him to create subliminal effects in fractions of a fraction of a second. Yes, it was \u201call the same,\u201d but I still smiled regardless.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t all smiles. I do wish there was more to Sakamoto than what was given. Maybe exploring that romance angle or maybe showing more of his thoughts in general. To be fair, having him end up with anyone would, in some sense, take away part of his coolness, and monologuing would defeat the surprise in the solutions he comes up with. But I still would have liked to have seen more.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest gripe, however, was Kubota\u2019s mom. Simply put, I was not a fan. At all. She was a creepy character who got too much screen time (time that could have been used to introduce another new person instead) for my liking.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, she wasn\u2019t enough on her own to completely take away how entertaining it was to see these slice-of-life moments taken to the \u201cextreme.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto desu ga? gives an answer to its question. The story\u2019s theme on coolness, the strong OP and ED, and the comedy itself are positives worth noting. But the lack of an interesting side cast, the low animation, and a certain mom are negatives also worth noting. Still, it\u2019s a cool time nonetheless (even without any snowboard tricks).\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, while problems exist in terms of the content and its delivery, the overall message on what is actually the coolest makes the show into more than just a comedic outing\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, mixed artistic direction, character designs, and actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, the side cast are severely unengaging, but Sakamoto\u2019s lack of details strangely helps, and the theme on everyone having the potential to be cool is not lost\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, good ED, okay OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, Kubota\u2019s mom was creepy, but the \u201cextreme\u201d slice-of-life events were still a lot of fun\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "What happens when you take a high school setting and add perfection itself, only second to God? Haven\u2019t you heard? Sakamoto happens. \r\nThis short but sweet comedy anime focuses on one gimmick only. Sakamoto being absolutely perfect in every situation, and his interactions with his classmates. It may seem like after some time, the anime loses its charm as the plot keeps on repeating, but fear not. The 12 episode limit keeps the pace steady. The story never gets boring or stale. Good soundtrack which incorporates jazz (obviously) keeps the anime smooth. The comedy is going to have you question \u201chow does Sakamoto get outof this one\u201d in second half of the anime. And it\u2019ll keep surprising you and make you laugh. A lot. My only complaint is that the show for me lacks rewatching value once you\u2019ll see how Sakamoto overcomes his situations in the most perfect manner possible. But for one time only it\u2019s a great ride. \\n\\n\r\nProduction remains good. Animation looks great. Only flaws I saw were some CGI shots later in the series but they are so brief that you have to search for them in order to find them. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is on point on the male side. The female side lacks a little but considering context of the show (females being mainly fangirls of Sakamoto and not having any MAJOR role in the story outside of trying to get his heart I can understand that producers weren\u2019t trying to have vast and diverse cast)\\n\\n\r\nBefore you\u2019ll know it, it\u2019s going to be over. So don\u2019t blink. You may miss some of this anime's awesomeness. \\n",

            "content": "Sakamoto Desu Ga is a gem that shines brilliantly in the Spring 2016 season. Its an amazing comedy that is definetly worth investing your time in. While I wasnt expecting much from this show Its become my favorite series of all time and one I highly reccomend\r\nSTORY: Sakamoto is the coolest kid at school who can do everything in the most stylish way possible. While the series follows Sakamoto but its really the story of how he helps everyone grow around him. Sakamoto Desu Ga is episodic and follows the narrative of hilarious short stories of everyone's interactions with Sakamoto. Wether his classmates are tryingto foil him or help him Sakamoto solves any problem often with the other chracter in that short story becoming a better person because of meeting Sakamoto. The story is amazingly creative in the everyday tasks Sakamoto and  co. face wether they're excorsizing a ghost, walking all over the town, or having a sumo match the show presents any task they face in the most hilarious way possible. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nART: The way you know if a series is well animated is if you dont notice the animation at all and it feels like a living breathing series. SDG does just that it's very well animated with its fluid motions and nice character design. The series isnt meant to be the most amazingly animated work of art like a Psycho Pass or Fate/Zero but it is very nice to look at, and the art especially shines whenever Sakamoto is on screen as the lighting is shown to portray Sakamoto as the Flashiest and most amazing person as possible and they easily succeed. The Sakamoto scenes can easily make you buy into the idea that Sakamoto is the coolest person alive because of how amazingly hes presented.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: The cast of Sakamoto is very large but offers a very memorable selection of them. I could be here all day talking about how amazing Sakamoto is and thats because I truly believe he is. Studio Deen goes out of their way to make Sakamoto the coolest whether it be their amazing visuals when hes on screen, the Suave music that always plays when hes around, or his amazing feats he is the best character of the series and is absolutely hilarious. Kubota sakamoto's sidekick is absolutey hilarious and serves as the kind of ugly sister to sakamoto. The Three delinquents always get into some mischief, Hayabousa is an absolute badass, Aina is a dual faced flirtatious psycho who is one of the many girls fawning over Sakamoto, Sera is just completely hilarous (ill come back to him in a second). These are all characters ive grown fond of in my 12 ep. run of SDG because they have human emotions and feel like people I could actually meet and be friends with and those are a limited number to not make this review too long. Sakamoto helps all these characters grow inderiectly and it is rewarding too see them do so. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The soundtrack is amazing and very Suave reflecting the feel of the series. From the high powered OP to the Cool soundtrack around Sakamoto the soundtrack. Yasuhiko Fukuda  gives a great OST  and im excited to see what he brings us in the future.\\n\\n\r\nCOMEDY: The series is hialrous and is always bringing a great sense of humor. If I had to compare how funny it is to other anime id say its up there with Gintama and Barakamon two of my favorite anime series. The show has great execution and always brings us the most simple situations in a hilarous manor. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Sakamoto Desu Ga was a pleasure to watch and is easily one of my favorite series of all time. From the comedic execution to the great characters there is little not too love. SDG earns a 10/10 for me and a strong reccomendation",

            "content": "People always said that \u201cPerfection is not always easy to achieve\u201d\r\nReally!!!!  Let me tell you about \u201cThe Legend of Sakamoto\u201d\r\nAlong time ago, in class 1-2 of Gakubun Perfectual High School. One student had the entire school\u2019s attention from the very first day. Carrying out class duties in STYLE, eating his lunch in STYLE, standing in the hall in STYLE, studying in STYLE, walking in STYLE, talking in STYLE, and even singing in SYLE. Every single move he makes is COOL! COOLER! COOLEST! And the name of the student is Sakamoto. There was nobody is PERFECT being except Sakamoto. Nobody can defeat him. In fact,all of girl student love him and certain of the boy student jealous at him. Furthermore, Sakamoto is the only PERFECT person in the world and he\u2019s the CHOSEN ONE. \\n\\n\r\nOut of the blue \u201cDeus Ex Machina\u201d is finally here. Oh thank you!!!!! \\n\r\n-\tSakamoto can help you pass in exam\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto can help you to defeat any gangster\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto can help you how to deal with the problem\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto inspired us how to became a fabulous person\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto can woo any girls with his fabulous face and his charisma\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto has a lot of idea to make something become wonderful\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto is our greatest HERO\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto is really \u201cBADASS\u201d in martial arts\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto\u2019s an extremely capable (of) all the things in \u201cSTYLE\u201d\\n\r\n-\tContact number 010-xxxxxxxx\u2026\u2026if you have any problem, just call Sakamoto \\n\r\n-\tAll the people always say \u201cWOW & SUGOI\u201d when Sakamoto show something incredible\\n\\n\r\nThe moral of the story is :\\n\r\n-\tHumorous\\n\r\n-\tYou can be a calm person\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto taught us about never intimidated by thugs\\n\r\n-\tSakamoto show us, about forgive someone is really important, even someone doing bad things to him \\n\r\n-\tOur confident will rise and its taught us never give up on something and don\u2019t be indecisive person  \\n\r\n-\tSakamoto show about justice is really paramount\\n\\n\\n\r\nRemember this \u201cPrecious Phrase\u201d \\n\\n\r\n\u201cKeep Calm and Watch Sakamoto desu ga?\u201d \\n\\n\r\n\u201cThis is Sakamoto. Sakamoto has everything \\n\r\n   and he\u2019s always rescue people. \\n\r\n   Sakamoto never complain about his classmate \\n\r\n   even certain people try to tricks him. \\n\r\n   Sakamoto is nice person. Be like Sakamoto\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cTHE END\u201d\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow about the \u201cseiyuu\u201d Midorikawa Hikaru, He was cast as a Sakamoto in the story and his voice is really unique and suitable. Next, a charismatic Sakamoto who attracted girls and a few guy also admired him. He\u2019s always calm down, never flustered & not afraid, even in an emergency. I really like his appearance and kindness. Sometime, we can called him as \u201cKUUDERE\u201d person or fabulous guy. When Sakamoto has purpose on something, he will do whatever it takes.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series is really great, especially Opening theme, COOLEST by Customi Z. Its include a motivation words like a COOL, COOLER, COOLEST, OH YEAH !, YEAH !, YOU ARE SPECIAL, BREAK OUT !, WAKE UP ! Seriously, I got such spirit when I heard this song and the music is really catchy and great. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the story gave me a lot of enjoyment. Truthfully, Nami Sano create a bizarre story. I think the creator try to teach us, how to become stylish person and brilliant person. In fact, I could call a masterpiece work. I laughed like a drain when I watched the story. In nutshell, Sakamoto desu ga? One of the most successful sitcom takes place in spring 2016. For the whole of the story Sakamoto desu ga? is magnificent & I have absolutely no doubt about Sakamoto desu ga? Is a masterpiece. In fact, Sakamoto desu ga? Is quite similar narrative with Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou & Gintama.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, it\u2019s Sakamoto desu ga? results !!!!!\\n\\n\r\nWhat I watched\\n\r\nSakamoto desu ga?\\n\\n\r\nWhat I Expected\\n\r\nI will become a FAMOUS person\\n\\n\r\nWhat I Got\\n\r\nI have total confidence, when I do something\\n",

Every episode gives us a glimpse of how awesome this guy it. If you think this premse will run stale pretty quickly, be reassured, it does not. Not every story is top notch, but this anime has so many ideas that you will be entertained most of the time.\r\n9/10\r\nArt:\r\nSakamoto is a pretty boy, but everybody else is pretty...pretty (I should have used a thesaurus there) as well. Except for Kubota and his mother, they are just disgusting, but that's the point of their characters.In general, this anime looks very good, but the focus is clearly on the characters.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening is good, the ending works as well. I really loved that piece of music that plays every time Sakamoto does something amazing. The voices are all very stereotype, but that's part of the charm.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nDid I mention already just how awesome Sakamoto is? Because he's awesome. Somehow he manages to overshadow everybody else without coming off as a jerk. The other characters do what they are supposed to, the only one who kinda stands out a little is Hayabusa. Oh, and Fujita is a sweetie.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, not every story is a hit, but most of them are. Sakamotos antics are always hilarious and incredible to witness. I'm not sure if they would have been able to keep this up for more than 12/13 episodes though. But for a weekly dose, it was absolutely worth it.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n8.2/10",

            "content": "Cool, Cooler, COOLEST!!!...and not just for Sakamoto, Studio DEEN as well.\r\nWell, LA will say it already, LA thinks Studio DEEN is two for twofer in terms of comedy anime (previous being KonoSuba).\r\nLA was worried as to Sakamoto's skits of always \"winning\" and it getting old and by the numbers, however and by in fact really quickly, LA found that the \"ways\" Sakamoto leads to his victory or him pleasing the masses and sometimes outright crazily amusing ways that the comedy doesn't get stale, it's the entire \"it's the journey not the destination\" scenario and Sakamoto executed it brilliantly.\r\nCharacterization, well if you cannot believe it, notonly do wee see Sakamoto's perfect nature, but also from his female and male classmates as well, most notably Yoshinou Kubota voiced by Akira Ishida an incredibly shy classmate, Atsushi Maeda voiced by Tomokazu Sugita a former delinquent along with his posse, Yuuya Sera voiced by Showtaro Morikubo an odd delinquent, Megumi Fujita voiced by Mai Nakahara, Aina Kuronuma voiced by Yui Horie Yagi voiced by Hitome Nabatame and Mii-chan voiced by Kana Ueda are all Sakamoto's fangirls. The delinquents at first are oddly weird and stereotypical delinquents, but come Sakamoto, they get some odd quirks that give them some personality. As for Sakamoto's fangirls, their fawning/fighting over Sakamoto are again typical fangirling, but once Sakamoto gives them screentime, they get some character development, fangirl wise, Megumi Fujita gets the most development and screentime, as for the delinquents, Atsushi Maeda and his posse gets the most. Yoshinobu gets his own episodes with Sakamoto too and Yoshinobu gains a backbone. More LA talks about the the minor characters, the more LA thinks the minor characters gets MORE character development than Sakamoto himself.\\n\\n\r\nWhich makes a good point, Sakamoto, being his perfect self in terms of personality or backstory, we actually hardly know much about him yet LA still liked Sakamoto even without that, (though LA suspects Sakamoto is an alien or one of those Parasites from Rick and Morty in Total Rickall) or something you wanna know why?, Sakamoto is a catalyst or a great punchline with the minor characters being the reactants to the utterly bizarre situations Sakamoto does, him being perfect or otherwise. It's some actually great comedy routine.\\n\\n\r\nNow LA keeps saying that Sakamoto is \"perfect\" and that actually comes out as a small detriment to this series as what LA was soo worried about this anime, since he's perfect, we'll know he'll always win in some bizarre way or another and LA will honestly say that not ALL of the skits in this anime will hit, mainly with \"Sakamoto vs. the delinquents\" skits comes off as bizarrely typical, where's it's comedy goldmine is when Sakamoto teams up with the delinquents (huh, double edged sword much?). \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting wise, well LA is gonna be honest here, Sakamoto's voice actor Hikaru Midorikawa is the utter ace in the voice cast (duhhh because he's the main character),but LA is such a sucker for almost all of Sakamoto's fangirls voice actors (Yukari Tamura, Kana Ueda, Yui Horie and LA's favorite from the fangirls Mai Nakahara).\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, well Studio DEEN, if KonoSuba gave us ironically made animation but still made a great comedy, then Sakamoto desu ga, did a solid animation for a great comedy, everything from the aesthetics to character designs, animation...is something LA would praise it much like it's comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending gave something rather dramatic in for a slice of life comedy and....errrrrr...LA hate to admit it but *ahem* mood-whiplashing, however the ending stuck to it's typical flavour and bombastically weird execution that the ending was well a perfect end to the mysterious eponymous Sakamoto...........................he's an alien right?...RIGHT!??!?!?! \\n\\n\r\nSakamoto desu ga? is another bright spot to Studio DEEN's catalog of great comedies of 2016 and with that it's utterly cool~ wouldn't you say Sakamoto?.",

            "content": "If there wasn\u2019t enough fabulousness this season, don\u2019t worry, Sakamoto is here. Sakamoto desu ga is exactly how it looks and sounds. An entire series focused on a character that is perfect is a pretty risky job. The series can easily become repetitive and boring if it heavily relies on one joke. Sakamoto manages to consistently entertain with its variety of different jokes, that all use the same backbone. It\u2019s just the sheer amount of creativity and wackiness that can make Sakamoto look not only perfect to the people around him, but also the viewers. But it\u2019s not just the comedy Sakamoto succeeds at, butalso its parody on common tropes in anime, which makes the series seem much more intelligent than it out to be. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nWell, Sakamoto desu ga is exactly as the premise says it is. The series revolves around Sakamoto doing wacky, yet fabulous stuff in very weird comedic situations. He\u2019ll avoid bullying, smoke bubble, run like the Darwin Evolution diagrams, create subliminal messages in split-seconds\u2026 you get the point. People say that there is no such thing as perfection. They clearly haven\u2019t heard about Sakamoto. He has the girls being deredere for him, the guys being tsundere for him, and birds being dandere for him\u2026 yeah, that\u2019s the power of Sakamoto\u2019s charm. Sakamoto is primarily episodic, as each episode (or more like half of an episode) revolves around a comedic situations involving Sakamoto. The series doesn\u2019t have a major plot in the series until the very end, but that\u2019s not the highlight of the series. The highlights are the comedic situations throughout the series. The writing of these comedic situations is somewhat genius and the tiny stories themselves are very unique and creative. And the ending is satisfying enough to be a fitting conclusion to the series, that doesn\u2019t need any more continuations. It leaves a lot of questions open, but that\u2019s what maintains the charm of the series \u2013 who is Sakamoto really?\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s fabulous in Sakamoto desu ga besides Sakamoto himself, it\u2019s the style. The way the series presents its comedy is fantastic. Characters will talk about the most absurd things in the most common fashion, OST will be an intentional mismatch for the situation to create more comedy, and Sakamoto will make the most bizarre things look like a typical day for an average teenager. For an anime that heavily relies on one joke for laughs, it manages to do so properly. The amount of creativity the series has makes it very impressive. Sakamoto\u2019s jokes may come from a randomly generated joke machine, but it manages to blend these absurd elements together that it makes is feel consistent. The series also has moments when the series takes a serious tone in situations, and this is when the series starts to break apart. The serious moments don\u2019t seem tense enough to be serious enough and they only make the moments boring. Though it is necessary to have these moments to create a main story, it\u2019s just that it feels so out-of-place that it feels like I\u2019m watching a different series. Luckily these moments end quick and the comedy kicks in again. But there are moments when the series can be heartwarming, such as its conclusion and its final moments with Sakamoto.\\n\r\nPresentation: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nSakamoto desu ga is all about Sakamoto and Sakamoto, nothing more, nothing less. And for a series that primarily focuses on one character, it is important for him to be likable and good as a character. Well, Sakamoto is more than that, as he\u2019s fabulous! Sakamoto is a character without any flaws and perfect to the core. But he\u2019s not a Gary Stu, because he\u2019s too extreme to be so. He\u2019s more like a parody of it. Sakamoto\u2019s character is here to pull fun at other characters from other series that are considered perfect. And a formula like this can get boring quite easily, but Sakamoto manages to keep us entertained by going through even wackier situations. He doesn\u2019t have a backstory, and there\u2019s no real depth to him, but that would ruin the purpose of the series. Sakamoto has always been a mystery with his inhuman abilities, and it\u2019s up for the viewers to decide who his really is. No matter what he is though, he\u2019s still Sakamoto. Even though the series primarily focuses on its protagonist, the supporting characters are also fun and likable. You got the tsundere bully Acchan (who plays a bigger role near the end), bully victim Kubota, delinquent Hayabusa, and much more. The series does feature an antagonist, but he never ends up being an interesting character.\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nConsidering Studio Deen\u2019s track record of having subpar art, Sakamoto desu ga\u2019s art quality is a lot better than most of their work. For the most part, it\u2019s very clean and consistent, and the series manages to have good detaining even for background objects. The backgrounds are really good looking and have a good amount of details. Deen was always good at having detailed architectures, and Sakamoto is no exception. Characters also look clean and neat, though they do lack some detailing. Character design is quite interesting, as the perfect Sakamoto is shown to have glasses, which was an interesting choice. Acchan\u2019s toque also makes him stand out a lot. And overall the character designs are good and somewhat unique. \\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThis is where Sakamoto desu ga starts to stumble. Studio Deen doesn\u2019t have the best reputation when it comes to production values and animation fluidity. However, they managed to nail Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu\u2019s quality from last season, so one could hope they would do the same in Sakamoto. Sadly it\u2019s only okay, nothing more. Character fluidity is quite lacking and disappointing and backgrounds, though they look good, feel very static and flat. And the series heavily relies on still shots so less will need to be animated. Though these still shots might have good art, the lack of animation in them shows that they were used to cut corners. Hey, at least the animations in the OP are great\u2026\\n\r\nAnimation: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Sakamoto desu ga is fabulous to say the least, as every character Is done with near perfect. Although, that is expected with such a good cast. Midorikawa Hikaru nails it as Sakamoto. His tone in his voice is always kept in an even level, just like how a perfect character like Sakamoto would talk. He makes sure to make his character lack emotion, yet not feel dead. He might have been the best choice for Sakamoto. Sugita Tomokazu does an outstanding job as Acchan, which it to be expected since Sugita is a wonderful seiyuu, especially for comedic situations. His over-the top tone in certain situations is hilarious. And Sugita nails his love for Sakamoto, by adding a girly tone to Acchan whenever he goes deredere for Sakamoto. Ishida Akira does a role I\u2019ve never seen him do before. It astonishes me how he\u2019s able to do Kubota so effortlessly. It just shows how talented he is. Other well-known seiyuu are also part of the series, such as Horie Yui, Nakahara Mai, Suzuki Tatsuhisa, and they all do an excellent job in what they have to do.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nI guess you can say that the music is Sakamoto desu ga is the \u201ccoolest\u201d. The OP, \u201cCOOLEST\u201d, is absolutely perfect for a series like this. The vocals are nice and the lyrics are ridiculous (and it should be like that), and the music is great too. The OP matches the context of the anime so well because Sakamoto is indeed the coolest. The ED, \u201cNakushita Hibi ni Sayonara\u201d, is also quite good. It\u2019s not as memorable as the OP, but it\u2019s nice enough. The vocals are nice and the music is soothing. The background music in the series is great and it works well with the series. Sakamoto\u2019s theme, which you\u2019ll be hearing a lot, matches every over-the-top situation Sakamoto\u2019s in. Overall, the background music may not be the most inventive, but it works well with the anime.\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nSakamoto desu ga is always a blast to watch. Very few comedy anime can make me laugh in every episode, and Sakamoto succeeds in doing so. The series is just so over-the-top, absurd, and ridiculous, that it\u2019s hard not to find enjoyment out of it. Sakamoto\u2019s perfection is to die for, and it\u2019s always fun seeing him in weird, comedic situations. Whether it be running like the Darwin Evolution diagram, or Sakamoto using curtains to make breasts, or uses a balloon gun to threaten bullies, Sakamoto does all of this in ease and it\u2019s fun seeing him do so. He remains a mystery throughout the series, and it\u2019s up for the audience to decide who he really might be. Is he actually human or is he an alien? It\u2019s up to you to decide. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Sakamoto desu ga is a comedy you don\u2019t want to miss out on. Parody comedy anime are pretty rare to see these days, so finding one that actually works is a blessing. The series is all about Sakamoto, nothing more, nothing less. It may be repetitive for some, but it\u2019s impossible to deny the sheer creativeness and uniqueness the series has to offer. You won\u2019t see comedic situations like the one you\u2019ll see in Sakamoto. The production values are a little off, and the serious moments aren\u2019t too great, but the comedy makes up for it. Do yourself a favor and fall in love with Sakamoto\u2019s fabulousness. You won\u2019t regret it! \\n\\n\r\n+ Sakamoto\u2019s a cool protagonist who manages to entertain throughout the series\\n\r\n+ Comedic situations are absurd and ridiculous, yet creative and inventive \\n\r\n+ Fitting and somewhat heartwarming conclusion\\n\r\n+ Fantastic voice acting for Sakamoto and the major supporting characters. \\n\r\n- Production values are lacking \\n\r\n- The serious tone, when it appears, don\u2019t work well for the series\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.2/10",

            "content": "tl;dr: An anime that can be really amusing at times but has no depth whatsoever.\r\nI like the general concept of this anime quite a bit.\u00a0It's essentially an extension of the trope of\u00a0there\u00a0being a character that is able to deal with any situation as is common in a lot of anime but taken to the extreme, to the\u00a0point it leaves no doubt in the viewers mind that everything will be resolved and be resolved well. Sakamoto was a really great character as well, being quite mysterious and\u00a0reserved, but also really involved and stylish, which makes him perfect for the prementioned trope. It also leads to alot\u00a0of really\u00a0solid\u00a0comedy. The\u00a0issue is that beyond that, it felt kind of weak. Sakamoto himself is cool, but beyond that he doesn't really have any character. Hence in terms of substance, the focus is on him interacting with others and\u00a0their development in interacting with him. However, there\u00a0really\u00a0weren't any character arcs that were good, all of them feeling shallow. There were lots of great moments, but nothing substantial overall. And plot wise, that was it. There were some hints of a larger narrative with a villain, but that was resolved so easily at the end that it felt pointless. Beyond that, the ending was a pretty solid way to end things, focusing on everything that happened up to that point in regards to Sakamoto's class and how they grew, but\u00a0ultimately\u00a0I don't feel that\u00a0growth\u00a0was enough to support such an ending so it didn't really have all that strong of an impact.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe OP was amazing, with a great song and awesome visuals. The ED was okay. The soundtrack wasn't particularly memorable outside of \"The Devil\" being used once.\u00a0The\u00a0art wasn't all that great. The animation was decent. Also, the OVA was half rehash and half just weird nonsense.\u00a0",

Every girl wants him, even those that have gone way past their teenage years.\r\nThe reason for this quite mediocre 4 is pretty simple: it's because I just described ALL of Sakamoto's storyboard.\r\nThere is no plot per se, it's half-episodes shorts where Sakamoto is always fabulous and the others are not.\r\nThere is nothing special about any of the characters, theybring out a really boring villain halfway through the season but apart from that, there is nobody even noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd far worse, not only are the characters unmemorable, but they are not developped AT ALL. Not one of them. Why are the punks punks? Why is the loser a loser? Is there any buildup in their personalities for any of that? I never even began to care about anyone because nobody was even remotely developped.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the gimmick is a lot of fun, it's used on something completely nonexistant, like watering a piece of wooden fence hoping a tree will grow out. It's loads of fun times but shoved on characters that I couldn't care less about. For an anime or movie, I'd expect more than just \"being awesome\" as sole point and case.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say Sakamoto Desu Ga has a fun gimmick, but really it IS a fun gimmick, because it's the gimmick and nothing else. No characters, no moments where I cared, no story threads that really worked, no moments where I felt anything, sure the over the topness was great, but it wasn't nearly enough to carry this beyond a few episodes.",

It explores some psychological aspects too especially regarding life in high school and switch to uni/college.\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto becomes a person, an idea, a teacher.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all this seriousness, this anime is still very entertaining to watch and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to watch anime, to pass time and/or enjoy a genuinely well written adapted anime. \\n",

Saw the first episode, I was like eh it's alright, it's just the first episode it should get better. Second episode, in terms of comedy just like the first, one scene that I thought was funny. So then I forced to watch episodes 3 to 5 in hopes that it would get better. It just didn't happen, sure there were a few funny scenes but then as each episode went by the anime just started to get moreand more ridiculous and that's when I realized. Sakamoto is like a character that I would have created in fifth grade which I sort of have when in class we were required to write. The humor is the same too, Sakamoto would have been the funniest thing in the world to me if I was back in fifth grade because I have written scenes where stupid and impossible things happen to make a main character look cool. What I'm trying to say is, characters who are perfect in every way are just really lame and not funny or cool.",

            "content": "This review is for Sakamoto desu ga. When referring to this anime, I will not be using the question mark at the end because it messes with punctuation and makes it complicated. This is my first anime review because I'm sure that I can give an accurate and objective perspective of what this anime is and isn't. As such, I want people to decide for themselves whether or not they enjoy Sakamoto desu ga. The purpose of this review is just to spell out what Sakamoto desu ga entails so that people who are watching and people who are interested in watching will know whatto make of this anime. Now, let's begin.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who dislike reading long blurbs, I'll summarize what I want to say right here. Sakamoto desu ga is a comedy anime that uses the main character, Sakamoto, in little skits. These skits will always involve another person trying to make Sakamoto look bad, but apparently Sakamoto is so omnipotently perfect that he can't possibly look bad and any attempt to do so will only highlight how cool he is. As such, this anime has zero plot, zero character development, and zero meaningful theme. This is not my opinion, this is fact. To contradict this statement would be a blatant lie. Now, before those who enjoy this anime gather their pitchforks, I am not saying that this anime is unenjoyable or dumb. My opinion is that this anime is a pathetic excuse for a comedy that is not worth my time, hence why this is on my dropped list, but that's just my opinion. For other people, maybe the skits are wonderfully funny and Sakamoto's character archetype is so perfect for them that this overrides the fact that Sakamoto desu ga has zero plot, zero character development, and zero meaningful theme.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, this anime is hit or miss based on people's personal tastes. If you like the characters and how they revolve around Sakamoto, then great, you've found something that you love. If you're two episodes in and you don't see anything worthwhile in Sakamoto desu ga, then quit while you're ahead. The series doesn't get better. In fact, for those who don't immediately enjoy the anime, I can guarantee that Sakamoto desu ga gets much, much, worse. Spare yourself the trauma. \\n\\n\r\nWow, that was the summary? Well then, okay. From here on out there may be spoilers for Sakamoto desu ga, but it's not like it matters. If you're watching Sakamoto desu ga for the plot, then I pity what your life has come to. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10\\n\r\nThere is no story. Period. I could take episode 1 and 12, set them aside, and jumble up episodes 2-11. The end result would make just as much sense as how the anime is actually structured. Each episode has absolutely nothing to do with the previous and next episode. The only thing that changes is the people that admire Sakamoto. After each skit, the people who originally tried to make Sakamoto look bad later come to realize his godliness. That's really the only thing that changes from episode to episode. The only sign that you're actually getting deeper into the anime. Really. No, I'm not kidding. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nI didn't notice anything extremely good about the art, but I also have no complaints with how the anime looks. Then again, I'm no art expert.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nNothing from the soundtrack stood out to me. I actually barely remember it. At least that means I also didn't remember anything bad about it either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nAgain, there is absolutely no character development. Anyone who says that there is is lying to themselves. Additionally, the change from \"hating Sakamoto\" to \"worshiping Sakamoto\" can hardly count as character development. That's literally the only thing that changes in this anime. As such, all the characters come as they appear. They don't change at all, so it's all up to personal preference whether you like them or not. I personally could not tolerate the presence of any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nThis is entirely personal opinion. If you found enjoyment in this, then congratulations. If you didn't find enjoyment within the first two episodes, please quit while you are ahead. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\nObjectively, anyone can say that Sakamoto desu ga has zero plot, zero character development, and zero meaningful theme. Because this show is fatally lacking in these departments, it can only possibly make up for itself through its art, sound, and static characters. Art and sound in anime are largely up to personal taste. I found nothing to actively complain about, yet nothing to actively praise about these two features. Because Sakamoto desu ga employs zero character development, all the characters that are introduced never change at all. That means the viewers will just get the characters as they are. If someone loves all the characters, they will find enjoyment in the show. If you can't bear any of the characters like me, you'll find every aspect of this show irritating and annoying. \\n\\n\r\nSakamoto desu ga is really just hit or miss, but at least it's not a complicated anime. That's why this is my first review. If you enjoy Sakamoto desu ga, please keep enjoying it for your own sake. It stays the same through and through, so you'll definitely find even more enjoyment in it. If you hate Sakamoto desu ga, please quit watching for your own sake. The anime stays the same through and through, so you'll definitely continue to be annoyed by it. Sakamoto is able to enchant all of his acquaintances and make them see the good in him. Unfortunately Sakamoto does not have the power to make all viewers find the good in his anime, so if you haven't liked Sakamoto desu ga so far, turn back now.",

            "content": "Sakamoto desu ga? is such an underrated comedy. It could have easily been overlooked by me but after I saw Konosuba from Studio Deen I was really into watching their comedies. Sakamoto desu ga? did not dissapoint. It is a string of vignettes about the coolest guy in school. It's such a simple concept but the absurdist humor is what drew me in. The senarios where Sakamoto can be embarassed and how he saves himself by making it look cool is absolutely hilarious. Some vignettes are better than others that's for sure but there is so much charm that I really enjoyed it thuroughly. It'sgoofy and silly but I enjoyed that. A great example of the absurdity is that a ghost pushes a mop bucket with a mop in it to Sakomoto to hit him. He jumps in the air and lands in it and begins riding it down the hallway looking cool as ever. While everyone is amazed at him and calling it a Segway scooter, even though it's a mop and bucket he's riding. It's shit like that, that's simple yet well executed and works well as a stupid joke but when watching it, it's very funny. MY friends and I saw the first episode together and were laughing so hard we had to pause the show. It was really something fun to watch and laugh with other people. Overall if you overlooked this show I wouldn't be surprised. Check it out if you have the taste for some ridiculous comedy hopefully you'll find enjoyment in it's absurdity.",

If you want to know more about my rating system check the video description. Now it is time to fumble over my words as I begin a potentially spoiler filled review. \r\nWords can very easily describe \u201cHaven\u2019t You Heard? I\u2019m Sakamoto,\u201d but the experience is something else entirely. The show has a fairly basic premise, attractive high schooler acts cool and people are jealous of him, and from watching Handa-kun this season I have learned that, that premise, while funny,can\u2019t lift a show to Sakamoto\u2019s heights. What makes Sakamoto so great is that most everything Sakamoto does is not cool, in fact, it is downright crazy most of the time, but the best part about it all is that he does it with such conviction that those around him find it cool. It is a show that shows confidence can mean everything, but it takes it one step further and addresses more serious issues. Characters end up disliking Sakamoto because he represents something they are lacking, whether that is principal, hard work, or escapism Sakamoto not only points out their flaws but helps to correct them. What truly made this show a 9 rather than an 8 was the last four episodes. The issues characters were struggling with resurfaced and Sakamoto assisted them in finally putting them to rest. The final few minutes of the last episode had me in tears, as the class was saying goodbye to Sakamoto I knew I was as well, and their heartfelt farewell along with the uncertainty of the future was a truly touching sentiment. Also, Sakamoto is totally an alien. I called it in episode two after he said his \u201cinvestigation was a success.\u201d This idea was further strengthened by his interest in NASA and how he assists others in odd ways and displays inhuman physical abilities. Then at the end Sakamoto is called out for not actually leaving school to go work for NASA by the blond school thug and Sakamoto replies \u201cI have no idea what you mean,\u201d dodging the question. I love this show, and I hope many others are able to share in the joy that is Sakamoto. \\n",

            "content": "Sakamoto desu ga? brings something new, to the veritable buffet table of comedy anime.  In a world filled with awkward protagonists, bumbling sidekicks, and simplistic humor, Sakamoto desu ga? manages to stir things off by doing the exact opposite, and manages to stick out from One Punch Man, despite the two having a relatively similar bases.  Sakamoto desu ga? stars Sakamoto (obviously), a man who has no flaws, and makes no mistakes.  You drop your books near him, he'll catch them all before they hit the ground.  You tie his legs together before a race, he'll gallop on all fours withmore poise then you ever could.\\n\\n\r\nSuch an anime seems like it would get boring quite quick.  A perfect protagonist, after all, cant really grow.  And here's where the similarity with OPM is most significant.  Both tell the story of their protagonist through the side characters.  In OPM most of it's about the public not recognizing Saitama, and how other heroes cope with his superiority.  In Sakamoto desu ga? it's about the other students, and how they deal with this \"freak\".  However the similarities end shortly after, with OPM delving into juxtapositional comedy, and Sakamoto desu ga? focusing on more altruistic, almost philosophical comedy.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are relatively standard for the most part.  When it wants to, Sakamoto desu ga? can hit you with some beautiful visuals, or masterful songs and dialogue.  However those moments are reserved, and given as \"rewards\" for reaching the climax of a story.\\n\\n\r\nMy main issue with Sakamoto desu ga? is the story structure.  Each episode is broken into 2-3 \"parts\", with each part being ~10 minute \"adventures\".  While this is great for comedy, it's very hard for the show to develop many characters, as they simply don't get enough screentime.  This leads to Sakamoto desu ga? at times feeling void of personality, but that almost never detracts from the comedy within.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I loved Sakamoto desu ga?, and it's a show I sincerely enjoyed.  The humour was spot on, it was just light enough while remaining serious on some issues, and Sakamoto was amazing, without feeling robotic or devoid of humility.  Like OPM and Mob Psycho, this is a comedic classic I'd wholeheartedly recommend you give a watch.",

This is the first anime I've completed in a few years now, though to be fair, that doesn't say much because I haven't watched anime since 2012 and even some of what I consider to be my favorite animes of all time I never actually bothered to finish to the end. \r\nI wouldn't recommend it for people looking for a real story line or any real character development, since the show runs with the idea of Sakamoto being perfect and sticks with it throughout, but if you're looking for a pretty light hearted comedic animefor the purpose of being just that, you'll get quite some laughs out of it. The show is truly unique though, nonetheless, though I feel like it weighs in just a bit on certain anime stereotypes that work for it.\\n\\n\r\nI personally consider it a favorite of mine in the comedy genre. No, it's not the most memorable anime and not amongst some of the best, but it is highly enjoyable and different and for someone such as myself who is only just now kinda-sorta-maybe getting back into anime, it's good enough.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also a very interesting and popular theory surrounding the ending and why Sakamoto is the way he is that I won't go into depth about as it may potentially spoil something. \\n\\n",

Well, the story is NOT the point in this show. It's just as it is, nothing more, nothing less.

The style here is awesome! Well, if it will make you laugh, at least it will not be for being poorly done. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and the soundtrack is pretty good here. It's consistent and present everytime. The songs fits perfectly with the moment, it's happy when it has to be and sad when it has to be.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 10//10\\n\\n\r\nGIVE THIS A 10 OUTTA 10!! The characters in this anime are really, and I mean REALLY, AWESOME! Every character has a backstory and something unique with them.

This is the most important part in a comedy show.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed my time watching Sakamoto Desu Ga?. It was really fun and sometimes I got myself laughing hard in some parts of this show. It's so fun, I remember every single joke and I still laugh every single time I heard them in this show, just like Soul Eater.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this to everyone looking for an anime focused on comedy.

            "content": "He's focused. He's cunning. He's everything you'd want in a man. I didn't even say his name but you already know who he is. Sakamoto desu ga? is an anime about a first year named Sakamoto, and his daily misadventures through school life. But while it provides its comedic and dramatic moments, do they add up to make a great combination?\r\nStory: Being a school anime, the show is limited to \"follow a school calendar year\" type of thing. The story revolves around what time of year it is, and how relationships have been built up since the last episode. That mixture creates some of themost interesting stories within the episodes. However, although interesting, there isn't much else besides Sakamoto's quirks that get through the entire show. That isn't bad, per se, but it doesn't help the story that much. Although this does occur, that doesn't make Sakamoto desu ga? any worse in terms of story, and helps it in some ways.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is pretty standard. Nothing much here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sakamoto is chill, and that's reflected in his voice acting. Everything felt like it was the way it should have been, and even the scene in the last episode was voiced with emotion. That aside, we should talk about the opening. I love the opening. It doesn't fit the show at all in the way that it sounds like its for an action anime, but it's great nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters here are fairly bare-bones for some, but more fleshed out for others. In this show, it seems that there are more than just main and supporting characters due to how much his classmates are developed. Before getting to them, though, we should talk about Sakamoto and his friend Kubota. Sakamoto is literally a perfect person. That makes him a bit shallow, but the fact that he can be sent to the hall shows that even he has flaws. Since he is basically perfect, however, this makes him have all the traits you would expect in perfect people. It's a bit cheap, but that tactic makes you know everything about him, fleshing him out a lot. His friend, Kubota, on the other hand, has many insecurities. Out of everyone, he has the most character. He goes from someone who paid for protection to someone that actually had purpose and could do things his way. His character development became something that allowed for others to develop in a way too, which is a plus for this section. Sakamoto's other classmates are all special in their own way too, but they're only there to fill in the roles of a class. They all have one or two special traits to them, but they mostly aren't too important in the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Sakamoto desu ga? is a very enjoyable anime. The random parts of the calendar year all show up to make a fun story that is a good experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Although some parts could be drawn out more or have more content put into them, this is a solid show in my opinion. There are times that I wish there was more, but it didn't impede on my viewing experience.\\n",

            "content": "Everything Sakamoto desu ga stands for is beautifully exectuted within the standard amount of 12 episodes. The story is depicting a not-so-average high school student by the name of Sakamoto. \r\nSakamoto excels at everything he does and his surroundings are either absolutely taken away by it or hating his guts for it - both ways lead to interesting and funny plot twists throughout the story! \r\nFrankly speaking, I have never ever laughed so much watching anime. The story development is all about simple process consisting of just as simple but yet interesting and very humorous events that slowly lead up to the end of theseries. Not only did the anime get everything it wanted done perfectly but digging deeper into the background of the ending brings up a whole new light upon the surface of the unique anime series Sakamoto desu ga.\\n\\n\r\nTo keep this review spoiler-free I won't talk about the ending much more but definitely search it up on Google after you're done watching it.\\n\\n\r\nJust as I enjoyed the story I, at least equally, enjoyed the art, sound and characters! Sakamoto desu ga seems to be indirectly poking fun at the other typical high school anime characters and behaviour which can truly be hilarious from time to time to realise. The creators weren't afraid of taking any risks. Sakamoto desu ga is the anime that says \"we don't give a damn, we do what we want\" which perfectly reflects at the usual exaggeration at many situations from Sakamoto's surroundings, unexpected twists which Sakamoto naturally handles all flawlessly. \\n\\n\r\nI loved to watch this anime and I definitely do recommend it!",

            "content": "Story: 3\r\nArt: 7\r\nSound: 5\r\nCharacter: 6\r\nEnjoyment: 5\r\nOverall: 6\r\n*Slight spoilers, but they're important to know if you're going into the series*\r\nThis show was alright, I suppose. It started off pretty amusing (I liked how the three boys were talking to each other while passing the ball at the end of the episode. OR was it the start? It's been so long since I watched this lol) and I was interested by Sakamoto's premise. He's the coolest boy in the school, so jealous people want to make him look un-cool.\r\naannnd that's the whole twelve episodes.\r\n(spoiler: these jealous people usually end up going gay for Sakamoto)\r\nAlthough, there is apretty interesting character who Sakamoto helps, named Kubota. He gets quite a bit of character development, since he goes from being bullied to getting a job at McDonalds and getting Sakamoto as a new friend. There's also an interesting episode where Sakamoto goes out of his way to help Kubota with a hair-related situation (I'd go into more detail but that would be spoilers) and I really found myself loving Kubota as a character. Without him, the character rating would've gone down significantly. I've noticed that not many of the reviews here mention him, so I thought I'd give him a special mention. Kubota's not perfect like Sakamoto, so it's kind of refreshing to have a character like him on screen.\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, there's a bit of creepiness with Kubota's mother having a really big crush on Sakamoto (there's even one episode where Kubota's mom dresses up as Kubota just so she can get close to Sakamoto... that episode was really creepy) which ruined the series a lot for me, if I'm honest. The anime would've been a LOT better without the whole 'my-friend's-mother-is-a-predator' vibe it had going on. Without it, my enjoyment could've been a potential 7, but it dampened my liking of the series significantly. It was basically normalising paedophilia, so I really couldn't get on board with those episodes... (and before anyone says that's 'normal' in anime, maybe it is. Depends on the type you watch. But I watched this anime for 'slice of life', not ecchi or whatever genre I can expect it to pop up in.)\\n\\n\r\nAs you may have noticed, I only watched eleven episodes out of twelve. And to be sincerely honest with you, I don't even remember what happened in the eleventh episode. If I saw a synopsis, it would probably jog my memory, but as of now, I don't really remember that episode being 'memorable'. This series isn't BAD, but it's just not interesting enough that I feel like it's worth watching to the end. I lost interest and read some posts about the last episode so that I would know what had happened without having to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, I didn't notice anything wrong. Character designs are diverse and the animation seemed pretty good. I also liked the OP (and of course, Swagamoto's fantastic sparkles whenever he does something cool). There's not really much I have to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't too memorable. Honestly, I can't even remember how the OP sounded. I remember the imagery for the OP, I remember how the OP played out, I just can't remember the actual song they had for the OP. So, you can see why the art is rated higher than the sound. I gave the sound a 5 since I remember the VAs were fairly good, I thought they suited their characters quite well.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you're trying to figure out whether to watch this series or not, it all depends on what you like. If you're coming from something like Nichijou, you'll most likely be disappointed. (If you haven't watched Nichijou, I suggest you watch that rather than Sakamoto Desu Ga. Nichijou is far more superior compared to this.) If you're a regular in the 'slice of life' genre, give it a watch. You'll like it. Or if you're predominately a fan of sports anime like I am, it honestly depends on your tastes at the end of the day.\\n\\n\r\nThis is by no means a bad anime, not at all. It's more or less due to the fact that I watched \"Sakamoto Desu Ga?\" alongside Nichijou, which I thought to be a lot superior compared to this anime. I was watching Nichijou a lot quicker than I was this anime, since it was honestly so BORING compared to Nichijou. That's probably why I never properly finished this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're going in with high standards, you'll find yourself a little lacking in excitement. But if you're just looking for something lighthearted or something to give you a quick laugh, go ahead and give Sakamoto Desu Ga a watch. The first episode was enough to get me watching almost the entire thing, if that makes you more inclined to watch it.",

            "content": "Prior to finishing Haven\u2019t You Heard? I\u2019m Sakamoto, the last anime that I watched to completion was about a year or two ago. For the past few years I have been making continuous efforts to try and get into back to watching a medium that I truly enjoyed and so I finally decided on watching this show. And in retrospect, because of this I may have set my expectations unfairly high because I found Haven\u2019t You Heard; I\u2019m Sakamoto as a somewhat fun however highly forgettable and very frustrating show.\r\nContains Minor Spoilers\r\nStory\r\nThe story of Haven\u2019t You Heard? I\u2019m Sakamoto Is about a near perfect highschool student, Sakamoto, and his schoolmates and classmates. The episodes are structured like western animated series where episodes are divided into two, sometimes three, segments where each segment contains its own story. I liked the idea of the story of a cool boy scout like character that is popular but that also butts heads with the people he interacts with a school setting. The story starts off pretty strong but struggles to maintain momentum as the show progresses. At the start, it is fun to see how the characters who dislike Sakamoto try to make him slip up and lose his cool in front of his class, yet Sakamoto manages to maintain his cool and suave demeanour and turns his adversaries\u2019 plans on its head.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the story veers off with this set up because you clearly cannot show a characters trying to maintain his cool while his classmates try to make him slip up for 12 episodes. However, thinking back, I would have rather have preferred that to a lot of what followed. Suffice to say, there is very little story in show. Without spoiling anything, one segment of an episode literally just revolves around Sakamoto walking. I\u2019m not over exaggerating when I say that in one episode, the story is basically Sakamoto walking from Point A to Point B. \\n\\n\r\nYou can watch the first two episodes of the series and then the final two and you would not miss anything important with everything in between feeling like filler. I have no problem with the structure of the show because there are animated titles that have 10 minute episodic segments where each segment has a beginning, middle and an end. And even if these shows do not have strong stories they make up for it with interesting and funny characters and good jokes and funny comedy. Haven\u2019t You Heard? I\u2019m Sakamoto rarely does and barely has any of these things. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nThe show\u2019s setup has you believe that the world, and more specifically the school, wherein the story is set, is inhabited by really goofy, wacky and zany characters almost akin to the anime Cromartie High but not to such a large extent. There were some standouts like Kubota Shigemi and Sera Yuuya, however most of the cast is pretty uninteresting and boring. The novelty of seeing Sakamoto being perfect and cool wears off quickly because you know that he won\u2019t slip up and that nothing bad will happen to him. There is no real character development for him or for most of the characters in the series. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nIt is always difficult for me to review the art of an anime title when the animation looks just like so many other title. The art and animation was okay however later all of the characters started to look the same, especially the girls. It was just fine.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThere is one recurring gag that made me laugh or at least chuckle and it was an extremely melodramatic song from a favourite television show of one of the characters. This was used to milk dramatic and over the top moments for laughs and in these scenes and moments, it works really well and never got tiresome. The rest of the music was fine as was the voice work but that\u2019s about it. Not much else to say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nHaven\u2019t You Heard? I\u2019m Sakamoto started really well and I was curious to see where the story would go, however it loses steam very quickly and some of the middle episodes were an absolute chore and grind to watch. Some of the characters I enjoyed and there are some clever ideas and gags spread throughout the show. After a year of not watching a single anime however, I was disappointed with Haven\u2019t You Heard? I\u2019m Sakamoto. If you\u2019re looking for a stupid anime to watch just to kill some time, give this a try. But if all you want to do is kill time, there are probably much better titles out there that you could rather watch.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n",

The story is of the popular boy Sakamoto whom changes his classmates lives with the way he handles situations in a cool manner. There isn't much to be developed upon that. The characters don't get much development either, it's just: normal classmates + delinquents + Sakamoto. \r\n\u2665 Art \u2665 : The art is fair. The art style is very clean and nice shaded. The art style doesn't really have any \"cool\" or noticeable characteristics that would make you rememberthe animation style though.\\n\\n\r\n\u2665 Sound \u2665 : The sound is very good. The normal lounge music is very soothing and relaxing and it fits Sakamoto character. The music is rather memorable and is of good quality. The voice actors are rather diverse and their voice work is sound as well. I just would have expected more lines out of Sakamoto overall.\\n\\n\r\n\u2665 Enjoyment \u2665 : I enjoyed Sakamoto Desu Ga? because of the ridiculous comedy, and the fact that you never know what is going to happen. I am also a comedy + slice of life fan so you can consider me pretty bias.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all for this review. Have a nice day! :)",

            "content": "\"Every move he makes is.... Cool! Cooler! Coolest!\"\r\nIt's no secret that everyone, even those who think they're perfect, has at least one flaw, but to every rule (although it's not really a rule), there's always an exception. Who is that exception? Could it be a certain high school boy with glasses and a mole under his left eye? I've known of the manga that contains such a person for a while now, and when an anime adaptation was announced, I decided to check it out. All I've got to say is, \"It was fun while it lasted.\"\r\nHaven't you heard, ladies and gentlement, of Sakamoto? Good,because I'm reviewing \"Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto\", known in Japanese as \"Sakamoto desu ga?\"\\n\\n\r\nHaven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto centers around Swagamoto - er, I mean, Sakamoto - a high school student who is basically the \"perfect human\". There's nothing he can't do, and he's got good looks, too. Needless to say, he instantly wins the hearts of girls and the jealousy of boys. Even in a tight situation, he emerges from said situation with elegance, grace, and, dare I say it, swag. Basically, this anime follows the (mis)adventures of Swagamoto - dang it, WHY CAN'T I SAY SAKAMOTO PROPERLY - and his classmates throughout his first year of high school.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing about this anime I'd like to take note of is its animation. I've seen a decent amount of anime from Studio Deen, but this has to be some of the best animation I've seen from them, with some decent character designs to go with it. The voice acting is pretty solid, too, especially Hikaru Midorikawa as Sakamoto; his voice adds to Sakamoto's coolness. The ending theme, \"Nakushita Hibi no Sayonara\" by Suneohair, is a pretty beautiful song, but I personally loved the opening theme, \"COOLEST\" by Customi Z, even more. Pardon the incoming pun, but it's a really COOL song! ....Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is pretty episodic, and they always seem to end with Sakamoto staying on top of things. It can get a bit repetitive at times, but luckily, this anime does shake things up a bit and keep it fresh. There are more funny and amusing moments than there are not, and I would either find myself grinning or laughing at times. As for the characters, some are likable, while some are characters I didn't care much for. If there was a character I had to pick as my favorite, it's Acchan; the fact that he's voiced by one of my favorite seiyuus aside, he was given a good amount of development.\\n\\n\r\nTo tell you the truth, though, a major deciding factor of whether or not you can enjoy this anime is the likability of the main character, Sakamoto. The main point of this anime is that he has no flaws; a character with no flaws is considered a \"Gary-Stu\". If you can overlook that, Sakamoto actually turns out to be a very interesting character. He always kept others' best interests in mind, and he turned some cliches on its head; those two factors kept me interested in his character. Sakamoto is also quite an enigma; I couldn't help but ask questions about who he actually is, especially toward the end.\\n\\n\r\nHaven't you heard? \"Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto\" is an enjoyable anime that I would recommend to anyone in the mood for a \"cool\" comedy. Anyone who watches this will know of the antics of Swagamoto!",

            "content": "Sakamoto Desu Ga. \r\nSounds weird right? Sounds like someone's full name or something that just doesn't click to us non-Japanese speaking viewers and yet this anime is very slice of life -like. To be honest it looks far too fashionable for what it seems on the google images. Dare I even say, it looks like an anime purely based for individuals who like slim, slender, elegant, glasses-wearing boys and yet this anime is what I dreamt to be when I was in school.\r\nLets get down to the basics oh this anime: The story revolves around the main character (who happens to be presented in thetitle) Sakamoto. We follow Sakamoto on this story of his daily life in high school and how he \"tackles\" the typical issues that occurs in said school. Now this is not much of a spoiler but Sakamoto is the coolest guy in the entire school. How do we know this, well in most episodes there is a ten second introduction where a very aged and experienced narrator takes his time to sit you down and just softly mention to you that Sakamoto is not only cool, but also cooler and coolest. This by itself is enough to take an interest in what this narrator has to show and that is only the first ten seconds of the actual anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo what got me interested in this anime? Am I one of those individuals that I mentioned previously? Nope. What caught my attention was a single .Gif image where we see Sakamoto sitting on the open window sill after seeing his school desk and chair missing. The hooking part was when Sakamoto took his place at the window sill and the wind elegantly brushes his hair to revel the sophistication of this mysterious character who is Sakamoto. And if this is not enough to capture your attention, the stunning awe is reflected back onto the entire classes reaction as you can see the girls fall in love and the boys also falling in love and, or being jealous of the situation. To think this short five-ten second .Gif was enough for me to try out the first episode and I am so glad that I did. \\n\\n\r\nFrom this point, the story tells us about Sakamoto and his interactions with each character to show us how suave, resourceful and gentleman-like Sakamoto really is and how we can either fall in love with him too or aspire to be like him.\\n\\n\r\nSo would I recommend this anime? Yes, if everything you have read previous to this has appealed to you. Or if you're interested in watching an anime which has comedic value, relatable scenes or able to take an anime which could be possible in the real world but is highly unlikely. At the very least I would recommend that you try at least one episode as the anime is a change of pace from most other animes, including the ones in its own genre.\\n\\n\r\nHappy watching.\\n",

And oddly thatch why I love it, I mentioned in my Tanaka-kun is always listless that there were two anime that were polar opposite, and this is the other half.  \r\nWere always told not to make a Gary Stu or Mary Sue and to try to avoid it, but it works here because it's so entertaining, he does everything with this perfectflair and style that you can't help but love it.   And that is what makes this anime good to me, it's a series of episodes with two stories in most of them, just enough to give you what you want in each one without over staying their welcome.\\n\\n\r\nBut what also works with the anime is that every character in the series is entertaining too in their own ways, and they work with Moussaka and grow up with him.  \\n\\n\r\nOver all this was a good series, I'm hope there will be a second season, but we know how often anime like this don't get it, so while it would be disappointing it's understandable.\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a hearty 10 out of 10, it seems odd and maybe the anime is like a gary stu itself but I never found any real faults with it.",

With only a handful of returning characters, each one of them are likable and unique and play very well off of each other. This show doesn't take itself too seriously and loves to play by the rule of cool, which I admire. \r\nSakamoto himself is OP and knows it, and so does everyone else. This doesn't keep things boring, though. Watching all of theinventive ways he pulls off stunts and gets things done never fails to put a smile on my face as I cheer him on. And the always perfectly timed theme puts the right amount of energy into every scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe simplicity of the story and the humor really gives works in the favor of the show. You never go in expecting to much and are pleasantly surprised when the show throws you a curveball. The side characters act as great foils for Sakamoto as he stylishly makes his way through life, leaving them crashing in his wake of glory.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Swagamoto gets a 9/10 in my book. It's trash, but it's some one of the best I've seen recently.",

They even showed me the pictures. Who's the perfect guy you say? Haven't you heard? He's Sakamoto.\r\nSakamoto desu ga? Well I bet a huge portion of you know him. A highschool slice of life comedy that tells the daily life of a young, aspiring, passionate student Sakamoto. There is almost no story being told here, well it's about highschool and there's the slice of life genre, of course there isn't much story to be expected, it's actuallyreally simple, it's about Sakamoto, do I have to say more?\\n\\n\r\nThe art style doesn't really hit me that much, sure it is more unique than the typical anime I've seen, it is just not appealing enough to me, nevertheless it attracted people into watching it for its quirky art and seperates it from the normie looking anime, so I would say it's done its job. The animation budget is way over the top, I can see it now, two drunk coworkers at night deciding what is the best way to make a highschool boy more interesting than he is, the other guy was like, \"Bruh, have you even watched Nichijou?\" and then the other guy was like, \"Say no more fam!\" very smooth animation with comic style slides delivered a very strong punchline everytime a joke happened.\\n\\n\r\nI frickin love the music and the audio overall, especially the opening. Nothing gets you pumped for a hilarious show than the opening for Sakamoto desu ga? The song, man it is catchy, even a year past and I still can hear the rhythm in my head, it's even more so memorable with the opening scene, I could place it side by side with the ending of Danshi koukousei no nichijou, and that means a lot coming from me.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters vary from one to the other, and get this, it actually has character development! Can you believe it, a highschool anime with actual character development!? Everyone slowly changes from the influence of Sakamoto, even the bad guys, I would say Sakamoto's best friend changes a LOT throughout the anime, the special episode could really confuse you if you're not familiar with him enough.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime was lighthearted, cheerful and a fun show to watch to pass the time, or a day.... I doubt there will be a season 2 but we all hope it would happen, however with the ending of the show, it would ruin the punchline, so I'm kind of 50/50 with that thought.\\n\\n\r\nYou all might think I'm crazy and full of it, but one day, when you call Sakamoto, you will get a call from me instead. SAKAMOTO, LET ME WORK FOR YOU! I HAVE FOLDABLE THUMBS!",

Everyone either loves him or hates him because he's perfect, but he does stupid things to make people avoid him or to solve problems.

            "content": "So cool, so cool. He is the coolest character. From washing plates to molding flour to everything you could ever imagine, he does all of it in the coolest way possible. Ladies-no, even males get enamored by this man's coolness it's so unfair! How could such a human being exist? No, wait, is he even human? Whatever his identity is, one thing's for sure. He's the one and only coolest guy that you will ever see in your entire life. What?! Who the heck am I talking about?! Haven't you heard about him?! I'm talkin' about SAKAMOTO! \r\nSakamoto desu ga is an anime adapted froma manga by Sano. I read a few chapters of it back then when it was still on its early stage and I found myself interested but a little disappointed due to the fact that the manga releases were quite few some years ago. And now it has become an anime and having seen that title, I immediately remembered and thought \"Wohooo...It's SAKAMOTO!\" except not! I wasn't really surprised given that I have read some of the manga chapters already and I found myself enjoying it at that time so adaptation was kind of imminent and hey, let's give this show a try and see if it'll manage to live up to my expectations(which were slightly above normal) and I needed some fun in my life anyway after so much depression Undertale caused me(ye ye I'm a pansy and take games seriously). So with that, I started watching Sakamoto desu ga. Each episode contained two to three story sections and Sakamoto's the star,like always, which wasn't bad because I have to admit, he was truly a cool and a likeable guy but perhaps that's just what my girl hormones is trying to make me feel, anyway, he was so cool and so funny in everything he does that I always find myself laughing already even just upon hearing that goofy cool Sakamoto theme song that's played whenever he was now about to show an absurdly, ridiculous yet cool \"technique\" to end a problem in a very neat and again, a very cool way. Surely, you have noticed that I used the word \"cool\" excessively but I have to put so much emphasis to that because that's the point! You should watch this show just to see how COOL Sakamato is. Anyway, it's still early for you to get convinced so I will now further enhance my skills to GENUINELY convince you to watch it. Ehermm...You must be thinking that Sakamoto's only quality is his coolness...well, you're right, that could be his only quality but I have to say now, Sakamoto has become the star of the show only because of the strong supporting cast and add to that his coolness and Sakamoto desu ga truly became such an entertaining show that combined everything from comedy to little drama to some bittersweet romance - it was really a fun ride overall. Music department, hoho, proved to be quite commendable as well which I realized maybe too late? Anyway, about EXACTLY halfway of the show, I took notice of the variety of instruments used on the BGMs and they were handled greatly, not that I'm a music hardcore fan, but I really found myself getting carried away by the arrangement and the scene made an even more impact to me than that in the manga. And since I'm a piano fan, I also fell in love with the piano theme BGMs which thankfully, were quite a handful. And to ignore the supporting casts would be an act of heresy so I'll now tell you how amazing these people were and how they managed to be so likeable like the protagonist of the show. To make it clear and to avoid excessive spoilers, I'll just mention some few characters which I won't say if they're the best supporting casts or not. That's for you to figure out once you watch the show. So first we have Aina Kuronuma, a cute,conniving, seductive girl that likes Sakamoto, actually, almost everybody likes Sakamoto but that's not what I'm trying to say. Given her characteristics, it was pretty much obvious that this girl is the type that acts all cutesy but beneath that veil lies an evil intent and you are correct. She really is a little bit of a sweet yet evil girl trope. Still, what's wrong with adding some ugliness? That's what humans are and the show never did shy away about the dark realities of life which made for an even enganging situation. Course', Sakamoto Desu ga is not a dark, depressing show. So the characters will change from being a very despising person to a slightly less atrocious human being in the blink of an eye but the way it was done - it all felt natural. And with each last few minutes of each episodes, I found myself smiling telling to myself how Sakamoto ended everything so neatly and so heartwarmingly again. And again, with each few last minutes of each episode, the supporting casts were given some great character developments that I can't help but feel satisfied every week back when it was still ongoing. Yeah, also noone could ever forget Acchan(actually forgot his real name) - an \"uke\" ,hrm, clearly he's a freakin' fujoshi bait! I have to admit he was a very funny guy and I can't help but pair him up with Sakamoto and Hayabusa or whatever and I must add, he's voiced by Gintoki's VA. Ahg, an eargasmic voice he has....OK.. Sorry, this is digressing too much. Anyway, Acchan was a delinquent and Sakamoto straightened him up. That will happen in the first episode so spoiled you there, but really, how Sakamoto changed him was what really mattered as it's golden. It's really funny remembering that scene what with the ridiculousness of Sakamoto's antics, they just never grow old even if you had anticipated it. The animation also did its job well. Cool, just like Sakamoto. \\n\\n\r\nSakamoto Desu ga was truly an entertaining show. It was ridiculously hilarious, well deserved of its genre, and offers a variety of gags to keep it fresh even until the last episode. Impressively done cute dramas that never felt forced and heartwarming conclusions to every problems that arise in every episodes coupled with loveable casts truly make for a nice heartfelt experience that I haven't felt since a long time in my life. So surely you've heard it clearly now, how COOL Sakamoto really is.\\n",

            "content": "Calling Sakamoto Desu Ga a comedic masterpiece would be an understatement, not to mention trite on my part, so I\u2019ll call it what it is: Sakamoto is a poignant comedic melodrama that not only makes you laugh often, but also packs an outstanding final moral that retains its comedic impact, but also refrains from sounding preachy. \r\nAt the same time Sakamoto develops side characters, whilst balancing consistently funny surreal comedy that not only does the aforementioned development of characters, but also criticizes the Gary Stu archetype. \r\nIn short, I enjoyed this show quite a bit, no that\u2019s wrong, I loved it. But, it had afew issues, more on that later. \\n\\n\r\n1.) Story. \\n\\n\r\nSakamoto is nothing mind-blowing or intricate, it won\u2019t alter your perception of humanity or give you some astounding revelation that will change you forever. Rather, Sakamoto works as an episodic comedy with continuity. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the comedy boils down to Swagamoto (I saw this name in another review, credit to whomever wrote it) being impossibly perfect, and due to this perfection some dunce(s) decides to outdo Swagamoto but ultimately gets defeated. That is Sakamoto in its entirety. \\n\\n\r\nWithout visual accompaniment I can\u2019t thoroughly describe Sakamoto\u2019s brand of comedy without saying, \u201cCrazy shit happens, and it\u2019s obvious that the animators had loads of fun breaking the laws of physics, via Swagamoto\u2019s undeniable swagger.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nWhile this act remains funny throughout, some of Swagamoto\u2019s antics can get tiring-seriously, what was up with Swagomoto constantly manipulating air?-especially when the punchline never changes. It can get boring admittedly, chiefly in the intermittent episodes (7 and 8 I think?). \\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, it still remained interesting. I smiled at the secondary characters, and still enjoyed the majority of these \u2018boring\u2019 episodes. \\n\r\nSo, I award Sakamoto a solid 8/10 for story, only deducting two points for some repetitive humor, and the same punchline being recycled. \\n\\n\r\n2.) Characters. \\n\\n\r\nBy far the most incredible thing about Sakamoto is humanizing its secondary characters. Unfortunately, this depth cannot be extended to Swagamoto himself, which, honestly is ok, that\u2019s the joke anyway! He\u2019s unbelievably perfect, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. \\n\\n\r\nWith Swagamoto himself constantly giving life lessons, or bolstering a classmate\u2019s confidence I thought for sure, \u201cOk, they\u2019re going to pull in new retards each episode to look dumb for laughs. Got it.\u201d But, no, that\u2019s not the case. Sakamoto utilizes the same characters, giving them arcs and the needed depth to keep an anime afloat. \\n\\n\r\nThere was a certain amount of intimacy I felt with these secondary characters due to their humanity. \\n\\n\r\nFor Sakamoto\u2019s characters I award a 9/10, deducting one point for Swagamoto\u2019s character, or rather, lack thereof. Not saying Swagamoto himself isn\u2019t a good character! Just that he lacks humanity. \\n\\n\r\n3.) Art. \\n\r\nImpressive, very impressive, minimal frame stutters, and appropriate usage of still-frames. It\u2019s a pet-peeve of mine for an anime to constantly use still-frames, so I was happy with the animator\u2019s restraint on using still-frames. \\n\\n\r\nNever once in this anime was anything an eyesore, colors blended and fused nicely, characters looked proportionate, and the animation had fluidity to it. \\n\r\nHowever, there was the occasional animation stutter, and in episode 9 I think (?) certain character\u2019s had jarring micro arms, very unsettling. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs were also fantastic, props to whoever designed Swagamoto. He is an unbelievable caricature of every anime Gary Stu ever conceived. From his physicality to his demeanor, Swagamoto is an amalgam of every awful anime protagonist. Amplified by 10,000,000, then allowed to simmer in his swag. \\n\\n\r\nFor art, I award Sakamoto an 8/10, deducting two points for those disturbing micro arms, and stutters. \\n\\n\r\n4.) Sound. \\n\r\nProbably the most underwhelming aspect of Sakamoto is its music, specifically its reliance on Sakamoto\u2019s theme, and a (funny) melancholic theme. Both are rather good pieces, setting the tone for scenes, but were used with such frequency that I grew tired of hearing the same notes. \\n\\n\r\nCouldn\u2019t they have, I don\u2019t know, at least altered segments of the music for the sake of variety? \\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, I award Sakamoto a 7/10 for music, deducting three points for the repetition of these themes. You\u2019ll find yourself laughing at these themes for the first four episodes, but soon after you will be annoyed. \\n\\n\r\n5.) Enjoyment. \\n\r\nPersonally, this is the funniest anime I\u2019ve ever seen. This isn\u2019t hyperbole, I\u2019m not fanboying. This is the comedy to watch for the summer season. \\n\\n\r\nAs someone who has watched loads of disappointing comedic anime that began promising but sizzled into nothing, Sakamoto is refreshing in its consistency of comedy. \\n\\n\r\nI, subjectively, award Sakamoto a 9/10. Deducting only 1 point for the intermittent episode\u2019s being slower than their predecessors and successors. \\n\\n\r\n6.) Overall. \\n\\n\r\nWatch this anime if you enjoy comedy, specifically surreal comedy that works in the realm of nonsense. If you respect comedy as an art form I suggest watching Sakamoto.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "There were many things that I initially didn\u2019t like about this show. Our protagonist is essentially a perfect Japanese dandy-man. He aces in studies and sports, is utterly popular among all the silly girls and boys, and can do anything at any moment and still be cool. Maybe I was biased because he reminds me of some of the cool kids in school while I was the so-so?\r\nAnd more than that, his sidekicks consists of a wannabe comedian/model (man, Shikamaru in the future really changed), a fixated girl who\u2019d do anything to get his attention, and an unattractively pitiful weakling (I\u2019d like to insist Idon\u2019t relate myself to him, if it\u2019s of any use\u2026). \\n\\n\r\nEven the bad guys aren\u2019t very interesting. Their motives seem to just revolve around getting a one up on him or to satisfy their own pride. The voice acting is average overall, though Mr Dandy\u2019s is spot on. Not surprising, as the voice actor also plays Yoshino from Clannad, another cool dandy-like character. The animation is alright, I found it amusing how some characters are made particularly unattractive (no hate please, SJWs). Also a few parts just made me frown with disbelief.\\n\\n\r\nBut yet, the way this dandy-man goes about his crazy days is hilarious, from simple things like putting out a fire and dramatic things like evading middle-aged cougars. Throw any problem at him, and he\u2019ll resolve with such style and flair that you\u2019d end up laughing at how absurd it is. Even normal stuff becomes hilarious when he does it. Like sweeping the ceiling, yeah, that\u2019s right\u2026 the ceiling. And when things get real, it only gets better as almost all your expectations are wiped out by this guy.\\n\\n\r\nAnytime he speaks, you end up wondering more and more how on earth his mind ticks. And that only makes it all the funnier because while everyone else thinks and acts rationally according to their characters, he\u2019s that wild card that you can bet would do something others would never consider. And when he decides to do something, everything ultimately ends up going his way in a manner that is not at all boring. Also, almost everything he says can be taken in multiple ways or has some sort of poetic ring to it. Very clever, very sly. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I did say that some voice acting could be better, the soundtrack fits perfectly. That jazz tune whenever he takes the spotlight is the anthem for this show, and the opening and closing songs are pretty good. This show throws some amazing curveballs at you. It\u2019s great fun trying to think what on earth will happen, only to end up chuckling when it is revealed. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then comes the last episode, when for the very first time, we see our dandy man show real human emotions for just a few seconds. Beautiful, just beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in short? He\u2019s that creature Haruhi Suzumiya is seeking. He is Sasuke\u2019s cool genius with Naruto\u2019s spontaneous badassery. And, the only way I can justify the plausibility of his existence is to claim he is an alien, which has been hinted quite a few times in the show, especially regarding his dream career. Yes. He is an alien from the Citadel, sent to Earth to elevate humanity to a new level of evolution and discover the Charon mass relay. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a good laugh and not an intricate plotline that involves flowcharts and relationship diagrams, this is for you. \\n",

            "content": "Showing that even the coolest characters can be quirky as well, Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto redefines the term \"eccentricity\".\r\nThere is nothing too grand in scale when it comes to the story. Each episode contains at least two parts that entail different stories. Most of them are set in the school, while the others are outside of that setting. If it weren't for the fact that the series is a full adaptation of the manga (which only lasted a little over 20 chapters), I kind of wished there was more. everything that happens comes into play later in the finale, which I still liked. However,I feel like a series such as this doesn't really need to have a definite ending and be more like several one-shot stories regarding the antics of Sakamoto. Other than that, it was still enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThis show would not be what it is had it not been for the characters. In this, we have the main character, who is either the prime focus or a driving point for other characters. While I do love Sakamoto as a character, I also find myself loving the others that interact with him. We only focus on one class, which has most of our cast, and we get to see how well everyone acts as a class. It would have been boring if Sakamoto was the only person that had any real personality, so with the others in the mix makes it a good blend.\\n\\n\r\nI can't really say anything much about the animation. While, for the most part, being pretty well done, there's not a whole lot you can do with a school setting. There aren't any dazzling spectacles or any fantasy-like elements that sticks out. It's simple animation that fits with its type of setting.\\n\\n\r\nWhen this was announced, I decided to read the manga beforehand to see what it was like (I managed to finish with a couple episodes left), which got me excited for its premiere. As I said, a premise like Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto probably could have work better if there was more focus on little incidents involving the main character kind of like the ones that occurred outside of school. However, what I was given (characters, story, etc.) still made he glad that I watched the show all the way through.",

And there's a reason why he's cool, cooler and coolest.\r\nUsually, perfect characters don't often get much attention. It's mostly written off as lazy writing. Characters like this are often called Gary Stu. These kind of characters are those who are good at everything without any explanation whatsoever. Usually, it's a bad idea to use these kinds of characters because they lose connection with the audience. But can we say that Sakamoto is a Gary Stu?\r\nHeck no!\r\nIn truth, Sakamotois completely different from this stereotype. For one, he is not based on lazy writing. Since the series is a comedy, you'd expect a klutzy idiot to be the MC. But Sakamoto changed that idea. This show proved that you don't need a funny character to be a comedy. What's important is the impact it has on the audience. And this is what Sakamoto has shown us. \\n\\n\r\nAnd another thing: what makes him so cool is not his appearance or his style. It's his personality, his compassion and willingness to help his neighbors. This itself shows a strong message to the viewers: you don't need to look cool to be loved, you just need a big heart. And that 's what makes Sakamoto cool, cooler, coolest!\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this to casuals and elitists alike. Even if you're not a fan of anime, I swear, you'll love this show. Because once you see it, you'll know who Sakamoto is.",

The reason for their character development was Sakamoto, which is what made them and the story worse.

            "content": "This is my second review and I couldn't be happier to review this anime, because it actually makes me laugh.\r\nStory: 7\r\nSakamoto desu ga? doesn't have a plot, it has a premise. A premise is different from something with a continually progressing story, which is a plot. It must've been difficult to make a decent/good anime with a premise as shows like that can't make it that far for someone with my attention span. I have a very short one. So your premise needs to set your series up for success. At first I thought it was going to be a harem about a perfect man,but I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nHe is a stylish and perfect character and is almost always alienating people around him as his perfection seems a little inhuman for the standard high school boy. \\n\\n\r\nThis premise set the show up for success because it knows that he is perfect. It isn't like Kirito from SAO that is like, ya know, god. Wanna know why that was bad? Cause they expected you to take it seriously! \\n\\n\r\nBecause of this, Sakamoto Desu Ga? is entertaining as it nails into your head that nothing should be taken seriously and doesn't mock your intelligence when it does nail the fact in your head.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisuals: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis art is...really pretty. It sets a little bit more for a standard for normal TV anime especially one that takes place in high school and during freeze frames I like pausing my screen to stare at it's prettiness and the animation flows and moves just a tad bit more than the standard as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nI like the main theme often playing when Sakamoto shows off his style and other songs. I like the OP and ED though I wouldn't listen to it on my own. The voice acting is decent at best and the voices fit their character and I just enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nI love these characters. Not really Sakamoto. I feel like Sakamoto is there as a way of developing and helping us to get to know these characters.\\n\\n\r\nI can sympathize with a lot of the characters as a lot of them seem really depressed until Sakamoto comes into their life which is kinda heart warming. It reminds me of the first few seasons of Spongebob Squarepants.\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto himself makes me happy because despite being perfect, he is so inhuman and alienating to so many people. I like that concept.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nWhat you all came for is the comedy and you can enjoy it no matter what element you're seeking from Sakamoto Desu Ga(?). It is random. It is whacky. It is weird.\\n\\n\r\nWe have an element of surprise which makes comedy, well, comedy. Fart jokes are never enjoyable when you predict them and they've been on the screen the whole time, but when you surprise a viewer with one it can make them laugh, especially in a relatively normal scene.\\n\\n\r\nIn every joke and tangent we get surprise making the sometimes immature jokes funny despite how childish they can be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nOnce again pretend there is a synopsis. I know saying that isn't good for reviewing but really you should have a fun time watching this anime.",

            "content": "The best way that I can describe Sakamoto Desu ga?  (Haven't you heard I'm Sakamoto) is that, it feels a bunch of youtube videos that someone saw and, thought that a show could be made out of it. That is how I got introduced to the show through youtube surfing and, they clips of the show were pretty hilarious.\r\nThe show itself was very entertaining and, had elements of comedic brilliance with its fair share of laugh out loud moments. Some of the situations the show presented was very unique and, something that we haven't really seen in a school setting. Adding on to thatthe high-school environment was used brilliantly such as sports, science and, especially dealing with bullies.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the show were memorable in their own right and, each given a moment to shine. However, because the show was only twelve episodes not all of them received massive development. The biggest victim of development was Sakamoto, he is an awesome character and, defiantly commands your attention when he is on screen. Even though he is totally awesome we know little to nothing about him. We don't know his motivation, backstory or even how he is able to be perfect.\\n\\n\r\nMany people compare Sakamoto to Saitama from One Punch Man, they are similar in many ways, but the difference between the two is that we know Saitama's motivation and, we feel a connection towards him in the end. I feel that Skamoto would be a great side character instead of a main character but, I enjoyed watching him on screen. The side characters were, quite entertaining and, some of their stories were great to witness with the standouts being Hayabusa, Maeda Atsushi and,Yoshinobu Kubota. Each of these guys went through a change throughout the show because of Sakamoto. The students of Sakamoto's classroom were all really fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest downfall of the show is its flow. Each episode feels like two or three clips put together to form an episode. There isn't even a real storyline till the eighth episode, thats two thirds of just filler. I understand that a show like this does not really need a great story as its more character driven but, it certainly needed more time as the execution was rushed and, weak. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was well done, Studio Deen (who I've never even heard of) did a really good job on the character and, location designs. The animation of the opening sequence was brilliant and the song coolest perfectly matched the show and, its tone. The OST was overall decent but, aside from the opening none of them are quite memorable. Also, the show has great rain animation, the way the rain was animated in the show was better than a few of the underwater scenes in the Aquaman movie.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sakamoto Desu ga? was a very entertaining anime I did enjoy but, there was no real substance to the show. It had its moments and, a few clips are definitely with rewatching such as the episode where Skamoto becomes a personal assistant or gets for karaoke but as an overall show its good but, not great. \\n",

            "content": "Sakamoto Desu ga? is one of those shows that can make you laugh, but this is certainly not a show for everyone. With it's unique sense of humour, and a storyline, which does not actually follow any specific concepts, instead it presents you with various scenarios, that Sakamoto goes through on a daily basis. With his cool headed character, and the way in which he preforms various task, in a matter of fact over exaggerated way, which most of us find ridiculous. But for Sakamoto, no task is truly a challenge, as  he performs it in a matter of fact perfect way. With hisupfront attitude, you simply cannot dislike his character completely. The fact that all of the actions seems to be centred  about him being a perfect class example, and doing everything perfectly, seems a slight drag on. Of course, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the comedic moments of this show, but none the less like most shows out there, there's of course place for improvement. Perhaps the creators, of this how could have given the show different perspectives, like focusing a bit more on how other people around him, react to the way he performs his actions, or maybe have a focus on what they think of him. Of course, not saying that this show was bad, but there could have been more added to it, to make it seem less like a repetitive concept of him being a perfectionist in everything.",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nThere really isn't much of a story in Sakamoto. it's the usual high school life up to a graduation, but this Anime main goal is of course comedy. And I gotta say, it has a very unique and odd comedy, which is simply priceless. So as far the plot goes, it's simply presentation of a ultra elegant and gentleman of a man called Sakamoto. The elegance is taken up to a whole new level and in a comedic manner. For the most part it's very enjoyable episodiccomedy show with a really odd style to it that ain't supposed to taken seriously at all.\\n\\n\r\nBut, here is as well a issue. A lot of jokes end up end up being very stale, overextended and repetitive, in not a good way. As far as \"random comedy\" Anime go, this one felt a bit weak. It did have quite few moments that gave me a good chuckle but at the same time there were a lot of moments where it felt simply \"tedious\" and eventually even started fast-forwarding. Which is simply a not good mark.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end, it was good enough and had plenty of funny \"elegance\" moments.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art&Sound\\n\r\nWell, animation and art was good. Nothing too impressive, but fairly enjoyable and pleasing as needed.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, music had some gold tracks. Main theme was simply catchy and joyful and some of the songs were as well actually quite good. Plus the utter classic moment was probably one of my favorite moments of this Anime.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment&Overall\\n\r\nUnique, odd, elegant. The dream of every girl on every planet and target of jealousy of every male. Jokes aside, it was simply fun Anime, but as mentioned, it was at the same time quite often stale, repetitive and tedious.\\n\\n\r\nThe good part is, it got my praise from it. And I feel like praising it by giving final score of 7 rather than 6. My stamp of \"Approval\". You can imagine it.",

            "content": "If ever you've wanted to see a master of \"winging it\" and making every situation work to his advantage, Sakamoto is that person. For those who play RPGs you know that character creation is a balance, you can't have it all- well Sakamoto has it all; he has perfect strength, perception, awareness, intelligence, stamina, and even luck. This show is about him acting cool in all situations. If you take Onizuka's indomitable spirit from GTO and translate that into unshakeable coolness, that's this show.\r\nIn my opinion, the show is definitely overrated. Though there are some neat moments, it was canceled out by the impractical natureof the stunts and antics. If you're looking for someone to be envious about, this might be your show. If you're annoyed by improbable yet persistent plot shields against anything going wrong, this is going to be a painful one. In any case, the first episode is a good litmus test to get your feet wet.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Animation:[/b]\\n\r\nThe animation in Sakamoto is a bit different from your typical cute-girl-packed show; the starting basics are relatively plain though. The show has an average amount of overall detail and shading. The background consists of urban landscapes and the school, with a surprisingly high amount of greenery. What makes the animation unique is a combination of the characters and special comic-like styling that occasionally appears. The character focus here is strongly on Sakamoto, and so it's probably on purpose that the other characters don't particularly stand out. Used to seeing girls with lots of accessories? Not happening here. Looking for moe in your girls? Not happening here either. Even the class idol Aina is toned down compared with your typical action-based harem heroine. As for the guys, you have everything from a chubby, girl-faced weakling to slit-eyed gangsters, you're not going to find any bishounens here.\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto has a bit of action but nothing strong enough to call a defining characteristic. Expect a bit of violence and a bit of blood, but it still is just a school-centric slice-of-life so nothing too extreme. There isn't any ecchi here, if anything there's anti-ecchi in the form of many chubby, older married moms showing up and chasing after the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Sound:[/b]\\n\r\nSakamoto opens with a rock-based, purposely made song; while unique, I liked neither the randomness of the melody nor the male singer. The ED has a better melody but is also slow enough to put even rowdy children to sleep. The BGM is pretty standard fare until Sakamoto does anything cool, which triggers the show's signature melody; given how often he does something \"cool\" you can't help but get used to the theme.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really got me to take the plunge for the show was the VA cast; seriously, when was the last time you heard the likes of Yukari Tamura, Yui Horie, Mai Nakahara, and Kana Ueda all in the same show? Given the \"cool\" nature of Sakamoto, a lot of the other characters spend a lot of time commenting on how awesome he is. The cast did a pretty good job throughout though I thought Yui Horie did an especially convincing job voicing Aina.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Story:[/b]\\n\r\nSakamoto is all about, well, Sakamoto of course. He's the envy of everyone who wants to be cool given his talents in everything and so various classmates and other entities do their best to trip him up. Unfortunately, for them, he always seems to be able to outplay everyone, often converting them to his side in the process.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is pretty episodic for the most part, often with two sub-plots per episode. Honestly, some of these sections are weird (Sakamoto playing walk on the line with elementary kids) and others are a tad off-putting (Yoshinobu's crazed mom). I didn't find have a particular arc that I thought was standout until the last quarter of the season, where a bit of tension finally builds in the show. There isn't much of a climax and the last episode wraps things up fairly nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall tonality of the show varies, much of it is rather light and playful but there are some serious moments as well. The comedy is not really in my taste as Sakamoto's behavior and everyone else's reactions don't really add up for me, no one finds it in any way immature for Sakamoto to walk as if in a parade while on the way out during a fire drill...\\n\\n\r\n[b]Character:[/b]\\n\r\nRegardless of my opinion of the comedy, there's no doubt that Sakamoto is one of the more unique characters out there. I'd probably liken him most to Karasuma from School Rumble, somewhat distant and aloof yet always able to surprise and overachieve. His immense breadth and depth of talent set him apart from your typical character, but his lack of any shortcomings makes him impossible to relate with.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a large supporting cast for the show; many of the characters are featured in a sub-episode segment before blending into the growing crowd of Sakamoto admirers. I wasn't particularly impressed with either the depth of the characters or their development, and (obviously) believe they spent excessive time on Yoshinobu's mom. Though some of the interactions were funny, don't expect any real depth of character bonding.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Value:[/b]\\n\r\nSakamoto is definitely a unique show and for that, it deserves kudos. However, despite the uniqueness and the strong VA cast, the show just doesn't rub me the right way. Not to say I'm jealous of the dude as heck it's fiction, but a character who is utterly flawless really just gets boring quickly. Though some of the latter episodes were a bit more fun, especially the college mixer, it doesn't balance out the lukewarm feeling felt throughout the rest of the show. Overall, it's a fair watch but by no means a match for the hype. Therefore, I end with my own secret technique: surprise disappointment.\\n",

            "content": "Nobody in this world is perfect. That was what we were learned when we were small children. However, this statement is proved false, with Sakamoto proving otherwise. In the world of Sakamoto desu ga? we explore the life of Sakamoto, showing us the very definition of cool.\r\nIn my opinion, comedy anime never need an amazing story. They just need to have good reasons to make us laugh. Although the story isn't the most original, it is certainly good. To have the perfect person encounter the different problems people bring onto him was a good story that brought hilarious over-exaggerated events. To keep it simple, thestory is good, not amazing, but is enough to make anyone (relatively) laugh hard.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, the overall quality was good. The sound wasn't amazing, but it definitely wasn't bad. Overall, the sound was good. On the art and animation sides, it was really good. In most cases, it was okay, with the usual animation we see in other anime. However, when it is time to show the coolness of Sakamoto, the animation skyrockets. Everything suddenly becomes more intense, and the animation helps showcase that. Overall, the art and animation is decent for most of the time, but have some \"sakuga\" moments that help to show how cool Sakamoto is.\\n\\n\r\nWhen talking about characters in Sakamoto desu ga?, the first character we would think of is Sakamoto. However, if you didn't know, there are other characters in this anime (Wow, who would have known! My mind is blown!). Despite having the whole series revolving around Sakamoto, the characters are just as interesting, and do have a bit of development to them. Many side characters are fun to see react to the crazy things Sakamoto pulled off. As for Sakamoto, he does not get any development, as there is nothing to develop. He is just too perfect to be changed. While some may think that is a problem, thinking that he will eventually become a boring character, which is not entirely false, but can be forgiven because of his coolness. Overall, the characters good, with some of the supporting getting a bit of development.\\n\\n\r\nAre you familiar with a decrescendo? If not, it is a decrease in loudness, mostly used in music. That is a reflection of my laughter. I started this anime with a laughter at ff, or fortissimo. After a few episodes, the decrescendo was dropped on, reducing my laughter to small giggles. If you didn't understand that, it basically means that the jokes started becoming repetitive, making them somewhat predictable, and not making them have the full effect they would have initially have on me. However, that does not mean that the anime will be boring by the end. There will always be a few surprises awaiting inside an anime. Once those are revealed, be ready to laugh. Overall, I really enjoyed watching this anime, despite it becoming predictable by the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed watching this anime. It is a hilarious comedy series that made me laugh every single episode. Although I mentioned that it gradually repetitive, it can easily be forgiven, because this show is just that funny. Overall, I would recommend you giving Sakamoto desu ga? a try, if you like any hilarious over-exaggerated events, and don't mind having the same joke repeated somewhat continuously.\\n",

The art is sort of meticulous since the main character is being portrayed as elegant. The characters are not that remarkable, but they are interested in their own ways. The elegant and jazz music background suits the anime. To me, I did enjoywatching the anime so far I was not bored it just a different style or attack to how it shows the main protagonist.

            "content": "Perfection has always been one of the most utmost desires humanity has ever had. Frankly, it\u2019s easy to see why. We people naturally want what we feel is better for us, whether it be by improving one\u2019s attributes, or even by obtaining the greatest and latest in, what we believe are, materializations of ecstasy. In a way, such a desire is carved into our genes, forming an inevitable instinct. As such, for centuries, the cycle of humanity\u2019s longing for perfection has gone through constant loops without bearing sufficient enough fruit. Tidbits of the world\u2019s history have accounted the presence of this cycle, both vaguely andexplicitly. Moreover, philosophers have long argued out with each other as to what exactly defines the concept of \u201cperfection\u201d we so seek. Yet, as more theories are regurgitated, more questions arise as to what can exactly be defined as \u201cperfect\u201d, so to speak. Is it found in the state of one\u2019s being, our relationships with other people, or our accomplishments? Despite all our struggles at an attempt towards perfection and grasping its meaning, we\u2019ll likely never reach the age in which we can present to our fellow homo sapiens what exactly defines our desires.\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto of Sakamoto Desu Ga, however, has achieved that very perfection and other aspects of grand calibers in just his very state of adolescence. Undeniably, such is a feat that even the most epic of legends can ever hope to describe in bountiful analogical detail. Having attributes that are the equivalent to that of an omnipotent divinity, Sakamoto constantly excels at everyday difficulties with radiance and class. Dangerous obstacles pose no harm to a modest Sakamoto, quite the contrary. The very obstacles up against Sakamoto\u2019s path rid of their malicious intents via reaching a transcendent of purpose upon the simple touch of Sakamoto\u2019s graceful forgiveness. And very much like those purified obstacles which Sakamoto has benefitted, Sakamoto\u2019s mere presence itself is akin to that of a magnificent fragrance that attracts all and transfigures us all. A mere walk taken by Sakamoto along a mundane park produces the blossoming of a multitude of flowers, along with the rising of the glorious sun. Those behind Sakamoto\u00b4s shadow gather around, praising his perfection beyond the extent that a theological figure holds. The rituals in which they participate in know no bounds; all are welcome in the hands of Sakamoto. Not that us plebeians can even absorb anything from Sakamoto's teachings without our sinful nature crawling its way out of us. Nonetheless, evidence of a blessing on humanity has never become as evident as Sakamoto's existence itself. Truly, there must be some kind of god out there. And that god, by all means, must be Sakamoto. \\n\\n\r\nAlright, let\u2019s remove all the memetic mutations Sakamoto has formed and get real. Sakamoto Desu Ga?\u2019s initial premise practically oozes out criticism in a single word: redundancy. After all, its primary genre is slice of life; a genre that invites viewers to immerse themselves into the tiny worlds of characters\u2019 mundane lives. When taking this into consideration, redundancy is definitely a crucial flaw that can easily pry itself in at any moment. Sakamoto Desu Ga?\u2019s premise of its titular character frolicking around as the participant of shenanigans in which he is a metaphorical god in is bound to get tiring fast. It practically discourages any curiosity one might have on wasting their time on a show in which aestheticism is the only thing going for it. In the end of the day, Sakamoto will always have a gallant laugh after having confronted a challenge, drink some wine on a refined glass, and indulge in luxury. And, even then, viewers cannot relate themselves to a being rid of flaws. Whereas disposable characters with the likes of Kirito or Kyousuke from My Little Sister Can\u00b4t Be This Cute are structured to be wish-fulfillment, Sakamoto doesn't provide any gaps in his existence that one can squeeze themselves into. If anything, watching Sakamoto's constant gaining of achievements as the sun sets itself invites irrationality. Whether it be from the fruitless task of watching Sakamoto reach new frontiers effortlessly or pure envy from a lack of understanding Sakamoto's divinity. Sakamoto's singular quirk of perfection just doesn't meet the requirements for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOr so one would think after having read the synopsis on paper. I say this as I too was a victim of skepticism as to how exactly Sakamoto desu Ga would play out. Of course, you could always aim for the most obvious executions, such as making the most basic usage of Sakamoto's talent through the varying of situations. But with the haunting premise Sakamoto Desu Ga curses itself with, even such an approach isn't without its own flaws. The biggest challenge Sakamoto Desu Ga has to deal with is how it will fundamentally differentiate itself each time, not through the situations Sakamoto gets himself in, but rather on how its stylistic tone is each varying situation is implemented. Both as a parodic comedy that laughs at our existence, and as a stock gag series, it has to keep intact what makes it so thematically different without ever boring the audience. However, upon realizing this work was in the hands of Shinji Takamatsu, a director whom I believe is fairly brilliant when working with comedic anime, I knew I had nothing to fear. He's the very reason as to why Gintama gained the legacy it so holds today, discarding controversial opinions. And even without Gintama, the guy's handling of comedy has been shown to have, not only to be consistent but better throughout the years. Sakamoto's premise is by no means a factor one should worry about, as absolute utilization of the exploits in Sakamoto's outlines is something Takamatsu can surely handle well. And handled well he did, as Sakamoto Desu Ga\u00b4s conveying of comedy is truly a unique experience. While it never manages to even closely reach the impeccable altitude that it's titular character has erected, it does manage to reach heights that demand respect.\\n\\n\r\nThe most fundamental, yet difficult task that has to be dealt with is hooking us into Sakamoto's heavenly characteristics. For a majority of the time, regardless of the audience finding Sakamoto as their idolized figure or containment of vented hatred, our attachment to Sakamoto is what will influence our enjoyment throughout the show. This could be done by opting out for the promotional route, either by creating PVs highlighting Sakamoto's loftiness or making a Sakamoto-themed 3DS layout. Of course, none of these cheap tactics would've had any effect if I were to just blindly walk into Sakamoto's world. The molding of Sakamoto's essence within the show he inhabits is what truly matters. Contrary to this, however, Sakamoto Desu Ga? absolutely denies creating any further traits to Sakamoto's character beyond what was originally founded. Sakamoto is just an overwhelming cool being. No profound implications, just pure coolness. Don't worry about missing this crucial detail; the narrator at the beginning of most episodes will provide you with his description of Sakamoto's persona. A clearly direct reminder to us all that Sakamoto is a medium meant to produce coolness. \\n\\n\r\nYet, the maneuvering around any possible flaws such characterization brings is handled with cunningly well. The usage of the adjective \"cool\" under the circumstances of Sakamoto explicitly brings out subjectivity. How exactly one perceives a fellow being as having qualities remarkable enough to encourage casual praise is entirely based one's own personal beliefs of what fabricates a figure of sublime respect. Which prompts the question, \"What exactly is it about Sakamoto that makes him cool?\". And that very form of skepticism is something Sakamoto Desu Ga knows its audience will make, as it's a necessity to how it'll execute its portrayal of Sakamoto. Taking advantage of the seemingly one-note flaws under Sakamoto's persona allows a flexible utilization of the character in question. The surroundings around Sakamoto and how he responds to them are all based on the very idea that he's \"cool\", but they're completely indirect in portraying the slyness of Sakamoto. At one point, Sakamoto's breaking physics, at the other, he's practicing eccentric behaviors in solitude. If the viewer weren't fed on the idea of Sakamoto's nature, they'd possibly put themselves into a stump if they were to describe Sakamoto solely based on his isolated actions. But with the cool-tinted leans Sakamoto Desu Ga provides the viewer with, all the actions he so performs already fall into the default categorization of \"cool\". This form of in-your-face characterization is what stirs up questionability in determining if the very figure in question is indeed as directly described. The instance when you've fallen to that bait is when Sakamoto's essence will truly be cast upon your mindset, resulting in the joining of new brethren for Sakamoto's praise. Essentially, predetermination in characterization is what allows Sakamoto to shine. Any and all actions Sakamoto performs will now automatically be described as \"cool\" via Word of God, therefore, his character is in complete control simply because he can act in accordance to any whim he so carries without ever breaking the influence held in his presence.\\n\\n\r\n Of course, such a tactic can be discarded as wasted if it's not used effectively enough to at least maintain an interest in Sakamoto's legacy. Similarly, writing that requires a subtle form of manipulation to work to its full effect is practically impossible to maintain throughout. Having a couple of loose strings attached here and there is inevitable. Stubborn people whose pride doesn't permit them to watch a show with \"the same joke repeated consecutively\" won't infatuate themselves with Sakamoto. People who've been on the Sakamoto train ever since its premiere are prone to wear off their attention if Sakamoto's flexibility were to be abused enough to the point of making his extreme activities senselessly mundane. Such a form of inconsistency is something not even Sakamoto himself can control; comedy is most prone to become tiring due to how subjective humor as a whole is. In the case of Sakamoto, excessive exposure is what damages him the most. At times, watching Sakamoto's radiance be escalated causes an undesirable blinding light in enjoyment. Thankfully, the prolonging of neglection towards flaws isn't allowed. Even with the marginalization its rough edges cause at times, Sakamoto Desu Ga is able to prosper itself by handling the variation of situations its titular character is placed in with a tenderly ease acknowledgment of its strengths and shortcomings. \\n\\n\r\nWhere the core of Sakamoto's comedic value lies is in the situations Sakamoto is utilized in. Despite how conventional such an approach seems at first glance, the factors that depend on the situations are kept in resonance with the eccentric, stylistic charm the show holds. The warping of the original definition that \"cool\" had towards Sakamoto's character is done so by the surroundings around him testifying his endurance. Often times, his environments provide materialized obstacles or internal conflicts for Sakamoto to decimate.  Once presented, Sakamoto will begin accumulating towards tactics in which he will break through the problems indicated before a problematic experience fully launches itself on him. On first inspection, the formulaic structure of overcoming challenges is a hindrance that sticks out like a sore thumb. Yet, the issues Sakamoto faces don't ponder into the possibility of his outcomes being successful, such a thing is a given. It's not so much \"Will Sakamoto open the pickle jar?\", but rather, \"How will Sakamoto open the pickle jar while simultaneously exemplifying his wonderous eroticism?\" The developing of Sakamoto's tactical schemes and how he utilizes them in the most prosperous, randomized manner possible is key to the delivering of punchlines. Sometimes, the figure does some inhumanely ludicrous things. Other times, he unexpectedly performs with normality. The more poetic verses Sakamoto spouts while majestically reading a classic on the edge of a school window, the more one becomes curious with how the abilities and techniques Sakamoto will ploy tests the boundaries that his \"coolness\" can reach. This, of course, isn't to say the atmosphere he's in is merely present to become the victim of Sakamoto. In actuality, it's the mundane nature in each atmosphere he's implemented in that allows us to sneak a peek on Sakamoto's unmeasurable capabilities. The seemingly normal settings Sakamoto gets in are what amplitudes his sheer capacity to convey coolness. The settings don't accommodate their natural laws whenever Sakamoto's presence enters the field, rather, they welcome Sakamoto with warm hands without any of the irritating fanfare. Sakamoto's shenanigans being viewed as \"commonplace\" simply because his charisma allows him to makes his performances feel all the more \"cool\" instead of pathetically forced. \\n\\n\r\nContrary to what one might expect out of his sheer divinity, Sakamoto is not the figure that holds up the entire show on his shoulders. Sure, his legacy is plastered on everywhere as if the entire world were to revolve around Sakamoto and Sakamoto only, but appearances can only be so deceiving. Instead, the very people who envelop themselves to Sakamoto are the individuals who are tasked with structuring the show as a whole. A god's foundation cannot exist without any followers, and such is the case with Sakamoto. The side characters that happen to inhabit the same world as Sakamoto are where the value of the show derives from. The whole collective body of side characters are symbolic of the flawed, foolish attributes humanity holds, which is what allows Sakamoto's perfection to be properly measured as something far more than a concept. The functionality of the side characters isn't largely the equivalent of that of a peanut gallery, however. This isn't to say that their purpose at times doesn't come up to be as such, it does. After all, if it weren't, we wouldn't be able to properly perceive Sakamoto's display of transcendentalism as the extraordinary thing that it is. But they can only indulge in such praise because they themselves have none of the attributes Sakamoto possess. While it never invites for tone-breaking seriousness, the fact that each of the side characters shares their own self-conscious flaws is largely what determines their purpose in the narrative. For instance, fellow male adolescents in Sakamoto's class will let their jealousy towards Sakamoto's universal harem corrupt them. So much so that they take the action to become an obstacle in Sakamoto's path, in hopes of ruining his image. This forces Sakamoto to participate in their internal struggle in hopes of reaching a solution only he himself can achieve. If angsty delinquents aren't what's troubling Sakamoto today, then it'll be pubescent girls aiming to get a glimpse of the forbidden fruit. All of which are dealt with a small dose of Sakamoto\u00b4s mercy. Essentially, the opposition of conflicts between the side characters' struggles and Sakamoto's carefree state of perfection are what compose the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nDespite how cursorily the side characters are presented at times, Sakamoto Desu Ga does not aim to make itself a satire on humanity's futile grasping for power and ideals by having its embodiment of perfection kicking on them as if they were mere pebbles on the road. At any point, such an execution of Sakamoto's character would have made the premise justifiable, enough to make the snarkiness that surrounds the show all the more ensuing. Yet, Sakamoto Desu Ga opts itself out for a much more different road. Instead of exemplifying his gracefulness through the mockery of others, Sakamoto's way of going about others dilemma is much more benevolent. All the approaches Sakamoto takes whenever confronted with an internal struggle is beneficial, not to him, but to the people that he aids. Sakamoto does so by simply reaching out his hand to whoever calls out for enlightenment, in one way or another. In the end of the day, however, the people in his aid aren't rid of any of the flaws they hold just because Sakamoto helped them. No one ever reaches heights close to that of Sakamoto, but that's only because they don't need to anymore. Sakamoto's perfection is utilized by making side characters come to the realization that what they desire isn't perfection in everything, but rather a peaceful acceptance of their flaws. Whenever Sakamoto accomplishes such a task, the side characters simply move on with their lives under the teachings Sakamoto conveyed. Such scenes become unexpectedly heartwarming and genuinely endearing at times. And while they will by no means gauge out all your bodily fluids out of your eyes, they do add a complimentary layer of meaning to the show as a whole. Integrating light thematic substance into shows of Sakamoto's kind is considerably difficult to carry out. Once one line akin to that of teenage poetry is spouted with serious intents, a breaking of the comical atmosphere is bound to occur. The existence of Sakamoto's figure, however, prevents such a thing from happening. As Sakamoto is consistently within the stylistic deadpan aestheticism of coolness, so is the very show itself in its execution of events. All the enlightenments Sakamoto performs are done with the same class he does other actions with, making what would've felt as a horned-in PSA feel natural within the show's style. It helps that Sakamoto Desu Ga is an exceptional comedy that keeps its continuity in check, much unlike that of irritating romcoms. Whenever a previously focused character makes their way into a future scene under the influence of their change, one can't help but make a wry smirk, both for the characters in question and for our always-growing entrustment towards Sakamoto's coolness.\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto\u00b4s meager classmates aren\u00b4t the only beings active in the veneration of Sakamoto, however. As with similar regard to the many depictions that have been given to the religious figure that is Jesus, Sakamoto has been painted with the very colors of elegance in his animated portrayal. Mostly thanks to the glorious animation studio that is Studio Deen, Sakamoto\u00b4s character design has been vigilantly adapted to captivate the very spiritual fragrance he composes with his brilliant loftiness. Enlightenment itself can be simply achieved with just a simple glance of Sakamoto\u00b4s poetic figure. It truly is quite the spectacle. Pseudo-theological jabbering aside, if one were to take a look at Sakamoto without previous knowledge as to what the show he\u00b4s the namesake of revolves around, they\u00b4d probably succumb to noting a casual remark on the cool persona he vibrates. And such a thing is to be expected of; Sakamoto\u00b4s character design itself characterizes him as the being he is without any need for an introduction. His build is robustly defined enough to engulf any passersby into his impacting gravitational pull, yet is equally spiced with the scent of adolescence to convey his comforting approach. His facial features are sharp and refined, being comprised of eloquent eyes with the capability of radiating his charisma, a wonderfully formed chin that will surely invoke some envy in CLAMP characters, and a single divine mole reminiscent of 18th-century nobles. Not to mention his stylishly parted blackened hair that serves as a complementation towards his celestial glasses. It\u00b4s no wonder why delinquents and Tumblr bloggers everywhere are dedicating themselves to Sakamoto\u00b4s figure in the tributes that are phone wallpapers. Conversely to Sakamoto, the side character\u00b4s that accompany him aren\u00b4t all that shabby either. While they can never hope to hold a candle to him, their designs certainly set the scene for the quasi-serious comical atmosphere of the show. Albeit comparing them to Sakamoto might be too grand of a scale, all the inhabiting characters are rather simplistic in how they\u00b4re designed. Besides Sakamoto\u00b4s exceptional display, designs throughout the show don\u00b4t convey any particular style to them. Occasionally, they\u00b4ll carry minimal traits to physically define themselves with and that\u00b4ll be it, which is sufficient in making them distinctive. The very simplicity they carry, much like their written characteristics, is a clear opposition to Sakamoto, which in return makes his greatness stand out more than it already has.\\n\\n\r\nYet, the character designs and how glamorous they aren\u00b4t all that matters. After all, this isn\u00b4t the doctrine that is the manga, this is an anime. Experiencing how The Sakamoto\u00b4s routines and actions come into play once the animation is added to the formula is one of the fundamentals in grasping his character. One would think that animated characters can only fully capture once their animation is realistically fluid, and such an idea wouldn\u00b4t be all that farfetched. However, the said capturing of emotion isn\u00b4t all that reliant on how many frames the model of a character is composed of. The sly mention of the animation studio, Deen, has been dropped for a reason. Deen hasn\u00b4t exactly been known to be the most vibrant animation studio in Japan; it\u2019s what gave birth to the now deteriorated infamy they had. As such, Sakamoto Desu Ga in the gritty hands of Deen shouldn\u00b4t be expected to be chock-full of sakuga or scenery that\u2019s worthy of rivaling Makoto Shinkai. Nor should it be down frowned upon; Deen\u00b4s been on quite a roll this recent year, what with the rare piece of art that was Winter 2016\u00b4s Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, as well as with Konosuba\u00b4s comically ingenious utilization of its \u201cpoor\u201d visuals. With Sakamoto Desu Ga, however, pulling off a visual technique that\u2019s both pleasing to the budget at hand and the final product is a bit more on the difficult side. Considering the show\u00b4s premise, one would expect visuals as grandiose as the ace himself throughout, but that is not the case here. The visuals of the show, much like some occasional gags that simply missed, tend to lean more towards on the inconsistent side of things. For instance, several times do Sakamoto\u00b4s facial attributes blankly disappear in the void that is the off-model. This results in the singular feature of Sakamoto becoming his empty, hollow glasses that display nothing else but an uninviting stare of pure whiteness. One could say that this is a deliberate, almost surreal attempt at conveying a contrasting side of Sakamoto that displays perfection as something to be feared, but I digress. Fortunately, the movement of the character does make up for this. Within the bizarre, yet surely cool habits Sakamoto executes, the animation is what partially allows for his abstract performances come to light. Whether he\u00b4s ludicrously brandishing his arms about, carefully pouring salt with his heavenly hands, or running in the style of Darwin\u00b4s evolutionary theory, an optimization towards the weak animation is made. Combined with the absurd shoujo special effects in the backgrounds, one can\u00b4t help but appreciate his wonder and snap a gif or two to stash in their private Sakamoto folder. On a similar note, the side characters often experience the same phenomenon that is the \u201coff-model\u201d, but on them, it\u00b4s much more welcome. There\u00b4s no doubt that the minor occasions in which they take place are due to another one of Sakamoto\u00b4s extraordinary powers.\\n\\n\r\nWith how exceptionally Sakamoto excels as a human being, both in his body build and characteristics far beyond that of plebeians, one would think that a voice would not be required to finally resonate the character. Considering how perfect he is, the necessity to convey messages indicative of meaning through vocal abilities wouldn\u00b4t confront Sakamoto. Unexpectedly, however, Sakamoto is containment of a particular voice. Luckily, the seiyuu he\u00b4s been cast with couldn\u00b4t have any more divine: Hikaru Midorikawa has been given the virtue of being able to voice Sakamoto. Admittedly, the guy\u00b4s experienced with characters types meant to extract awe out of the viewer, such as in the case of the embodiment of brotherly sentimentalities that is Natsume Kyousuke from the Little Busters, and the most admirable conman and best girl known as Deishuu Kaiki from the Monogatari series. His performance as Sakamoto is by no means a decline in comparison to these two. Midorikawa\u00b4s take on Sakamoto is splendid in which it manages to capture all the traits the character possess in one voice without the need for tonal shift. He\u00b4s humble and modest enough to attract a passing bird, yet erotic and romantic enough to tingle your sensations with a single whisper into your ear. With such a majestical voice, it\u2019s no wonder why high school girls and delinquents alike reach the peak of ecstasy once confronting Sakamoto. And despite the potential of his voice alone being able to equate to that of a German chorus, surrounding soundtracks happen to accompany Sakamoto in his actions. The score of Sakamoto Desu Ga at first glance might seem like that of a Mozart masterpiece, but upon much closer inspection, it\u00b4ll be revealed that is not the case. Abundantly throughout the show do multiple renditions of Sakamoto\u00b4s leitmotif play, more often than not whenever Sakamoto is in the process of accomplishing a gag. It\u00b4s full of class and jazz, very much like his persona, however, I can only dare to describe it as \u201cSakamoto-esque\u201d. Unfortunately, the leitmotif in question isn\u00b4t sufficient enough a track to be constantly played throughout in almost every single episode. After a while, when the memes die off, it wears off as well. Only then can the fact that other pieces in Sakamoto Desu Ga\u00b4s soundtrack exist come into light. But by that point, the leitmotif would have already spread its influence enough to make them, quite frankly, dismissable. Albeit when compared to how the leitmotif exerts the entire style of the show all in one, other pieces simply aren\u00b4t sonorous enough to maintain atmosphere beyond their particular usage in a fitting scene. \\n\\n\r\nContrary to the lackluster soundtrack\u2019s inability to fully captivate The Sakamoto, the opening and ending themes of the show are dynamic in their ability at expressing the show\u2019s signature style. The dubbed title of the show\u00b4s opening itself, [COOLEST], exemplifies the capacity of Sakamoto\u00b4s abilities. Being composed of guitar riffs that are sure to reach out to the heavens, some absurdly befitting lyrics to what follows, and Sakamoto performing everyday tasks in manners in which only he can, [COOLEST] couldn\u00b4t have been dubbed by any other name. Customi Z sure fabricated an opening that\u2019s both an earworm to listen to and complimentary to the series. In juxtaposition to the zaniness of the opening, the ending theme, [Nakushita Hibi ni Sayonara] by Suneohair, is of a more melancholic and sentimental tone. Featuring Sakamoto indulging in luxurious pastimes in the midst of a dawn-engulfed afternoon, the emotionally invoking ending theme serves as a curtain call to the subdue thematic implications throughout Sakamoto Desu Ga. Both songs are similar in this regard; they set the mood naturally well as introductions to the show at hand and subtle farewells to the viewers. Plus, what sane person wouldn\u00b4t want to jam out to the choruses of \u201cKuuru, kuuraa, kuurizuto!\u201d directed towards praising Sakamoto?\\n\\n\r\nOnce all eccentric mannerisms of the titular character have come to a momentary intermission, Sakamoto Desu Ga, despite the conspicuous premise arousing skepticism towards redundant gags, is an unexceptionally engrossing comedy to watch that\u00b4s in acknowledgment of its shortcomings without neglecting what makes it brilliant. When inspecting the character\u00b4s mannerism both ironically and casually, one can\u00b4t help but instantly be enraptured by Sakamoto\u00b4s charisma. Despite the constant allusion to him being an embodiment of perfection, when scrutinizing Sakamoto he\u00b4s anything but a euphemized figure of boredom. The direction of the show\u00b4s stylistic humor is as well-composed as the character himself in merging the obscure mannerisms of Sakamoto in a universe where such frolicsomeness is accepted as the norm.This, however, doesn\u00b4t prevent itself from stepping into unknown boundaries well in its reach, being the providing of simplistic themes properly interweaved thoughtfully enough to contain impact without ruining its comical priorities. With its tongue-in-cheek maintenance of its characters reputation and clever exertion of the varying potential he has in his COOLness, Sakamoto Desu Ga plows itself through as a comedy with sheer swagger, resulting in an enchanting experience far beyond that of transcendental happenings and linear punchlines devoid of the gracious touching.",

            "content": "In a school in Japan there was a student who tops everyone in the world for being the coolest person because anything he does is perceived as \"cool\". Women want him, men envy him, and children look up to him. Who is he? \"Haven't you heard? I'm Sakamato.\"\r\nPerfect Sakamoto does everything right that he has absolutely no flaws. The only flaw of the anime is the fact that it doesn't have a plot, mainly revolves around Sakamoto the Greatest as he does things to overcome anything despite it might be occasionally funny and seemingly idiotic - but Sakamoto doesn't allow you to see those parts,because he's a bishounen! Anything a bishounen does is neither funny or idiotic.\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto is also a perfect character to the point he does not undergo any changes as well - surprise, you might think he would receive a power-up for being overpowered as a perfect character to further upgrade his OP status, but his only power-up is to be a massive chick magnet (and some males as well) that seems to level from normal, high school girls to aunts. All other characters are nothing compared to him as they revolve around Great Sakamoto for being the greatest.\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto makes the art of Sakamoto great, though I have nothing much to contribute when he has already contributed to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe overuse of one of the soundtrack for everything Sakamoto does will be attached to you in one way or another as they will use it every time Sakamoto does something great - pretty much all the time because Sakamoto is the greatest person every alive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \"Haven't you heard? I'm Sakamoto\" or known more as \"Sakamoto desu ga?\" is a decent comedic anime revolving Sakamoto the Greatest being overpowered and cool as well as great in capturing the hearts of older women for being too perfect of everything he does. The ending was applause-worthy for it features his departure, both his school and the anime world being the Sakamoto the Greatest and will remain in our minds for perhaps a new religion of Sakamoto.\\n\\n\r\nIt was rated slightly above average as I seem to lost my ability to laugh after 4 episodes in, and I have no idea why. The comedy probably is overused around Sakamoto the Greatest that it has lost its charming point of comedy, or perhaps the turning point of the story circling through the shady society of school turns Sakamoto the Greatest slightly grim yet he does not portray any of those in his perfect bishounen face. On the last episode, we finally know that Sakamoto the Greatest is in fact not some pan-face, heartless, emotionless bishounen who knows nothing but to portray his bishounen-ness and is capable of changing emotions makes Sakamoto the Greatest slightly relative to human and not some alien in human skin.",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Sakamoto Desu ga? This show was pretty bland. The comedy was poor, there was no real story, the wackiness and strangeness of the show manages to be somehow unimpressive. Overall I wouldn't recommend.\r\nThe show is about a boy named Sakamoto and his daily life at school. Sakamoto is super cool, everything he does is stylish and impressive to everyone, including other guys. Simply watch the intro to the anime and it will describe Sakamoto and what the shows antics will look like. He's like a Mary Poppins. Some event will arise that is out of the leagueof normal high school students and he will remedy the situation without confronting it directly. He can also go with the flow of any situation to make it feel normal. For example one time a mop bucket goes out of control and rolls to him super fast and he simply jumps in it and rides it to the next class.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound both decent, nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were not bad, in fact the supporting cast made the later episodes enjoyable to me. Mostly the show follows Sakamoto and throws in another character or characters for whatever situation that needs remedied. You have the loser best friend, the clever man hunting woman, the bossy class rep, and some delinquents. As we all know from our high school days, this is the typical class line up. The first half of the show was to show off Sakamoto as everyone fell in love with him. The second half of the show was more of exploring other characters a bit, though nothing deep. We never know a lot about anyone.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't much enjoy this show. It had a moment or two of interest. I particularly liked the episodes where Sakamoto and Hayabusa, Shou would do something together. I liked Hayabusa's character and before I finished it I thought it would play into a small story arc, which I guess technically it did, though it was rather anti climatic. Other than those few episodes though I found myself bored. Comedy is Sakamoto doing something cool, girls and guys both swooning. Not something bad to pick up if your bored or are between shows. Not something I would recommend though.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Sakamoto is cool, too cool and it makes the show boring. No story, bland comedy, decent but pointless characters.",

Cool, Cooler , Coolest, all superlatives that describe this character, But:\r\nStorywise, for starters, it was quite unique, there is no plot just the character itself, in fact everything was made to revolve around this seemingly perfect character. so it was really good for it's uniqueness, but not that good in it's story telling scenario, then again it's a 7 over  for this category.\r\nArtwise, it was  decent, 4 over 10 to be exact,  enough to say the least, cu's you won't find anything naughty in here, except of coursefor Y\u016bya Sera in a black and white boxer......I can never understand as to why character designer Atsuko Nakajima have to illustrate  him as this fat slob in his boxers.\\n\\n\r\nSound.......a 3 over 10 , since all the characters sounded like adults than teens. Plus the fact that I hate both opening and closing themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, I gave it a 3 over 10, not because there is something wrong with the main character.....actually, that's just it, their is really nothing wrong with the main character Sakamoto that his character can be rendered as BORING, due to that fact that he can get away with anything and I do mean ANYTHING, so that's why life ain't perfect, cu'z it'll loose any reason to live. Basically the main character Sakamoto is actually an embodiment of Japan's  pursue of perfection, no wonder they're lives boring in reality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, well for the the 1st 7 episodes it was enjoyable, but since the anime was all about main character all momentum of interest over this anime has gone, that I've started to just skim the remaining episodes, also, since when did the concept of throwing pie at a top student who is leaving became a tradition, I mean where did writer Nami Sano and director Shinji Takamatsu got  such idea, does such thing really happens in real life in Japan's school? Or was it another misinterpreted western thing that the duo git when they saw some scene in Saturday Night Live? Anyways, overall I gave it a 3, for too much on the character and such pie misinterpretation that wasn't even funny. \\n\\n\r\nSakamoto OUT!",

            "content": "\"Sakamoto desu ga?\" Is an anime I didn't really enjoy watching, but it also wasn't something that I needed to avert my eyes to.\r\nFirst off, there isn't any real plot to begin with, it's just Sakamoto's every day habits with the thoughts of the people involved in it, and it only gets interesting after an episode introducing a \"villain\" whereas, ploys to \"annihilate\" our Stylish MC.\r\nThis is an anime that will really make you laugh at some point, the comedy is worth a watch, some conflicts are easily predictable and how the whole thing delivers is a bit generic, bad person realizes mistake, and Sakamotoknew all along.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I clearly love about this anime is most definitely, Sakamoto's way of dealing with problems, not only does he resolve them well, but he resolves them \"Stylish\"-ly. As to what I hate, is how the supporting characters wrap stuff up, consider it as a \"Sakamoto Syndrome\" but I most definitely expected something better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is an anime you can watch if you really RAN OUT of good animes to watch, but put in mind that is is also something you can't watch half-heartedly, some moments are actually good and worth your 25 minutes of viewing. In more words or less, \"Sakamoto desu ga?\" Is just another mainstream anime that got a lot of attention because it was \"funny\", so you should watch it if you WANT to.",

It doens't really have a story, because it is kinda a slice of life story about Sakomoto. \r\nEvery time he does something great, the well known and good music is playing and that makes the series fun too. The series is a great comedy. All things that happen in the series is original. Sakomoto solves problems with a twist, which seem to be really funny. \r\nSome people might say they have stolen bits of the black butler series. That Sakamoto looks a bit like Sebastian qua acting, but this time it is not abutler but a student. I must say it looks like they have stolen bits of the Black Butler series, but it is okay, since the series is a big comedy and the side characters are part of making this anime a great comedy.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you think this is useful.

The way how simple day-to-day life is exaggerated and overstylised is a big factor in making this anime a successful comedy.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nYou can't expect much story from a slice of life anime. Apart from loosely connected scenarios, there is little to no story. Although the ending was quite satisfying, I wasn't too impressed by the story, and you shouldn't expect much from a slice of life. But anyway, it was fun in it's own right.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nThe Art was okay I guess, it fit the anime quite a bit but I felt the art had tooless colors and wasn't at all vibrant. The colors were dull, and didn't feel too great as you'd expect from TBS' other works.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was above average. The characters matched their personalities very well and it mathced the comedic tone very well too. Sadly, the OP/ED weren't great at all. I felt as if they were bland and lacked any fun in them. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhy have character development when your character is already perfect? Sakamoto developed little (as expected in slice of life anime) and didn't need to develop that much too as the anime revolved around how daily life deals with him, rather than him dealing with daily life (think about it). Nonetheless, the characters were great, although there wasn't much development, they were still very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Sakamoto desu ga. It was the perfect marriage of slapstick comedy and style, much like the title character. The comedy was really fresh and hilarious and fit the tone well. It livened up my mood a lot and I got a good many laughs out of this one. Imo, Sakamoto desu ga could easily rank in the lower half of my top five comedy anime. It was great, but not *too* great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSakamoto desu ga had it's flaws, but in it's core purpose, it doesn't fail to deliver. Fans of comedy will love this and although it doesn't equal KonoSuba (my fav comedy), it ranks up pretty high too. A valuable contender for comedy of the year!\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Secret Technique: Flourish and applause!",

            "content": "\"Haven't you heard? I'm Sakamoto.\"\r\nThese Five Words. Words have oft held great, sometimes even sacred, import for mankind over the years; whether it be the Ten Commandments or the Five Pillars or the Eightfold Path or what have you, words framed in a holy light last and endure through the musty years, never to be forgotten by their followers.\r\nAm I implying that these Five Words, or Three Words in Japanese -- Sakamoto desu ga? -- indicate a sort of divine status for the primary and eponymous character of this anime masterpiece?\r\nWhy, yes, I am. For after seeing these Twelve Episodes of Absolute Magnificence, you can'thelp but see Sakamoto in a superhuman light. In our communal journeys through shared education, from elementary to middle to high school to college and beyond, most of us yearn to look good in front of others to some degree. We desire our own coolness.\\n\\n\r\nI apologize for disrupting your dreams. For no matter how cool you have become, after watching Sakamoto desu ga? (henceforth abbreviated to SDG, which may or may not also stand for Student Demonstrates Godliness) you will realize how futile your struggles have been. For no matter how hard you try, you can never hope to stand in the shadow of, nay, not even be privileged to stand in the blinding light of, this man named Sakamoto. These Twelve Episodes of Sublime Brilliance tell the common youth and young adult's journey to coolness, and ultimately, its sheer lack of worth. Let me explain.\\n\\n\r\nSo SDG is about this first-year high school student named Sakamoto who impresses his class from the first day on. Of course, as his every action and word is in itself a self-defining and society-defying emblem of majesty, he can't help but be in the limelight and capture the hearts of all the girls. Not surprisingly, some boys try to step into the light as well by attempting to make Sakamoto look bad in various ways. Not surprisingly, some girls try to reach Sakamoto as well, helplessly smitten as they are. And obviously what happens? Sakamoto not only evades their efforts, but converts them into something better, usually helping them in the process. Every episode of the Twelve Unforgotten has several such attempts, and each is hilarious. For every episode of the Twelve Empyrean I was trying to contain my otherwise uproarious laughter (unfortunately I watched this in my dorm, usually while my roommates were sleeping) to pounding my knee and almost tearing up. Before SDG, comedy in anime was pretty prevalent; from what I had seen so far, Gintama held the top tier, followed by others such as Steins;Gate and the High School DxD series. But after experiencing the Twelve-fold Comedy of SDG, I realized that what I had believed to be comedy was mere rubbish. In short, SDG is the funniest anime I have ever seen so far, and may hold that spot eternally. The mangaka, the genius who created Sakamoto, is brilliant for coming up with so many actions only worthy of Sakamoto. For example (and I'll just give one out of the myriad), when his shoes are tied together during a race, he simply goes on all fours and runs like a cheetah. Everything taken into consideration, Sakamoto is multitudinous talent personified. As you progress through the Twelve Episodes of Wonder, he keeps surprising and awing you with his new feats. So much so that you're left thinking whether he's actually human.",

            "content": "\u201cHappy the writer who, after ignoring characters that are boring, repulsive, astounding in their sad actuality, gravitates towards characters that manifest the high dignity of man, who, out of the great maelstrom of images that whirl about him daily, has chosen only the few exceptions, who not once has altered the elevated pitch of his lyre, has not descended from his height to the level of his poor, insignificant brethren, and, without touching the earth, has given himself, all of him, over to his own images, which are exalted and far removed from it.\u201d \u2013 Nikolai Gogol, Dead Souls\r\nHappy the writer, perhaps, but less sothe audience.  Nikolai Gogol\u2019s bitter, sarcastic disparagement of the safe and insipid recipients of universal acclaim, if a tad too accusatory for my exact purposes, serves as an appropriate epigraph for a review of Sakamoto desu ga.  As you have no doubt already gathered, Sakamoto himself is the epitome of cool, the apex of aptitude, the Shatner of suave, the sultan of swing, the margrave of magnificence, the Zhong Kui of je ne sais quoi: the Sakamoto of Sakamoto.  Everything he does is exceedingly brilliant and everything he touches turns to gold that will also do your taxes and wash your car.\\n\\n\r\nPlenty of people know by now that perfect characters aren\u2019t interesting.  Anyone who cannot possibly be in any danger cannot be counted on to sustain an engaging plot.  All the best characters in any medium are deeply flawed.  We know this by now, and we know it so well that Sakamoto desu ga decides to challenge this basic rule by featuring a perfect protagonist and using him creatively to generate unusual storylines.  To the credit of the series, it does consist of more than merely Sakamoto showing off his endless talents for the benefit of Class 1-2.  Every opportunity for Sakamoto to impress is an opportunity for his classmates and acquaintances to learn how to live in his shadow.  All the other characters must learn to appreciate their own strengths or reach difficult conclusions about themselves when faced with a figure so awe-inspiring and effortlessly competent.  This is a thought-provoking and refreshing way to handle such a scenario, and the first few episodes in particular explore the idea of Sakamoto as a motivation for others very well.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, having a perfect protagonist isn\u2019t a circumstances of Sakamoto; it\u2019s the premise.  The whole point of the show is to see what kind of ridiculous solutions Sakamoto can conjure for basic problems and how he can overcome the absurd tests devised by his enemies.  This is a comedy, after all, and most of the comedy stems from Sakamoto\u2019s exaggerated prowess at everything.  Because perfection is the premise of the show and not the result of a lazy, sloppy, or na\u00efve writer who can\u2019t bear the thought of being cruel to their characters, I don\u2019t believe that perfection is what makes Sakamoto unsatisfactory as a show.\\n\\n\r\nI simply find the show boring on a substantial level.  After the first few episodes, the show begins to lose whatever deeper layers it had and devolves into a series of skits about how much everyone loves Sakamoto.  The conceit of other characters learning from this singular, titular figure was the main factor that kept the series interesting at first, and when left with only the comedic elements, you begin to realize that Sakamoto desu ga really only has one joke.  One joke isn\u2019t enough to float a series, unfortunately, no matter how many incarnations it has.  I typically find that the series isn\u2019t over-the-top enough, as odd as that might sound in reference to Sakamoto.  To sell a premise like this, you need to pull out absolutely all the stops and get as much mileage as possible; restraint doesn\u2019t really work for this setting.  Sakamoto desu ga isn\u2019t especially over-the-top; it is level with the top and occasionally sloshes over when jostled.  The trio of Acchan and\u2026 friends\u2026? \u2026supplies some laughs, but more often than not, the settings build up to \u201clook how cool and handsome Sakamoto is!\u201d  My sense of humor doesn\u2019t completely fall in line with that of the show.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, in the real world as in the story\u2019s universe itself, everything about the series revolves around Sakamoto.  Aside from maybe Sera, Sakamoto is the only one with a particularly striking character design.  None of the other characters are all that noteworthy, and the few recurring storylines the show keeps trying to push just don\u2019t feel worth the time.  Sakamoto is the only main character, and he is neither what you would call a conventional character nor a relatable lens through which to view his world.  Overall the art style is pretty generic and devoid of personality; maybe it is supposed to be that way to underscore how singular the protagonist is, but I don\u2019t especially care for it.  The uniforms, setting, dialogue, designs, and most of the soundtrack are all as nondescript as can be.  I am a pretty big fan of the OP, the ED, and certain elements of the soundtrack, and the performances are generally good, but none of that is enough to save the show for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe goal that Sakamoto desu ga has is more interesting than what Sakamoto desu ga is.  I appreciate the idea of head-on torpedoing this rule against perfect characters and making something fun out of the fragments, but the results aren\u2019t funny or charming or meaningful enough to keep me engaged.  I had high hopes for Sakamoto, but at this point, I have to say I\u2019m ill-inclined to give it another shot or recommend it to others.  The length of time I have taken to explain my problems with the show might suggest that they are larger and more intrusive than they really are; watching the show the first time, I liked it enough to continue to the end, even without taking into account that I have so far refused to drop anything at all anyway, so it\u2019s not like I would have abandoned Sakamoto even if I had hated it, but I mean this as a compliment.  It\u2019s fine to watch when I need to kill time, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t kill any more time with it than a single viewing\u2019s worth.\\n",

            "content": "\"Occasionally hilarious\" is the perfect description for this anime. Sakamoto desu ga? is basically a collection of short stories about how people around Sakamoto interact with his perfectness. There's not much of a story, and what's there isn't even close to good, so if that's what you are looking for, go away. It's hard to recommend this anime in general due to how inconsistent it is. However, I don't regret watching it. Sure, quite a bit of it was boring, and most of it wasn't really interesting, but there were some instances of absolute gold spread throughout. Due to that, my memories from watching thisanime are not \"Episode X was so dull I had to force myself to slug through it\", but \"the Y scene on Episode Z was awesome!\".\\n\\n\r\nMaybe you should watch the first episode and see how you like it. The comedic style remains the same throughout the series, so if you take a liking to the first episode, you probably won't have a problem going through the not-so-good parts while you'll enjoy the good ones even more.",

            "content": "This high-school comedy is based on a 4-volume manga that ended in 2015. The titular chacrcter is a 16 years old boy that is as much an idealized man as Mr. Gray is. Sakamoto is athletic, handsome, studious, but his main attribute is style; to quote from the OP: \u201cEverything he does is cool, cooler, coolest-o\u201d.\r\n\tBeing the not-so-obscure object of desire of every girl and her mother (quite literally), is bound to excite the envy of the other boys; all of them want to see Sakamoto's pristine image get blemished. Those boys with delinquent habits, are willing tomake the effort to achieve that. The show has a distinct One-punch-man feeling to it; the villains' careful laid plans are laid to waste by the equivalent of a single punch from Sakamoto. Actually it is a stylish move that looks initially silly, but ends up getting maximum cool points. \\n\\n\r\n\tThat way of acting sets the series tone; Sakamoto looks  unapproachable, arrogant, and usually downright stupid; but he always has a selfless plan, to help his classmates while simultaneously manages to be kind to his \u201cenemies\u201d. The comedy stems from the absurdity of the situations that Sakamoto finds himself in and of course from when he increases the level of absurdity to resolve the situation with the aforementioned single cool-looking move.\\n\\n\r\n\tUnfortunately, the comedy sometimes misses its target. Moreover, since there is no story whatsoever, but each episode is a series of sketches, it is vital that most of them are entertaining, which is not the case. The final negative element, probably an emanation of the lack of a storyline, is that there is no development, neither in characters, nor in plot.\\n\\n\r\n\tSo, Sakamoto offers a lot of laughs and some very original over-the-top situations. Even though the are a lot of uninteresting sketches, if we couple the good ones with the kindness that the series radiates, we have a good result. The twelfth episode concluded the series, but there is a thirteenth episode in the blu-ray, that the station didn't manage to air due to scheduling conflicts. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe worst part about Sakamoto is that it is probably the third-best original anime of the Spring 2016 season; a quite disheartening fact. 6.5/10.",
