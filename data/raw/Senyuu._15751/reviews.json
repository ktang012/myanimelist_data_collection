No anime has particularly captured the spirit of the good times (the 80s and 90s). Look at ourselves squabbling what is the best anime this season; we are not united. There's even some of us who say none of the anime this season is actually good. Inside our corrupted minds, the inner voice is telling us, \"No, this anime will never be good as Anime X.\" It is how human nature works: we are negative, brutish, cynical beings.\r\nBut one adventurous director has decided to fight against the odds-- the nasty public that prides itself in deriding other animes. He walks to us, face-to-face. Despite the possible violence, he believe this is a fateful night for us. We may change our ideals and therefore should stay, he argues. Who is this man and why is he trying to make an anime that will unite us together? This brave soul is merely reckless. Not one fractale of hope remains in our miserable anime lives. He will need more than just a bunch of lucky stars and blessing from some shrine maidens.\\n\\n\r\nThis man takes out his sketchbook and flips the pages to show his masterpiece. Was it godly enough to cause the world to change at a whim? Us skeptics take a step closer, breathing more and more air than usual. Are we excited?\\n\\n\r\nWe can't be. Anime is a dying medium after all. The sick invasion of moe has dumbed anime down to the depths of stupidity. And we feel the greatness of today's animes are attributed to some form of disgusting perversion. We do not wish to understand. No, why should we understand today's minds? Let the kids play their iPads and watch their crappy Precure shows; us real anime fans want to engage in discussing and writing essays on the structuralist conventions and philosophical themes in our children's cartoons while listening to \"Canon in D\".\\n\\n\r\nSo what is this irrational excitement we are feeling? Is it a return to the bygone days of anime intellectualism? Why are we panicking as if this is our second chance to see a good anime?\\n\\n\r\nWhat is this \"Senyuu.\"?\\n\\n\r\nIt is an Anime. By Yamamoto Yutaka.\\n\\n\r\nAnime is saved.\\n\\n\r\nThank you, Yamakan.",

All classic voice stereotypes. Good sfx. No ambient scene sounds. Nothing exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6. The first 'likable' character is also the 'villain'.

            "content": "Senyuu is a general hilarious story of the adventures of Alba and Ros to defeat the demon king. The story follows a particular video game style much like old Final Fantasy (Utilizing  a control pad to attack or defend). The story involves quit a lot of slapstick humor, as well as many references to characters being perverted (\"Tentacles are sexy\").\r\nThe art work is very well drawn, although simple. The artwork also tends to change from time to time, with great detail.\r\nThe sound quality is great. The actors do a wonderful job depicting each character.\r\nThe characters are good, but have no real change in theircharacterizations, although in this particular case there is no need for this.\\n\\n\r\nI laugh at the constantly funny characters, and get a kick out of the slapstick comedy in the piece. The one thing that does detract from the shortness of the episodes. Much like Hetalia, the episode are generally 5 mins long. What is unlike Hetalia, is Senyuu is even shorter. Despit this fact it was on of the best winter anime of 2012-2013.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to almost anyone.",

            "content": "Shorts are quite rare in Anime, and as like majority of the shorts Senyuu is a gag or comedy short in its core. But what is unique about this show is that it is based on a fantasy settings which is even more rare in shorts. Unlike many other shorts Senyuu has one other criteria that is although it tries to parody the fantasy world setting in overall it also tries to have a continuity (rather then being self contained episodes) and tries to tell a short yet somewhat coherent (somewhat comes to mind mostly due to ridiculously comic sequences) story. And that is whatI find enjoyable and also an appreciable effort for this series.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe story is in a setting like old school rpgs but with a few funny twists. It goes something like long time ago the demon king Rchimedes was defeated and sealed by Hero Creation, but suddenly one day a huge hole appeared in the world and all kinds of demons started coming out of it. So naturally the king decides that the demon king has returned and tries to send the hero's descendant to fight him. and there comes the first funny twist as one thousand years had passed he found 75 candidates and sends them all and declares whoever defeats the demon lord will be deemed the \"true hero\" and will receive vast riches. This show particularly follows the hero Alba & soldier Ross in their quest to be the true heroes where they meets many funny characters and the writer also throws in various slapstick humor while also parodying various other typical Shounen anime/manga.\\n\r\nOverall the story is somewhat original and I enjoyed the humor very much so it gets 8 out of 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\nWhile the art is anything spectacular but I really enjoyed how the animation and art was used to convey humor and how they complemented the overall nature of the ridiculous humor of the show. And on a small note, I also quite enjoyed the varying opening sequences used.\\n\r\nThis gets 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nWhile Alba is a typical Shounen character I really liked his comments/complains against various actions of the other characters and even the narrator. Ross is character with a very unique sense of humor which is quite enjoyable in a slapstick nature really. Other characters like the little girl and innocent demon lord; the elderly loli lover; the masochistic cat are very funny and unique. the rest are somewhat generic but still compliments the overall nature of the show nicely.\\n\r\nThis is another strong aspect and gets 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe in-show music what not that noticeable at all and I was not impressed at all. The opening and ending theme is done by JAM Project which sadly I didn't find neither appropriate nor enjoyable. In short to me this is by far the weakest aspect of this anime and gets 5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nFor me who is relatively new at shorts actually this was really a unique experience to say the least, although there are a few faults like a bad overall music & a cliffhanger ending that was quite unexpected I would gladly watch the second season. I would recommend this to anyone who likes shorts or parody shows or to people who likes to have some good laughs occasionally with no string attached for bigger storyline or whatnot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score -\\n\r\n                         7 out of 10.\\n",

Senyuu answers that question, after the first episode it's hard to resist it's satirical slapstick comedy that is incredibly short and sweet. It takes the classic hero knight story and turns it on it's ear. The only problem I have with this series is the length of each episode. 5 minutes becomes 2.5 of actual episode once the credits have been accounted for, but that's part of the humorous appeal. This is one of those special series, and I look forward to watching season 2.\r\nIf you like knights, demonlords, old perverts and constant slapstick satiricalcomedy then this is for you. Don't miss this wonderful series. It's not like you don't have time for it!",

Everything about the anime(art, sounds, characters) are all at good at best, but where this anime stands out is through its quick and witty humor.\r\n'Senyuu' follows the story of a king sending soldiers to fight demons, but is focused on bits of interactions between characters, which is brilliant because they are able to divulge on the fast-paced funny and interesting jokes and parodies while also having something to tie it to. \r\nIf you get tired of theshouting matches of the Big 3 Animoos, or the twists and turns of the more complicated animes (which is saying pretty much everything else because a blank canvas can be at times more complex than 'Naruto' or 'One Piece'), I would totally recommend you turn on Senyuu; open a bag of snacks and pop a drink, and go for the wonderful short ride of Senyuu..desu. \\n",

            "content": "Shorts are something I never even knew that it existed. A less than 25 minute of anime is such an absurd thing to do and I would never in the right mind, to even think of watching this.\r\nBut I was proven wrong with Senyuu, that shorts might not be such a bad thing after all.\r\nStory: (8/10)\r\nA simple, but really imaginative one in my opinion. One day, a huge hole appeared in the world and at the same time, many monster started appearing. The reason though behind this, is that the demon king Rchimedes that was sealed by the legendary hero Creasion, was revived and sothe king sent forth the hero's descendant to defeat the demon king. All 75 of them.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing that there's around 1000 years between the sealing and current time, it is hard to know who's the real descendant, so being the righteous king he is, he grabbed those who seemed to fit.\\n\\n\r\nSo Alba's, hero number 45, and Ross's, appointed by the king and from the royal soldiers, adventure had begun.\\n\\n\r\nIt sounds simple and has a very serious feel to it, doesn't it? \\n\\n\r\nIN-CO-RRECT! Senyuu are a comedy. With only four-five minute of showtime, more than 95% of it are comedy while the 1% are the explaining the story and the other 4% are the ending song. That's right! Don't expect your heart to be be beaten into pulp or staying up all night because of horrendous plot twist. Just expect to have your WTF face because some can't believe what you are seeing are happening and your water ready because you'll be laughing out loud until you dehydrate.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nProbably one of the best there is. Unfortunately, Senyuu and Senyuu 2 only covers the first volume of the webcomic, so character development is not going to be there. But they are given great personality that for god knows how, mesh very well with each other. \\n\\n\r\nAlba, our protagonist and hero, is the straight man (the tsukkomi) that yells out the weirdness or the not logic of something that is happening in the anime. That is his whole personality, because as our soldier, Ross, would say \"a hero that can't even comment is like a fried egg without the egg\". Our soldier, Ross, might as well be a professional sadist that made his life goals to have our hero, Alba, be in despain 24/7.\\n\r\nRuki, our third party of the trio, are an adorable demon with hardly any power but changes her personality all the time, depending on the situation.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are also very funny.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nIt is a comedy so fighting or beautiful art is not going to there much. BUT! Senyuu is a short so I guess, unlike normal anime, the animators probably have more enough time to make Senyuu good. Because the animation is good, it is clean and sharp and no \"one panel that looks really wrong/lazy*.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI beg of you if you are going to watch it, or has watch it but doesn't know this. You are most likely will watch it online or download it. While I don't know about the download one, I know for sure that if you watch it online you are just given the story and then the ending. So I beg of you to go to youtube and search for Senyuu op because it is worth it.\\n\\n\r\nSenyuu opening are over exaggerated scenes from the anime itself that makes you think that you are not watching that silly, comedic anime Senyuu but some other serious, dramatic anime. With awesome catchy opening too!\\n\\n\r\nThe ending are really nice to listen too after laughing for 4-5 minute straight, very melodic and soothing. While the anime itself uses rpg kind of soundtrack, like when you level up in a game.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nYou can easily finish this anime in about one hour with a story and characters that, no matter how you feel that day, will make you laugh.  So yeah, give this anime a try!",

There's something charming about it that other shows seem to lack. \r\nThe story is good, to begin with. Each episode is not it's own crack episode: there is a storyline (however vague and loosely connected) and there is a large cast of characters with different relationships to the plot. I found that interesting. On top of that, it honestly has a betterplot than a lot of serious anime that I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good, especially considering the (probably) low budget and the terrible animation and art that most short animes tend to have. It's by no means intricate, but it even makes the art part of the joke. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, while very crazy, have actual personalities. Even if they seem like parodies of characters, they truly seem to have motivations and goals and defining traits that make this anime quite refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this a lot! \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if you: like medieval stuff, like quests, like crack fiction, liked Akatsuki no Yona and wanted a kinda parody version of it, like sadistic or questionable characters, like stupidity, liked Teekyuu\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if you: want something serious, wanted something heartfelt, were looking for a legitimate journey of some sort, wanted something deep, cannot tolerate subtle and frequent jokes about lowkey pedophilic people\\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

My expectations were somewhat low, but that was only before i turned on the first episode.\r\nIf there is love from the first sight, than Senyuu is the case. I never imagined that action about heroes and saving the world could be THAT funny. You would usually expect some drama, some pathos, lots of fighting and pinches, really strong good and bad guys.. With Senyuu it was quite different. \r\nActually the first thing you should know about this anime is that youare gonna laugh a lot. Each episode is aproximately 5 min long, and during this time you are really unlikely to stop laughing or, at least, smiling.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nWhat i really love about this anime, apart from its humour, is the characters. Even though episodes are short and there's only 13 of them, you will get a pretty good idea about their personalities. Their design is pretty much interesting and fits in anime's style really well. I also loved the naming, f.e. the 12 demons are named after name of a month and its number in german, like Ein Januar, Zwei Februar, etc.\\n\r\nVoice actors did really good job as well. \\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY\\n\r\nThe main point in this anime is its jokes, so it's more about dialogs and different comic situations, than about story. Though something was really going on in the series, the story hadn't proceeded much in the first season. But that's hardly a bad point, and the only thing a wished for was not more story, but more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nTHE ART\\n\r\nThe art actually is pretty simble, but that's expected of the anime that's about comedy and parody. As for me it's not really inportant whether the art is simplistic or glamouros or whatever. What really matters is whether it fits the idea of the anime or not. Senyuu's art surely does fit, 'cause funny anime must have funny art.\\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND\\n\r\nThe sound was somewhat cheerful, though i didn't pay much attention to it. Guess that's a good thing, hm.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nAs for me it was really enjoyable. If you're feeling down, you must watch it and you'll feel much better. If you're not feeling down, you still must watch it and again you will be in a better mood. \\n\\n\r\nThe second season of Senyuu is airing this july and i'm really really really looking forward to it.",

Though, it's not the best laughs you can get out of an anime, butit's still very solid; Senyuu was entertaining from the very first episode till the last and you may even wished that the series was longer.

As such, this may not coincide with yours, or the general publics opinions.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\"I'm like a cinderella of love, I can only love girls younger than 12\"\r\nI\u2019m usually pretty reluctant to watch shows with episodes shorter than the normal ~20 minutes, because I feel like they won\u2019t be able to fulfill what I actually want to see in an anime. However, today I was pretty bored, and I thought to myself that I might as well try watching this...\r\nStory: (7 / 10)\r\nWhen watching a series built on 5-minute episodes,you can\u2019t possibly go in expecting an awesome, or heartbreaking story, because that\u2019s obviously not what you\u2019re going to get.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, Senyuu is more or less about the comedy, using the story as a means of progressing things and introducing new characters.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode starts with a recap of prior events, which at first I thought would be really annoying, as the episodes are short enough, without them telling us about what we\u2019ve already seen. However, to make up for this, they try to change it up with each recap (in terms of the artstyle, complete changes in the narration, etc).\\n\\n\r\nBut the series\u2019 humor is where it really shines. It all mostly consists of slapstick comedy (or atleast I guess you\u2019d call it that), but I also noticed a lot of cultural references, both to japanese culture and anime, as well as western culture, mostly referring to popular internet culture.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (7 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Senyuu is an interesting variation of many different art styles. Most of the time you have the common art style, seen in basically every other show, but now and then they make cuts to scenes where all of the characters are like... chubby stick figures, I guess would be a way to describe it. There are also scenes where some characters are just made up of parentheses and other symbols, or scenes looking like they were \u201chand painted\u201d, so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it makes for quite an interesting experience, and I feel like it helps bring out the true nature of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (7 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not a lot to talk about here, to be honest. The voice actors all did a great job in portraying their characters, but nobody really stood out from the others, not that this was a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, I didn\u2019t really notice a lot of the background music at all (though I rarely do this unless it\u2019s very prominent), and the ending song was decent at best, for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (8 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nIn a series like this, where you basically lack any extensive story, I feel like characters play a really important role. You need to have good and generally funny characters to bring forth the comedy you have in store for the show.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like Senyuu really accomplished this, with its rather eclectic cast, including an old man who desperately tries to protect all the loli\u2019s around him...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I quite enjoyed the series, and it made me laugh numerous times. My one complaint would still be that it\u2019s so short (and that the recap takes up a whole minute of that time period, most of the time), but thankfully there\u2019s a second season coming very soon!\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for something very short, either for a laugh or to just keep you entertained for a bit, then I\u2019d definitely recommend this show.",

            "content": "Hoo boy. How does one review Senyuu?\r\nWell, I suppose its best to start with its origins. You see, Senyuu has some rather unusual origins. Most of the anime you see will fall into one of three categories: based on a light novel, based on a manga, or (usually the most rare) original properties from the studio in question. Senyuu is none of these--its based on a webcomic, though its likely not what you think when you see the word 'webcomic'. I guess the best way to define it would be to call it the Japanese Homestuck. This may be a strike for or against itdepending on your outlook, but keep in mind that this comparison is 100% only to the sequential format of the original comic and not to the storytelling or comedic style.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah. Not something you'd expect to have an anime adaptation. But the Senyuu webcomic exploded so much in popularity in Japan that Liden Films & Ordet joined forces to profit off that popularity (in association with Nico Nico, I can only assume thanks to the various Nico Nico plugs). What we got was something that was definitely BETTER than the original webcomic, technically speaking, but is still very strictly a 'your mileage may vary' kind of show. Basically put it just isn't a show for everyone. \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that might irritate people is the format. Your average Senyuu episode is about...three to five minutes once you shave off the opening, ending, and narrative explanation of the previous episode. This is a format that can work well in a lot of stories that are episodic jokes, but Senyuu runs into the issue that it is ultimately not an episodic story. Instead of small chunks of jokes, we're basically seeing small chunks of a full show here. There's a narrative being cut apart, that being the narrative of the hero Alba's journey and the ultimate goal of defeating Dezember, Juli, and Rchimedes. And while the show is still funny as can be, clever, and peppered with great characters...this format can get annoying. \\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to the story itself! Senyuu is a tried and true parody of the RPG fantasy genre, even going as far as to include classic game screens into some of the episodes. There is even the classic storyline: the Hero is recruited by a royal to go and defeat the Big Bad. It pokes fun at many of the aspects we've become accustom to -- the descendant of the hero (except wouldn't he have lots of descendants?), the Demon Lord whom all fear (except he's really not worth fearing), and ultimately the role of how use(less) a destined hero can be. Make no mistake, this show is an onslaught of jokes both at the expense of RPG fantasy and at the expense of the world that they've created. And its funny. Its a good deconstruction of its genre while managing to make plenty of jokes outside that scope at the same time. There's a few groan worthy jokes (I still can't make myself laugh at the 12 Demons named after months) but for the most part the show presents great humor at the expense of themselves.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this brings us to the true strength in Senyuu: the characters. When describing characters like these, the words 'idiots' and 'jerks' come to mind pretty often. But for once, that's actually kind of a good thing. This is because the main character, Alba Fruhling, is pretty much a straight man character that the world loves to beat up on for realizing how insane all of these tropes are. He's accompanied by a sadist soldier with a secret and...uh, the Demon Lord who all fear. Or at least the Demon Lord's 10 year old granddaughter, ripe with cuteness. Follow this with two Heroes who are money hungry and halfway to crazytown, a princess in an Fullmetal Alchemist suit, a demon who didn't even want to be here and is feeling so attacked right now, a masochistic cat, a school delinquent immune from the laws of realities whenever his friends are in danger...oh jeez, the list goes on. It could be argued that maybe Senyuu has too many characters but honestly, when each and every one contributes so well to the jokes while being so contagiously likeable, its hard to say that this is a problem. They're all just so brutally fun. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about the sound. The voice acting is REALLY good (though this specific show lacks a dub) with each character's execution of their lines adding a whole new dimension to already funny jokes that were in the webcomic. Unfortunately, besides the good voice acting, the sound is just kind of there. The background music isn't memorable in the least and, well, if you like the opening/ending songs then more power to you but they come off as more boring than anything else. At least, that's my two cents on it. Good voice acting, pretty mediocre everything else. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I honestly loved this show. It's a 9/10 for me. But I have to recognize that the show has its deep, deep flaws and that not everyone is going to be into this kind of format. It's the kind of show you'll either love or you'll hate. It doesn't take itself seriously in the slightest to the point where it will even mock itself if it DOES start to get serious, and the way the story is strung together through short episodes is a good idea in theory but just is annoying in practice. If you have an open mind about unique formats and like parody, then this show is probably for you. If not, it still might be because the characters are so delightfully brutal and the jokes aren't always about parody. It's an easy show to dislike, but its also an easy show to absolutely love. Which is probably how a webcomic became a television show to begin with.",

Its enjoyable and fun and really and even if you disagree the time investment is minimal. I'm not a fan of short anime, mostly because they tend to be well done and I hate not having more content. This remains the case with this one, it was funny and I enjoyed it but alas I'll never see any more episodes. \r\nThe story revolves around a fantasy setting. Holes opened up around the world and demons came out of them, causing mayhemand panic. The king sends out an ancient heroes descendants to reign in this threat and to kill the demon lord. However as I mentioned before this is a comedy and spoof anime so even this plot line gets spiced up with minor gags.\\n\\n\r\nArt is dated but not terrible. The music was decent and the voice actors are great.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were funny but since its not serious or long their isn't much development.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show a bunch and its well worth the hour or so you need to invest to watch everything. The comedy style is based around wacky situations that the straight man comments on. To me this is very hit or miss comedy style but I enjoyed it, perhaps not as much as everyone else as this anime has tremendous scores and praises. Anyway give it a watch.",

Senyuu is a short anime with about 5 minutes run-time ( 1 min being the ending theme ) and comes under the general genre of fantasy. It has a great plot, the setting is amazing and it's execution is extraordinary. It reminds of Nanbaka. It is a gag anime but has its action times. The artwork and the sound are also amazing considering it was aired in 2013 but the best thing about it is its characters, i doubt you'll find better characters like this in anime anymore. \r\nThis was a veryentertaining anime with a great plot, artwork and characters. It's quite funny and is a MUST watch. I really love this anime because of how it cheered me up when i was going through one of those sad periods. The first episode is only like 3 minutes long and the whole anime might not be that long but still i would suggest that you watch this great (and what i believe; underrated ) anime.",

No anime has particularly captured the spirit of the good times (the 80s and 90s). Look at ourselves squabbling what is the best anime this season; we are not united. There's even some of us who say none of the anime this season is actually good. Inside our corrupted minds, the inner voice is telling us, \"No, this anime will never be good as Anime X.\" It is how human nature works: we are negative, brutish, cynical beings.\r\nBut one adventurous director has decided to fight against the odds-- the nasty public that prides itself in deriding other animes. He walks to us, face-to-face. Despite the possible violence, he believe this is a fateful night for us. We may change our ideals and therefore should stay, he argues. Who is this man and why is he trying to make an anime that will unite us together? This brave soul is merely reckless. Not one fractale of hope remains in our miserable anime lives. He will need more than just a bunch of lucky stars and blessing from some shrine maidens.\\n\\n\r\nThis man takes out his sketchbook and flips the pages to show his masterpiece. Was it godly enough to cause the world to change at a whim? Us skeptics take a step closer, breathing more and more air than usual. Are we excited?\\n\\n\r\nWe can't be. Anime is a dying medium after all. The sick invasion of moe has dumbed anime down to the depths of stupidity. And we feel the greatness of today's animes are attributed to some form of disgusting perversion. We do not wish to understand. No, why should we understand today's minds? Let the kids play their iPads and watch their crappy Precure shows; us real anime fans want to engage in discussing and writing essays on the structuralist conventions and philosophical themes in our children's cartoons while listening to \"Canon in D\".\\n\\n\r\nSo what is this irrational excitement we are feeling? Is it a return to the bygone days of anime intellectualism? Why are we panicking as if this is our second chance to see a good anime?\\n\\n\r\nWhat is this \"Senyuu.\"?\\n\\n\r\nIt is an Anime.

The story follows a particular video game style much like old Final Fantasy (Utilizing  a control pad to attack or defend). The story involves quit a lot of slapstick humor, as well as many references to characters being perverted (\"Tentacles are sexy\").\r\nThe art work is very well drawn, although simple. The artwork also tends to change from time to time, with great detail.\r\nThe sound quality is great. The actors do a wonderful job depicting each character.\r\nThe characters are good, but have no real change in theircharacterizations, although in this particular case there is no need for this.\\n\\n\r\nI laugh at the constantly funny characters, and get a kick out of the slapstick comedy in the piece. The one thing that does detract from the shortness of the episodes. Much like Hetalia, the episode are generally 5 mins long. What is unlike Hetalia, is Senyuu is even shorter. Despit this fact it was on of the best winter anime of 2012-2013.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to almost anyone.",

            "content": "Shorts are quite rare in Anime, and as like majority of the shorts Senyuu is a gag or comedy short in its core. But what is unique about this show is that it is based on a fantasy settings which is even more rare in shorts. Unlike many other shorts Senyuu has one other criteria that is although it tries to parody the fantasy world setting in overall it also tries to have a continuity (rather then being self contained episodes) and tries to tell a short yet somewhat coherent (somewhat comes to mind mostly due to ridiculously comic sequences) story. And that is whatI find enjoyable and also an appreciable effort for this series.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe story is in a setting like old school rpgs but with a few funny twists. It goes something like long time ago the demon king Rchimedes was defeated and sealed by Hero Creation, but suddenly one day a huge hole appeared in the world and all kinds of demons started coming out of it. So naturally the king decides that the demon king has returned and tries to send the hero's descendant to fight him. and there comes the first funny twist as one thousand years had passed he found 75 candidates and sends them all and declares whoever defeats the demon lord will be deemed the \"true hero\" and will receive vast riches. This show particularly follows the hero Alba & soldier Ross in their quest to be the true heroes where they meets many funny characters and the writer also throws in various slapstick humor while also parodying various other typical Shounen anime/manga.\\n\r\nOverall the story is somewhat original and I enjoyed the humor very much so it gets 8 out of 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\nWhile the art is anything spectacular but I really enjoyed how the animation and art was used to convey humor and how they complemented the overall nature of the ridiculous humor of the show. And on a small note, I also quite enjoyed the varying opening sequences used.\\n\r\nThis gets 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nWhile Alba is a typical Shounen character I really liked his comments/complains against various actions of the other characters and even the narrator. Ross is character with a very unique sense of humor which is quite enjoyable in a slapstick nature really. Other characters like the little girl and innocent demon lord; the elderly loli lover; the masochistic cat are very funny and unique. the rest are somewhat generic but still compliments the overall nature of the show nicely.\\n\r\nThis is another strong aspect and gets 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe in-show music what not that noticeable at all and I was not impressed at all. The opening and ending theme is done by JAM Project which sadly I didn't find neither appropriate nor enjoyable. In short to me this is by far the weakest aspect of this anime and gets 5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nFor me who is relatively new at shorts actually this was really a unique experience to say the least, although there are a few faults like a bad overall music & a cliffhanger ending that was quite unexpected I would gladly watch the second season. I would recommend this to anyone who likes shorts or parody shows or to people who likes to have some good laughs occasionally with no string attached for bigger storyline or whatnot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score -\\n\r\n                         7 out of 10.\\n",

Senyuu answers that question, after the first episode it's hard to resist it's satirical slapstick comedy that is incredibly short and sweet. It takes the classic hero knight story and turns it on it's ear. The only problem I have with this series is the length of each episode. 5 minutes becomes 2.5 of actual episode once the credits have been accounted for, but that's part of the humorous appeal. This is one of those special series, and I look forward to watching season 2.\r\nIf you like knights, demonlords, old perverts and constant slapstick satiricalcomedy then this is for you. Don't miss this wonderful series. It's not like you don't have time for it!",

            "content": "Shorts are something I never even knew that it existed. A less than 25 minute of anime is such an absurd thing to do and I would never in the right mind, to even think of watching this.\r\nBut I was proven wrong with Senyuu, that shorts might not be such a bad thing after all.\r\nStory: (8/10)\r\nA simple, but really imaginative one in my opinion. One day, a huge hole appeared in the world and at the same time, many monster started appearing. The reason though behind this, is that the demon king Rchimedes that was sealed by the legendary hero Creasion, was revived and sothe king sent forth the hero's descendant to defeat the demon king. All 75 of them.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing that there's around 1000 years between the sealing and current time, it is hard to know who's the real descendant, so being the righteous king he is, he grabbed those who seemed to fit.\\n\\n\r\nSo Alba's, hero number 45, and Ross's, appointed by the king and from the royal soldiers, adventure had begun.\\n\\n\r\nIt sounds simple and has a very serious feel to it, doesn't it? \\n\\n\r\nIN-CO-RRECT! Senyuu are a comedy. With only four-five minute of showtime, more than 95% of it are comedy while the 1% are the explaining the story and the other 4% are the ending song. That's right! Don't expect your heart to be be beaten into pulp or staying up all night because of horrendous plot twist. Just expect to have your WTF face because some can't believe what you are seeing are happening and your water ready because you'll be laughing out loud until you dehydrate.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nProbably one of the best there is. Unfortunately, Senyuu and Senyuu 2 only covers the first volume of the webcomic, so character development is not going to be there. But they are given great personality that for god knows how, mesh very well with each other. \\n\\n\r\nAlba, our protagonist and hero, is the straight man (the tsukkomi) that yells out the weirdness or the not logic of something that is happening in the anime. That is his whole personality, because as our soldier, Ross, would say \"a hero that can't even comment is like a fried egg without the egg\". Our soldier, Ross, might as well be a professional sadist that made his life goals to have our hero, Alba, be in despain 24/7.\\n\r\nRuki, our third party of the trio, are an adorable demon with hardly any power but changes her personality all the time, depending on the situation.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are also very funny.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nIt is a comedy so fighting or beautiful art is not going to there much. BUT! Senyuu is a short so I guess, unlike normal anime, the animators probably have more enough time to make Senyuu good. Because the animation is good, it is clean and sharp and no \"one panel that looks really wrong/lazy*.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI beg of you if you are going to watch it, or has watch it but doesn't know this. You are most likely will watch it online or download it. While I don't know about the download one, I know for sure that if you watch it online you are just given the story and then the ending. So I beg of you to go to youtube and search for Senyuu op because it is worth it.\\n\\n\r\nSenyuu opening are over exaggerated scenes from the anime itself that makes you think that you are not watching that silly, comedic anime Senyuu but some other serious, dramatic anime. With awesome catchy opening too!\\n\\n\r\nThe ending are really nice to listen too after laughing for 4-5 minute straight, very melodic and soothing. While the anime itself uses rpg kind of soundtrack, like when you level up in a game.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nYou can easily finish this anime in about one hour with a story and characters that, no matter how you feel that day, will make you laugh.  So yeah, give this anime a try!",

There's something charming about it that other shows seem to lack. \r\nThe story is good, to begin with. Each episode is not it's own crack episode: there is a storyline (however vague and loosely connected) and there is a large cast of characters with different relationships to the plot. I found that interesting. On top of that, it honestly has a betterplot than a lot of serious anime that I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good, especially considering the (probably) low budget and the terrible animation and art that most short animes tend to have. It's by no means intricate, but it even makes the art part of the joke. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, while very crazy, have actual personalities. Even if they seem like parodies of characters, they truly seem to have motivations and goals and defining traits that make this anime quite refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this a lot! \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if you: like medieval stuff, like quests, like crack fiction, liked Akatsuki no Yona and wanted a kinda parody version of it, like sadistic or questionable characters, like stupidity, liked Teekyuu\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if you: want something serious, wanted something heartfelt, were looking for a legitimate journey of some sort, wanted something deep, cannot tolerate subtle and frequent jokes about lowkey pedophilic people\\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

            "content": "Hello, minna-san!\r\nHere i am with my review on Senyuu.\r\nWhen i first read the synopsis i wasn't really sure if i wanted to watch it. My expectations were somewhat low, but that was only before i turned on the first episode.\r\nIf there is love from the first sight, than Senyuu is the case. I never imagined that action about heroes and saving the world could be THAT funny. You would usually expect some drama, some pathos, lots of fighting and pinches, really strong good and bad guys.. With Senyuu it was quite different. \r\nActually the first thing you should know about this anime is that youare gonna laugh a lot. Each episode is aproximately 5 min long, and during this time you are really unlikely to stop laughing or, at least, smiling.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nWhat i really love about this anime, apart from its humour, is the characters. Even though episodes are short and there's only 13 of them, you will get a pretty good idea about their personalities. Their design is pretty much interesting and fits in anime's style really well. I also loved the naming, f.e. the 12 demons are named after name of a month and its number in german, like Ein Januar, Zwei Februar, etc.\\n\r\nVoice actors did really good job as well. \\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY\\n\r\nThe main point in this anime is its jokes, so it's more about dialogs and different comic situations, than about story. Though something was really going on in the series, the story hadn't proceeded much in the first season. But that's hardly a bad point, and the only thing a wished for was not more story, but more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nTHE ART\\n\r\nThe art actually is pretty simble, but that's expected of the anime that's about comedy and parody. As for me it's not really inportant whether the art is simplistic or glamouros or whatever. What really matters is whether it fits the idea of the anime or not. Senyuu's art surely does fit, 'cause funny anime must have funny art.\\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND\\n\r\nThe sound was somewhat cheerful, though i didn't pay much attention to it. Guess that's a good thing, hm.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nAs for me it was really enjoyable. If you're feeling down, you must watch it and you'll feel much better. If you're not feeling down, you still must watch it and again you will be in a better mood. \\n\\n\r\nThe second season of Senyuu is airing this july and i'm really really really looking forward to it.",

Though, it's not the best laughs you can get out of an anime, butit's still very solid; Senyuu was entertaining from the very first episode till the last and you may even wished that the series was longer. Character development is lacking - from a 5 minute, comedy series, that was expected.\\n\\n\r\nWhile lacking a unique(and serious) storyline, Senyuu offers great sense of humor together with funny, and likable characters.

            "content": "Disclaimer: The following review is based on my personal opinions, and does not feature many objective analyses. As such, this may not coincide with yours, or the general publics opinions.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\"I'm like a cinderella of love, I can only love girls younger than 12\"\r\nI\u2019m usually pretty reluctant to watch shows with episodes shorter than the normal ~20 minutes, because I feel like they won\u2019t be able to fulfill what I actually want to see in an anime. However, today I was pretty bored, and I thought to myself that I might as well try watching this...\r\nStory: (7 / 10)\r\nWhen watching a series built on 5-minute episodes,you can\u2019t possibly go in expecting an awesome, or heartbreaking story, because that\u2019s obviously not what you\u2019re going to get.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, Senyuu is more or less about the comedy, using the story as a means of progressing things and introducing new characters.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode starts with a recap of prior events, which at first I thought would be really annoying, as the episodes are short enough, without them telling us about what we\u2019ve already seen. However, to make up for this, they try to change it up with each recap (in terms of the artstyle, complete changes in the narration, etc).\\n\\n\r\nBut the series\u2019 humor is where it really shines. It all mostly consists of slapstick comedy (or atleast I guess you\u2019d call it that), but I also noticed a lot of cultural references, both to japanese culture and anime, as well as western culture, mostly referring to popular internet culture.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (7 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Senyuu is an interesting variation of many different art styles. Most of the time you have the common art style, seen in basically every other show, but now and then they make cuts to scenes where all of the characters are like... chubby stick figures, I guess would be a way to describe it. There are also scenes where some characters are just made up of parentheses and other symbols, or scenes looking like they were \u201chand painted\u201d, so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it makes for quite an interesting experience, and I feel like it helps bring out the true nature of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (7 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not a lot to talk about here, to be honest. The voice actors all did a great job in portraying their characters, but nobody really stood out from the others, not that this was a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, I didn\u2019t really notice a lot of the background music at all (though I rarely do this unless it\u2019s very prominent), and the ending song was decent at best, for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (8 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nIn a series like this, where you basically lack any extensive story, I feel like characters play a really important role. You need to have good and generally funny characters to bring forth the comedy you have in store for the show.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like Senyuu really accomplished this, with its rather eclectic cast, including an old man who desperately tries to protect all the loli\u2019s around him...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I quite enjoyed the series, and it made me laugh numerous times. My one complaint would still be that it\u2019s so short (and that the recap takes up a whole minute of that time period, most of the time), but thankfully there\u2019s a second season coming very soon!\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for something very short, either for a laugh or to just keep you entertained for a bit, then I\u2019d definitely recommend this show.",

            "content": "Hoo boy. How does one review Senyuu?\r\nWell, I suppose its best to start with its origins. You see, Senyuu has some rather unusual origins. Most of the anime you see will fall into one of three categories: based on a light novel, based on a manga, or (usually the most rare) original properties from the studio in question. Senyuu is none of these--its based on a webcomic, though its likely not what you think when you see the word 'webcomic'. I guess the best way to define it would be to call it the Japanese Homestuck. This may be a strike for or against itdepending on your outlook, but keep in mind that this comparison is 100% only to the sequential format of the original comic and not to the storytelling or comedic style.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah. Not something you'd expect to have an anime adaptation. But the Senyuu webcomic exploded so much in popularity in Japan that Liden Films & Ordet joined forces to profit off that popularity (in association with Nico Nico, I can only assume thanks to the various Nico Nico plugs). What we got was something that was definitely BETTER than the original webcomic, technically speaking, but is still very strictly a 'your mileage may vary' kind of show. Basically put it just isn't a show for everyone. \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that might irritate people is the format. Your average Senyuu episode is about...three to five minutes once you shave off the opening, ending, and narrative explanation of the previous episode. This is a format that can work well in a lot of stories that are episodic jokes, but Senyuu runs into the issue that it is ultimately not an episodic story. Instead of small chunks of jokes, we're basically seeing small chunks of a full show here. There's a narrative being cut apart, that being the narrative of the hero Alba's journey and the ultimate goal of defeating Dezember, Juli, and Rchimedes. And while the show is still funny as can be, clever, and peppered with great characters...this format can get annoying. \\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to the story itself! Senyuu is a tried and true parody of the RPG fantasy genre, even going as far as to include classic game screens into some of the episodes. There is even the classic storyline: the Hero is recruited by a royal to go and defeat the Big Bad. It pokes fun at many of the aspects we've become accustom to -- the descendant of the hero (except wouldn't he have lots of descendants?), the Demon Lord whom all fear (except he's really not worth fearing), and ultimately the role of how use(less) a destined hero can be. Make no mistake, this show is an onslaught of jokes both at the expense of RPG fantasy and at the expense of the world that they've created. And its funny. Its a good deconstruction of its genre while managing to make plenty of jokes outside that scope at the same time. There's a few groan worthy jokes (I still can't make myself laugh at the 12 Demons named after months) but for the most part the show presents great humor at the expense of themselves.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this brings us to the true strength in Senyuu: the characters. When describing characters like these, the words 'idiots' and 'jerks' come to mind pretty often. But for once, that's actually kind of a good thing. This is because the main character, Alba Fruhling, is pretty much a straight man character that the world loves to beat up on for realizing how insane all of these tropes are. He's accompanied by a sadist soldier with a secret and...uh, the Demon Lord who all fear. Or at least the Demon Lord's 10 year old granddaughter, ripe with cuteness. Follow this with two Heroes who are money hungry and halfway to crazytown, a princess in an Fullmetal Alchemist suit, a demon who didn't even want to be here and is feeling so attacked right now, a masochistic cat, a school delinquent immune from the laws of realities whenever his friends are in danger...oh jeez, the list goes on. It could be argued that maybe Senyuu has too many characters but honestly, when each and every one contributes so well to the jokes while being so contagiously likeable, its hard to say that this is a problem. They're all just so brutally fun. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about the sound. The voice acting is REALLY good (though this specific show lacks a dub) with each character's execution of their lines adding a whole new dimension to already funny jokes that were in the webcomic. Unfortunately, besides the good voice acting, the sound is just kind of there. The background music isn't memorable in the least and, well, if you like the opening/ending songs then more power to you but they come off as more boring than anything else. At least, that's my two cents on it. Good voice acting, pretty mediocre everything else. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I honestly loved this show. It's a 9/10 for me. But I have to recognize that the show has its deep, deep flaws and that not everyone is going to be into this kind of format. It's the kind of show you'll either love or you'll hate. It doesn't take itself seriously in the slightest to the point where it will even mock itself if it DOES start to get serious, and the way the story is strung together through short episodes is a good idea in theory but just is annoying in practice. If you have an open mind about unique formats and like parody, then this show is probably for you. If not, it still might be because the characters are so delightfully brutal and the jokes aren't always about parody. It's an easy show to dislike, but its also an easy show to absolutely love. Which is probably how a webcomic became a television show to begin with.",

The story (although progressing steadily) is always on the back burner here, as the jokes take precedence, and unlike other animes, Senyuu has the ability to cause a serious amount of rib-tickling. The one downside is the length of each episode being only five minutes, that being said, five minutes of quality outweigh thirty minutes of....not.\r\nThe strength of the series lies in the random happenings, in a style similar to family guy, these random comic acts always flow quickly and easily, and rarely were too random. Due to this, the show does tend tobounce around quite regularly, however, this compliments the randomness of the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nI would highly recommend this anime, if you're on the fence, it's only five minutes an episode, give it a try, although be prepared for a fast pace from the start.",

But if you rather want to watch a funny, Quick and fun anime, then Senyuu is more of your choice.\r\nStory got a 5.\r\nArt, Not very detailed, yet still Fair. Great for this kind of Anime.Fun, Colorful. And Joyful arts. It is still not the best, But it fits really well. I give this a 6.\\n\\n\r\nSound, Was good. Pretty basic sounds, The OST I personnally didn't really Like. But yeah, Pretty Basic Sounds. Some of the Voices annoyed me, Some we're okay. Well I gave it a 5.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, They we're okay. They we're unique indeed. Funny and different Mentality for each and everyone of them. I did not like the Main character, He  was kinda annoying, But that doesn't change the fact that it made it Funny, Which is the goal of this Anime. So, I gave this a 7.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Senyuu.

Its enjoyable and fun and really and even if you disagree the time investment is minimal. I'm not a fan of short anime, mostly because they tend to be well done and I hate not having more content. This remains the case with this one, it was funny and I enjoyed it but alas I'll never see any more episodes. \r\nThe story revolves around a fantasy setting. Holes opened up around the world and demons came out of them, causing mayhemand panic. The king sends out an ancient heroes descendants to reign in this threat and to kill the demon lord. However as I mentioned before this is a comedy and spoof anime so even this plot line gets spiced up with minor gags.\\n\\n\r\nArt is dated but not terrible. The music was decent and the voice actors are great.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were funny but since its not serious or long their isn't much development.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show a bunch and its well worth the hour or so you need to invest to watch everything. The comedy style is based around wacky situations that the straight man comments on. To me this is very hit or miss comedy style but I enjoyed it, perhaps not as much as everyone else as this anime has tremendous scores and praises. Anyway give it a watch.",

The artwork and the sound are also amazing considering it was aired in 2013 but the best thing about it is its characters, i doubt you'll find better characters like this in anime anymore. \r\nThis was a veryentertaining anime with a great plot, artwork and characters. It's quite funny and is a MUST watch. I really love this anime because of how it cheered me up when i was going through one of those sad periods.
