            "content": "One phrase that would perfectly describe Shirobako is simply ingenious. Surprisingly, the series has cleverly put together a lot of elements into one stand-out show. Aside from being an exposition of how anime series are made, it also tells us a cute and charming story all while boasting a splendid cast of characters and vibrant, dynamic designs.\r\nThe art in Shirobako is lovely. Although vibrant and dynamic, it is never flashy nor exaggerating. It is clean-cut and simple but more than enough to bring the story into fruition and to distinguish one character from the other. The sound is also kept simple, evoking the right feelingat the right moment. Shirobako couldn\u2019t ask for anything more fitting. The theme songs fit perfectly with the story too: inspiring yet also fun and relevant.  All in all, Shirobako exercised its liberty pretty well regarding its production.\\n\\n\r\nThe giant cast of characters actually does not pose a problem for character development and, in general, for the series. During their respective screen times (no matter how little they had), they are well flesh out. The realism they portray is an exceptionally rare feat. They are not archetypal and overblown. All of the characters, especially the five girls, possessed and displayed certain realistic qualities that break free from the confines of typical slice of life anime. The series was careful to not be intimidated by the size of the cast and to handle it with finesse.\\n\\n\r\nWe follow the lives of five girls as they struggle to live their dreams in the anime industry and an unlikely animation studio fighting against all odds to produce quality anime. It is a tale of of the creative process, professionalism, teamwork,  and finding one\u2019s motivation. It is amazing to point out that Shirobako\u2018s core story is incredibly simple yet satisfying. The side stories are also quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nBut what makes Shirobako stand out is how it is able to masterfully and effortlessly incorporate the core story, multiple side stories, and a brief but informative look into what goes down in the anime industry into one seamless and fluid narrative without ever losing focus. It is never overblown with the unnecessary. All these elements are treated with careful balance \u2013 something not all anime series have \u2013 that underlies the show\u2019s ingenuity.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako is an anime that is \u201cjust right\u201d. It breaks one\u2019s expectations without betraying them. You just have to enjoy it as it is as you learn countless things about life, careers, and, of course, anime. The series is a force to be reckoned with and I could easily recommend it to anyone, especially to those in need of a surprise.",

            "content": "Shirobako is a love letter to the anime industry. It doesn't glorify it or portray animators as hyper-talented geniuses, and many of the characters in the show admit they do not even understand why they're working in the industry. But there's something that keeps them passionate about what they do, even if it may not be the most respected form of media out there. \r\nShirobako is also a genuinely well-written and entertaining story in its own right. It's a highly informative and interesting look at what the process of creating anime is all about, but it is more than that, too. And it is alsocourageous for being an original series and for telling a story about adult characters rather than the typical high school fare that anime is seemingly incapable of escaping from. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are expecting tons of drama or deep, philosophical themes (in which case I'd argue you're in the wrong medium), Shirobako is not going to be for you. It is a story about the mundane, the everyday struggles of the workplace. Rushing to meet deadlines is often the most the characters have to deal with in any given episode. And there's something inherently appealing about that, I think. The closer something is to reality-- the more mundane it is, the more you can relate to and empathise with what's going on. Being able to empathise is perhaps the most important part of any story. \\n\\n\r\nShirobako does attempt to break away from otaku fantasy-land by making its world more resemble ours. There are obese characters, old characters, married characters and all sorts of other types that populate our world and yet are seemingly extinct in the vast majority of anime. There's definitely still a large 'moe' appeal for most of the female characters, but there is never a point where it becomes overbearing. Shirobako doesn't resort to panty-shots and beach episodes and other sorts of contrived nonsense in order to make the girls appealing. Their cuteness is more natural; it stems from their personality and their flaws rather than their body, even if Yano's stockings and Diesel-chan's side ponytail are perhaps the greatest things my eyes have ever witnessed. \\n\\n\r\nI do have to wonder why anime are so afraid of including female characters outside the high school age range, as if they are somehow incapable of being interesting or likeable once the clock strikes 18. The girls of Shirobako are in their 20's and yet they are far more appealing (and yes, more cute) than the vast majority of teenage characters. Maybe that could be my own oldness speaking, but I'd like to see more variety and more 20-somethings like there are in Shirobako. There's far more that can be done with adult characters. Shirobako understands that life exists outside of high school, and it isn't afraid of showing that life. \\n\\n\r\nBut only talking about the appeal of the characters would be a disservice, as there is far more that makes Shirobako an outstanding anime. Most people who watch the show are going to have their attention on its portrayal of the anime industry and the animator's lifestyle, which are shown with extensive detail in each and every episode. Even if you have no knowledge of how the anime industry works, by the time you finish Shirobako, you'll have a pretty OK idea of how it does. It does not just focus on the animators alone, but also the lower roles (such as the delivery dude/lady), all the way up to the very top management who decide the voice actors and how the anime should end. It does lend to a deeper appreciation for anime as a whole, as you'll realise that even the complete stinkers may have sucked because of a minor managerial mistake rather than incompetence. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot speak to how accurate these things are since I'm not an animator myself, but what I can tell is that the show is obviously idealised to some extent. It is, after all, meant to be a piece of entertainment rather than a documentary, so occasionally the characters will do things such as working at superhuman speeds or engage in the usual manzai routine for comedic effect. The story actually goes completely bonkers in the last couple episodes (with one of the characters actually deflecting bullets with the lard in their belly - YES REALLY), so it wouldn't be a good idea to expect Shirobako to be a perfectly accurate representation of reality. And then there's those talking stuffed animals that are never really explained. Magic, or something? \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that Shirobako is an anime-original series and not an adaptation of some other manga or light novel makes it an inherently positive presence in anime, I think. P.A. Works not only made a great anime, but something that is strictly 'anime' and not a property of some other medium. Personally, I am getting pretty bored of anime's role as the 'adaptation medium'. The industry would benefit from more titles like Shirobako, even if that means studios taking a bit of a financial risk. \\n\\n\r\nShirobako can be a bit misleading, though. The first episode creates the impression that the entire story is going to be about the five high school friends working together in the anime industry, but that isn't really how things pan out. It is a story about the events of Musashino Animation. Only two of the five girls work there as regular employees for the majority of the series, with my goddess Diesel joining in the latter half and the remaining two pitching in at the very last moment. Some people may find this a bit disappointing, but I thought it was the proper route for the story. Adult life rarely ever works out exactly as planned, and Shirobako is very much an anime about adult life. \\n\\n\r\nIt would be pretty ironic if an anime about animation had poor animation, so it's fortunate that Shirobako looks and sounds as nice as it does. There is none of the usual 'sameface' phenomenon that plagues most anime with a moe art style (which Shirobako most definitely has), and the backgrounds are often filled with detail (like an anime figure sitting on a desk to the side) which makes having a wandering eye recommended. It's a bright and visually pleasant show, while the music, even if it's not particularly notable, creates an appropriate atmosphere. There are no melodramatic 'PLEASE CRY NOW' piano pieces, and for that I am thankful. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of preferences and standards, I think Shirobako is more than capable of being one of the most enjoyable experiences anyone has with anime for a very long time-- especially so if you have any sort of passion for the anime industry. It's well-written and free of any noteworthy flaws, sure, but it's also informative and unique for a medium that has been plagued by sameness for decades. Why there haven't been anime like Shirobako until this day remains a mystery to me, but it has made me regain some hope for the anime industry-- it's still capable of creating great things, it seems.",

            "content": "~Multilingual review, English & Espa\u00f1ol: SHIROBAKO~\r\nHey... did you know?, in the Animation Industry an anime episode which is distributed to the production staff members prior to its official release is called \"shirobako\", litteraly \"white box\", that's because at time VHS tapes containing the episode were enclosed in white boxes and distributed, despite the fact that white enclosures are no longer used, the term still remains in use in the actual anime industry, thus the anime's title comes from that little particular, SHIROBAKO.  \r\nSimple but at the same time meaningful, a word which I was totally unaware of its background story, to tell the truthactually even if I've been watching anime for years, I'm completely ignorant when it comes to it's realization and process which follow a simple draw sketch, hand made, into becoming incredible pieces of animation rich of music, effects and sounds. This is the first time I came across with an anime that handles a theme with such professionalism and realism imitating with, almost, absolute perfection the production of an animated series in the real world, exaggerating and overreacting a bit with the details, with the final purpose of avoiding to bore the audience, and such effect results in an ironic comedy sticked that enough to the realism in order to don't lose it's seriousness, SHIROBAKO totally succeeded in recreating a working field with extreme quality.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize this series with just \"an anime about making anime\" doesn't describe it at all, actually I think it's a devaluation because in that way we're leaving behind the most important theme touched in it, and which is in my opinion, the reason it made shine this show: 'keep working to realize your dreams'. Unfortunately sometimes there are times that working hard doesn't guarantee the results we expect, and thus it feels like the sky fell upon us, like getting hit by a bullet train, extremely painful, sometimes it damages us more than any physical injuries might harm, there it is... the disappointment after failing.\\n\\n\r\n\"Not everyone who works hard is rewarded, however all those who succeed have worked hard!\"\\n\\n\r\nI need to say that the hard work is really shown through the show, our protagonists aren't passive girls, they've a dream and in order to achieve it they struggle and confront themselves with real life in their respective field of interest, trying to overcome doubts and obstacles, normal things for someone who is initially starting to find a place to fit in this society, after all, the approach to real life feels so genuine that we can easily relate to. Specially the ones who hasn't find a place in this world but keep working hard to find it, we'll be touched directly by the themes developed through this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the realization of an amateur animated short back in High School, Miyamori Aoi, Yasuhara Ema, Imai Midori, Todo Misa and Sakaki Shizuka, the Animation Club's members, promised all together to realize a professional animation work one day. As the years pass, in the present day, Miyamori is a 'Production Assistant' for Musashino Animation, Ema works as 'Key Animator' in the same studio, Misa decided to go for the computer graphics, Midori is still studying in the University but her goal is to write scripts and Shizuka works part-time meanwhile she tries to emerge as a voice actress. SHIROBAKO is the story about these five young women and the Musashino Animation, behind the scenes, 'what we don't see', of the Animation Industry.\\n\\n\r\nThrough the show's development the viewers experience almost each of the productions phases that make up the realization of a TV series, starting from the basic things such as obtaining the rights from the author, to later pass to the productive phases: Script, Storyboard, Character Design, Art Direction, Coloration, Computer Graphics, Sound Direction, Voice Acting selection, Editing and Assembly, and finally the end product delivery to the TV station. Everything obviously presented under the POW of the various characters that make part of this cycle of work, which going through the difficulties they might across, allow us to gain a vision, really close to the reality, of what means to realize a task in this working field, the meeting point, between all the different phases, is represented by Miyamori, our protagonist, which serving as 'Production Assistant' is in charge of coordinating all the works as well as being the bridge for each production's department.\\n\\n\r\nThe particular attention on details in this anime is really noteworthy, to allow a better comprehension of each production aspect, Musashino Animation was in charge to realize two anime series (an anime inside an anime!). The script was discussed, what message and which emotions should reach the viewers, redefine the characters in case the result isn't the wanted one, War fell upon the studios when it was confronted a 2D animation sequence to a 3D one and was asked which one was better, meanwhile in another department, voice actors selection was being held, another battleground...\\n\\n\r\nHowever SHIROBAKO isn't only a documental-anime, since great quality was shown in the characterization of each character presented, casting away any kind of stereotype, going directly through the realism route, a result which ended giving the show a really pleasant atmosphere. The cast was really huge, even so, each one of them had an opportunity to shine in their respective working field, each character had their own identity and goal in life, which through the series, lead them to a route of personal grow and professional development, with a special regard for, obviously, our protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nThe complete absence of Fanservice, and the typical cliche scenarios that could expose the girls sex appeal as well as the fanservice yuri undertones, characteristic features for anime with a female-only cast, was something that allowed the anime to have a certain level of professionalism, specially considering the interactions between the characters, it was something I really appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Designs were labeled by P.A. Works, it's almost like a seal of guarantee, this studio has the fame of creating one of the best visuals available in the current market, and again, it delivered, characters' range of expressivity was superb, between the bests I've seen. The Sound wasn't completely appreciated, in part because of the anime's frenetic pace, an another because of the heavy dialogues and explanations, in few words the attention was driven off from them, something that I couldn't say it's a bad thing since the OST suited perfectly the scenes, it's just, they didn't were outstanding besides being a bit forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nSHIROBAKO represents an act of Love towards the Anime Industry itself, paying a tribute to all the people who works in this difficult field, and in the same time, showing a side completely unknown to most of us, presenting an original format of entertainment whose protagonists are the people who made all this possible.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Espa\u00f1ol]\\n\\n\r\nOye... \u00bflo sab\u00edas?, en la Industria de la Animaci\u00f3n cuando un episodio de anime es distribuido al equipo de producci\u00f3n, antes de su efectiva emisi\u00f3n, se le llama \"shirobako\", literalmente \"caja blanca\". En la \u00e9poca de oro, las video casetas que llevaban el episodio eran distribuidas adentro de cajas blancas, aunque si ya no se suelen usar m\u00e1s, este t\u00e9rmino se sigue utilizando actualmente en la industria, as\u00ed que el t\u00edtulo de este anime deriva da esa peque\u00f1a particularidad, SHIROBAKO.\\n\\n\r\nDe simple origen, pero llena de significado, se trata de una palabra que desconoc\u00eda completamente. Siendo sincero, aunque si mi experiencia con el anime est\u00e1 llegando a la d\u00e9cada, soy completamente ignorante cuando se trata de la realizaci\u00f3n y procesos que permiten a un simple dibujo, hecho a mano, convertirse en piezas incre\u00edbles de animaci\u00f3n, llenas de m\u00fasica, efectos y sonidos. Esta es la primera vez que me cruzo con un anime que trata de manera profesional y realista el verdadero trabajo que hay detr\u00e1s de las series animadas, su producci\u00f3n y creaci\u00f3n, paso a paso, exagerando un poco de las situaciones de cada d\u00eda en modo de crear una comicidad ir\u00f3nica, aunque siempre apegada a la realidad, aquel tanto que basta para no dejar de ser tomada en serio. \u00bfEl resultado? SHIROBAKO logra recrear un sector de trabajo de manera fresca y divertida de ver, despu\u00e9s de todo, \u00a1tampoco es que cada profesi\u00f3n sea apta para divertir a un p\u00fablico!.\\n\\n\r\nDefinir esta serie s\u00f3lo como \"un anime acerca de hacer anime\" no la describe en su totalidad, de hecho la deval\u00faa, porque deja de lado el aspecto m\u00e1s importante, y que en mi opini\u00f3n, es lo que hace verdaderamente brillar esta serie: trabajar para alcanzar tus sue\u00f1os. Desafortunadamente hay veces que el trabajo duro no es suficiente y no asegura el resultado que se espera. Es ah\u00ed que se siente como si el cielo se nos cayera encima, el mismo efecto que ser\u00eda ser atropellado por un tren, con la diferencia que es indoloro, pero a\u00fan as\u00ed nos procura un dolor mucho mayor que cualquier da\u00f1o f\u00edsico, ah\u00ed esta... la decepci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de fallar.\\n\\n\r\n\"Trabajar duro no asegura el \u00e9xito, pero puedo asegurarte que todas las personas exitosas han trabajado duro\"\\n\\n\r\nEl esfuerzo y la pasi\u00f3n por alcanzar tus sue\u00f1os est\u00e1n a la base de este anime, nuestras protagonistas no son para nada pasivas, tienen un sue\u00f1o y hacen de todo para alcanzarlo, confrontandose con la vida real en sus respectivos campos de inter\u00e9s, y en sus caminos se encontrar\u00e1n con obst\u00e1culos y dudas, cosas normales para alguien que apenas esta comenzando a encontrar su puesto al interno de esta sociedad, despu\u00e9s de todo, el aproche con la vida real se siente tan genuino que es muy f\u00e1cil poder relacionarse. Sobre todo nosotros los m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes, los que todav\u00eda no hemos encontrado nuestro lugar en el mundo pero estamos trabajando duramente para ello, nos sentiremos tocados directamente y especialmente por las tem\u00e1ticas afrontadas a lo largo de la serie.\\n\\n\r\nDespu\u00e9s de haber realizado un peque\u00f1o corto amatorial de animaci\u00f3n para proyectar en la escuela, Miyamori Aoi, Yasuhara Ema, Imai Midori, Todo Misa y Sakaki Shizuka, los cinco miembros que formaban el Club de Animaci\u00f3n al tiempo del liceo, se prometen un d\u00eda hacer un verdadero trabajo de animaci\u00f3n profesional todas juntas. Los a\u00f1os pasan, Miyamori se encuentra actualmente trabajando como 'Asistente de Producci\u00f3n' para la Musashino Animation, Ema trabaja como 'Dise\u00f1ador' en el mismo estudio, Misa se fue por el ramo de la animaci\u00f3n a computadora y trabaja para una empresa, Midori estudia en la Universidad pero su ambici\u00f3n es llegar a escribir guiones y Shizuka trabaja part-time mientras trata de entrar en el dif\u00edcil mundo del Doblaje. SHIROBAKO es la historia de estas cinco chicas y de todos los miembros de Musashino Animation, detr\u00e1s de las cortinas, lo que no se ve, en el mundo de la animaci\u00f3n.\\n\\n\r\nA lo largo de la serie la audiencia est\u00e1 presente en casi todas las fases de producci\u00f3n que componen la realizaci\u00f3n de una serie televisiva, partiendo de lo m\u00e1s b\u00e1sico como obtener los derechos del autor para despu\u00e9s pasar a las fases productivas las cuales son: Gui\u00f3n, Storyboard, Dise\u00f1o de los Personajes, distribuci\u00f3n de los keyframe entre los dise\u00f1adores, Direcci\u00f3n Art\u00edstica, paisajes y fondos, Coloraci\u00f3n, Computer Graphics, Direcci\u00f3n Musical, creaci\u00f3n de sonidos, selecci\u00f3n de dobladores, montaje conclusivo hasta llegar finalmente a la entrega del producto final a las estaciones televisivas. Todo obviamente presentado bajo el punto de vista de los varios personajes que hacen parte del ciclo de trabajo, que pasando por las dificultades que se pueden presentar, nos permiten obtener una visi\u00f3n completamente apegada a la realidad de lo que es realizar un determinado trabajo al interno de este ambiente, el punto de conexi\u00f3n, entre todas las diferentes fases es representado da Miyamori Aoi, nuestra protagonista, la cual sirviendo de Asistente de Producci\u00f3n, esta encargada de coordinar todos los aspectos adem\u00e1s de hacer de puente entre los repartos de producci\u00f3n.\\n\\n\r\nLa particular atenci\u00f3n puesta en los detalles es este anime es para premiar, para permitir la plena compresi\u00f3n de todos los aspectos productivos, durante la serie se realizaron la composici\u00f3n de dos series animadas (\u00a1un anime dentro del anime!). Se discuti\u00f3 el gui\u00f3n, que mensaje tenia llegar al espectador y cuales emociones deber\u00edan transmitirse, redefinir los personajes cuando no se obtiene el efecto deseado, se confront\u00f3 una misma escena hecha en animaci\u00f3n tradicional con una en CGI, dando vida a una pelea interna sobre cual es mejor, mientras que en otro reparto se escog\u00edan los dobladores, otro campo de batalla...\\n\\n\r\nPero SHIROBAKO no es s\u00f3lo un anime-documental, en cuanto grande calidad se demostr\u00f3 en la caracterizaci\u00f3n de cada personaje presentado, dejando de lado cualquier estereotipo t\u00edpico, puntando directamente al real\u00edsimo, un resultado que sinceramente se aprecia mucho m\u00e1s. El Cast se compone de un gran n\u00famero de personajes, a\u00fan as\u00ed, cada uno de ellos tuvo la oportunidad de brillar en su respectivo campo de trabajo, cada personaje tiene su propia identidad y objetivo en la vida, que a lo largo de la serie lo conducir\u00e1 en una v\u00eda de maduraci\u00f3n y desarrollo profesional, con un enfoque especial, obviamente, hacia nuestras 5 chicas.\\n\\n\r\nLa completa ausencia de cualquier forma de fanservice y de las t\u00edpicas situaciones clich\u00e9 que enfocan el sex appeal de los personajes, al igual que los t\u00edpicos tonos fanservice 'yuriescos' que caracterizan la mayor parte de las series que presentan un cast prevalentemente femenino, fue algo que permiti\u00f3 a la serie ser tomada m\u00e1s en serio, presentando un cierto grado de profesionalidad en las interacciones entre los personajes, algo que aprecie bastante.\\n\\n\r\nLa Animaci\u00f3n & Dise\u00f1os fueron firmadas por P.A. Works, y de verdad se not\u00f3, este estudio tiene la reputaci\u00f3n de hacer una de la mejores visuales que hay actualmente en el mercado, y otra vez, cumpli\u00f3 perfectamente, la expresividad que llegan a tener los personajes es de verdad notable, de las mejores que he visto. El Sonido no se pudo apreciar completamente, en parte debido al ritmo fren\u00e9tico que se llegaba a tener en algunos momentos, y en otras debido al di\u00e1logo pesado, en pr\u00e1ctica la atenci\u00f3n fue completamente desviada, algo que no es necesariamente malo, las OST acompa\u00f1an perfectamente las escenas, s\u00f3lo que, no se hicieron notar mucho adem\u00e1s de ser, un poco, olvidables.\\n\\n\r\nSHIROBAKO representa un acto de Amor hacia la industria del anime en s\u00ed misma, homenajeando a las personas que hacen parte de ella, y al mismo tiempo mostrando un lado que era completamente desconocido a la mayor\u00eda, presentando un formato original y dando protagonismo finalmente ad aquellas personas que hacen que todo esto sea posible.",

And then, Shirobako came around.\r\nAn anime about the creation process of an anime - or some kind of meta-animation or animeception - that is not only a daring approach to new age infotainment, but also an excellent opportunity for the creators to put in their passion associated with this kind of work, and to tell a realistic tale on the hardships that newbies in this industry are likely to encounter.\r\nShirobako managed to rank very high in mylist due to the fact that it is done with an astonishing amount of perfection, especially in terms of storytelling. This show is not about documentation, it actually has a decent, even exciting story in which the factual elements of anime-making are embedded. The first anime I was reminded of was Bakuman, doing practically the same with manga but on a more entertaining and less informative level. Shirobako, on the other hand, provides for an almost perfect balance between entertainment and information. A bunch of girls decide to follow their dreams to become a part of the anime industry, which is an excellent premise for the fact that the transition between school/university and work life is described in particular. It is especially this transition with its associated culture shock that is hard to outline on an emotional level. In actuality, it is not unusual to get rejected by companies although you were educated well, and just like that, dreams get shattered. The pressure that is inherent to these situations is portrayed by Shirobako in a marvelous manner.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako minds details. This becomes apparent even in the way the anime-making process is illustrated with all its facets, from storyboard creation over key/3D animation to post-processing and voice acting. In addition, as the heroine serves as production assistant, various aspects of management and leadership are also subject of interest. This all leads to a very realistic picture of what (harsh) business and work life is about in general. As someone who doesn't know anything or very little about the creation of anime, you will feel enriched by the level of detail that comes with the explanations, although this might lead to a noticeable issue as well. I found myself overloaded with information during the first episodes, which led to the assumption of mine that Shirobako will turn out a mediocre show. This relativised mostly after I had gotten used to the setting and the pace. Shirobako would have done well choosing a more progressive approach than a linear one regarding the amount of information conveyed. This, however, is criticism on a very high level.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, Shirobako is one of the few anime that does very well with the side cast, which convinces especially through personality variety. The female main characters are very similar to each other: the typical inexperienced and naive yet dreamful and highly motivated graduates entering the job market. Although this made it easy for Shirobako to refrain from elements to enhance character depth, I don't consider this a problem for it being a necessary mean to equally approach the various parts of the anime industry from the same viewpoint at the same time. This also helps the viewer to relate to the characters in general and to reduce the already high degree of complexity. The side characters, on the other hand, apart from those that serve the comedic aspect, are well conceptualized to act realistically and provide a credible personality. This shows that the producers of Shirobako approached the entire thing holistically and honestly, which implies a great deal of passion that must have been put into it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fits the show well and the OP/ED songs underline the basically happy and energetic atmosphere of the anime. Same can be said for the seiyuu. Where Shirobako really stands out is the level of detail that is presented in the images, for example in the backgrounds of the production companies' office that represents the main setting. I am honestly very impressed by how the arts support the realistic feeling that was intended to come about with Shirobako. This is what I, at least, expect from a masterpiece. Another big plus comes with the various versions of the second ending animation, similar to what Angel Beats! did, which adds to the perceived amount of effort that was exerted towards Shirobako becoming a remarkable anime.\\n\\n\r\nI raise my hat to Shirobako. If you want to learn something about how anime are made, or if you like shoujo/josei series and mostly realistic work-related anime, I implore you to give this show a chance. I assume that Shirobako appeals to a broad audience, however, be aware of the fact that you might get bombarded with information early on, which might dampen your enjoyment in early stages of the anime. I can suggest, keep it up, it's worth it.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 9.03/10\\n\r\n(A quantified evaluation can be found on my page.)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Yeah, I know Shirobako is going to go on for another cour. I saw the advertisement that promised to introduce more characters and more problems. Still, there's a reason this show isn't popular on Nano and it doesn't help that nobody wants to read the words of a man who hates their surprise-darling show of the year each week. As such, this will be the last I'm going to write about it, because after watching twelve episodes, I have to accept the fact that Shirobako (and PA Works stuff in general) is never going to appeal to me and move on to hating Ikuhara's newthing or something. But before we part ways, I want to finalize some thoughts regarding why I'm not into this thing.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, I didn't expect this show to explode in popularity (relatively-speaking) the way it did. But I sort of get why Shirobako appeals to the blogosphere. It has adult characters, which is considered rare in anime. It has snappy direction by the guy who made Girls Und Panzer, another critical darling that I don't really care about. It's about anime, and considering we're anime fans, that appeals to a lot of us. And considering that a lot of us have jobs or are struggling to get jobs, it's nice to see an anime that reflect that part of our lives.\\n\\n\r\nBut here's the thing, I'm not like most anime fans. Because you see, I \"do\" try to interpret things for basic enjoyment. I \"do\" want my fiction to not spoon-feed me what's going on. Even though I am capable of liking summer blockbusters and laugh-out-loud comedies, what separates the good ones from the bad ones tends to be elements that tickle the mind. And when my mind isn't tickled, it tends to shut off completely.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, there are limits to that sort of thinking. I like Mamoru Oshii fine as a director, but he can be obtuse to the point of being impenetrable (Angel's Egg, Sky Crawlers). Still, I don't like Roland Emmerich's blockbuster trash and there's a reason why Ingmar Bergman is one of my favorite foreign directors. Now I'm not saying Shirobako has to be at the quality of a Bergman film. That's too much to ask. But for all you fans of the show, answer me this: what exactly is in this anime for thinkers like me? Because being educated on anime production doesn't really leave much to the imagination.\\n\\n\r\n\"What about how anime production affects the employers who make it? After all, that's what you enjoyed about that one Paranoia Agent episode, isn't it, Mr. Flawfinder?\" It sure is, but here's the thing: the employee died at the end of that episode as a consequence of his production fuck-ups. Shirobako's biggest problem is that it never goes beyond threatening the characters' work positions. That's not an inherently bad thing, but that's only intriguing depending on how the employees deal with said threat, and I'm not seeing anyone rob a bank in desperation. I'm not seeing anyone contemplate suicide. I'm not even seeing anyone make any kind of sacrifice to keep their job. I see people spouting textbook lines and...that's pretty much it. This isn't mind-racing. This isn't even a plot. This is just fanservice without purpose, and I don't do fanservice without purpose.\\n\\n\r\n\"But wait, Mr. Flawfinder! Considering who's directing the show, surely you must be laughing at some of the jokes...\" Okay, I'm going to have to stop you guys right there. Aside from You're Being Summoned Azazel-san, Mizushima hasn't directed anything I've really enjoyed, and the reason the former appealed to me so much - or at least the first season did - is because it was mean. It subverted my expectations in clever ways. It was borderline offensive. None of his other works do that, and Shirobako in particular isn't even close to being mean. In fact, most of the humor comes from in-joking, and I hate that sort of stuff when it's the crux of your humor. Hell, I found it (along with the lack of intriguing plot and character) painful in those Expendables films, and those movies are supposed to appeal to action fans like myself. And if I can't like an action movie that's pure purposeless fanservice, how do you expect me to like a slice-of-life anime that does the same thing?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't appealing to me because without good comedy and a good representation of anything I can sink my teeth into, there's nothing else they've got going for them other than their character designs and the fact that some of them are parodies of real-life anime staff (and we all know I don't care about those). There's no actual plot that goes beyond the characters living their lives. It's not even doing anything all that bad. It's just \"there\", and what am I supposed to say about something that's just \"there\"? Psycho-Pass 2? Whether you hated it or not, at least it was upping the ante regard its crazy failures each week. Amagi Brilliant Park? That's a highly-exaggerated comedic take on what Shirobako does, and yet I've written about every single episode despite only finding it decent at best because at least each episode succeeded or failed in a way that was fresh. Your Lie In April? It's one of the worst dramas I've seen in a while, but at least it's coming up with new ways to be tastelessly boring as it goes along - albeit not every week - and it's overall failures are fun to discuss.\\n\\n\r\nSo if nothing is appealing to me in a good way, nothing is appealing to me in a bad way, there are no hints to indicate that this will change with the show's second half, and it's not even giving me good views, what else is there? Appealing to me in an average way? Yeah, that's not my style, guys. Wake me up when PA Works makes an anime out of Jun Maeda's new thing. At least that has a good chance of boring me in a way that's fun to talk about.",

            "content": "I think it's common knowledge that two of the most important things in the world are doughnuts and anime. But when you combine those two things with well-written comedy, a plethora of memorable characters, and a realistic and interesting story, you receive something so great that it literally revives an entire genre of animation that has been becoming less and less creative as years go by. This mixture can be referred to as Shirobako, which can also go by the name of Watch This Show Because It Is Probably The Best Thing Ever. I'm not kidding. There's so much packed within the confines of thisslice-of-work/comedy/drama that literally anyone can take something out of it. Whether it be laughs, anime industry know-how, or even tears later on, we can all benefit from Shirobako in some way or another.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the lives of five girls and their respective ventures into the anime industry (But focusing mainly on one girl -- Aoi Miyamori), Shirobako gives us a glance into the many different aspects that go into creating anime. Miyamori, being unsure of exactly WHAT she wants to do as far as making anime goes, falls into the position of a production-assistant tasked with essentially making sure things get done on time. But apart from being a peek into the life of a production-assistant, Shirobako is a tale of realizing your dreams and figuring out your place in not only the workplace, but the world as a whole. Of course there are obstacles along the way, there always are, but Shirobako shows how different people in different positions cope with those obstacles. This culminates in a story that is not only a blast to watch, but actually provides various life lessons and a bunch of general knowledge along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThis show originally caught my eye because I've always wanted to bust my way into the anime industry. And just like Miyamori, I've always been unsure of exactly WHERE in that industry I want to be. It wasn't until just a few years ago when I finally realized where that was. But, achieving that goal isn't even remotely easy. And Miyamori, as well as the other girls in Shirobako, show you just that. Working in anime isn't all fun and games; it is a job. And like any job out there, it requires hard work, determination, and a clear view of what you should do next and when you should do it. But that's enough rambling on the hardships of anime-craft. It's time to dive into the depths of Shirobako and figure out why it is just so damn great.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nThe OST for Shirobako is underrated. The music easily fits the tone of the show at all times. It's happy when it needs to be happy, it's sorrowful when things aren't going right, and it's well-produced and well-written. Even though it features over an hour of original music, the soundtrack to Shirobako is often overlooked due to the fast-paced dialogue and never ending onslaught of jokes the show shoots out at you. But one aspect of the soundtrack you simply can't overlook would be the opening and ending themes. I'm not usually one to be overjoyed by catchy songs spilling out happiness all over the floor, but Shirobako's opening just forces me to smile every time I hear it. PLUS, the actual voice cast of the show are the ones that are singing these songs. AND THEN Miyamori shows up smiling and holding a doughnut as the opening plays and you literally have to look away from the screen to avoid exploding due to cutesy-happiness overload. Bravo girls, bravo.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nShirobako has perhaps the most extensive cast of characters I have seen since Mahou Sensei Negima! But they need those characters considering they have an entire damn animation studio and you can't run that with just the five main girls. But the cast here is not only extremely varied, it is extremely realistic and extremely lovable. This show absolutely nails every type of person you will ever work with. There's the spontaneous and overly-confident dude, the quiet and knowledgeable girl always willing to lend you a hand, and then the fat guy. Who can forget about the fat guy? It's not just the characters themselves that are great either. The way they interact with and even intertwine with one another is what makes those relationships so believable and so important. After all, this is a studio we are talking about. There will obviously be problems within the workplace, but these characters are smart enough to know that they need to work together in order to accomplish a set goal. Oh, and not to mention that each one of these characters has their own unique dream constantly pushing them forward. I'm going to stop here so that this section of the review doesn't take up half of your web-browser, but I just want you to know that you will never find another cast of characters this realistic anywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nShirobako looks about as pretty as an anime of this genre can get. The art-style is consistent every episode and each character is drawn with intense care and precision. The color-scheme is bright and joyous, but not overdone to the point where it doesn't seem real anymore. Character-design is fantastic and each character isn't solely equipped with just one outfit (A problem a lot of anime faces nowadays). The art is subtly reminding you that these characters are basically real people. Real people change clothes sometimes. That's just how things work. Another aspect of this show that kind of just blends in with how great everything is and winds up being overlooked would be the facial expressions of these characters. While watching this, keep a close eye on the faces. Shirobako doesn't go through the typical cycle of excited face, sad face, and embarrassed face. Every emotion the characters must portray is intricately woven to a point where that face can only fit one situation. It is these different levels of human emotion that are put together so perfectly that really make the art in Shirobako as great as it is, and only overdone when needed to elevate a joke to the next level.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nAs I said before, Shirobako is a glimpse into the inner-workings of the anime industry that can be inspected by those who either appreciate or want to delve into it. It works the same way movies about movies work. Obviously the viewer will be interested in how movies work if they are watching a movie -- the same goes with anime. How often is a show founded entirely upon reminding you that it is a show? Answer: Not often. But it isn't just this that makes the story of Shirobako one to remember. What makes the story memorable is how the dreams inside of it play out. In the real world, things aren't always going to work out the way you want them to. Some times, the outcome or a scenario will be laden with sadness instead of a resolution. When that gets taken into account, the show isn't necessarily all that happy anymore. Shirobako becomes less about comedy and more about a girl struggling to realize her dreams. It is that double-meaning that creates an atmosphere where you get to have a great time while still caring about each and every thing that happens.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe Shirobako isn't the most perfectly-woven anime ever created. But this is a review. And I just want to remind you that when reviewing something, there is a category that a lot of critics either miss or just forget about. That category is \"Enjoyment\". It's hard for me to say if I have ever enjoyed a show as much as I enjoyed Shirobako. In looking back on it, I can't ever recall a moment where I didn't care -- a moment where I got bored. The fact is that I was so constantly looking forward to seeing what happens next that Shirobako created an experience for me where the characters felt more like people I cared about rather than an animated cast just moving along my flat-screen television. I would find it hard to believe that anyone else who followed the show to completion didn't feel the same way.",

            "content": "Every so often an anime comes around that, while certainly not perfect, fully deserves a 10/10 rating. There are anime which get their 10/10 rating by being masterful works which envelope your senses and bring you on an exciting journey - but then there are also anime which change your perception, and change the way you think about certain things, which make them equally deserving. Shirobako is the latter. When initially hearing about and watching the first few episodes of Shirobako I certainly expected to find it interesting and insightful, I never would have thought that it would change my perception on anime, and ultimatelyhelp me appreciate the entire medium in a whole new way.\\n\r\nSo, all that being said, I'll do my review the usual way, but when I get to the \"enjoyment\" section I'll explain my above section~ Let me break it down:\\n\\n\r\n~STORY~\\n\r\nShirobako, in short, is an anime all about making anime. Starting with a short scene with five girls in their high school animation club declaring to pursue their dreams to make anime together, we then follow Aoi Miyamori, Musashi Animation studio and the other four girls in the club as they work in the anime industry. The show is split into two distinct halves: 1-12 is about the creation of an original anime series, and 13-24 is about adapting a popular manga into an anime series. We then see the various struggles associated with creating anime, going across all of the various people and stages involved in anime - and seeing how the studio overcomes them. I thought it was a really great idea splitting the series this way, since both an original series and adaptation have their own difficulties during creation.\\n\r\nAside from the creation of these two series, across both arcs we see how the five girls from the animation club develop and determine how they wish to spend their futures in the anime industry, or whether they want to be in the anime industry at all. This shows a good perspective of how to initially become involved with the anime industry. Shizuka Sakaki's journey as she tries to become a voice actress was one of my overall favourites.\\n\r\nOverall, what the story does is greatly humanise the anime-creation process. Which is wonderful, and what I'll certainly get into more detail later.\\n\\n\r\n~ART~\\n\r\nI'm going to have to break down the art into two sections: Firstly, just the normal scene-to-scene animation; and secondly, the big set-piece moments and the animation of the anime they're animating (It'll make sense in a bit).\\n\r\nFirst off, overall the show looks pretty average. The character designs are quite standard (which is understandable, these are supposed to be relatively 'normal' people), and the backgrounds aren't particularly imaginative (90% of the show is set in the various locations that anime is made, so mainly at desks, in offices). The colours don't particularly stand out as anything special. Honestly, it doesn't do much above what would be considered standard for anime today.\\n\r\nHOWEVER, this is an anime about making anime - so they also animate the anime that they're making. And I don't just mean complete scenes, I'm talking about the line drawings, the storyboards, without the backgrounds, etc. I love it. It may be easier to animate, but seeing behind the curtain at how anime looks at each stage of production was fantastic, and it looked genuine (which it probably was). Then there are the big set pieces, every now and again there are these moments where the show really shines - where this big sweeping scenes take place. I won't spoil them, but I would be lying if I didn't say I wasn't occasionally moved to tears when watching them.\\n\r\nBut speaking of tears, just one final thing to add - while sometimes expressions were exaggerated, I have to say that it all felt so human. There are a couple of crying scenes that, while slightly exaggerated, just felt so real (and once or twice I cried along with them)! For an anime that humanises the anime-creation process, the art had a big part to play in making that humanisation succeed.\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~\\n\r\nThe sound is mixed. Half the time it's just pretty standard slice-of-life soundtrack, nothing worth focusing. BUT THE OTHER HALF, oh yes, this is what's important. Shirobako helps illustrate the importance of sound in various scenes (when they're making anime), like when the sound is supposed to come in, what type of music is appropriate for which scene, etc. So, to not be hypocrites, in various important scenes Shirobako nails it. The final two episodes especially are fantastic demonstrations of how music can add to the weight of a scene, and really the majority of those final two episodes showcase the best the soundtrack has to offer (not to say that the rest of the anime's music is shoddy in comparison, but the final two episodes stick out in my memory). Aside from that, Shirobako also knows how to use silence to their advantage, able to add tension to a scene when appropriate.\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTER~\\n\r\n(Man this is definitely my longest review!) To keep it short, while the five girls from the animation club are the main five of the series - each and every supporting character in Shirobako plays an important role, fleshing out and humanising the anime. You can tell that the staff behind Shirobako clearly were drawing from the people they have worked with in order to make these characters. Whether it be from the inexperienced but passionate go-getters, the slightly jaded and experienced  cynics, those who talk big but ultimately fail to deliver (Tarou anybody?), and those who wish to simply better themselves at their craft. Shirobako's very extensive character list covers it. And you know what else? While, due to simply the enormous cast that the anime offers, I think the anime succeeds in fleshing out the majority of them to an extent which helps you connect to the characters. Not to the level of something like Cowboy Bebop, but it's definitely up there.\\n\r\nThe characters offer up different perspectives on anime as well, which is why I truly love them. Some of my favourites were Shigeru-san, the old animator who is struggling to find purpose in the modern anime industry as it shifts towards newer, more moe art styles than the era in which he was in his prime. Endou, who feels as though his skills as an animator are less appreciated as more and more CG is included in the anime-making process - and his complimentary character Shimoyanagi, the 3D director, who simply loves anime and being a part of the processes, but lacks the art skills to do key-frame animation.\\n\r\nThe key point in all of this is: They are all human. The people that make anime, from the director to the key-frame artists, from the production desk to the character designers; they all have lives, likes and dislikes, preferences and, most importantly flaws. The director is the best example. He loves anime, he loves making it, he loves creating a world and a story and seeing it come to life - but he's also childish, he doesn't like responsibility, he struggles. But ultimately the passion he has for what he does wins out. This is a story about making anime, but beyond that, the people that make it happen - and how they're so passionate about it.\\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~\\n\r\nIf you, for some reason, skipped everything before this - here is the short of it. I love Shirobako. As the episodes went on and I got more and more attached to the characters (and I mean ALL the characters), I cried with them, became stressed with them, but above all became passionate with them. I felt as if I was a part of their failures and their victories, even as an onlooker.\\n\r\nBefore watching Shirobako I knew that anime had a lot of people behind it, but I never really knew what that meant. Or, better than that, I never appreciated what that meant. Watching Shirobako has been as if I've looked behind the curtain and seen even just a little bit of what is involved in making this medium that I love. The way I've watched anime is now changed, I'm now more sympathetic to what goes on, even if I don't see it. The anime that I already love, I appreciate even more the obvious love and effort that went into them. And even those that I look down on, or don't enjoy, I can appreciate that human being dedicated their time into creating it - and that is astounding.\\n\r\nThis is not a documentary, there is certainly exaggeration for dramatic purposes, and there are certainly some things that are added to make the show a little more interesting (Everyone involved in anime are somehow very skilled in drifting and street racing?). But if even 10% of Shirobako displays some resemblance to the truth of how anime is made, then I applaud it. Some anime have made me think about things, made me look within myself, but Shirobako is the first to change my perception of anime, all anime, an entire medium after I have been loving it for as long as I can remember.\\n\r\nBut, even aside from all that, the anime is still fun. It's definitely the most authentic slice-of-life anime I've seen in a long time that is actually happy, and an overall positive experience.\\n\r\nSo in short: Enjoyment - 10/10. I will certainly watch this anime multiple times over my life for as long as I watch anime. I'm hoping that Australia gets a DVD release so I can actually buy it.\\n\\n\r\n~OVERALL~\\n\r\nIf you have any sort of feeling for the anime medium, if you enjoy anime as a whole, even if you're just tangentially interested in anime: Watch Shirobako. Not, \"you should watch\" or \"if you're into slice of life, you should watch\"; No, straight up watch Shirobako.\\n\r\nEven if you're only into action series, moe series, meccha series, whatever - you need to watch Shirobako. If it changes your perception only slightly of the anime industry, then that's enough.\\n\r\nShirobako is not perfect - I said that before - but it is what it needs to be, and it does what it needs to do. It humanises anime, gives the viewer an insight into the world of Japanese animation. The only thing I would've added to it would be the end-credit scenes actually showing the real-life process of making Shirobako itself, having the actual animators, artists, etc talking directly to the audience about what they do. But hey, that would simply be a bonus for what is already a great anime.\\n\r\nSo do it. Watch Shirobako. I hope it does to you what it did to me~\\n\\n\r\nToodles~",

            "content": "There are many ideas the average viewer thinks about when they are asked what makes an anime work for them. Is it the driving narrative that help to construct the pieces of the story? Is it the lovable cast of characters that help drive the story to its own path? Is it the breathless, but invigorating and vibrant animation that help to bring it to life? Is it the overall palatable visual design that help to give the show its identity? Is it the mesmerizing voice acting and sound direction that help to make it memorable?\r\nBut what if it's a little more personal than that,taking in account with the people who help make it and how the overall production goes? With so little information, it's hard to know what exactly goes on behind the scenes. Shirobako helps to alleviate this problem by providing the audience with a personal tale that focuses on the industry and the people behind it.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako follows the story of five girls and the struggles they experience following their dream in the anime industry. Their dream stems from their own little experiences of managing an animation club in high school, their hopes and aspirations held up high in regards to their future of wanting to work in the anime industry, not knowing the hardships and struggles that they will face in the near future. Although each have their own set of motivations and paths they set on, the show mostly focuses on Aoi, an amateur production assistant working at Musashino Animation and her experiences working in the industry she sought after.\\n\\n\r\nThrough her we see the basic setup to Shirobako, in that it's an anime about making anime with all the nooks and crannies that come along with it. From the writing processes, to general animating, to sound production, to editing, and so forth. It shows what goes on in the production with in depth and precise detail, never trying to dumb down its explanations nor barraging the audience with information. Instead, it flows with the backdrop of the story and helps to build and give flavor to the world it's set in.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with its details on the industry itself, it also gives attention to the people who work to produce it. The cast is immensely large and it shows, as each staff member have their own unique personalities, role, motivations, and backstory that help tie the story together in its attempt to show off the inner workings of the industry. Granted, it does comes off as overwhelming, but each character never particularly feels wasteful or comes across as flat, as they each bring an intoxicating and down to earth atmosphere and overall entertaining dynamic with their interactions. The cast always aim to provide differing viewpoints and details of the anime industry that helps build upon the subject matter and themes that it lays its foundation on.\\n\\n\r\nBut there's also a more personal story to take away from Shirobako. It isn't just some animated documentary on the anime industry, but rather a compelling character drama that focuses on the hardships of adult life and the struggle of a career in the fine arts. Some characters struggle to make ends meet, some have their aspirations crushed, some never get the break they deserve, some get stuck in the frenetic and tiring productions and lose purpose, some have their own vision compromised, and some just give it all up. While it's not afraid to show the reality of the world, it still maintains a nice, lighthearted tone through its humor and exaggeration. This helps give the series a positive, optimistic and genuine feel to it as it never leaves a certain comfort zone of its subjects to make sure it doesn't get too dark. However, it still manages to give the viewer a general idea of the hectic work they deal with while also driving their own development. It's all there to reinforce the central themes of the series, and feels absolutely genuine and believable in its manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, art, and sound in general are good, if not great. PA Works once again has the usual efficiency in producing stunning backgrounds, and aims to provide a realistic look to reinforce the backdrop of the show. Animation isn't particularly groundbreaking, but always feels consistent and fluid, never exceeding more than it wants to convey. The overall character design have a rather charming and vibrant feel to them, trying to balance out a memorable and colorful design while adhering to a realistic tone. Soundtrack is simple, catchy, and never feels out of place as it skillfully matches a certain tone it sets in. And finally, the outstanding VA cast comprised of newcomers and professionals help bring their performances to life with a believable and exhilarating spirit to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako feels like a love letter to the anime industry and it truly shines. From the bustling and frenetic take on what goes on production, the feelings and dreams of the people who work in it, and the love and care for such a niche industry despite the madness that comes with it. Thus, Shirobako's beauty resides in the nature of the industry, not only because of its heartfelt subject matter, but also because of how genuine and relatable it is.",

            "content": "The majority of the adult life concerns itself with the professional career. Enjoy your job, you spend much of your serious thinking time there, it\u2019s how you make your money and ultimately do really anything. It\u2019s important. I\u2019m sure we all want to be NEETs, ideally, but of course in today\u2019s world that\u2019s hard to do successfully. So we sacrifice time in the present for a sustainable calling. And when we do get that job, after some time we may think to ourselves: Why am I here? Why do I do this? How do this relate to my passions and dreams?\r\nSuch thoughts occupy Miyamori Aoi,our ever-passionate and lovable protagonist of Shirobako. In high school she dreamed of making an anime; now a young adult, she experiences the daily quirks, joys, and obstacles of working as a production assistant in an anime studio. She is indeed making anime come to life, although not in the way she had imagined; so for most of the show she ponders this question.\\n\\n\r\nMiyamori is the main character, but as a whole, Shirobako details the life of an anime studio. Each of the many characters, each of whom contributes towards the making of the shows in some manner, has his or her own distinct personality and design. Like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Shirobako has an outstanding cast that doesn\u2019t lose the realistic feel that is often lost when having so many characters. And the fact that they all work together as one big happy team, grown adults whose job description literally entails making anime, just makes me smile. Several times throughout the show you see many of the employees at Musashino Animation together in the same room, and to see these people talk about making an anime for youth so seriously is just\u2026 so gratifying. For someone who loves anime dearly, an anime about making anime is ambrosia and nectar.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s even more appealing about Shirobako\u2019s characters is how they interact with each other. Being a two-dimensional visual medium, anime inherently carries what I will call the Character Problem -- the difficulty with presenting characters in a way resembling three-dimensional human life. Given such constraints as limited screen time, limited movement, stylistic and peculiar designs, and so on, characters that are drawn on the screen just cannot appear as real as in live-action, and even less so than in real life. Often, to preserve memorability, an anime may make its characters very flat and distinctive, to the degree such that they react to situations the same way every time. Some examples of lackluster characterization are Brook\u2019s recurring request to see a girl\u2019s panties and Sumire Kakei\u2019s histrionic panicking for even slightly worrying circumstances. Yes, this method leaves you with memorable characters, but they certainly don\u2019t feel human. After all, in real life humans are not so different from one another.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is why in hindsight looking back at the many fun personalities of Musashino it feels like I\u2019m looking at the real thing. It\u2019s amazing how P.A. Works managed to come up with that many unique characters that aren\u2019t sharply defined as, say, the genin in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. There\u2019s something almost ineffably empathetic about the daily shenanigans of Miyamori and her coworkers; there\u2019s definitely something resembling real human emotions and feelings. Kind of how Dostoevsky through his writing succeeds in manifesting human thought -- notably Crime and Punishment, whose protagonist Raskolnikov resounded to me far beyond the written word -- but on the screen. It\u2019s hard to explain. But by the end of it all, I had grown to adore the characters of Shirobako, almost as if they were real. I miss them still.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on about basically everyone at Musashino, but for this review I\u2019ll focus on its heart, Miyamori Aoi. Although not being at the head of things, with her role as production assistant, she has to make sure operations are moving smoothly -- that animators are meeting deadlines, that Kinoshita is drawing the storyboards, etc. -- which is often stressful. But Miyamori, whose infectious ebullience and devotion to the job can only lighten the mood, is a welcome presence, both to fellow adults spending hours drawing or creating or editing and to myself. And, I think, to anyone starting to think about his or her future professional career.\\n\\n\r\nWe are creatures of pleasure, and thus the prospect of working a 9-to-5 job five days a week with sparse vacation time throughout the year isn\u2019t exactly promising. I believe that it is against basic human nature to enjoy doing work. However, doing anything with others makes it enormously more tolerable, perhaps even fun; such was the feeling I got when watching the day-to-day routine of Musashino. I have worked a 9-to-5 internship so I know what it\u2019s like, and after watching Shirobako I\u2019ve realized that that lifestyle isn\u2019t so bad -- you befriend your fellow slaves, you gripe together about your plight, you make it through -- and I think that this is important to recognize. If at least for that, Shirobako is mightily worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nFor when it concerns potentially lifelong commitments, we humans seek out an all-unifying reason, a single important motivating factor that justifies the contract we make with ourselves. Miyamori asks herself this question, even though she does like making anime and doing it with great people. I guess the more pertinent question is this: Does there even have to be a reason? If you\u2019re already on that path voluntarily, then you took the steps to reach that path, which means you decided to take that path, implying that there was a reason. Miyamori becomes a production assistant in the hope to come closer to her dream, of making an anime with her friends from high school. Don Don Donuts!\\n\\n\r\nWhich is where reality hits. From episode 1 we are immediately struck by how the lifestyle of someone working in the anime industry isn\u2019t all peaches and cookies. Sakata Gintoki described the anime studio as the \u201cmodern day sweatshop\u201d; and Shirobako very likely sugarcoats it, which means that it really isn\u2019t don don donuts at all. This is why we need to support the anime industry. This is why so much trash continues to be produced, and this is why the stigma surrounding the medium exists.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses, we see how Miyamori and her friends do become involved with the making of anime, but their dreams are yet far away. Take voice actors (seiyuu) for example. Watch any anime and you will be impressed by the sheer caliber of the industry\u2019s voices. They sound so incredibly real. But each selected seiyuu is but one of many more who audition and fail. In general, breaking out in the fine arts is like winning the lottery, except that you have some control over your chances. In other words, you gotta have both luck and talent in addition to hard work. I mention this because Shizuka Sakaki, the aspiring voice actor, has it tough. Don\u2019t expect her to get the part on her first try. It\u2019s unfortunate, but that\u2019s just how the modern day world works. Each spot has too many competitors. Just look at college applications.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Shirobako is one of the more realistic anime out there. The women aren\u2019t all ridiculously endowed. Facial designs are fairly accurate depictions of real human faces (by anime standards -- see Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works, Code Geass, or Re:Zero for example). And, of course, anything and everything related to the characters, whom I already mentioned. Their portrayals of real-life types of people are superb, and besides the hair they couldn\u2019t be more human.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, some other points:\\n\\n\r\nSOUNDTRACK\\n\r\nGigguk mentioned in his video \u201cMusic in Anime\u201d how certain melodies, when played at certain moments, bring on the feels because they are associated with certain emotions. Shirobako\u2019s main theme, a lighthearted, frolicking tune played on strings and what I believe is clarinet (and other instruments), changes throughout the show as certain cruxes are met. We see this technique often: Daenerys\u2019s theme gets stronger throughout Game of Thrones, the Fellowship Theme/leitmotif changes and grows more complex to parallel events in The Lord of the Rings. But other than that, Shirobako\u2019s soundtrack throughout can be described as\u2026 well, fitting. Yes, it sounds obvious; but there was something very apt about the quite sophisticated variety of instruments used and how the makeup adapted per the situation. I really liked it, and when I hear the main theme a smile comes upon my face.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\nIn Gigguk\u2019s video \u201cIf Anime Studios Were People\u201d, P.A. Works is represented by a cute chick admiring herself in a hand mirror who says that her work looks good. Personally I wasn\u2019t too enraptured by the marble eyes and spade faces of Angel Beats!, or the rather lean personages of Another; but P.A. Works did manage to have a bevy of attractive women in Shirobako. I\u2019ll name Miyamori, Yano, and Diesel-san, just to name a few. Strangely enough, Miyamori was and is very appealing to me, despite her relatively flat chest -- which actually made her more realistically human, which coupled with her demeanor made her stand out. I remember her more keenly than, say, Rias Gremory.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty solid. Characters weren\u2019t too clearly cut and yet retained a good clarity to complement the backgrounds. That is, it didn\u2019t look like they were distinctly drawn on top of something else, they were a part of it. The backgrounds themselves are what you would expect of today\u2019s anime, warmly colored with a gentle palette. No complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT\\n\r\nI learned a great deal about how anime is made. I knew that it was hard work, but now I know firmly that each episode carries a significant amount of time and effort put in by many people behind it. Just like any other white-collar company, employees have to meet deadlines, work long hours, and go through office politics. In Shirobako the featured studio produces two different shows, one for each cour. The studio itself is comprised of various roles, such as the production assistants, animators, directors, CGI, music editors, etc. You know when the credits roll after a live-action film and the list is really long? Exactly. It\u2019s amazing how these grown adults spend their lives making anime, and I\u2019m extremely grateful towards Japan for giving us so many great titles.\\n\\n\r\nBeing an anime about anime, Shirobako also pays homage to real-life anime. I won\u2019t go into detail and I\u2019ll let you see for yourself -- but you may recognize parodies of well-known directors, certain studios, and more. Shirobako for being Shirobako is for that reason one of my favorites. I cannot give more kudos to those underpaid, overworked people over there for creating the worlds and stories and characters that I\u2019ve grown to love, perhaps more than my own -- thank you Japan for Hellsalem\u2019s Lot, thank you for One Piece, thank you for the likes of Yagami Light and Roronoa Zoro and Saitama.\\n\\n\r\nPARTING THOUGHTS\\n\r\nSo given the enormous skill and diligence required to make anime, let us all refrain from criticizing any show too much. A series can suffer from terrible writing, unoriginal premises, low-quality art, plastic characters, and so on -- but even so, every show that\u2019s trash is still trash that\u2019s not easy to make. And when you see certain gems like\u2026\\n\\n\r\n       Kotonoha no Niwa, the best 2D art I\u2019ve ever seen;\\n\r\n       Gintama, the meta-anime that laughs at itself;\\n\r\n       Shingeki no Kyojin, the most addicting schlock ever;\\n\r\n       Clannad: After Story, love and tears and everything else;\\n\r\n       Mushishi, art;\\n\\n\r\nand literally a bajillion others, you\u2019ll realize just how incomprehensibly stunning anime is as a medium. I have never laughed more, wept more, smiled more, anticipated more, learned more, [verb] more than I have for anime.\\n\\n\r\nSHOULD YOU WATCH?\\n\r\nShirobako is a much-needed, refreshing story whose depiction of the working world doesn\u2019t exaggerate too much or show too little. It just is. The real world isn\u2019t too great, but if you look at life like Miyamori does and be cheerful, you won\u2019t regret your actions and you\u2019ll find your way. So yes, I give Shirobako the highest recommendation. It is one of my favorites and I\u2019m sure to come back to it again.",

            "content": "Ever wanted to know how anime is made? The magic behind the scenes is always something I\u2019m sure almost any anime fan would want to know. Shirobako opens up that curtain of magic as it brings together a show that discusses about making anime. It\u2019s almost a dream like come true for anyone who has a fascination in the art of crafting anime. Thanks to P.A Works, that fascination can now become a reality.\r\nAs an original show, it\u2019s noticeable for the fact that it\u2019s also a 2 cour that ran consecutively for 24 episodes. As the series is related to anime making themes, one mightwonder how it can cover so much. The answer is simple: work. Like it or not but making anime is not an easy task. It requires dignity, effort, teamwork, management, and unparalleled responsibility to get the job done. The sheer amount of effort is accurately depicted in this show from start to finish. In fact, the first few episodes of this series creates the atmosphere of reality. Indeed, realism is adapted as part of this show when it comes to anime making. Everything is incorporated with high degree of detail from prototype drawings, character designs, and voice acting. Those are just a few examples but Shirobako gives you the idea of what it\u2019s like to be in the shoes of these dedicated workers.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the story mainly retains its premise with every episode covering some sort of theme related to anime making. The title of each episode gives a good clue to what it may be about while also solidifying the details of what it\u2019s trying to do. In essence, Shirobako is known for experimenting. At Musashino Animation, you can see exactly what\u2019s going on involving the characters and their roles. With a mission set to craft a show about anime making, one should also clearly address its intentions. Luckily, it does just that by introducing our main protagonists. The main trio (Aoi, Ema, and Shizuka) shows us the harsh reality of the anime industry. Taking a few steps back though, the show also has a crystal clear narrative. It establishes the fact that these three girls has a strong dedication in their passion to making anime such as forming an Animation Club and even made a short show at school. For what is worth, this series is more than just a slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nAnother noticeable fact is the show\u2019s large cast of characters. Besides our main trio, there are numerous characters that all have some sort of role in the show. As such, don\u2019t expect much focus on the characterization or their development but rather on their roles. It gives them a performance and discusses their responsibilities. Each episode focuses on something related to the anime industry whether it\u2019s the director, animator, sound producer, storyboard, or production. The list goes on and on but the praise here given is how focused the show is directed at these roles. From conversations to mechanics, each episode specifically shows and tells what the true reality of their roles are like. At the same time, the series also makes its way to show the creativity of some of the characters. It reveals their skills not just in a realistic way but also in a profound method to grip the audience in their ideas. Sure, some of these ideas might not extravagant or earth shattering but the point is to show how these ideas came to be. In retrospect, Shirobako makes the audience feel like you\u2019re there; almost in a way like you are backstage with the cast. \\n\\n\r\nWhile on an individual basis, the characters may not stand out as much. However, the series rebounds this back by crafting appealing character relationships. From a professional viewpoint, we can see how the working relationship between the characters are like at the workplace. While many episode discusses the mechanics of the anime industry, some also does this on an interpersonal level. It provides adequate reasons of why people are there in the first place. After all, everyone has a reason of wanting to get the job and being part of the anime industry workforce is no exception. It also clearly depicts emotions and personalities of the characters by doing this with its thought provoking themes. At the same time, it\u2019s able to also squeeze in comedic moments (donuts, Initial D level driving skills, etc) to give the audience a gentler feel. As the series is about work, it\u2019s able to show that there are rewards for being part of the anime industry. It also be relatable too because anyone with a job will know what rewards feels like and how your efforts aren\u2019t wasted. For our main trio, they realize that as well as the series goes on. \\n\\n\r\nWith everything coming together, Shirobako can take a bulk of patience to get through or even get started. One should realize what the purpose of the show with every episode. And while it\u2019s not an educational show, Shirobako conveys anime industry with an immaculately crafting style. However, there are times when the show feels one dimensional. After all, there\u2019s not too much development in the overlay of the main story. Each episode ties in with one another with the principles of anime industry but some of them will feel dull or repetitive. The occasional dramedy of the series can also feel a bit forced. Resolutions can also come as abrupt while some conflicts really loses its momentum. Despite this, I give credit for Shirobako when it shows the characters\u2019 talents for resolving those conflicts. Every character in this show clearly has some of it.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork about a show involving anime industry? That\u2019s almost ironic. While the series clearly neglects any fan service, it\u2019s the artistic values of the show that will label Shirobako as a visual porn. P.A. Works\u2019 efforts is easily recognized by the strong artwork of the series whether it\u2019s character designs or setting. It establishes the foundation of the anime industry by creating that sense of realism. This includes the art of the studio and even the way the animation is done within this show itself. However, I do have some criticism with a few of the character designs that makes the cast looks a bit younger than they seem. While it creates a sense of growth with their roles as employees in the real world, they also look generic especially with our main female characters. However, it also does rebound this with some of the other characters who plays out their role as more credible mature adults. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is more or less on the weaker scale. Both the OP and ED songs are adequate but doesn\u2019t necessarily create a sensational feel. Additionally, some of the character voices of the adults feels monotonous. However, I do give credit for the dramedy of the series. During some of the more emotional angles (usually sub-plots) and character relationships, voice mannerisms are well delivered to present feelings. This is also true on a professional level when we see how some of the cast are desperate to get the experience by expressing their tone in voice. The mechanics with that is something I think most people will find thought provoking. \\n\\n\r\nSo what is this show really about? Shirobako literally means White Box but there\u2019s hardly anything plain about the series. Rather, it crafts a colorful imagery of what the anime industry is like from all angles. There will be some periods of time during the show where you may be itching to get through an episode because it may be something that is less appealing to others. At the same time, not everyone will be able to appreciate the idea of anime industry. That\u2019s fine though with the given concept but I still urge anyone to give this a try whether or not you have a passion in the art of anime making. With a creative cast of characters, dynamic realism, relatable mechanics, and great chemistry between characters, this show is definitely one of the coming ages. Oh and donuts.",

            "content": "I don't know how accurate Shirobako is about the nuances of the anime industry, but what I do know is that it absolutely nails the heart of why creative pursuits are so challenging yet so rewarding.\r\nThere's a short but definitive list of the things that make Shirobako the absolute best.\r\n1. This is an anime for and about adults. I don't mean this like it's super edgy extreme hardcore, I mean that despite its occasional goofiness, the show takes place in the working world and focuses on the struggles of its chosen line of work. The characters all have goals and challenges that relate to howthey fit their careers into their vision of what they want to be as a creative. Not that I don't enjoy high school supernatural adventure like the rest of us, but Shirobako dives right for an under-served niche in this medium and knocks it out of the park.\\n\\n\r\n2. Production value (cue Super 8 joke). This anime is all gorgeous, all the time. It's not just a manner of consistently top-notch art and animation quality. Nor is it just the massive cast with an array of fantastic designs. It's all that, plus unflinching attention to detail and no cut corners on the aesthetics. The backgrounds are always detailed and contain little personality-adding tidbits, and all the major characters have a variety of outfits that keep the visuals fresh. This is obviously an all-out production from P.A. works in story and art, and it absolutely shows.\\n\\n\r\n3. Everyone is a good person. The story of Shirobako is fraught with constant drama, and it always feels like the world is falling apart. Despite that, with one exception, there's no true villain in this show. There's conflict, but its all borne of people with limits in a line of work constantly pushing them to the brink. You can't help but root for everyone, even that dumbass Tarou or that prick Hiraoka.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako is an overwhelmingly positive show about connecting with your passion, and I couldn't recommend it highly enough.",

            "content": "Shirobako is yet another series I watched on a whim and which ended up surprising me in a very good way.\r\nWhile the first episode shows a bunch of high school girls who're part of an anime-making club, the show nearly immediately skips past that part of the characters' lives and instead treats us to a completely different setting instead, where we see them several years later as they're either already working professionally, or at least looking for a job. This alone was enough to catch my attention, since it avoided the overly done high school setting that so many series end up doing.\r\nThe main characterwho gets the most showtime is, by far, Aoi, as we're shown the highs and lows of the anime studio she works at as a newbie producer. It was really interesting for me to see the anime industry shown in both its good side, showcasing the passion and drive people have to try and make something they can be proud of, but also its bad side, with looming deadlines, quarrels and all sorts of hurdles that the studio is forced to overcome in order to deliver on its promises.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a show about something fairly mundane, it was really nice how much Shirobako showcased the whole process of making an anime, all the way from acquiring the rights to a series, to script writing to delivering the finished episodes, and the passion that oozed from each part of it. Besides the focus on Aoi, we can also see the her former schoolmates as they either work on the industry or try their best to make it in there, and the way they experience the whole process, learn from it and make decissions.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Shirobako might be a bit too positive at times (which might be a bit off-putting for some people), I'd definitely recommend it. It's a short but sweet series that happily surpassed the expectations I had for it.",

            "content": "Have any of these questions ever passed through your mind while watching anime? \u201cWhy did that last anime you watch have a dodgy scene of animation in the last episode?\u201d \u201cWhy did the animation style start to seem to slacken off as the show progressed?\u201d \u201cWhy on earth did the show choose to not stay closer to the source material?\u201d If so then Shirobako \u2013 the anime about making anime - can provide reasons for you delivered in an entertaining and memorable package. This labour of love from P.A. Works is one of my favourite shows I\u2019ve been lucky enough to watch of late. It\u2019sjam packed with a large, lively cast who provide everything from side-splitting humour to some very hard-hitting emotional moments. For a show about something as menial sounding as making anime, it manages to keep your attention throughout. It achieves this with flying colours thanks to a great selection of themes which include self-worth, talent, imagination and motivation \u2013 all clearly and realistically explored from start to finish. When all is said and done it\u2019s bound to give you a better appreciation for the process behind a show\u2019s creation.\\n\\n\r\nOur story follows Aoi Miyamori, a new production assistant at the fictional Musashino Animation. Along for the ride are her four former animation club classmates \u2013 Ema, Shizuka, Misa and Midori \u2013 all either successfully in or attempting to break into the anime industry. Each of the five carry their own hopes and dreams though reality tends to stand in the way of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn\u2019t take its time dishing out the drama revolving around the five characters, keeping the issues rolling in on a frequent basis. People are sick. People slack off. Above all, people make mistakes. As a viewer, I was constantly on edge. It didn\u2019t take me long at all to build affection for this motley crew of anime workers. I badly wanted them to succeed and was riding on every little piece of drama. \\n\\n\r\nEvery problem in the show, no matter how big or small, feels like it has a huge bearing on proceedings. Whatever happens never affects one person, it starts a domino effect across the office, and sometimes it can even reshape the entire final product. On top of this there\u2019s plenty of complexity to something as seemingly simple as a show set predominantly in an office. While our story follows Aoi in her role, there\u2019s plenty of things always happening around her outside of her control. Musashino Animation actually feels alive. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s impossible to talk about Shirobako without mentioning its sizeable cast of characters and its impressive feat of making none of them feel like a waste of space. There\u2019s the gluttonous yet nerve-wracked director Seiichi, the confident and obnoxious Taro, the no-nonsense Yutaka and the calm-headed, goth-clothing-clad Ogasawara to name a few. And I mean just a few. What P.A. Works have done is created a slew of side-stories utilising these characters yet somehow managed to not let that drag down the core story. All characters steer well clear of any negative and overused tropes. These are some of the most well written characters I\u2019ve seen in almost any form of animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe show loves bringing up common public anime-related debates and casting them into the spotlight. The most notable of these is the issue of hand-drawn animation vs computer-generated imagery. Sometimes the pace is dialled back a touch when Shirobako chooses to take a look at these ideas to explore them in good detail. Characters bicker about, yet gain an appreciation for, each other\u2019s methods. It tell us plenty of interesting little tales: Choosing the right voice actor means trying to meet a lot of different demands, a key animation retake can be more crippling than you\u2019d think and a communication breakdown can have devastating effects. There\u2019s a truckload of commentary on the medium and also a handful of lovely throwbacks to some of anime\u2019s most influential shows and people.\\n\\n\r\nArt-wise the show filled to the brim with a lovely selection of backgrounds and attention to detail \u2013 nothing we should be surprised about at all when it comes to P.A. Works. It\u2019s even the small details that sometimes go unnoticed, like characters actually wearing a variety of clothing, that breathe life into a show and those within it. They go a long way to showcasing each of their separate personalities.\\n\\n\r\nI feel it\u2019s important to approach Shirobako with the right mindset and knowing what sort of depiction of the industry you can expect. You shouldn\u2019t go into the show expecting a hyper-realistic look at topics like financial and/or social life problems that can easily affect workers in the real world. The show instead chooses to focus on the production hurdles, not the lifestyle ones, and I have no qualms about that. I\u2019ve seen some rather hilarious criticism over some scenes which have intentionally been crafted by P.A. Works as over-the-top moments. Had the show still included these scenes yet gone for the aforementioned broader (and perhaps darker) depiction of the industry then they certainly would have felt more out of place. Shirobako tells us from the opening moments the tone it\u2019s going for \u2013 a lighter-hearted and humorous one \u2013 so don\u2019t take everything you see as gospel when it comes to the production process. The show maintains a level of silliness at times and it\u2019s better off for it.\\n\\n\r\nThis polished work had me going on all ends of the emotional spectrum. Characters mad me mad and moments made me overjoyed. This is a special show and one that should be put on a pedestal in people\u2019s \u2018recommended anime\u2019 list. It\u2019s one of those shows I wish I could wipe the mind clear of just to experience it for the first time once again. Congratulations P.A. Works. You turned a show about making anime into one of my most treasured anime.",

            "content": "Shirobako is an anime about making anime. In this sense it feels very different to most shows you might have seen but different doesn't have to mean bad. At first I was a little sceptical about the show, after all, how exciting can an anime ABOUT anime be? Although at the same time, I was also a bit curious about what exactly would be in the show. If you've been watching anime for a while, then I really would recommend you take the chance, because the odds are that you won't regret it, it really helps you appreciate anime more. Even if you are relativelynew to anime, it is a wonderful eye opener. \\n\\n\r\nSo, how is the show presented? Shirobako does a good job of trying to pass on its message in the form of a believable story and very vested characters. We start the story following the lives of 5 girls who are all part of an anime club in high school as the year comes to an end. For some it is their last year while a few still have one year left, although no matter where they go on to work, they promise to one day work on a professional anime together. That is their dream, that is the goal that they look to pursue during the show. All these girls have their own passions within the anime industry, some want to be voice actors, producers, graphic and sketch artists and some don't really know where they can fit in, but want to be part of something. \\n\\n\r\nThe 5 giels aren't all given equal screen time, which in my eyes was a let-down since they all had such distinct personalities and you really want to know about all of them in detail. Shirobako concentrates on one of these girls a lot, Miyanmori, who has gone on to find a job as a production desk assistant at a small anime production studio, Mushishino Animation. We see the show through her eyes, her experiences and her interactions (for the most part anyways). She has a stable, friendly and professional attitude however is prone to stress (but aren't we all!) Shirobako then takes us through what it really is like to make anime, sometimes getting the point across via its bonkers characters or through very real, very grounded situations. \\n\\n\r\nWhen first watching the show, you might find it a bit slow to start with, I certainly did and for the first few episodes I wasn't getting a great vibe. After all, this show doesn't have much action and a lot of the time it is set in the studio, so those looking for something jam packed with action will not find it here. Instead, Shirobako has wonderful dialogue and great character interactions to keep you interested, it may be a little slow but persist. \\n\\n\r\nThe show really gets across the struggles faced not only in production, but also of common recurring problems in life. This was what was really refreshing, the struggle and hard work needed to reach a goal were highlighted well, some characters struggled to the bitter end while constantly questioning themselves and running into one wall after the other. Things aren't always sugar coated to make it nice, but the realism is conveyed in a believable manner. Almost all the characters have had problems to deal with in even the most simplest of jobs, it's very easy to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the biggest attraction of this show was the insight to what making an anime is like and in this respect you will not be disappointed, although for some I can understand why they might find the whole idea a little dull- although Shirobako does try to make it funny and quirky at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nGoing through the process of how voices actors work, how the people who are behind the drawings and sketches are inspired to just how difficult it can be to meet deadlines all the time. It really captures how frantic the entire process can be. It is also really fulfilling to watch the characters go about different aspects of building together an entire series. You will learn of the techniques they use as well as the new and old styles. You will get an idea of how friction might arise and how different people have different solutions around problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe art-style was impressive and you tended to notice it a lot more given how the show makes a point of art-styles itself in the actually storyline. The dialogue as mentioned before was excellent and the interactions very real- although there are some more over the top sequences with the sole purpose of emphasis, which is great. The OPs and EDs were nice, but mostly forgettable after having watched the show and it was only the 2nd ED that really stood out for me- they weren't bad but weren't amazing either. \\n\\n\r\nOther than being initially slow, of the drag back for me was the fact that so much of the show is within the confines of an office and while it was interesting to see a group dynamic, the show could have benefitted from more action outside the walls. While this wasn't a major problem for me since I am happy to go along with the situation, I can see why this might be a major turn off. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, despite having mentioned it before, I would like to seriously point out how there isn\u2019t much in the way of action or incredible tension (other than the stress of work) and as a result it can seem a down-right bore, especially to new viewers who are looking for action. The exaggerated areas, most which take place outside the show, like the car-racing sequences or the fictional left-shoulder devil and right-shoulder angel characters or just the extremities the characters take, does sort of remedy this. \\n\\n\r\nDespite everything, this is a thoroughly enjoyable show as long as you aren\u2019t predetermined in what to expect. It felt like a lively slice of life with plenty of humour. If you have been watching anime for a while, you will undoubtedly love the show even more, since so many different aspects and styles of anime are put forwards with great effect. In some sense\u2019s it will polarise opinion- but you won\u2019t know if you don\u2019t try!\\n\\n\r\nI most certainly will not be forgetting this show. \\n\\n\r\nTukky12\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Girls who want to make an anime together sounds something that can be cliche but the creators of this anime has made it original and fun. Its not one of those everything clicks at once and everyone is happy since everything goes well. No this anime fully brings out the process behind making an anime and not only that but the different sides of animation. Everything from drawing to voice actors. You canthelp but to love it every time one watch it. Although there are times you want to push one spesific character over a ledge his stupidity is almost errased from memory as the better and more fun characters enters the stage and really lights it up so much that you cant see that big insensitive idiot on the side. This anime has done what a lot of other anime cant and that is to stay true to themselves and go with their own pace. That is the feeling i had when i watched it and finished it. It felt like wow these guys didn't have to cram stupid stuff into it to make it fun to watch. It was a story about anime , its production and the people around it in its purest form. \\n\\n\r\nI think the sound is were i would think ah didn't really remember much here or didn't think about much here. Which isn't that good but the sound isn't bad either its just normal with hints of good soundtrack in between. And the opening and ending is a matter of taste i personally found them uninteresting but again this is just the sound and music so it wont bash my faith in this anime at all.\\n\\n\r\nOk if i had to talk about every \"main\" character in this anime i would make whoever read this bored fast since there are like 5 and there isn't a big meaning for me to 1 make someone bored and 2 talk about every since then this review would be longer than it already is. Tehe.\\n\\n\r\nSo i will talk about Miyamori, Aoi who is what i prefer to call the main main character of the anime since you see her mostly while the other \"mains\" are a little here and there depending on the parts of the anime. I honestly like Miyamoris character from the get go. She is hard working yet has a weird like personality. like talking toys and pretend they either talk to her or talk to each-other about different worries she has. She is a typical character you want to do well with what she does and you always want to see more of what she can do. She is purely interesting and there isnt really an annoying side about her. \\n\\n\r\nAs a general way of summarizing her friends or other mains would be to say. There is an aspiring voice actor who struggles with confidence but she is interesting in the way she handles it. There is a aspiring 3d graphic girl who struggles with what path she should take onwards in her job. Then there is a drawer whos confidence or lack there off is sweet yet you also want her to find out. The last is an aspiring writer who is at college but is interesting in the way that she is an all round support to the other 4 girls. \\n\r\nAs you see if i wrote one summary of sorts and how much i liked them all i would be writing wayy much and it wouldnt be that fun. \\n\\n\r\nAs i started watching this anime it just proved to me how much this is a must watch for anyone who loves anime and the production behind it. I liked everything from most of the characters to the story buildt around it and it never got too melodramatic or boring. I enjoyed this to a 10 and more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this deserve to be honored for the pure and clean work this anime is which is why i think eventhough i dont give it 10 in everything i still rate it as a 10. I think in its own it will be viewed as a classical anime for what it does. This anime didnt have to put romance and alot of drama to make it work. it just had to be itself from the start and continue onward. \\n\\n\r\nAs i have said previously. Watch this if you have an interest in anime in general and the production behind it but also because it overall is a great anime that i almost guarantee that you will feel after a time that you want to rewatch and just see this unique great anime yet again. There is a risk that it might sound slow for some which is something i should just say since i know it is that although i dont mind it personally.",

I am slightly less amenable to the five main characters who turn out like drunk hahaha maybe because they are girls. especially Sugie san and Goth Loli Sama you both are amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10\\n\r\nreally enjoy every episode of shirobako, maybe because this anime takes reference from real activities so the audience especially me can easily understand what to convey\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10\\n\r\nThank you so much Shirobako.",

            "content": "We all love anime. Otherwise we wouldn't be on this site. \r\nMany of us dreamt to work in the anime industry, to create things we ourselves are interested in. Or if not to work, many of us still wanted to at least understand it, wanted to know how things are done and if it really is as great as we imagine it to be. \r\nIt's no surprise, that Shirobako, the show that offers a glimpse into the production process of anime, created such resonance in the anime-loving community. And the way it tries to do that! Shirobako positions itself as an entertainment, a work ofart that could give you something else apart from the dry info about the technical process. \\n\\n\r\nThe key words here are 'positions itself'. But does it manage to authentically convey the details of the process of making anime while remaining entertaining at the same time? \\n\\n\r\nThe show definitely provides quite a bit of insight into the anime-making process. But let's be honest to ourselves: if we really wanted to know about how anime is made, we'd watch a documentary or google for some articles on the internet. The information can be found if you try hard enough, and if you didn't try, chances are that's not what will be the most important part of Shirobako for you, even if you think it is. \\n\\n\r\nWhat we really want in this kind of fiction is to root for characters, to worry if they'll manage to overcome the obstacles on the way to their goal.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Shirobako seem to understand this, but it doesn't go out of it's way to provide this. \\n\r\nAt least definitely not to the point of calling it 'Drama' as it's tagged here on MAL.\\n\r\nOf course it has quite a bit of emotionally powerful moments, but they are by no means Dramatic.\\n\r\nIt's much closer to Slice-of-Life if anything. \\n\\n\r\nAnd sometimes Shirobako is focusing too much on this slice of life, the everyday job of the staff, while having little else going on. The start in particular can be called slow.\\n\\n\r\nIt eventually starts to focus on important things: the characters, their motivations and determination, their views and methods to do things, their differences and their trials to overcome them, but those things are still provided in a very reserved way that some people won't be able to appreciate. For example, there's no life and death situations, sometimes even stakes don't seem to be high enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe further story goes, the higher tension gets, the more crises and obstacles characters face, the more development they undergo, and by the end you become familiar with almost everyone in Musashino Animation staff, they grow on you, you sympathize with them. But you need to get there first. Because of this the show might come off as \"Boring people doing boring job\" for some. Especially if you don't like Slice of Life stories.\\n\\n\r\nBut familiarizing yourself with characters takes time. If you ready to actually invest it, it will definitely become rewarding in the end. Because, once they develop enough, characters in Shirobako are great, and the Show tries really hard to give enough screen time to everyone (despite the fact that there are tons of them), and handle them as good as possible. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, as a bit of a personal commentary, I myself am not a fan of Slice of Life stories, and that was my major concern going into Shirobako, but in the end I really liked it. And I think if you like anime it is a good show for you to try and watch. Even if you won't like it in the end, it definitely is worth your time to try.\\n\\n",

            "content": "'Bakuman' became a cult hit by giving manga fans a look inside the industry. If the manga about manga can do well, why not an anime about anime? Much like 'Bakuman', 'Shirobako' delivers a high level of enjoyment and information, but threadbare plot and character development keep it from being anything beyond a fun ride.\r\n-Story-\r\nThere is very little story to speak of, as what plot exists is there solely to deliver lessons about the anime industry or occasionally set-up a debate over some facet of it (such as 2D vs CGI animation, or the politics behind choosing a voice cast). There are occasional side-trips tovisit the personal lives of 5 main girls, but these serve as little more than breathing spaces between information-heavy lessons on how anime is made. The 'slice-of-life' elements have no real drama or tension, as every problem is inevitably solved by hard work and patience (much like Bakuman, this series is an optimistic look at the industry). Like I said earlier, the plot exists as an excuse to look inside the anime industry- and as a look inside it's informative and entertaining, but it's hardly deep or moving.\\n\\n\r\n-Art & Sound-\\n\\n\r\nI have little to say on either of these segments, so I'll tackle them both at once. Production values are as high as they need to be, but nothing spectacular. The soundtrack is light and upbeat, the voice actors do their jobs, and the OPs and EDs are fine. Art is your pretty standard for a show centering on cutesy girls, but quality is solid. (side note, for a bit of a 'meta' moment, 'Shirobako' shows that CGI is most often used in anime today to handle complex moving machines like cars- and the most obvious use of CGI in the show are the cars).\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nQuick, tell me what the main 5 girls want to do besides make anime? Yes, they each have some quirk to distinguish themselves from each other, but that's hardly depth or internal conflict. They are plot devices and need to be treated as such. Since MAIN main character Aoi is a production assistant, it means that 'Shirobako' can seamlessly move between the various stages of anime production (if she were specialized and stuck in say, the sound department, the plot would get stale quickly- sound designers are rarely sent to draw key animation frames after all). Meanwhile, by giving Aoi a friend in each major area of anime production 'Shirobako' can get in-depth on a particular subject when it wants to. The side characters are one-trick ponies with little development as individuals. There are occasionally *tiny* changes and developments (Director Kinoshita is more self-confident and dependable and Taro is a bit less useless in the second arc, for example) but nothing that would exactly be confused for the Valhalla chapter of 'Vinland Saga'. The cast is so large, and individual development so minimal that each character is introduced with on-screen text giving their name and job title the first few times they appear just to help the viewer keep track. Like the plot, the characters serve as a vehicle to drive the audience from one look inside the anime industry to another- Misa's story arc about the life of a CGI designer  might have been INFORMATIVE and INTERESTING, but I was hardly kept awake at night pondering the depth and twists of her internal debate on whether or not to leave one CGI production company for another.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nThis series is highly enjoyable for anime fans who want to look inside the industry. If the lessons on anime production aren't entertaining however, I doubt you would find anything else to truly make this show a must-watch.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\\n\r\nIt's best to view 'Shirobako' as a fictional documentary about anime. I say 'fictional documentary' because while it follows a fictional cast of characters through fictional events, its main focus is teaching the viewer about the anime industry- not getting them deeply invested in the cast and their conflicts. For what it is 'Shirobako' IS enjoyable and educational, but it is at its core an entertaining lesson about anime production, if those anime lessons were removed there would be very little of value or interest left. Not bashing 'Shirobako' by any stretch, but while it is certainly a fun ride, it's just a fun ride.",

            "content": "Shirobako is a good choice for you if you want to have a look into the anime industry but without events and characters seeming like they progress in a natural or realistic fashion, but still giving you somewhat of a decent insight into the industry regardless.\r\nYou see, Shirobako does do a good job at putting on the line some of the goals and aspirations the characters want to do, even if it's half corny and generic safe responses and the other half is mostly what would feel natural for someone that has entered into the industry making a decision that fits their original goal presentedin a situation that makes sense. Well maybe it's more like, 60-40%. Well... maybe... erm...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, what it absolutely fails to do is present the situation of the working space in a believable way. You see there is this director who is, putting it mildly, the absolute worst thing in the world. He constantly procrastinates, he is usually indecisive and he had no sense of direction to the point that when he was asked what he wanted to do with his series, his answer was simply \"moe\". That was his answer for why he created the series and where he wanted to take it. I'm sure anyone, despite however rancid might think has gotten and maybe wanted to capitalize on the moe factor, if that was at all the case in this director's case, would have at the very least an idea on how to capitalize on moe and give a different answer. But, no, he said that because he was asked what were his original intentions with the series in order to get help from another writter, and that was his answer. And he's already known in the industry for his poor direction and what not, because he had failed on directing another original work called \"Jiggly Jiggly Heaven\" which is exactly what you're probably thinking. I won't represent him as antagonistically as I can, but trust me, he seems very unqualified all throughout the first cour.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I'm mentioning all this and I'm stopping here is because I want to ask you the following questions: \\n\\n\r\nWould you work under him? \\n\\n\r\nNow think a bit before you answer because these are the guarantees of your job: you will probably be forced to take a lot of retakes due to his indecisiveness and work under a very limited timespan due to how much he's delayed writing the storyboards due to him procrastinating, which would make the retakes that much more difficult. Also keep in mind that he has a terrible reputation and if you're there and he fails he probably is going to drag you down with him as well. Maybe you're asking yourself how would I have known which, okay, good point, then I'm gonna ask you the following question instead.\\n\\n\r\nWhat would you do when you found out he's this way?\\n\\n\r\nWould you continue working so the anime won't be a permanent stain on your resume and make it as great as possible, would you bail because as soon as you could before you would be able to have it as a permanent stain on you or would you have an outburst at the director and tell him to get his shit together? Or would you simply just quit as soon as the project is done? I mean, you would feel at every point like you're in a sinking ship, right? Or maybe if you wouldn't, someone else at least would?\\n\\n\r\nExcept that's not what happens. Most people continue working so the work won't leave a permanent impact on their reputation in the industry but there is absolutely nobody, except one guy who downright forces the director to work. There's nobody that expresses any sort of frustration at the chaos the director has caused at things that are completely his fault. They had opportunities to do so with a bunch of characters, but no, they instead chose this path with this character: \"Everyone struggles until the asshole finally fucking gets some inspiration and then everything ends fine and dandy.\" I can't imagine in a realistic situation where there wouldn't be at least one person lashing out or at the very least talking the director behind his back for being this pathetic at what he's doing, hell, I barely can imagine someone being this tolerant in a fictional scenario built in my mind. Instead people just take it and do their work and eventually the director stops fucking around. You could've given the director some motivation to correct his ways through consequences of his work force simply not accepting what he's doing by lashing out at him or quitting or anything. But, no, that would make too much sense. Lets instead have his actions have very little voiced consequences and everything ending up pretty much okay.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is the main problem with Shirobako, whenever there is a problem, everything ends up okay in the end, to the point where you get to the content of the second cour, where everything works even better in the project and the director isn't even a problem anymore, whenever a \"oh my god a setback\" happens there's no sense of urgency behind it and the tension from this type of situation is pretty much gone. There's no consequence to things going wrong other than, okay, lets work a little bit harder mkay? Okay. You're writing a story about an industry, there's always a risk for someone doing a bad job, but quitting and being fired are totally natural responses a person or a company could take in these situations. Failing a deadline or the work suffering a drop in quality are also possible consequences of incompetence or simply harsh conditions. As a result of this, none of the events happening in Shirobako have any dramatic value, despite trying to build them up and failing spectacularly at them. You know they will strive to make things in the series as optimistic as possible while creating tension with only one result, you feeling relieved it worked out.\\n\\n\r\nIt looked like all the characters were pulling punches in the hopes that things will work out and they will somehow manage, which made me feel very cynical about the whole experiences they've went through.\\n\\n\r\nThat was what mostly almost kinda made me drop the series a bunch of times but instead I continued watching the series because quite frankly, I enjoyed the parts where Shirobako presented the motivations and ambitions the characters had in the industry, or their loss of motivation and how they got over it. It does do a genuinely good job with that whenever they don't go on the safe route and offer some sort of insightful advice through a conclusion you could draw out from what the characters experience which is a good thing to see. Like what happens when you lose inspiration (no, I'm not talking about the director) or when you are stuck in a loop where you don't get any experience that would help you improve in the future. If the story focused more on this aspect of what it was trying to do while creating tension and focusing more on how to get over yourself and how you've achieved that and what consequences this could have not only on you but also on the team, I'm sure this could've been quite good, but it wasn't. I thought this aspect was enough for me to second guess calling this show bad, but I can't say it's fine for the lack of repercussions for every problem in the series that has appeared in it and making it seem quite unrealistic. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style of the show is generally good, given its a show about creating anime and animation plays a big part in it, most things are animated well. Everything looks well put together and you could technically see the process behind it too, which will probably help you have a better appreciation of it. The art style is a bit too cutsey for me but, I can say that it looked good regardless. The sound was generally fine too, although if I caught a glimpse of either the intro or ending I would immediately get turned off because I hate j-pop, and there are some downright cringy moments in the series that are meant to be heartwarming when the main character along with her friends go on and say this: \"DON DON DONUTS LETS GO NUTS!\". Ugh.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might or might have not guessed from what I've already said, the purpose of the characters is mostly to display one aspect of the industry or that area of expertise through either shared wisdom or experience or the difficulty said person might have in their area. The situations presented by them tend to be hit and miss but they usually are enjoyable enough for what they're trying to do and they tend to have some insight into them.\\n\\n\r\nIf you think you'd be frustrated by the lack of consequences the problems in the series, like the poor direction or the problems created by the staff itself, having little to no consequences to the overall quality on the series could be a hurdle for you, or the fact that the interpersonal relationships of the series being treated so casually is a really bad thing just like me, I can't recommend this series to you at all. But if you think some of the insight Shirobako might provide into the industry might be worth it, although I would suggest looking for some documentaries that might offer the same insight into the industry from real people talking about real experiences, you could have a look into it. As I've said, it does present some insightful situations and how people get over their own hurdles, which might be something you want. But I don't know if that would justify it as a good series for you, given it's possible you could get the same feedback from different sources. I managed to enjoy Shirobako enough to finish it and thought it was an okay enough experience, despite the hurdles, but I can see them being too much for other people as well.",

            "content": "One phrase that would perfectly describe Shirobako is simply ingenious. Surprisingly, the series has cleverly put together a lot of elements into one stand-out show. Aside from being an exposition of how anime series are made, it also tells us a cute and charming story all while boasting a splendid cast of characters and vibrant, dynamic designs.\r\nThe art in Shirobako is lovely. Although vibrant and dynamic, it is never flashy nor exaggerating. It is clean-cut and simple but more than enough to bring the story into fruition and to distinguish one character from the other. The sound is also kept simple, evoking the right feelingat the right moment. Shirobako couldn\u2019t ask for anything more fitting. The theme songs fit perfectly with the story too: inspiring yet also fun and relevant.  All in all, Shirobako exercised its liberty pretty well regarding its production.\\n\\n\r\nThe giant cast of characters actually does not pose a problem for character development and, in general, for the series. During their respective screen times (no matter how little they had), they are well flesh out. The realism they portray is an exceptionally rare feat. They are not archetypal and overblown. All of the characters, especially the five girls, possessed and displayed certain realistic qualities that break free from the confines of typical slice of life anime. The series was careful to not be intimidated by the size of the cast and to handle it with finesse.\\n\\n\r\nWe follow the lives of five girls as they struggle to live their dreams in the anime industry and an unlikely animation studio fighting against all odds to produce quality anime. It is a tale of of the creative process, professionalism, teamwork,  and finding one\u2019s motivation. It is amazing to point out that Shirobako\u2018s core story is incredibly simple yet satisfying. The side stories are also quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nBut what makes Shirobako stand out is how it is able to masterfully and effortlessly incorporate the core story, multiple side stories, and a brief but informative look into what goes down in the anime industry into one seamless and fluid narrative without ever losing focus. It is never overblown with the unnecessary. All these elements are treated with careful balance \u2013 something not all anime series have \u2013 that underlies the show\u2019s ingenuity.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako is an anime that is \u201cjust right\u201d. It breaks one\u2019s expectations without betraying them. You just have to enjoy it as it is as you learn countless things about life, careers, and, of course, anime. The series is a force to be reckoned with and I could easily recommend it to anyone, especially to those in need of a surprise.",

            "content": "Shirobako is a love letter to the anime industry. It doesn't glorify it or portray animators as hyper-talented geniuses, and many of the characters in the show admit they do not even understand why they're working in the industry. But there's something that keeps them passionate about what they do, even if it may not be the most respected form of media out there. \r\nShirobako is also a genuinely well-written and entertaining story in its own right. It's a highly informative and interesting look at what the process of creating anime is all about, but it is more than that, too. And it is alsocourageous for being an original series and for telling a story about adult characters rather than the typical high school fare that anime is seemingly incapable of escaping from. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are expecting tons of drama or deep, philosophical themes (in which case I'd argue you're in the wrong medium), Shirobako is not going to be for you. It is a story about the mundane, the everyday struggles of the workplace. Rushing to meet deadlines is often the most the characters have to deal with in any given episode. And there's something inherently appealing about that, I think. The closer something is to reality-- the more mundane it is, the more you can relate to and empathise with what's going on. Being able to empathise is perhaps the most important part of any story. \\n\\n\r\nShirobako does attempt to break away from otaku fantasy-land by making its world more resemble ours. There are obese characters, old characters, married characters and all sorts of other types that populate our world and yet are seemingly extinct in the vast majority of anime. There's definitely still a large 'moe' appeal for most of the female characters, but there is never a point where it becomes overbearing. Shirobako doesn't resort to panty-shots and beach episodes and other sorts of contrived nonsense in order to make the girls appealing. Their cuteness is more natural; it stems from their personality and their flaws rather than their body, even if Yano's stockings and Diesel-chan's side ponytail are perhaps the greatest things my eyes have ever witnessed. \\n\\n\r\nI do have to wonder why anime are so afraid of including female characters outside the high school age range, as if they are somehow incapable of being interesting or likeable once the clock strikes 18. The girls of Shirobako are in their 20's and yet they are far more appealing (and yes, more cute) than the vast majority of teenage characters. Maybe that could be my own oldness speaking, but I'd like to see more variety and more 20-somethings like there are in Shirobako. There's far more that can be done with adult characters. Shirobako understands that life exists outside of high school, and it isn't afraid of showing that life. \\n\\n\r\nBut only talking about the appeal of the characters would be a disservice, as there is far more that makes Shirobako an outstanding anime. Most people who watch the show are going to have their attention on its portrayal of the anime industry and the animator's lifestyle, which are shown with extensive detail in each and every episode. Even if you have no knowledge of how the anime industry works, by the time you finish Shirobako, you'll have a pretty OK idea of how it does. It does not just focus on the animators alone, but also the lower roles (such as the delivery dude/lady), all the way up to the very top management who decide the voice actors and how the anime should end. It does lend to a deeper appreciation for anime as a whole, as you'll realise that even the complete stinkers may have sucked because of a minor managerial mistake rather than incompetence. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot speak to how accurate these things are since I'm not an animator myself, but what I can tell is that the show is obviously idealised to some extent. It is, after all, meant to be a piece of entertainment rather than a documentary, so occasionally the characters will do things such as working at superhuman speeds or engage in the usual manzai routine for comedic effect. The story actually goes completely bonkers in the last couple episodes (with one of the characters actually deflecting bullets with the lard in their belly - YES REALLY), so it wouldn't be a good idea to expect Shirobako to be a perfectly accurate representation of reality. And then there's those talking stuffed animals that are never really explained. Magic, or something? \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that Shirobako is an anime-original series and not an adaptation of some other manga or light novel makes it an inherently positive presence in anime, I think. P.A. Works not only made a great anime, but something that is strictly 'anime' and not a property of some other medium. Personally, I am getting pretty bored of anime's role as the 'adaptation medium'. The industry would benefit from more titles like Shirobako, even if that means studios taking a bit of a financial risk. \\n\\n\r\nShirobako can be a bit misleading, though. The first episode creates the impression that the entire story is going to be about the five high school friends working together in the anime industry, but that isn't really how things pan out. It is a story about the events of Musashino Animation. Only two of the five girls work there as regular employees for the majority of the series, with my goddess Diesel joining in the latter half and the remaining two pitching in at the very last moment. Some people may find this a bit disappointing, but I thought it was the proper route for the story. Adult life rarely ever works out exactly as planned, and Shirobako is very much an anime about adult life. \\n\\n\r\nIt would be pretty ironic if an anime about animation had poor animation, so it's fortunate that Shirobako looks and sounds as nice as it does. There is none of the usual 'sameface' phenomenon that plagues most anime with a moe art style (which Shirobako most definitely has), and the backgrounds are often filled with detail (like an anime figure sitting on a desk to the side) which makes having a wandering eye recommended. It's a bright and visually pleasant show, while the music, even if it's not particularly notable, creates an appropriate atmosphere. There are no melodramatic 'PLEASE CRY NOW' piano pieces, and for that I am thankful. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of preferences and standards, I think Shirobako is more than capable of being one of the most enjoyable experiences anyone has with anime for a very long time-- especially so if you have any sort of passion for the anime industry. It's well-written and free of any noteworthy flaws, sure, but it's also informative and unique for a medium that has been plagued by sameness for decades. Why there haven't been anime like Shirobako until this day remains a mystery to me, but it has made me regain some hope for the anime industry-- it's still capable of creating great things, it seems.",

            "content": "~Multilingual review, English & Espa\u00f1ol: SHIROBAKO~\r\nHey... did you know?, in the Animation Industry an anime episode which is distributed to the production staff members prior to its official release is called \"shirobako\", litteraly \"white box\", that's because at time VHS tapes containing the episode were enclosed in white boxes and distributed, despite the fact that white enclosures are no longer used, the term still remains in use in the actual anime industry, thus the anime's title comes from that little particular, SHIROBAKO.  \r\nSimple but at the same time meaningful, a word which I was totally unaware of its background story, to tell the truthactually even if I've been watching anime for years, I'm completely ignorant when it comes to it's realization and process which follow a simple draw sketch, hand made, into becoming incredible pieces of animation rich of music, effects and sounds. This is the first time I came across with an anime that handles a theme with such professionalism and realism imitating with, almost, absolute perfection the production of an animated series in the real world, exaggerating and overreacting a bit with the details, with the final purpose of avoiding to bore the audience, and such effect results in an ironic comedy sticked that enough to the realism in order to don't lose it's seriousness, SHIROBAKO totally succeeded in recreating a working field with extreme quality.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize this series with just \"an anime about making anime\" doesn't describe it at all, actually I think it's a devaluation because in that way we're leaving behind the most important theme touched in it, and which is in my opinion, the reason it made shine this show: 'keep working to realize your dreams'. Unfortunately sometimes there are times that working hard doesn't guarantee the results we expect, and thus it feels like the sky fell upon us, like getting hit by a bullet train, extremely painful, sometimes it damages us more than any physical injuries might harm, there it is... the disappointment after failing.\\n\\n\r\n\"Not everyone who works hard is rewarded, however all those who succeed have worked hard!\"\\n\\n\r\nI need to say that the hard work is really shown through the show, our protagonists aren't passive girls, they've a dream and in order to achieve it they struggle and confront themselves with real life in their respective field of interest, trying to overcome doubts and obstacles, normal things for someone who is initially starting to find a place to fit in this society, after all, the approach to real life feels so genuine that we can easily relate to. Specially the ones who hasn't find a place in this world but keep working hard to find it, we'll be touched directly by the themes developed through this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the realization of an amateur animated short back in High School, Miyamori Aoi, Yasuhara Ema, Imai Midori, Todo Misa and Sakaki Shizuka, the Animation Club's members, promised all together to realize a professional animation work one day. As the years pass, in the present day, Miyamori is a 'Production Assistant' for Musashino Animation, Ema works as 'Key Animator' in the same studio, Misa decided to go for the computer graphics, Midori is still studying in the University but her goal is to write scripts and Shizuka works part-time meanwhile she tries to emerge as a voice actress. SHIROBAKO is the story about these five young women and the Musashino Animation, behind the scenes, 'what we don't see', of the Animation Industry.\\n\\n\r\nThrough the show's development the viewers experience almost each of the productions phases that make up the realization of a TV series, starting from the basic things such as obtaining the rights from the author, to later pass to the productive phases: Script, Storyboard, Character Design, Art Direction, Coloration, Computer Graphics, Sound Direction, Voice Acting selection, Editing and Assembly, and finally the end product delivery to the TV station. Everything obviously presented under the POW of the various characters that make part of this cycle of work, which going through the difficulties they might across, allow us to gain a vision, really close to the reality, of what means to realize a task in this working field, the meeting point, between all the different phases, is represented by Miyamori, our protagonist, which serving as 'Production Assistant' is in charge of coordinating all the works as well as being the bridge for each production's department.\\n\\n\r\nThe particular attention on details in this anime is really noteworthy, to allow a better comprehension of each production aspect, Musashino Animation was in charge to realize two anime series (an anime inside an anime!). The script was discussed, what message and which emotions should reach the viewers, redefine the characters in case the result isn't the wanted one, War fell upon the studios when it was confronted a 2D animation sequence to a 3D one and was asked which one was better, meanwhile in another department, voice actors selection was being held, another battleground...\\n\\n\r\nHowever SHIROBAKO isn't only a documental-anime, since great quality was shown in the characterization of each character presented, casting away any kind of stereotype, going directly through the realism route, a result which ended giving the show a really pleasant atmosphere. The cast was really huge, even so, each one of them had an opportunity to shine in their respective working field, each character had their own identity and goal in life, which through the series, lead them to a route of personal grow and professional development, with a special regard for, obviously, our protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nThe complete absence of Fanservice, and the typical cliche scenarios that could expose the girls sex appeal as well as the fanservice yuri undertones, characteristic features for anime with a female-only cast, was something that allowed the anime to have a certain level of professionalism, specially considering the interactions between the characters, it was something I really appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Designs were labeled by P.A. Works, it's almost like a seal of guarantee, this studio has the fame of creating one of the best visuals available in the current market, and again, it delivered, characters' range of expressivity was superb, between the bests I've seen. The Sound wasn't completely appreciated, in part because of the anime's frenetic pace, an another because of the heavy dialogues and explanations, in few words the attention was driven off from them, something that I couldn't say it's a bad thing since the OST suited perfectly the scenes, it's just, they didn't were outstanding besides being a bit forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nSHIROBAKO represents an act of Love towards the Anime Industry itself, paying a tribute to all the people who works in this difficult field, and in the same time, showing a side completely unknown to most of us, presenting an original format of entertainment whose protagonists are the people who made all this possible.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Espa\u00f1ol]\\n\\n\r\nOye... \u00bflo sab\u00edas?, en la Industria de la Animaci\u00f3n cuando un episodio de anime es distribuido al equipo de producci\u00f3n, antes de su efectiva emisi\u00f3n, se le llama \"shirobako\", literalmente \"caja blanca\". En la \u00e9poca de oro, las video casetas que llevaban el episodio eran distribuidas adentro de cajas blancas, aunque si ya no se suelen usar m\u00e1s, este t\u00e9rmino se sigue utilizando actualmente en la industria, as\u00ed que el t\u00edtulo de este anime deriva da esa peque\u00f1a particularidad, SHIROBAKO.\\n\\n\r\nDe simple origen, pero llena de significado, se trata de una palabra que desconoc\u00eda completamente. Siendo sincero, aunque si mi experiencia con el anime est\u00e1 llegando a la d\u00e9cada, soy completamente ignorante cuando se trata de la realizaci\u00f3n y procesos que permiten a un simple dibujo, hecho a mano, convertirse en piezas incre\u00edbles de animaci\u00f3n, llenas de m\u00fasica, efectos y sonidos. Esta es la primera vez que me cruzo con un anime que trata de manera profesional y realista el verdadero trabajo que hay detr\u00e1s de las series animadas, su producci\u00f3n y creaci\u00f3n, paso a paso, exagerando un poco de las situaciones de cada d\u00eda en modo de crear una comicidad ir\u00f3nica, aunque siempre apegada a la realidad, aquel tanto que basta para no dejar de ser tomada en serio. \u00bfEl resultado? SHIROBAKO logra recrear un sector de trabajo de manera fresca y divertida de ver, despu\u00e9s de todo, \u00a1tampoco es que cada profesi\u00f3n sea apta para divertir a un p\u00fablico!.\\n\\n\r\nDefinir esta serie s\u00f3lo como \"un anime acerca de hacer anime\" no la describe en su totalidad, de hecho la deval\u00faa, porque deja de lado el aspecto m\u00e1s importante, y que en mi opini\u00f3n, es lo que hace verdaderamente brillar esta serie: trabajar para alcanzar tus sue\u00f1os. Desafortunadamente hay veces que el trabajo duro no es suficiente y no asegura el resultado que se espera. Es ah\u00ed que se siente como si el cielo se nos cayera encima, el mismo efecto que ser\u00eda ser atropellado por un tren, con la diferencia que es indoloro, pero a\u00fan as\u00ed nos procura un dolor mucho mayor que cualquier da\u00f1o f\u00edsico, ah\u00ed esta... la decepci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de fallar.\\n\\n\r\n\"Trabajar duro no asegura el \u00e9xito, pero puedo asegurarte que todas las personas exitosas han trabajado duro\"\\n\\n\r\nEl esfuerzo y la pasi\u00f3n por alcanzar tus sue\u00f1os est\u00e1n a la base de este anime, nuestras protagonistas no son para nada pasivas, tienen un sue\u00f1o y hacen de todo para alcanzarlo, confrontandose con la vida real en sus respectivos campos de inter\u00e9s, y en sus caminos se encontrar\u00e1n con obst\u00e1culos y dudas, cosas normales para alguien que apenas esta comenzando a encontrar su puesto al interno de esta sociedad, despu\u00e9s de todo, el aproche con la vida real se siente tan genuino que es muy f\u00e1cil poder relacionarse. Sobre todo nosotros los m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes, los que todav\u00eda no hemos encontrado nuestro lugar en el mundo pero estamos trabajando duramente para ello, nos sentiremos tocados directamente y especialmente por las tem\u00e1ticas afrontadas a lo largo de la serie.\\n\\n\r\nDespu\u00e9s de haber realizado un peque\u00f1o corto amatorial de animaci\u00f3n para proyectar en la escuela, Miyamori Aoi, Yasuhara Ema, Imai Midori, Todo Misa y Sakaki Shizuka, los cinco miembros que formaban el Club de Animaci\u00f3n al tiempo del liceo, se prometen un d\u00eda hacer un verdadero trabajo de animaci\u00f3n profesional todas juntas. Los a\u00f1os pasan, Miyamori se encuentra actualmente trabajando como 'Asistente de Producci\u00f3n' para la Musashino Animation, Ema trabaja como 'Dise\u00f1ador' en el mismo estudio, Misa se fue por el ramo de la animaci\u00f3n a computadora y trabaja para una empresa, Midori estudia en la Universidad pero su ambici\u00f3n es llegar a escribir guiones y Shizuka trabaja part-time mientras trata de entrar en el dif\u00edcil mundo del Doblaje. SHIROBAKO es la historia de estas cinco chicas y de todos los miembros de Musashino Animation, detr\u00e1s de las cortinas, lo que no se ve, en el mundo de la animaci\u00f3n.\\n\\n\r\nA lo largo de la serie la audiencia est\u00e1 presente en casi todas las fases de producci\u00f3n que componen la realizaci\u00f3n de una serie televisiva, partiendo de lo m\u00e1s b\u00e1sico como obtener los derechos del autor para despu\u00e9s pasar a las fases productivas las cuales son: Gui\u00f3n, Storyboard, Dise\u00f1o de los Personajes, distribuci\u00f3n de los keyframe entre los dise\u00f1adores, Direcci\u00f3n Art\u00edstica, paisajes y fondos, Coloraci\u00f3n, Computer Graphics, Direcci\u00f3n Musical, creaci\u00f3n de sonidos, selecci\u00f3n de dobladores, montaje conclusivo hasta llegar finalmente a la entrega del producto final a las estaciones televisivas. Todo obviamente presentado bajo el punto de vista de los varios personajes que hacen parte del ciclo de trabajo, que pasando por las dificultades que se pueden presentar, nos permiten obtener una visi\u00f3n completamente apegada a la realidad de lo que es realizar un determinado trabajo al interno de este ambiente, el punto de conexi\u00f3n, entre todas las diferentes fases es representado da Miyamori Aoi, nuestra protagonista, la cual sirviendo de Asistente de Producci\u00f3n, esta encargada de coordinar todos los aspectos adem\u00e1s de hacer de puente entre los repartos de producci\u00f3n.\\n\\n\r\nLa particular atenci\u00f3n puesta en los detalles es este anime es para premiar, para permitir la plena compresi\u00f3n de todos los aspectos productivos, durante la serie se realizaron la composici\u00f3n de dos series animadas (\u00a1un anime dentro del anime!). Se discuti\u00f3 el gui\u00f3n, que mensaje tenia llegar al espectador y cuales emociones deber\u00edan transmitirse, redefinir los personajes cuando no se obtiene el efecto deseado, se confront\u00f3 una misma escena hecha en animaci\u00f3n tradicional con una en CGI, dando vida a una pelea interna sobre cual es mejor, mientras que en otro reparto se escog\u00edan los dobladores, otro campo de batalla...\\n\\n\r\nPero SHIROBAKO no es s\u00f3lo un anime-documental, en cuanto grande calidad se demostr\u00f3 en la caracterizaci\u00f3n de cada personaje presentado, dejando de lado cualquier estereotipo t\u00edpico, puntando directamente al real\u00edsimo, un resultado que sinceramente se aprecia mucho m\u00e1s. El Cast se compone de un gran n\u00famero de personajes, a\u00fan as\u00ed, cada uno de ellos tuvo la oportunidad de brillar en su respectivo campo de trabajo, cada personaje tiene su propia identidad y objetivo en la vida, que a lo largo de la serie lo conducir\u00e1 en una v\u00eda de maduraci\u00f3n y desarrollo profesional, con un enfoque especial, obviamente, hacia nuestras 5 chicas.\\n\\n\r\nLa completa ausencia de cualquier forma de fanservice y de las t\u00edpicas situaciones clich\u00e9 que enfocan el sex appeal de los personajes, al igual que los t\u00edpicos tonos fanservice 'yuriescos' que caracterizan la mayor parte de las series que presentan un cast prevalentemente femenino, fue algo que permiti\u00f3 a la serie ser tomada m\u00e1s en serio, presentando un cierto grado de profesionalidad en las interacciones entre los personajes, algo que aprecie bastante.\\n\\n\r\nLa Animaci\u00f3n & Dise\u00f1os fueron firmadas por P.A. Works, y de verdad se not\u00f3, este estudio tiene la reputaci\u00f3n de hacer una de la mejores visuales que hay actualmente en el mercado, y otra vez, cumpli\u00f3 perfectamente, la expresividad que llegan a tener los personajes es de verdad notable, de las mejores que he visto. El Sonido no se pudo apreciar completamente, en parte debido al ritmo fren\u00e9tico que se llegaba a tener en algunos momentos, y en otras debido al di\u00e1logo pesado, en pr\u00e1ctica la atenci\u00f3n fue completamente desviada, algo que no es necesariamente malo, las OST acompa\u00f1an perfectamente las escenas, s\u00f3lo que, no se hicieron notar mucho adem\u00e1s de ser, un poco, olvidables.\\n\\n\r\nSHIROBAKO representa un acto de Amor hacia la industria del anime en s\u00ed misma, homenajeando a las personas que hacen parte de ella, y al mismo tiempo mostrando un lado que era completamente desconocido a la mayor\u00eda, presentando un formato original y dando protagonismo finalmente ad aquellas personas que hacen que todo esto sea posible.",

            "content": "Out of curiosity, I've been thinking a lot about how anime are made, but it is fairly hard to get insights into the practices of this particular industry. And then, Shirobako came around.\r\nAn anime about the creation process of an anime - or some kind of meta-animation or animeception - that is not only a daring approach to new age infotainment, but also an excellent opportunity for the creators to put in their passion associated with this kind of work, and to tell a realistic tale on the hardships that newbies in this industry are likely to encounter.\r\nShirobako managed to rank very high in mylist due to the fact that it is done with an astonishing amount of perfection, especially in terms of storytelling. This show is not about documentation, it actually has a decent, even exciting story in which the factual elements of anime-making are embedded. The first anime I was reminded of was Bakuman, doing practically the same with manga but on a more entertaining and less informative level. Shirobako, on the other hand, provides for an almost perfect balance between entertainment and information. A bunch of girls decide to follow their dreams to become a part of the anime industry, which is an excellent premise for the fact that the transition between school/university and work life is described in particular. It is especially this transition with its associated culture shock that is hard to outline on an emotional level. In actuality, it is not unusual to get rejected by companies although you were educated well, and just like that, dreams get shattered. The pressure that is inherent to these situations is portrayed by Shirobako in a marvelous manner.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako minds details. This becomes apparent even in the way the anime-making process is illustrated with all its facets, from storyboard creation over key/3D animation to post-processing and voice acting. In addition, as the heroine serves as production assistant, various aspects of management and leadership are also subject of interest. This all leads to a very realistic picture of what (harsh) business and work life is about in general. As someone who doesn't know anything or very little about the creation of anime, you will feel enriched by the level of detail that comes with the explanations, although this might lead to a noticeable issue as well. I found myself overloaded with information during the first episodes, which led to the assumption of mine that Shirobako will turn out a mediocre show. This relativised mostly after I had gotten used to the setting and the pace. Shirobako would have done well choosing a more progressive approach than a linear one regarding the amount of information conveyed. This, however, is criticism on a very high level.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, Shirobako is one of the few anime that does very well with the side cast, which convinces especially through personality variety. The female main characters are very similar to each other: the typical inexperienced and naive yet dreamful and highly motivated graduates entering the job market. Although this made it easy for Shirobako to refrain from elements to enhance character depth, I don't consider this a problem for it being a necessary mean to equally approach the various parts of the anime industry from the same viewpoint at the same time. This also helps the viewer to relate to the characters in general and to reduce the already high degree of complexity. The side characters, on the other hand, apart from those that serve the comedic aspect, are well conceptualized to act realistically and provide a credible personality. This shows that the producers of Shirobako approached the entire thing holistically and honestly, which implies a great deal of passion that must have been put into it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fits the show well and the OP/ED songs underline the basically happy and energetic atmosphere of the anime. Same can be said for the seiyuu. Where Shirobako really stands out is the level of detail that is presented in the images, for example in the backgrounds of the production companies' office that represents the main setting. I am honestly very impressed by how the arts support the realistic feeling that was intended to come about with Shirobako. This is what I, at least, expect from a masterpiece. Another big plus comes with the various versions of the second ending animation, similar to what Angel Beats! did, which adds to the perceived amount of effort that was exerted towards Shirobako becoming a remarkable anime.\\n\\n\r\nI raise my hat to Shirobako. If you want to learn something about how anime are made, or if you like shoujo/josei series and mostly realistic work-related anime, I implore you to give this show a chance. I assume that Shirobako appeals to a broad audience, however, be aware of the fact that you might get bombarded with information early on, which might dampen your enjoyment in early stages of the anime. I can suggest, keep it up, it's worth it.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 9.03/10\\n\r\n(A quantified evaluation can be found on my page.)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Yeah, I know Shirobako is going to go on for another cour. I saw the advertisement that promised to introduce more characters and more problems. Still, there's a reason this show isn't popular on Nano and it doesn't help that nobody wants to read the words of a man who hates their surprise-darling show of the year each week. As such, this will be the last I'm going to write about it, because after watching twelve episodes, I have to accept the fact that Shirobako (and PA Works stuff in general) is never going to appeal to me and move on to hating Ikuhara's newthing or something. But before we part ways, I want to finalize some thoughts regarding why I'm not into this thing.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, I didn't expect this show to explode in popularity (relatively-speaking) the way it did. But I sort of get why Shirobako appeals to the blogosphere. It has adult characters, which is considered rare in anime. It has snappy direction by the guy who made Girls Und Panzer, another critical darling that I don't really care about. It's about anime, and considering we're anime fans, that appeals to a lot of us. And considering that a lot of us have jobs or are struggling to get jobs, it's nice to see an anime that reflect that part of our lives.\\n\\n\r\nBut here's the thing, I'm not like most anime fans. Because you see, I \"do\" try to interpret things for basic enjoyment. I \"do\" want my fiction to not spoon-feed me what's going on. Even though I am capable of liking summer blockbusters and laugh-out-loud comedies, what separates the good ones from the bad ones tends to be elements that tickle the mind. And when my mind isn't tickled, it tends to shut off completely.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, there are limits to that sort of thinking. I like Mamoru Oshii fine as a director, but he can be obtuse to the point of being impenetrable (Angel's Egg, Sky Crawlers). Still, I don't like Roland Emmerich's blockbuster trash and there's a reason why Ingmar Bergman is one of my favorite foreign directors. Now I'm not saying Shirobako has to be at the quality of a Bergman film. That's too much to ask. But for all you fans of the show, answer me this: what exactly is in this anime for thinkers like me? Because being educated on anime production doesn't really leave much to the imagination.\\n\\n\r\n\"What about how anime production affects the employers who make it? After all, that's what you enjoyed about that one Paranoia Agent episode, isn't it, Mr. Flawfinder?\" It sure is, but here's the thing: the employee died at the end of that episode as a consequence of his production fuck-ups. Shirobako's biggest problem is that it never goes beyond threatening the characters' work positions. That's not an inherently bad thing, but that's only intriguing depending on how the employees deal with said threat, and I'm not seeing anyone rob a bank in desperation. I'm not seeing anyone contemplate suicide. I'm not even seeing anyone make any kind of sacrifice to keep their job. I see people spouting textbook lines and...that's pretty much it. This isn't mind-racing. This isn't even a plot. This is just fanservice without purpose, and I don't do fanservice without purpose.\\n\\n\r\n\"But wait, Mr. Flawfinder! Considering who's directing the show, surely you must be laughing at some of the jokes...\" Okay, I'm going to have to stop you guys right there. Aside from You're Being Summoned Azazel-san, Mizushima hasn't directed anything I've really enjoyed, and the reason the former appealed to me so much - or at least the first season did - is because it was mean. It subverted my expectations in clever ways. It was borderline offensive. None of his other works do that, and Shirobako in particular isn't even close to being mean. In fact, most of the humor comes from in-joking, and I hate that sort of stuff when it's the crux of your humor. Hell, I found it (along with the lack of intriguing plot and character) painful in those Expendables films, and those movies are supposed to appeal to action fans like myself. And if I can't like an action movie that's pure purposeless fanservice, how do you expect me to like a slice-of-life anime that does the same thing?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't appealing to me because without good comedy and a good representation of anything I can sink my teeth into, there's nothing else they've got going for them other than their character designs and the fact that some of them are parodies of real-life anime staff (and we all know I don't care about those). There's no actual plot that goes beyond the characters living their lives. It's not even doing anything all that bad. It's just \"there\", and what am I supposed to say about something that's just \"there\"? Psycho-Pass 2? Whether you hated it or not, at least it was upping the ante regard its crazy failures each week. Amagi Brilliant Park? That's a highly-exaggerated comedic take on what Shirobako does, and yet I've written about every single episode despite only finding it decent at best because at least each episode succeeded or failed in a way that was fresh. Your Lie In April? It's one of the worst dramas I've seen in a while, but at least it's coming up with new ways to be tastelessly boring as it goes along - albeit not every week - and it's overall failures are fun to discuss.\\n\\n\r\nSo if nothing is appealing to me in a good way, nothing is appealing to me in a bad way, there are no hints to indicate that this will change with the show's second half, and it's not even giving me good views, what else is there? Appealing to me in an average way? Yeah, that's not my style, guys. Wake me up when PA Works makes an anime out of Jun Maeda's new thing. At least that has a good chance of boring me in a way that's fun to talk about.",

            "content": "I think it's common knowledge that two of the most important things in the world are doughnuts and anime. But when you combine those two things with well-written comedy, a plethora of memorable characters, and a realistic and interesting story, you receive something so great that it literally revives an entire genre of animation that has been becoming less and less creative as years go by. This mixture can be referred to as Shirobako, which can also go by the name of Watch This Show Because It Is Probably The Best Thing Ever. I'm not kidding. There's so much packed within the confines of thisslice-of-work/comedy/drama that literally anyone can take something out of it. Whether it be laughs, anime industry know-how, or even tears later on, we can all benefit from Shirobako in some way or another.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the lives of five girls and their respective ventures into the anime industry (But focusing mainly on one girl -- Aoi Miyamori), Shirobako gives us a glance into the many different aspects that go into creating anime. Miyamori, being unsure of exactly WHAT she wants to do as far as making anime goes, falls into the position of a production-assistant tasked with essentially making sure things get done on time. But apart from being a peek into the life of a production-assistant, Shirobako is a tale of realizing your dreams and figuring out your place in not only the workplace, but the world as a whole. Of course there are obstacles along the way, there always are, but Shirobako shows how different people in different positions cope with those obstacles. This culminates in a story that is not only a blast to watch, but actually provides various life lessons and a bunch of general knowledge along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThis show originally caught my eye because I've always wanted to bust my way into the anime industry. And just like Miyamori, I've always been unsure of exactly WHERE in that industry I want to be. It wasn't until just a few years ago when I finally realized where that was. But, achieving that goal isn't even remotely easy. And Miyamori, as well as the other girls in Shirobako, show you just that. Working in anime isn't all fun and games; it is a job. And like any job out there, it requires hard work, determination, and a clear view of what you should do next and when you should do it. But that's enough rambling on the hardships of anime-craft. It's time to dive into the depths of Shirobako and figure out why it is just so damn great.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nThe OST for Shirobako is underrated. The music easily fits the tone of the show at all times. It's happy when it needs to be happy, it's sorrowful when things aren't going right, and it's well-produced and well-written. Even though it features over an hour of original music, the soundtrack to Shirobako is often overlooked due to the fast-paced dialogue and never ending onslaught of jokes the show shoots out at you. But one aspect of the soundtrack you simply can't overlook would be the opening and ending themes. I'm not usually one to be overjoyed by catchy songs spilling out happiness all over the floor, but Shirobako's opening just forces me to smile every time I hear it. PLUS, the actual voice cast of the show are the ones that are singing these songs. AND THEN Miyamori shows up smiling and holding a doughnut as the opening plays and you literally have to look away from the screen to avoid exploding due to cutesy-happiness overload. Bravo girls, bravo.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nShirobako has perhaps the most extensive cast of characters I have seen since Mahou Sensei Negima! But they need those characters considering they have an entire damn animation studio and you can't run that with just the five main girls. But the cast here is not only extremely varied, it is extremely realistic and extremely lovable. This show absolutely nails every type of person you will ever work with. There's the spontaneous and overly-confident dude, the quiet and knowledgeable girl always willing to lend you a hand, and then the fat guy. Who can forget about the fat guy? It's not just the characters themselves that are great either. The way they interact with and even intertwine with one another is what makes those relationships so believable and so important. After all, this is a studio we are talking about. There will obviously be problems within the workplace, but these characters are smart enough to know that they need to work together in order to accomplish a set goal. Oh, and not to mention that each one of these characters has their own unique dream constantly pushing them forward. I'm going to stop here so that this section of the review doesn't take up half of your web-browser, but I just want you to know that you will never find another cast of characters this realistic anywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nShirobako looks about as pretty as an anime of this genre can get. The art-style is consistent every episode and each character is drawn with intense care and precision. The color-scheme is bright and joyous, but not overdone to the point where it doesn't seem real anymore. Character-design is fantastic and each character isn't solely equipped with just one outfit (A problem a lot of anime faces nowadays). The art is subtly reminding you that these characters are basically real people. Real people change clothes sometimes. That's just how things work. Another aspect of this show that kind of just blends in with how great everything is and winds up being overlooked would be the facial expressions of these characters. While watching this, keep a close eye on the faces. Shirobako doesn't go through the typical cycle of excited face, sad face, and embarrassed face. Every emotion the characters must portray is intricately woven to a point where that face can only fit one situation. It is these different levels of human emotion that are put together so perfectly that really make the art in Shirobako as great as it is, and only overdone when needed to elevate a joke to the next level.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nAs I said before, Shirobako is a glimpse into the inner-workings of the anime industry that can be inspected by those who either appreciate or want to delve into it. It works the same way movies about movies work. Obviously the viewer will be interested in how movies work if they are watching a movie -- the same goes with anime. How often is a show founded entirely upon reminding you that it is a show? Answer: Not often. But it isn't just this that makes the story of Shirobako one to remember. What makes the story memorable is how the dreams inside of it play out. In the real world, things aren't always going to work out the way you want them to. Some times, the outcome or a scenario will be laden with sadness instead of a resolution. When that gets taken into account, the show isn't necessarily all that happy anymore. Shirobako becomes less about comedy and more about a girl struggling to realize her dreams. It is that double-meaning that creates an atmosphere where you get to have a great time while still caring about each and every thing that happens.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe Shirobako isn't the most perfectly-woven anime ever created. But this is a review. And I just want to remind you that when reviewing something, there is a category that a lot of critics either miss or just forget about. That category is \"Enjoyment\". It's hard for me to say if I have ever enjoyed a show as much as I enjoyed Shirobako. In looking back on it, I can't ever recall a moment where I didn't care -- a moment where I got bored. The fact is that I was so constantly looking forward to seeing what happens next that Shirobako created an experience for me where the characters felt more like people I cared about rather than an animated cast just moving along my flat-screen television. I would find it hard to believe that anyone else who followed the show to completion didn't feel the same way.",

            "content": "Every so often an anime comes around that, while certainly not perfect, fully deserves a 10/10 rating. There are anime which get their 10/10 rating by being masterful works which envelope your senses and bring you on an exciting journey - but then there are also anime which change your perception, and change the way you think about certain things, which make them equally deserving. Shirobako is the latter. When initially hearing about and watching the first few episodes of Shirobako I certainly expected to find it interesting and insightful, I never would have thought that it would change my perception on anime, and ultimatelyhelp me appreciate the entire medium in a whole new way.\\n\r\nSo, all that being said, I'll do my review the usual way, but when I get to the \"enjoyment\" section I'll explain my above section~ Let me break it down:\\n\\n\r\n~STORY~\\n\r\nShirobako, in short, is an anime all about making anime. Starting with a short scene with five girls in their high school animation club declaring to pursue their dreams to make anime together, we then follow Aoi Miyamori, Musashi Animation studio and the other four girls in the club as they work in the anime industry. The show is split into two distinct halves: 1-12 is about the creation of an original anime series, and 13-24 is about adapting a popular manga into an anime series. We then see the various struggles associated with creating anime, going across all of the various people and stages involved in anime - and seeing how the studio overcomes them. I thought it was a really great idea splitting the series this way, since both an original series and adaptation have their own difficulties during creation.\\n\r\nAside from the creation of these two series, across both arcs we see how the five girls from the animation club develop and determine how they wish to spend their futures in the anime industry, or whether they want to be in the anime industry at all. This shows a good perspective of how to initially become involved with the anime industry. Shizuka Sakaki's journey as she tries to become a voice actress was one of my overall favourites.\\n\r\nOverall, what the story does is greatly humanise the anime-creation process. Which is wonderful, and what I'll certainly get into more detail later.\\n\\n\r\n~ART~\\n\r\nI'm going to have to break down the art into two sections: Firstly, just the normal scene-to-scene animation; and secondly, the big set-piece moments and the animation of the anime they're animating (It'll make sense in a bit).\\n\r\nFirst off, overall the show looks pretty average. The character designs are quite standard (which is understandable, these are supposed to be relatively 'normal' people), and the backgrounds aren't particularly imaginative (90% of the show is set in the various locations that anime is made, so mainly at desks, in offices). The colours don't particularly stand out as anything special. Honestly, it doesn't do much above what would be considered standard for anime today.\\n\r\nHOWEVER, this is an anime about making anime - so they also animate the anime that they're making. And I don't just mean complete scenes, I'm talking about the line drawings, the storyboards, without the backgrounds, etc. I love it. It may be easier to animate, but seeing behind the curtain at how anime looks at each stage of production was fantastic, and it looked genuine (which it probably was). Then there are the big set pieces, every now and again there are these moments where the show really shines - where this big sweeping scenes take place. I won't spoil them, but I would be lying if I didn't say I wasn't occasionally moved to tears when watching them.\\n\r\nBut speaking of tears, just one final thing to add - while sometimes expressions were exaggerated, I have to say that it all felt so human. There are a couple of crying scenes that, while slightly exaggerated, just felt so real (and once or twice I cried along with them)! For an anime that humanises the anime-creation process, the art had a big part to play in making that humanisation succeed.\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~\\n\r\nThe sound is mixed. Half the time it's just pretty standard slice-of-life soundtrack, nothing worth focusing. BUT THE OTHER HALF, oh yes, this is what's important. Shirobako helps illustrate the importance of sound in various scenes (when they're making anime), like when the sound is supposed to come in, what type of music is appropriate for which scene, etc. So, to not be hypocrites, in various important scenes Shirobako nails it. The final two episodes especially are fantastic demonstrations of how music can add to the weight of a scene, and really the majority of those final two episodes showcase the best the soundtrack has to offer (not to say that the rest of the anime's music is shoddy in comparison, but the final two episodes stick out in my memory). Aside from that, Shirobako also knows how to use silence to their advantage, able to add tension to a scene when appropriate.\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTER~\\n\r\n(Man this is definitely my longest review!) To keep it short, while the five girls from the animation club are the main five of the series - each and every supporting character in Shirobako plays an important role, fleshing out and humanising the anime. You can tell that the staff behind Shirobako clearly were drawing from the people they have worked with in order to make these characters. Whether it be from the inexperienced but passionate go-getters, the slightly jaded and experienced  cynics, those who talk big but ultimately fail to deliver (Tarou anybody?), and those who wish to simply better themselves at their craft. Shirobako's very extensive character list covers it. And you know what else? While, due to simply the enormous cast that the anime offers, I think the anime succeeds in fleshing out the majority of them to an extent which helps you connect to the characters. Not to the level of something like Cowboy Bebop, but it's definitely up there.\\n\r\nThe characters offer up different perspectives on anime as well, which is why I truly love them. Some of my favourites were Shigeru-san, the old animator who is struggling to find purpose in the modern anime industry as it shifts towards newer, more moe art styles than the era in which he was in his prime. Endou, who feels as though his skills as an animator are less appreciated as more and more CG is included in the anime-making process - and his complimentary character Shimoyanagi, the 3D director, who simply loves anime and being a part of the processes, but lacks the art skills to do key-frame animation.\\n\r\nThe key point in all of this is: They are all human. The people that make anime, from the director to the key-frame artists, from the production desk to the character designers; they all have lives, likes and dislikes, preferences and, most importantly flaws. The director is the best example. He loves anime, he loves making it, he loves creating a world and a story and seeing it come to life - but he's also childish, he doesn't like responsibility, he struggles. But ultimately the passion he has for what he does wins out. This is a story about making anime, but beyond that, the people that make it happen - and how they're so passionate about it.\\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~\\n\r\nIf you, for some reason, skipped everything before this - here is the short of it. I love Shirobako. As the episodes went on and I got more and more attached to the characters (and I mean ALL the characters), I cried with them, became stressed with them, but above all became passionate with them. I felt as if I was a part of their failures and their victories, even as an onlooker.\\n\r\nBefore watching Shirobako I knew that anime had a lot of people behind it, but I never really knew what that meant. Or, better than that, I never appreciated what that meant. Watching Shirobako has been as if I've looked behind the curtain and seen even just a little bit of what is involved in making this medium that I love. The way I've watched anime is now changed, I'm now more sympathetic to what goes on, even if I don't see it. The anime that I already love, I appreciate even more the obvious love and effort that went into them. And even those that I look down on, or don't enjoy, I can appreciate that human being dedicated their time into creating it - and that is astounding.\\n\r\nThis is not a documentary, there is certainly exaggeration for dramatic purposes, and there are certainly some things that are added to make the show a little more interesting (Everyone involved in anime are somehow very skilled in drifting and street racing?). But if even 10% of Shirobako displays some resemblance to the truth of how anime is made, then I applaud it. Some anime have made me think about things, made me look within myself, but Shirobako is the first to change my perception of anime, all anime, an entire medium after I have been loving it for as long as I can remember.\\n\r\nBut, even aside from all that, the anime is still fun. It's definitely the most authentic slice-of-life anime I've seen in a long time that is actually happy, and an overall positive experience.\\n\r\nSo in short: Enjoyment - 10/10. I will certainly watch this anime multiple times over my life for as long as I watch anime. I'm hoping that Australia gets a DVD release so I can actually buy it.\\n\\n\r\n~OVERALL~\\n\r\nIf you have any sort of feeling for the anime medium, if you enjoy anime as a whole, even if you're just tangentially interested in anime: Watch Shirobako. Not, \"you should watch\" or \"if you're into slice of life, you should watch\"; No, straight up watch Shirobako.\\n\r\nEven if you're only into action series, moe series, meccha series, whatever - you need to watch Shirobako. If it changes your perception only slightly of the anime industry, then that's enough.\\n\r\nShirobako is not perfect - I said that before - but it is what it needs to be, and it does what it needs to do. It humanises anime, gives the viewer an insight into the world of Japanese animation. The only thing I would've added to it would be the end-credit scenes actually showing the real-life process of making Shirobako itself, having the actual animators, artists, etc talking directly to the audience about what they do. But hey, that would simply be a bonus for what is already a great anime.\\n\r\nSo do it. Watch Shirobako. I hope it does to you what it did to me~\\n\\n\r\nToodles~",

            "content": "There are many ideas the average viewer thinks about when they are asked what makes an anime work for them. Is it the driving narrative that help to construct the pieces of the story? Is it the lovable cast of characters that help drive the story to its own path? Is it the breathless, but invigorating and vibrant animation that help to bring it to life? Is it the overall palatable visual design that help to give the show its identity? Is it the mesmerizing voice acting and sound direction that help to make it memorable?\r\nBut what if it's a little more personal than that,taking in account with the people who help make it and how the overall production goes? With so little information, it's hard to know what exactly goes on behind the scenes. Shirobako helps to alleviate this problem by providing the audience with a personal tale that focuses on the industry and the people behind it.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako follows the story of five girls and the struggles they experience following their dream in the anime industry. Their dream stems from their own little experiences of managing an animation club in high school, their hopes and aspirations held up high in regards to their future of wanting to work in the anime industry, not knowing the hardships and struggles that they will face in the near future. Although each have their own set of motivations and paths they set on, the show mostly focuses on Aoi, an amateur production assistant working at Musashino Animation and her experiences working in the industry she sought after.\\n\\n\r\nThrough her we see the basic setup to Shirobako, in that it's an anime about making anime with all the nooks and crannies that come along with it. From the writing processes, to general animating, to sound production, to editing, and so forth. It shows what goes on in the production with in depth and precise detail, never trying to dumb down its explanations nor barraging the audience with information. Instead, it flows with the backdrop of the story and helps to build and give flavor to the world it's set in.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with its details on the industry itself, it also gives attention to the people who work to produce it. The cast is immensely large and it shows, as each staff member have their own unique personalities, role, motivations, and backstory that help tie the story together in its attempt to show off the inner workings of the industry. Granted, it does comes off as overwhelming, but each character never particularly feels wasteful or comes across as flat, as they each bring an intoxicating and down to earth atmosphere and overall entertaining dynamic with their interactions. The cast always aim to provide differing viewpoints and details of the anime industry that helps build upon the subject matter and themes that it lays its foundation on.\\n\\n\r\nBut there's also a more personal story to take away from Shirobako. It isn't just some animated documentary on the anime industry, but rather a compelling character drama that focuses on the hardships of adult life and the struggle of a career in the fine arts. Some characters struggle to make ends meet, some have their aspirations crushed, some never get the break they deserve, some get stuck in the frenetic and tiring productions and lose purpose, some have their own vision compromised, and some just give it all up. While it's not afraid to show the reality of the world, it still maintains a nice, lighthearted tone through its humor and exaggeration. This helps give the series a positive, optimistic and genuine feel to it as it never leaves a certain comfort zone of its subjects to make sure it doesn't get too dark. However, it still manages to give the viewer a general idea of the hectic work they deal with while also driving their own development. It's all there to reinforce the central themes of the series, and feels absolutely genuine and believable in its manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, art, and sound in general are good, if not great. PA Works once again has the usual efficiency in producing stunning backgrounds, and aims to provide a realistic look to reinforce the backdrop of the show. Animation isn't particularly groundbreaking, but always feels consistent and fluid, never exceeding more than it wants to convey. The overall character design have a rather charming and vibrant feel to them, trying to balance out a memorable and colorful design while adhering to a realistic tone. Soundtrack is simple, catchy, and never feels out of place as it skillfully matches a certain tone it sets in. And finally, the outstanding VA cast comprised of newcomers and professionals help bring their performances to life with a believable and exhilarating spirit to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako feels like a love letter to the anime industry and it truly shines. From the bustling and frenetic take on what goes on production, the feelings and dreams of the people who work in it, and the love and care for such a niche industry despite the madness that comes with it. Thus, Shirobako's beauty resides in the nature of the industry, not only because of its heartfelt subject matter, but also because of how genuine and relatable it is.",

            "content": "The majority of the adult life concerns itself with the professional career. Enjoy your job, you spend much of your serious thinking time there, it\u2019s how you make your money and ultimately do really anything. It\u2019s important. I\u2019m sure we all want to be NEETs, ideally, but of course in today\u2019s world that\u2019s hard to do successfully. So we sacrifice time in the present for a sustainable calling. And when we do get that job, after some time we may think to ourselves: Why am I here? Why do I do this? How do this relate to my passions and dreams?\r\nSuch thoughts occupy Miyamori Aoi,our ever-passionate and lovable protagonist of Shirobako. In high school she dreamed of making an anime; now a young adult, she experiences the daily quirks, joys, and obstacles of working as a production assistant in an anime studio. She is indeed making anime come to life, although not in the way she had imagined; so for most of the show she ponders this question.\\n\\n\r\nMiyamori is the main character, but as a whole, Shirobako details the life of an anime studio. Each of the many characters, each of whom contributes towards the making of the shows in some manner, has his or her own distinct personality and design. Like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Shirobako has an outstanding cast that doesn\u2019t lose the realistic feel that is often lost when having so many characters. And the fact that they all work together as one big happy team, grown adults whose job description literally entails making anime, just makes me smile. Several times throughout the show you see many of the employees at Musashino Animation together in the same room, and to see these people talk about making an anime for youth so seriously is just\u2026 so gratifying. For someone who loves anime dearly, an anime about making anime is ambrosia and nectar.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s even more appealing about Shirobako\u2019s characters is how they interact with each other. Being a two-dimensional visual medium, anime inherently carries what I will call the Character Problem -- the difficulty with presenting characters in a way resembling three-dimensional human life. Given such constraints as limited screen time, limited movement, stylistic and peculiar designs, and so on, characters that are drawn on the screen just cannot appear as real as in live-action, and even less so than in real life. Often, to preserve memorability, an anime may make its characters very flat and distinctive, to the degree such that they react to situations the same way every time. Some examples of lackluster characterization are Brook\u2019s recurring request to see a girl\u2019s panties and Sumire Kakei\u2019s histrionic panicking for even slightly worrying circumstances. Yes, this method leaves you with memorable characters, but they certainly don\u2019t feel human. After all, in real life humans are not so different from one another.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is why in hindsight looking back at the many fun personalities of Musashino it feels like I\u2019m looking at the real thing. It\u2019s amazing how P.A. Works managed to come up with that many unique characters that aren\u2019t sharply defined as, say, the genin in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. There\u2019s something almost ineffably empathetic about the daily shenanigans of Miyamori and her coworkers; there\u2019s definitely something resembling real human emotions and feelings. Kind of how Dostoevsky through his writing succeeds in manifesting human thought -- notably Crime and Punishment, whose protagonist Raskolnikov resounded to me far beyond the written word -- but on the screen. It\u2019s hard to explain. But by the end of it all, I had grown to adore the characters of Shirobako, almost as if they were real. I miss them still.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on about basically everyone at Musashino, but for this review I\u2019ll focus on its heart, Miyamori Aoi. Although not being at the head of things, with her role as production assistant, she has to make sure operations are moving smoothly -- that animators are meeting deadlines, that Kinoshita is drawing the storyboards, etc. -- which is often stressful. But Miyamori, whose infectious ebullience and devotion to the job can only lighten the mood, is a welcome presence, both to fellow adults spending hours drawing or creating or editing and to myself. And, I think, to anyone starting to think about his or her future professional career.\\n\\n\r\nWe are creatures of pleasure, and thus the prospect of working a 9-to-5 job five days a week with sparse vacation time throughout the year isn\u2019t exactly promising. I believe that it is against basic human nature to enjoy doing work. However, doing anything with others makes it enormously more tolerable, perhaps even fun; such was the feeling I got when watching the day-to-day routine of Musashino. I have worked a 9-to-5 internship so I know what it\u2019s like, and after watching Shirobako I\u2019ve realized that that lifestyle isn\u2019t so bad -- you befriend your fellow slaves, you gripe together about your plight, you make it through -- and I think that this is important to recognize. If at least for that, Shirobako is mightily worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nFor when it concerns potentially lifelong commitments, we humans seek out an all-unifying reason, a single important motivating factor that justifies the contract we make with ourselves. Miyamori asks herself this question, even though she does like making anime and doing it with great people. I guess the more pertinent question is this: Does there even have to be a reason? If you\u2019re already on that path voluntarily, then you took the steps to reach that path, which means you decided to take that path, implying that there was a reason. Miyamori becomes a production assistant in the hope to come closer to her dream, of making an anime with her friends from high school. Don Don Donuts!\\n\\n\r\nWhich is where reality hits. From episode 1 we are immediately struck by how the lifestyle of someone working in the anime industry isn\u2019t all peaches and cookies. Sakata Gintoki described the anime studio as the \u201cmodern day sweatshop\u201d; and Shirobako very likely sugarcoats it, which means that it really isn\u2019t don don donuts at all. This is why we need to support the anime industry. This is why so much trash continues to be produced, and this is why the stigma surrounding the medium exists.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses, we see how Miyamori and her friends do become involved with the making of anime, but their dreams are yet far away. Take voice actors (seiyuu) for example. Watch any anime and you will be impressed by the sheer caliber of the industry\u2019s voices. They sound so incredibly real. But each selected seiyuu is but one of many more who audition and fail. In general, breaking out in the fine arts is like winning the lottery, except that you have some control over your chances. In other words, you gotta have both luck and talent in addition to hard work. I mention this because Shizuka Sakaki, the aspiring voice actor, has it tough. Don\u2019t expect her to get the part on her first try. It\u2019s unfortunate, but that\u2019s just how the modern day world works. Each spot has too many competitors. Just look at college applications.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Shirobako is one of the more realistic anime out there. The women aren\u2019t all ridiculously endowed. Facial designs are fairly accurate depictions of real human faces (by anime standards -- see Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works, Code Geass, or Re:Zero for example). And, of course, anything and everything related to the characters, whom I already mentioned. Their portrayals of real-life types of people are superb, and besides the hair they couldn\u2019t be more human.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, some other points:\\n\\n\r\nSOUNDTRACK\\n\r\nGigguk mentioned in his video \u201cMusic in Anime\u201d how certain melodies, when played at certain moments, bring on the feels because they are associated with certain emotions. Shirobako\u2019s main theme, a lighthearted, frolicking tune played on strings and what I believe is clarinet (and other instruments), changes throughout the show as certain cruxes are met. We see this technique often: Daenerys\u2019s theme gets stronger throughout Game of Thrones, the Fellowship Theme/leitmotif changes and grows more complex to parallel events in The Lord of the Rings. But other than that, Shirobako\u2019s soundtrack throughout can be described as\u2026 well, fitting. Yes, it sounds obvious; but there was something very apt about the quite sophisticated variety of instruments used and how the makeup adapted per the situation. I really liked it, and when I hear the main theme a smile comes upon my face.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\nIn Gigguk\u2019s video \u201cIf Anime Studios Were People\u201d, P.A. Works is represented by a cute chick admiring herself in a hand mirror who says that her work looks good. Personally I wasn\u2019t too enraptured by the marble eyes and spade faces of Angel Beats!, or the rather lean personages of Another; but P.A. Works did manage to have a bevy of attractive women in Shirobako. I\u2019ll name Miyamori, Yano, and Diesel-san, just to name a few. Strangely enough, Miyamori was and is very appealing to me, despite her relatively flat chest -- which actually made her more realistically human, which coupled with her demeanor made her stand out. I remember her more keenly than, say, Rias Gremory.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty solid. Characters weren\u2019t too clearly cut and yet retained a good clarity to complement the backgrounds. That is, it didn\u2019t look like they were distinctly drawn on top of something else, they were a part of it. The backgrounds themselves are what you would expect of today\u2019s anime, warmly colored with a gentle palette. No complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT\\n\r\nI learned a great deal about how anime is made. I knew that it was hard work, but now I know firmly that each episode carries a significant amount of time and effort put in by many people behind it. Just like any other white-collar company, employees have to meet deadlines, work long hours, and go through office politics. In Shirobako the featured studio produces two different shows, one for each cour. The studio itself is comprised of various roles, such as the production assistants, animators, directors, CGI, music editors, etc. You know when the credits roll after a live-action film and the list is really long? Exactly. It\u2019s amazing how these grown adults spend their lives making anime, and I\u2019m extremely grateful towards Japan for giving us so many great titles.\\n\\n\r\nBeing an anime about anime, Shirobako also pays homage to real-life anime. I won\u2019t go into detail and I\u2019ll let you see for yourself -- but you may recognize parodies of well-known directors, certain studios, and more. Shirobako for being Shirobako is for that reason one of my favorites. I cannot give more kudos to those underpaid, overworked people over there for creating the worlds and stories and characters that I\u2019ve grown to love, perhaps more than my own -- thank you Japan for Hellsalem\u2019s Lot, thank you for One Piece, thank you for the likes of Yagami Light and Roronoa Zoro and Saitama.\\n\\n\r\nPARTING THOUGHTS\\n\r\nSo given the enormous skill and diligence required to make anime, let us all refrain from criticizing any show too much. A series can suffer from terrible writing, unoriginal premises, low-quality art, plastic characters, and so on -- but even so, every show that\u2019s trash is still trash that\u2019s not easy to make. And when you see certain gems like\u2026\\n\\n\r\n       Kotonoha no Niwa, the best 2D art I\u2019ve ever seen;\\n\r\n       Gintama, the meta-anime that laughs at itself;\\n\r\n       Shingeki no Kyojin, the most addicting schlock ever;\\n\r\n       Clannad: After Story, love and tears and everything else;\\n\r\n       Mushishi, art;\\n\\n\r\nand literally a bajillion others, you\u2019ll realize just how incomprehensibly stunning anime is as a medium. I have never laughed more, wept more, smiled more, anticipated more, learned more, [verb] more than I have for anime.\\n\\n\r\nSHOULD YOU WATCH?\\n\r\nShirobako is a much-needed, refreshing story whose depiction of the working world doesn\u2019t exaggerate too much or show too little. It just is. The real world isn\u2019t too great, but if you look at life like Miyamori does and be cheerful, you won\u2019t regret your actions and you\u2019ll find your way. So yes, I give Shirobako the highest recommendation. It is one of my favorites and I\u2019m sure to come back to it again.",

            "content": "Ever wanted to know how anime is made? The magic behind the scenes is always something I\u2019m sure almost any anime fan would want to know. Shirobako opens up that curtain of magic as it brings together a show that discusses about making anime. It\u2019s almost a dream like come true for anyone who has a fascination in the art of crafting anime. Thanks to P.A Works, that fascination can now become a reality.\r\nAs an original show, it\u2019s noticeable for the fact that it\u2019s also a 2 cour that ran consecutively for 24 episodes. As the series is related to anime making themes, one mightwonder how it can cover so much. The answer is simple: work. Like it or not but making anime is not an easy task. It requires dignity, effort, teamwork, management, and unparalleled responsibility to get the job done. The sheer amount of effort is accurately depicted in this show from start to finish. In fact, the first few episodes of this series creates the atmosphere of reality. Indeed, realism is adapted as part of this show when it comes to anime making. Everything is incorporated with high degree of detail from prototype drawings, character designs, and voice acting. Those are just a few examples but Shirobako gives you the idea of what it\u2019s like to be in the shoes of these dedicated workers.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the story mainly retains its premise with every episode covering some sort of theme related to anime making. The title of each episode gives a good clue to what it may be about while also solidifying the details of what it\u2019s trying to do. In essence, Shirobako is known for experimenting. At Musashino Animation, you can see exactly what\u2019s going on involving the characters and their roles. With a mission set to craft a show about anime making, one should also clearly address its intentions. Luckily, it does just that by introducing our main protagonists. The main trio (Aoi, Ema, and Shizuka) shows us the harsh reality of the anime industry. Taking a few steps back though, the show also has a crystal clear narrative. It establishes the fact that these three girls has a strong dedication in their passion to making anime such as forming an Animation Club and even made a short show at school. For what is worth, this series is more than just a slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nAnother noticeable fact is the show\u2019s large cast of characters. Besides our main trio, there are numerous characters that all have some sort of role in the show. As such, don\u2019t expect much focus on the characterization or their development but rather on their roles. It gives them a performance and discusses their responsibilities. Each episode focuses on something related to the anime industry whether it\u2019s the director, animator, sound producer, storyboard, or production. The list goes on and on but the praise here given is how focused the show is directed at these roles. From conversations to mechanics, each episode specifically shows and tells what the true reality of their roles are like. At the same time, the series also makes its way to show the creativity of some of the characters. It reveals their skills not just in a realistic way but also in a profound method to grip the audience in their ideas. Sure, some of these ideas might not extravagant or earth shattering but the point is to show how these ideas came to be. In retrospect, Shirobako makes the audience feel like you\u2019re there; almost in a way like you are backstage with the cast. \\n\\n\r\nWhile on an individual basis, the characters may not stand out as much. However, the series rebounds this back by crafting appealing character relationships. From a professional viewpoint, we can see how the working relationship between the characters are like at the workplace. While many episode discusses the mechanics of the anime industry, some also does this on an interpersonal level. It provides adequate reasons of why people are there in the first place. After all, everyone has a reason of wanting to get the job and being part of the anime industry workforce is no exception. It also clearly depicts emotions and personalities of the characters by doing this with its thought provoking themes. At the same time, it\u2019s able to also squeeze in comedic moments (donuts, Initial D level driving skills, etc) to give the audience a gentler feel. As the series is about work, it\u2019s able to show that there are rewards for being part of the anime industry. It also be relatable too because anyone with a job will know what rewards feels like and how your efforts aren\u2019t wasted. For our main trio, they realize that as well as the series goes on. \\n\\n\r\nWith everything coming together, Shirobako can take a bulk of patience to get through or even get started. One should realize what the purpose of the show with every episode. And while it\u2019s not an educational show, Shirobako conveys anime industry with an immaculately crafting style. However, there are times when the show feels one dimensional. After all, there\u2019s not too much development in the overlay of the main story. Each episode ties in with one another with the principles of anime industry but some of them will feel dull or repetitive. The occasional dramedy of the series can also feel a bit forced. Resolutions can also come as abrupt while some conflicts really loses its momentum. Despite this, I give credit for Shirobako when it shows the characters\u2019 talents for resolving those conflicts. Every character in this show clearly has some of it.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork about a show involving anime industry? That\u2019s almost ironic. While the series clearly neglects any fan service, it\u2019s the artistic values of the show that will label Shirobako as a visual porn. P.A. Works\u2019 efforts is easily recognized by the strong artwork of the series whether it\u2019s character designs or setting. It establishes the foundation of the anime industry by creating that sense of realism. This includes the art of the studio and even the way the animation is done within this show itself. However, I do have some criticism with a few of the character designs that makes the cast looks a bit younger than they seem. While it creates a sense of growth with their roles as employees in the real world, they also look generic especially with our main female characters. However, it also does rebound this with some of the other characters who plays out their role as more credible mature adults. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is more or less on the weaker scale. Both the OP and ED songs are adequate but doesn\u2019t necessarily create a sensational feel. Additionally, some of the character voices of the adults feels monotonous. However, I do give credit for the dramedy of the series. During some of the more emotional angles (usually sub-plots) and character relationships, voice mannerisms are well delivered to present feelings. This is also true on a professional level when we see how some of the cast are desperate to get the experience by expressing their tone in voice. The mechanics with that is something I think most people will find thought provoking. \\n\\n\r\nSo what is this show really about? Shirobako literally means White Box but there\u2019s hardly anything plain about the series. Rather, it crafts a colorful imagery of what the anime industry is like from all angles. There will be some periods of time during the show where you may be itching to get through an episode because it may be something that is less appealing to others. At the same time, not everyone will be able to appreciate the idea of anime industry. That\u2019s fine though with the given concept but I still urge anyone to give this a try whether or not you have a passion in the art of anime making. With a creative cast of characters, dynamic realism, relatable mechanics, and great chemistry between characters, this show is definitely one of the coming ages. Oh and donuts.",

            "content": "I don't know how accurate Shirobako is about the nuances of the anime industry, but what I do know is that it absolutely nails the heart of why creative pursuits are so challenging yet so rewarding.\r\nThere's a short but definitive list of the things that make Shirobako the absolute best.\r\n1. This is an anime for and about adults. I don't mean this like it's super edgy extreme hardcore, I mean that despite its occasional goofiness, the show takes place in the working world and focuses on the struggles of its chosen line of work. The characters all have goals and challenges that relate to howthey fit their careers into their vision of what they want to be as a creative. Not that I don't enjoy high school supernatural adventure like the rest of us, but Shirobako dives right for an under-served niche in this medium and knocks it out of the park.\\n\\n\r\n2. Production value (cue Super 8 joke). This anime is all gorgeous, all the time. It's not just a manner of consistently top-notch art and animation quality. Nor is it just the massive cast with an array of fantastic designs. It's all that, plus unflinching attention to detail and no cut corners on the aesthetics. The backgrounds are always detailed and contain little personality-adding tidbits, and all the major characters have a variety of outfits that keep the visuals fresh. This is obviously an all-out production from P.A. works in story and art, and it absolutely shows.\\n\\n\r\n3. Everyone is a good person. The story of Shirobako is fraught with constant drama, and it always feels like the world is falling apart. Despite that, with one exception, there's no true villain in this show. There's conflict, but its all borne of people with limits in a line of work constantly pushing them to the brink. You can't help but root for everyone, even that dumbass Tarou or that prick Hiraoka.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako is an overwhelmingly positive show about connecting with your passion, and I couldn't recommend it highly enough.",

            "content": "Shirobako is yet another series I watched on a whim and which ended up surprising me in a very good way.\r\nWhile the first episode shows a bunch of high school girls who're part of an anime-making club, the show nearly immediately skips past that part of the characters' lives and instead treats us to a completely different setting instead, where we see them several years later as they're either already working professionally, or at least looking for a job. This alone was enough to catch my attention, since it avoided the overly done high school setting that so many series end up doing.\r\nThe main characterwho gets the most showtime is, by far, Aoi, as we're shown the highs and lows of the anime studio she works at as a newbie producer. It was really interesting for me to see the anime industry shown in both its good side, showcasing the passion and drive people have to try and make something they can be proud of, but also its bad side, with looming deadlines, quarrels and all sorts of hurdles that the studio is forced to overcome in order to deliver on its promises.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a show about something fairly mundane, it was really nice how much Shirobako showcased the whole process of making an anime, all the way from acquiring the rights to a series, to script writing to delivering the finished episodes, and the passion that oozed from each part of it. Besides the focus on Aoi, we can also see the her former schoolmates as they either work on the industry or try their best to make it in there, and the way they experience the whole process, learn from it and make decissions.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Shirobako might be a bit too positive at times (which might be a bit off-putting for some people), I'd definitely recommend it. It's a short but sweet series that happily surpassed the expectations I had for it.",

            "content": "Have any of these questions ever passed through your mind while watching anime? \u201cWhy did that last anime you watch have a dodgy scene of animation in the last episode?\u201d \u201cWhy did the animation style start to seem to slacken off as the show progressed?\u201d \u201cWhy on earth did the show choose to not stay closer to the source material?\u201d If so then Shirobako \u2013 the anime about making anime - can provide reasons for you delivered in an entertaining and memorable package. This labour of love from P.A. Works is one of my favourite shows I\u2019ve been lucky enough to watch of late. It\u2019sjam packed with a large, lively cast who provide everything from side-splitting humour to some very hard-hitting emotional moments. For a show about something as menial sounding as making anime, it manages to keep your attention throughout. It achieves this with flying colours thanks to a great selection of themes which include self-worth, talent, imagination and motivation \u2013 all clearly and realistically explored from start to finish. When all is said and done it\u2019s bound to give you a better appreciation for the process behind a show\u2019s creation.\\n\\n\r\nOur story follows Aoi Miyamori, a new production assistant at the fictional Musashino Animation. Along for the ride are her four former animation club classmates \u2013 Ema, Shizuka, Misa and Midori \u2013 all either successfully in or attempting to break into the anime industry. Each of the five carry their own hopes and dreams though reality tends to stand in the way of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn\u2019t take its time dishing out the drama revolving around the five characters, keeping the issues rolling in on a frequent basis. People are sick. People slack off. Above all, people make mistakes. As a viewer, I was constantly on edge. It didn\u2019t take me long at all to build affection for this motley crew of anime workers. I badly wanted them to succeed and was riding on every little piece of drama. \\n\\n\r\nEvery problem in the show, no matter how big or small, feels like it has a huge bearing on proceedings. Whatever happens never affects one person, it starts a domino effect across the office, and sometimes it can even reshape the entire final product. On top of this there\u2019s plenty of complexity to something as seemingly simple as a show set predominantly in an office. While our story follows Aoi in her role, there\u2019s plenty of things always happening around her outside of her control. Musashino Animation actually feels alive. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s impossible to talk about Shirobako without mentioning its sizeable cast of characters and its impressive feat of making none of them feel like a waste of space. There\u2019s the gluttonous yet nerve-wracked director Seiichi, the confident and obnoxious Taro, the no-nonsense Yutaka and the calm-headed, goth-clothing-clad Ogasawara to name a few. And I mean just a few. What P.A. Works have done is created a slew of side-stories utilising these characters yet somehow managed to not let that drag down the core story. All characters steer well clear of any negative and overused tropes. These are some of the most well written characters I\u2019ve seen in almost any form of animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe show loves bringing up common public anime-related debates and casting them into the spotlight. The most notable of these is the issue of hand-drawn animation vs computer-generated imagery. Sometimes the pace is dialled back a touch when Shirobako chooses to take a look at these ideas to explore them in good detail. Characters bicker about, yet gain an appreciation for, each other\u2019s methods. It tell us plenty of interesting little tales: Choosing the right voice actor means trying to meet a lot of different demands, a key animation retake can be more crippling than you\u2019d think and a communication breakdown can have devastating effects. There\u2019s a truckload of commentary on the medium and also a handful of lovely throwbacks to some of anime\u2019s most influential shows and people.\\n\\n\r\nArt-wise the show filled to the brim with a lovely selection of backgrounds and attention to detail \u2013 nothing we should be surprised about at all when it comes to P.A. Works. It\u2019s even the small details that sometimes go unnoticed, like characters actually wearing a variety of clothing, that breathe life into a show and those within it. They go a long way to showcasing each of their separate personalities.\\n\\n\r\nI feel it\u2019s important to approach Shirobako with the right mindset and knowing what sort of depiction of the industry you can expect. You shouldn\u2019t go into the show expecting a hyper-realistic look at topics like financial and/or social life problems that can easily affect workers in the real world. The show instead chooses to focus on the production hurdles, not the lifestyle ones, and I have no qualms about that. I\u2019ve seen some rather hilarious criticism over some scenes which have intentionally been crafted by P.A. Works as over-the-top moments. Had the show still included these scenes yet gone for the aforementioned broader (and perhaps darker) depiction of the industry then they certainly would have felt more out of place. Shirobako tells us from the opening moments the tone it\u2019s going for \u2013 a lighter-hearted and humorous one \u2013 so don\u2019t take everything you see as gospel when it comes to the production process. The show maintains a level of silliness at times and it\u2019s better off for it.\\n\\n\r\nThis polished work had me going on all ends of the emotional spectrum. Characters mad me mad and moments made me overjoyed. This is a special show and one that should be put on a pedestal in people\u2019s \u2018recommended anime\u2019 list. It\u2019s one of those shows I wish I could wipe the mind clear of just to experience it for the first time once again. Congratulations P.A. Works. You turned a show about making anime into one of my most treasured anime.",

            "content": "Shirobako is an anime about making anime. In this sense it feels very different to most shows you might have seen but different doesn't have to mean bad. At first I was a little sceptical about the show, after all, how exciting can an anime ABOUT anime be? Although at the same time, I was also a bit curious about what exactly would be in the show. If you've been watching anime for a while, then I really would recommend you take the chance, because the odds are that you won't regret it, it really helps you appreciate anime more. Even if you are relativelynew to anime, it is a wonderful eye opener. \\n\\n\r\nSo, how is the show presented? Shirobako does a good job of trying to pass on its message in the form of a believable story and very vested characters. We start the story following the lives of 5 girls who are all part of an anime club in high school as the year comes to an end. For some it is their last year while a few still have one year left, although no matter where they go on to work, they promise to one day work on a professional anime together. That is their dream, that is the goal that they look to pursue during the show. All these girls have their own passions within the anime industry, some want to be voice actors, producers, graphic and sketch artists and some don't really know where they can fit in, but want to be part of something. \\n\\n\r\nThe 5 giels aren't all given equal screen time, which in my eyes was a let-down since they all had such distinct personalities and you really want to know about all of them in detail. Shirobako concentrates on one of these girls a lot, Miyanmori, who has gone on to find a job as a production desk assistant at a small anime production studio, Mushishino Animation. We see the show through her eyes, her experiences and her interactions (for the most part anyways). She has a stable, friendly and professional attitude however is prone to stress (but aren't we all!) Shirobako then takes us through what it really is like to make anime, sometimes getting the point across via its bonkers characters or through very real, very grounded situations. \\n\\n\r\nWhen first watching the show, you might find it a bit slow to start with, I certainly did and for the first few episodes I wasn't getting a great vibe. After all, this show doesn't have much action and a lot of the time it is set in the studio, so those looking for something jam packed with action will not find it here. Instead, Shirobako has wonderful dialogue and great character interactions to keep you interested, it may be a little slow but persist. \\n\\n\r\nThe show really gets across the struggles faced not only in production, but also of common recurring problems in life. This was what was really refreshing, the struggle and hard work needed to reach a goal were highlighted well, some characters struggled to the bitter end while constantly questioning themselves and running into one wall after the other. Things aren't always sugar coated to make it nice, but the realism is conveyed in a believable manner. Almost all the characters have had problems to deal with in even the most simplest of jobs, it's very easy to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the biggest attraction of this show was the insight to what making an anime is like and in this respect you will not be disappointed, although for some I can understand why they might find the whole idea a little dull- although Shirobako does try to make it funny and quirky at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nGoing through the process of how voices actors work, how the people who are behind the drawings and sketches are inspired to just how difficult it can be to meet deadlines all the time. It really captures how frantic the entire process can be. It is also really fulfilling to watch the characters go about different aspects of building together an entire series. You will learn of the techniques they use as well as the new and old styles. You will get an idea of how friction might arise and how different people have different solutions around problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe art-style was impressive and you tended to notice it a lot more given how the show makes a point of art-styles itself in the actually storyline. The dialogue as mentioned before was excellent and the interactions very real- although there are some more over the top sequences with the sole purpose of emphasis, which is great. The OPs and EDs were nice, but mostly forgettable after having watched the show and it was only the 2nd ED that really stood out for me- they weren't bad but weren't amazing either. \\n\\n\r\nOther than being initially slow, of the drag back for me was the fact that so much of the show is within the confines of an office and while it was interesting to see a group dynamic, the show could have benefitted from more action outside the walls. While this wasn't a major problem for me since I am happy to go along with the situation, I can see why this might be a major turn off. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, despite having mentioned it before, I would like to seriously point out how there isn\u2019t much in the way of action or incredible tension (other than the stress of work) and as a result it can seem a down-right bore, especially to new viewers who are looking for action. The exaggerated areas, most which take place outside the show, like the car-racing sequences or the fictional left-shoulder devil and right-shoulder angel characters or just the extremities the characters take, does sort of remedy this. \\n\\n\r\nDespite everything, this is a thoroughly enjoyable show as long as you aren\u2019t predetermined in what to expect. It felt like a lively slice of life with plenty of humour. If you have been watching anime for a while, you will undoubtedly love the show even more, since so many different aspects and styles of anime are put forwards with great effect. In some sense\u2019s it will polarise opinion- but you won\u2019t know if you don\u2019t try!\\n\\n\r\nI most certainly will not be forgetting this show. \\n\\n\r\nTukky12\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you love anime and the process behind it this will come back to tell you again and again that you should watch it. \r\nOne of the many reasons is the story. Girls who want to make an anime together sounds something that can be cliche but the creators of this anime has made it original and fun. Its not one of those everything clicks at once and everyone is happy since everything goes well. No this anime fully brings out the process behind making an anime and not only that but the different sides of animation. Everything from drawing to voice actors. You canthelp but to love it every time one watch it. Although there are times you want to push one spesific character over a ledge his stupidity is almost errased from memory as the better and more fun characters enters the stage and really lights it up so much that you cant see that big insensitive idiot on the side. This anime has done what a lot of other anime cant and that is to stay true to themselves and go with their own pace. That is the feeling i had when i watched it and finished it. It felt like wow these guys didn't have to cram stupid stuff into it to make it fun to watch. It was a story about anime , its production and the people around it in its purest form. \\n\\n\r\nI think the sound is were i would think ah didn't really remember much here or didn't think about much here. Which isn't that good but the sound isn't bad either its just normal with hints of good soundtrack in between. And the opening and ending is a matter of taste i personally found them uninteresting but again this is just the sound and music so it wont bash my faith in this anime at all.\\n\\n\r\nOk if i had to talk about every \"main\" character in this anime i would make whoever read this bored fast since there are like 5 and there isn't a big meaning for me to 1 make someone bored and 2 talk about every since then this review would be longer than it already is. Tehe.\\n\\n\r\nSo i will talk about Miyamori, Aoi who is what i prefer to call the main main character of the anime since you see her mostly while the other \"mains\" are a little here and there depending on the parts of the anime. I honestly like Miyamoris character from the get go. She is hard working yet has a weird like personality. like talking toys and pretend they either talk to her or talk to each-other about different worries she has. She is a typical character you want to do well with what she does and you always want to see more of what she can do. She is purely interesting and there isnt really an annoying side about her. \\n\\n\r\nAs a general way of summarizing her friends or other mains would be to say. There is an aspiring voice actor who struggles with confidence but she is interesting in the way she handles it. There is a aspiring 3d graphic girl who struggles with what path she should take onwards in her job. Then there is a drawer whos confidence or lack there off is sweet yet you also want her to find out. The last is an aspiring writer who is at college but is interesting in the way that she is an all round support to the other 4 girls. \\n\r\nAs you see if i wrote one summary of sorts and how much i liked them all i would be writing wayy much and it wouldnt be that fun. \\n\\n\r\nAs i started watching this anime it just proved to me how much this is a must watch for anyone who loves anime and the production behind it. I liked everything from most of the characters to the story buildt around it and it never got too melodramatic or boring. I enjoyed this to a 10 and more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this deserve to be honored for the pure and clean work this anime is which is why i think eventhough i dont give it 10 in everything i still rate it as a 10. I think in its own it will be viewed as a classical anime for what it does. This anime didnt have to put romance and alot of drama to make it work. it just had to be itself from the start and continue onward. \\n\\n\r\nAs i have said previously. Watch this if you have an interest in anime in general and the production behind it but also because it overall is a great anime that i almost guarantee that you will feel after a time that you want to rewatch and just see this unique great anime yet again. There is a risk that it might sound slow for some which is something i should just say since i know it is that although i dont mind it personally.",

I am slightly less amenable to the five main characters who turn out like drunk hahaha maybe because they are girls. especially Sugie san and Goth Loli Sama you both are amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10\\n\r\nreally enjoy every episode of shirobako, maybe because this anime takes reference from real activities so the audience especially me can easily understand what to convey\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10\\n\r\nThank you so much Shirobako.",

            "content": "We all love anime. Otherwise we wouldn't be on this site. \r\nMany of us dreamt to work in the anime industry, to create things we ourselves are interested in. Or if not to work, many of us still wanted to at least understand it, wanted to know how things are done and if it really is as great as we imagine it to be. \r\nIt's no surprise, that Shirobako, the show that offers a glimpse into the production process of anime, created such resonance in the anime-loving community. And the way it tries to do that! Shirobako positions itself as an entertainment, a work ofart that could give you something else apart from the dry info about the technical process. \\n\\n\r\nThe key words here are 'positions itself'. But does it manage to authentically convey the details of the process of making anime while remaining entertaining at the same time? \\n\\n\r\nThe show definitely provides quite a bit of insight into the anime-making process. But let's be honest to ourselves: if we really wanted to know about how anime is made, we'd watch a documentary or google for some articles on the internet. The information can be found if you try hard enough, and if you didn't try, chances are that's not what will be the most important part of Shirobako for you, even if you think it is. \\n\\n\r\nWhat we really want in this kind of fiction is to root for characters, to worry if they'll manage to overcome the obstacles on the way to their goal.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Shirobako seem to understand this, but it doesn't go out of it's way to provide this. \\n\r\nAt least definitely not to the point of calling it 'Drama' as it's tagged here on MAL.\\n\r\nOf course it has quite a bit of emotionally powerful moments, but they are by no means Dramatic.\\n\r\nIt's much closer to Slice-of-Life if anything. \\n\\n\r\nAnd sometimes Shirobako is focusing too much on this slice of life, the everyday job of the staff, while having little else going on. The start in particular can be called slow.\\n\\n\r\nIt eventually starts to focus on important things: the characters, their motivations and determination, their views and methods to do things, their differences and their trials to overcome them, but those things are still provided in a very reserved way that some people won't be able to appreciate. For example, there's no life and death situations, sometimes even stakes don't seem to be high enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe further story goes, the higher tension gets, the more crises and obstacles characters face, the more development they undergo, and by the end you become familiar with almost everyone in Musashino Animation staff, they grow on you, you sympathize with them. But you need to get there first. Because of this the show might come off as \"Boring people doing boring job\" for some. Especially if you don't like Slice of Life stories.\\n\\n\r\nBut familiarizing yourself with characters takes time. If you ready to actually invest it, it will definitely become rewarding in the end. Because, once they develop enough, characters in Shirobako are great, and the Show tries really hard to give enough screen time to everyone (despite the fact that there are tons of them), and handle them as good as possible. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, as a bit of a personal commentary, I myself am not a fan of Slice of Life stories, and that was my major concern going into Shirobako, but in the end I really liked it. And I think if you like anime it is a good show for you to try and watch. Even if you won't like it in the end, it definitely is worth your time to try.\\n\\n",

            "content": "'Bakuman' became a cult hit by giving manga fans a look inside the industry. If the manga about manga can do well, why not an anime about anime? Much like 'Bakuman', 'Shirobako' delivers a high level of enjoyment and information, but threadbare plot and character development keep it from being anything beyond a fun ride.\r\n-Story-\r\nThere is very little story to speak of, as what plot exists is there solely to deliver lessons about the anime industry or occasionally set-up a debate over some facet of it (such as 2D vs CGI animation, or the politics behind choosing a voice cast). There are occasional side-trips tovisit the personal lives of 5 main girls, but these serve as little more than breathing spaces between information-heavy lessons on how anime is made. The 'slice-of-life' elements have no real drama or tension, as every problem is inevitably solved by hard work and patience (much like Bakuman, this series is an optimistic look at the industry). Like I said earlier, the plot exists as an excuse to look inside the anime industry- and as a look inside it's informative and entertaining, but it's hardly deep or moving.\\n\\n\r\n-Art & Sound-\\n\\n\r\nI have little to say on either of these segments, so I'll tackle them both at once. Production values are as high as they need to be, but nothing spectacular. The soundtrack is light and upbeat, the voice actors do their jobs, and the OPs and EDs are fine. Art is your pretty standard for a show centering on cutesy girls, but quality is solid. (side note, for a bit of a 'meta' moment, 'Shirobako' shows that CGI is most often used in anime today to handle complex moving machines like cars- and the most obvious use of CGI in the show are the cars).\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nQuick, tell me what the main 5 girls want to do besides make anime? Yes, they each have some quirk to distinguish themselves from each other, but that's hardly depth or internal conflict. They are plot devices and need to be treated as such. Since MAIN main character Aoi is a production assistant, it means that 'Shirobako' can seamlessly move between the various stages of anime production (if she were specialized and stuck in say, the sound department, the plot would get stale quickly- sound designers are rarely sent to draw key animation frames after all). Meanwhile, by giving Aoi a friend in each major area of anime production 'Shirobako' can get in-depth on a particular subject when it wants to. The side characters are one-trick ponies with little development as individuals. There are occasionally *tiny* changes and developments (Director Kinoshita is more self-confident and dependable and Taro is a bit less useless in the second arc, for example) but nothing that would exactly be confused for the Valhalla chapter of 'Vinland Saga'. The cast is so large, and individual development so minimal that each character is introduced with on-screen text giving their name and job title the first few times they appear just to help the viewer keep track. Like the plot, the characters serve as a vehicle to drive the audience from one look inside the anime industry to another- Misa's story arc about the life of a CGI designer  might have been INFORMATIVE and INTERESTING, but I was hardly kept awake at night pondering the depth and twists of her internal debate on whether or not to leave one CGI production company for another.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nThis series is highly enjoyable for anime fans who want to look inside the industry. If the lessons on anime production aren't entertaining however, I doubt you would find anything else to truly make this show a must-watch.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\\n\r\nIt's best to view 'Shirobako' as a fictional documentary about anime. I say 'fictional documentary' because while it follows a fictional cast of characters through fictional events, its main focus is teaching the viewer about the anime industry- not getting them deeply invested in the cast and their conflicts. For what it is 'Shirobako' IS enjoyable and educational, but it is at its core an entertaining lesson about anime production, if those anime lessons were removed there would be very little of value or interest left. Not bashing 'Shirobako' by any stretch, but while it is certainly a fun ride, it's just a fun ride.",

            "content": "Shirobako is a good choice for you if you want to have a look into the anime industry but without events and characters seeming like they progress in a natural or realistic fashion, but still giving you somewhat of a decent insight into the industry regardless.\r\nYou see, Shirobako does do a good job at putting on the line some of the goals and aspirations the characters want to do, even if it's half corny and generic safe responses and the other half is mostly what would feel natural for someone that has entered into the industry making a decision that fits their original goal presentedin a situation that makes sense. Well maybe it's more like, 60-40%. Well... maybe... erm...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, what it absolutely fails to do is present the situation of the working space in a believable way. You see there is this director who is, putting it mildly, the absolute worst thing in the world. He constantly procrastinates, he is usually indecisive and he had no sense of direction to the point that when he was asked what he wanted to do with his series, his answer was simply \"moe\". That was his answer for why he created the series and where he wanted to take it. I'm sure anyone, despite however rancid might think has gotten and maybe wanted to capitalize on the moe factor, if that was at all the case in this director's case, would have at the very least an idea on how to capitalize on moe and give a different answer. But, no, he said that because he was asked what were his original intentions with the series in order to get help from another writter, and that was his answer. And he's already known in the industry for his poor direction and what not, because he had failed on directing another original work called \"Jiggly Jiggly Heaven\" which is exactly what you're probably thinking. I won't represent him as antagonistically as I can, but trust me, he seems very unqualified all throughout the first cour.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I'm mentioning all this and I'm stopping here is because I want to ask you the following questions: \\n\\n\r\nWould you work under him? \\n\\n\r\nNow think a bit before you answer because these are the guarantees of your job: you will probably be forced to take a lot of retakes due to his indecisiveness and work under a very limited timespan due to how much he's delayed writing the storyboards due to him procrastinating, which would make the retakes that much more difficult. Also keep in mind that he has a terrible reputation and if you're there and he fails he probably is going to drag you down with him as well. Maybe you're asking yourself how would I have known which, okay, good point, then I'm gonna ask you the following question instead.\\n\\n\r\nWhat would you do when you found out he's this way?\\n\\n\r\nWould you continue working so the anime won't be a permanent stain on your resume and make it as great as possible, would you bail because as soon as you could before you would be able to have it as a permanent stain on you or would you have an outburst at the director and tell him to get his shit together? Or would you simply just quit as soon as the project is done? I mean, you would feel at every point like you're in a sinking ship, right? Or maybe if you wouldn't, someone else at least would?\\n\\n\r\nExcept that's not what happens. Most people continue working so the work won't leave a permanent impact on their reputation in the industry but there is absolutely nobody, except one guy who downright forces the director to work. There's nobody that expresses any sort of frustration at the chaos the director has caused at things that are completely his fault. They had opportunities to do so with a bunch of characters, but no, they instead chose this path with this character: \"Everyone struggles until the asshole finally fucking gets some inspiration and then everything ends fine and dandy.\" I can't imagine in a realistic situation where there wouldn't be at least one person lashing out or at the very least talking the director behind his back for being this pathetic at what he's doing, hell, I barely can imagine someone being this tolerant in a fictional scenario built in my mind. Instead people just take it and do their work and eventually the director stops fucking around. You could've given the director some motivation to correct his ways through consequences of his work force simply not accepting what he's doing by lashing out at him or quitting or anything. But, no, that would make too much sense. Lets instead have his actions have very little voiced consequences and everything ending up pretty much okay.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is the main problem with Shirobako, whenever there is a problem, everything ends up okay in the end, to the point where you get to the content of the second cour, where everything works even better in the project and the director isn't even a problem anymore, whenever a \"oh my god a setback\" happens there's no sense of urgency behind it and the tension from this type of situation is pretty much gone. There's no consequence to things going wrong other than, okay, lets work a little bit harder mkay? Okay. You're writing a story about an industry, there's always a risk for someone doing a bad job, but quitting and being fired are totally natural responses a person or a company could take in these situations. Failing a deadline or the work suffering a drop in quality are also possible consequences of incompetence or simply harsh conditions. As a result of this, none of the events happening in Shirobako have any dramatic value, despite trying to build them up and failing spectacularly at them. You know they will strive to make things in the series as optimistic as possible while creating tension with only one result, you feeling relieved it worked out.\\n\\n\r\nIt looked like all the characters were pulling punches in the hopes that things will work out and they will somehow manage, which made me feel very cynical about the whole experiences they've went through.\\n\\n\r\nThat was what mostly almost kinda made me drop the series a bunch of times but instead I continued watching the series because quite frankly, I enjoyed the parts where Shirobako presented the motivations and ambitions the characters had in the industry, or their loss of motivation and how they got over it. It does do a genuinely good job with that whenever they don't go on the safe route and offer some sort of insightful advice through a conclusion you could draw out from what the characters experience which is a good thing to see. Like what happens when you lose inspiration (no, I'm not talking about the director) or when you are stuck in a loop where you don't get any experience that would help you improve in the future. If the story focused more on this aspect of what it was trying to do while creating tension and focusing more on how to get over yourself and how you've achieved that and what consequences this could have not only on you but also on the team, I'm sure this could've been quite good, but it wasn't. I thought this aspect was enough for me to second guess calling this show bad, but I can't say it's fine for the lack of repercussions for every problem in the series that has appeared in it and making it seem quite unrealistic. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style of the show is generally good, given its a show about creating anime and animation plays a big part in it, most things are animated well. Everything looks well put together and you could technically see the process behind it too, which will probably help you have a better appreciation of it. The art style is a bit too cutsey for me but, I can say that it looked good regardless. The sound was generally fine too, although if I caught a glimpse of either the intro or ending I would immediately get turned off because I hate j-pop, and there are some downright cringy moments in the series that are meant to be heartwarming when the main character along with her friends go on and say this: \"DON DON DONUTS LETS GO NUTS!\". Ugh.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might or might have not guessed from what I've already said, the purpose of the characters is mostly to display one aspect of the industry or that area of expertise through either shared wisdom or experience or the difficulty said person might have in their area. The situations presented by them tend to be hit and miss but they usually are enjoyable enough for what they're trying to do and they tend to have some insight into them.\\n\\n\r\nIf you think you'd be frustrated by the lack of consequences the problems in the series, like the poor direction or the problems created by the staff itself, having little to no consequences to the overall quality on the series could be a hurdle for you, or the fact that the interpersonal relationships of the series being treated so casually is a really bad thing just like me, I can't recommend this series to you at all. But if you think some of the insight Shirobako might provide into the industry might be worth it, although I would suggest looking for some documentaries that might offer the same insight into the industry from real people talking about real experiences, you could have a look into it. As I've said, it does present some insightful situations and how people get over their own hurdles, which might be something you want. But I don't know if that would justify it as a good series for you, given it's possible you could get the same feedback from different sources. I managed to enjoy Shirobako enough to finish it and thought it was an okay enough experience, despite the hurdles, but I can see them being too much for other people as well.",

            "content": "Shirobako is a great and unique anime that tells the story that nobody elses try to made, its about the anime industry itself, how to make anime ? How many people are involve in it ? The intrique and the hectic situations that comes up from making anime. From that description alone, this anime could be the most boring anime or the most interesting anime, and i'm here to tell you that its the most interesting anime that i ever watched.\r\nFirst thing first, the story isn't like your typical anime story telling, the characters dilemma, problem, happiness its all told from a realistic view point,you can easily relate to the story and the characters because of this. The plot itself when it didn't focus on the characters, it focused on the anime making process, it teaches the viewer how to make anime, what are the roles, the dynamic relations between roles and how all of that is combine to make a team that is capable of making anime. It also told the viewers about the hardship of scheduling, how one failure could destroy the whole schedules, its very mature and i can see from the viewers perspective that this anime is made with love, PA Works (The production company that make this anime) love what they do and love every anime that they are making. Everything about this anime is oozes with love, even though some scene like the driving scene feels out of place because they feel the need to make it exciting at the cost of realistic, its just feels off when been compare to the realistic plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe character developments is great for some characters and really bad for some other characters. From the main characters, Miyamori, Ema, Zuka, Misa, and Midori, they all got good development, they all got a really realistic problem that really hits me personally, its about what do they want to do in life, what is their dream, and how can they achieve it. They all grow to appreciate themself and others in the course of the anime. The trip and hardship that they have to face to reach their dream is both really sad and exciting when they finally reached it. I cry with tears of joy when one of them finally reach her dream after soo much hardship and failure.\\n\\n\r\nFor some of the other characters though, some of them got 1 or even 2 episodes dedicated to they development as a characters, and some others only got a little bit of development or even none in the course of the anime. What i didn't like but totally understandable is that, its really hard to remember all the characters name since they put like 20 or more characters in the anime, i can't even remember some of the important side characters name because of this. They nearly did it right but putting the name up everytime we see them for the first time in an episode, but after episodes 7 or so they just didn't put the name up again.\\n\\n\r\nThe background art and the music is really beautiful and great, its really add to the whole experience as a whole, its one of the most beautiful background art that i ever seen from an anime with actual complex plot. The sound suit everything well, especially for the sad scene. The beautiful background music will makes you feel the scene more. The charaters art itself is pretty cute and cool, the variety on the male characters is really good to looks at. Theres's a fat guy, old guy, cool guy, normal skinny guy, and a lot more variety. But, i know why they decided this because anime viewers like cute girls but all the girls in the anime looks young and cute at the point where i don't know who is older than who most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nSoo.. Is it good ? Yes. It might not been the most fun anime out there, but if you want a unique realistic anime with a deep character development and beautiful art and music. I can even say its an educative anime. You would want to watch this.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThere exist two kinds of dreams. There are dreams that one has had and those that one has. The former are often nonsensical in nature. The latter are slightly more corporeal; it's a \"thing\" that one wants above all else. It might be a state of being or simply a set of objects. But whatever the dream might pertain to, it's important to not only strive for that dream but to also know what that dream is. For while they may be the most difficult part of your life to obtain, they're also the most rewarding.And as Shirobako demonstrates, sometimes those dreams have been around you all along.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nShirobako follows Miyamori, a new production assistant working for known animation company Musashino Animation. Alongside her friends Ema, Midori, Zuka, and Mii, Miyamori's skills start to be tested in the field she grew up loving so much.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough typically listed as a comedy and a drama, Shirobako is first and foremost a slice-of-life anime. Or more specifically a slice-of-work anime. It dabbles in certain sections that are normally considered regular for everyday people -- going to an amusement park, having meet-ups, and visiting old locations -- but what it does so wonderfully is use such ventures as backdrops for its focus. This focus is the aforementioned work. Shirobako divulges to its audience all of the inner workings of anime production. This cannot be stressed enough: any aspect of what goes into making anime is looked at. The creation of key frames, CG modeling, storyboard directing, field research, voice acting retakes, outsourcing, coloring, sound effect manipulation, source material collaboration, product delivery; nothing is left untouched by Shirobako. And in this way, the show is both unique and educational. The subject tackled has never really been done before; the majority of fans of this medium have always had a general idea of what goes down, but nothing as concrete as what this show provides. In this way, what is given is wholly knowledgeable, not just for the audience but for anyone looking to understand what exactly an anime is.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, it follows through with this theme of work by keeping everything entertaining. Normally when you think of someone's job, it's sitting in a cubicle, doing boring paperwork, and other menial tasks. Anime making contains these facets as well, but Shirobako never makes them its prime target and instead aims at showcasing all parts of what makes work have its name. There are those elated times when the cast are seeing progress, having a celebratory party, or simply enjoying the stuff they are participating in. But there are also those low moments with irritating coworkers, unhelpful messengers, and encroaching deadlines. By encompassing everything that work entails, rather than just honing in on the hard labor, the anime is able to maintain both a sense of realism and a sense of understanding.\\n\\n\r\nBut most important of all is one of Shirobako's greatest strengths: its theme of dreams. What the show is able to pull off remarkably well is something that it has already been doing, and that is show all sides to a particular motif. They do it with anime, they do it with work, and they do it once more here. Dreams come in all varieties, and may be exactly the same or wildly different when moving from person to person. Within the anime, this thinking is no different. There are those who are dreaming -- the Director dreams of repairing the reputation he built for himself, Midori dreams of writing a beautiful story, and Yano dreams of having her father in good health. There are those who accomplish their dreams -- Mii leaves her old job to pursue her dream and Honda retires to bake the cakes he has always wanted to. There are those who's dreams range in difficulty -- Zuka's dream of becoming a voice actress is brutal while Ema's is more guided due the support around her. And there are even different states to these dreams -- Miyamori isn't sure what her dream is whereas Hiraoka had his dreams crushed. Nearly every cast member has some relation to dreams -- Ogasawara dreams of getting better at key frames, Kunogi dreams of gaining self-esteem, Nogame doesn't want his dream shattered -- and while the show is rather optimistic in terms of how they play out, it nevertheless serves as a poignant example of the phrase \"dare to dream.\"\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nShirobako maintains its forward momentum as well with its art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style for the show not only has much detail but continues the trend of managing to grab as many parts of a particular subject as possible. This time, it is in the locations that are visited. Despite the anime revolving around Musashino Animation -- which itself has the animator's abode, production rooms, and \"jail closet\" -- there are a multitude of environments that are trekked. Pastoral landscapes, intercity offerings, older buildings, noodle dives, major company skyscrapers, personal apartments; the anime ceases to rest on its laurels, always looking to make the world feel dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are also incredibly well done. Miyamori's overalls, Midori's stars-and-stripes, Zuka's red hair, Ogasawara's gothic attire, and Yano's twin-tails are simultaneously anime and real looking. And the whole cast has the same vibe, with people being distinct but not overly unique. On top of this, some characters are even based on real-world counterparts, giving the show just one more step in the direction of realism.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation is also of top-notch quality. The use of CG is minimal, with characters seeing fantastic movement in all parts of their life, from drawing an in-between to holding a casual conversation. Faces are expressive, interactions are fluid, and other activities shy away from remaining static.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of characters attributed to Shirobako, like most major production companies, is massive. And while some may get a bit more spotlight than others, it wouldn't do most of them justice to talk about any of them individually -- with the exception of Miyamori, the main star of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhile in high school, Miyamori worked with her four closest friends to make an anime, sparking that creative gene within her. Thus she went down the road of becoming a producer within the medium. But the show starts with her in a slump, seemingly annoyed by the work she is doing, and not being as happy-go-lucky as she was back in the day. In essence, she's unsure of her position, if the path she has chosen is the one right for her. Yet, she continues down this road, experiencing the many sides to anime and the many people related to the process. She undergoes stress, happiness, sadness, anxiousness; an emotional hurricane absorbs her through it all, just as any work place would. But more than this, she gets to learn from the lives of the friends around her. Seeing Ookura's passion for hand-drawn backgrounds, reliving Masato's past, and witnessing the beautiful moment when Zuka finally got the break she deserved were events that were individually promising but collectively special. And by the end of the show, Miyamori is no longer unsure about herself; rather, she is a dreamer, fully realizing that she's always loved anime and the people behind it. That this is where she belongs.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the rest of the cast in the general sense, they, too, offer their own perspectives. Each cast member is characterized in a specific manner -- Iguchi is playful, Andou is carefree, and Katsuragi is always worried -- making them have their own respective ways of dealing with the situations they find themselves in. Some even see personal growth despite the large amount of people involved -- Ema, Midori, Zuka, and Mii fall into this category. But most of all, everyone represents a specific work personality. Tarou is the fool, Sugie is the older veteran, Segawa is the hard worker, Satou is the newcomer, and Chazawa is the insufferable jerk. These are quick examples, but it gets the point across; people, like the anime that is worked on, come in all shapes and sizes. Being able to cooperate with them, respect them, and most important of all understand them goes a long way towards making work life that much easier. Many can be your friends, a few might be your enemies, but at the end of the day, they're your family. A family that, through thick and thin, bands together to help one another, to make the best of any situation, and create everlasting memories that one won't soon forget. And for Shirobako, such a family couldn't be more connected.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP is a good track that begins with the female vocalist working in tandem with the piano and drums. The halfway point slows down slightly, with the singer bringing about some catchy lyrical singing. As it nears its end, the track continues being playful, with the back-and-forth beat and singing.\\n\\n\r\nThe second OP starts off a bit weaker, with more simple beat and singing. But it starts to morph into a more hopeful song, with background singers coming in, and chimes being utilized at just the right moments. The singer can have particularly catchy parts at times, but the real winner is the beginning and ending instrument that gives the piece its signature sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ED is Shirobako's first real blemish. It doesn't seem to have the same amount of effort put into it, when compared to the music and everything else. The unified singing is alright, the drum beat is okay, and the ending \"love letter\" is fine for what it is. The track screams mediocre, and doesn't hold a candle to what the rest of the show has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nBut the second ED does an about-face; it's a fantastic track. It opens with a semi-techno beat and chimes, which leads into a good bout of singing. The beat continues, until the halfway point, where the real magic begins. It's a simple \"la-loo-la-loo-la\" but one can't help but to sing along. The tone, the onomatopoeia, and interjected vocals in-between make it an absolutely enjoyable piece both inside and outside the anime. And just for good measure, the animation associated with it is something that only Shirobako could do.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also nicely done, by perfectly capturing that everyday work feel. It contains more float-y pieces that calm the mind, slower piano-and-ambient ones for the more emotional scenes, and more trumpet-filled tracks for faster-paced, high-stakes \"action.\" They're a good set of tunes that work in parallel with what Shirobako presents.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as voice-acting is concerned, those involved perform above-average within their respective roles. Special shout-outs are in order for the main cast -- Juri Kimura as Miyamori, Haruka Yoshimura as Ema, Hitomi Ohwada as Midori, Haruka Chisuga as Zuka, and Asami Takano as Mii -- for being relative newbies in the field of anime yet dishing out such splendid performances.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThe show could actually be quite comedic when it wanted to be, usually when introducing the quite unrealistic scenes that would pop up from time to time. The Director's \"belly arts\" moves, Kunogi's extreme shyness, and Tarou's nonchalant walk into a brawl at the company are specific instances that stick out in my mind as being quite hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in true anime fashion, many of the women within the show are quite cute, too. Midori's determination, Ema's caring nature, and Yano's intelligence are quite attractive. The girls' specific traits, coupled with the fact that this is an anime centered on adults, made this one that much more pleasing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako's triumph isn't necessarily in its diverse cast of characters, slick art, or catchy music. No, what it champions is the subject it tackles. At this point others have already said it, and I agree with them: this is a show all anime fans need to see at least once. For now instead of dreaming about how your favorite anime was made, you simply need to stop by Musashino Animation and witness it first hand, while gaining some valuable life experiences along the way.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, educational look into anime, work-filled but entertaining, and \"dare to dream\"\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, nice art style, great character designs, above-average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Miyamori finds her dream, with the rest of her \"family\" supporting her\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good first OP, good second OP, bad first ED, great second ED, good soundtrack, above-average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, quite funny, cute women, and a show that every anime fan needs to see\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "I didn't expect to like this show as much as i did. Shirobako is a show about the production of anime, which makes it an anime... About anime. That doesn't sound very interesting at first right? WRONG. What lies beneath the simple nature of its plot is a well constructed, brilliantly executed masterpiece with lovable characters that ends up being an eye opening experience overall. Allow me to elaborate.\r\nThe show stars a group of girls who grow up to work in the production of anime, though the main focus is Miyamori, and most episodes show her many struggles in the industry. The first arc revolvesaround the production of an original anime while the second one is about adapting manga. This way they are able to show how two very different production cycles work.\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts off very slow, to the point where the main reason i kept going through the first few episodes were the characters, whom i fell in love with. They feel so alive, you want to see them triumph, which is what kept me going. However, once the show starts getting good, it gets really freking good, like, so-good-it-literally-hurts-to-stop-watching good\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are lovable and relatable while still managing to be their own thing, the story is great and being able to see what it takes to make an anime show is fantastic, even if part of what's shown is fiction. The only complaint i had is that the OST isn't really that memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThis show isn't perfect, but it comes pretty darn close, and for that i believe it deserves a 10. A 10 shouldn't be for flawless shows, because such thing doesn't exist, but for anime that do as good as humanly possible, and Shirobako hits that mark for me. I consider it a must watch for anime fans.\\n\r\nIt can be comedy, it can be tragedy, this show does everything and it does it right.",

            "content": "Do you like anime? Of course you do, otherwise you wouldn't be on this website and reading this review. Shirobako really hooked me in with the first few episodes. I've already watched it twice and it doesn't get any worse. As one of the millions of avid anime fans out there in the world, Shirobako allows me and others to glance into the production stages of anime and how everything gets mashed up together to build our 22 minute long joy. Through Shirobako, I realized that making an anime that is on par and awesome is painstakingly difficult. Every member of the anime staff islike a cog in the machine and everything is organized by the production staff. You also learn the multiple stages and steps it takes for at least one scene. However, Shirobako is not simply an anime that shows simply details about the anime stages, but it also gives an amazing plot.\\n\\n\r\nIf you read the synopsis, then you know that 5 girls enter the anime business from different areas: Production, animator, 3-D animator, voice acting, and script writer. However, the story mainly focuses around Miyamori Aoi, who is part of the production staff of a studio. She has her own set of struggles besides the ones she receives by being part of the production staff. Her issues are genuine and maybe reflective of what some people feel like in their actual real jobs in the real world. Additionally, the struggles that the studio faces with the anime they are producing seems real and not at all fake. The life of the production staff is not clean and nice, and everyday there is always a problem. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the content of Shirobako tend to be serious, the anime has a variety of comedic scenes. Miyamori has these two dolls who discuss the serious issues in a comedic routine and of course, this is in her head. The dolls mostly are used to explain the specific details and phrases that the anime production world uses. SPOILER. There is a scene with one of Miyamori's friend and she does this cute dance, and it is things like these that make me laugh and enjoy the anime. Anyway, there are a lot of funny scenes to look forward to in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe most amazing part of the anime is that the studio is making an anime inside an anime. It's like when you see a movie that is about making a movie. However, it is much more impressive with an anime since you have to draw everything and have a new set of sounds, and art. It simply amazes how Shirobako manages to make the anime look good and have all the art be laid out for us to see. I mean it just looks so damn good and very hard to do. Just watch and you'll know what I'm talking about. You will ask, \"How do they do that???\"\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters are lovable except for one guy, and you will know who that is once you see the first episode. You also will start to want the 5 girls to fulfill their dream one day. Then wishing for a second season because this anime is simply just awesome and eye-opening.",

            "content": "*MINUTE SPOILERS FOR SHIROBAKO*\r\nAnime is an interesting medium. Critics, fans, news spreaders, forums, directors, studios, products, songs, and animators. All of them exist in other mediums, and some exist in all entertainment mediums, but they all exist here, and this is obviously, a rich and interesting medium. The thing is, we tend to only really know the news of the anime, some the people working on the anime, and the final result that airs on tv. We never really get to see the real ins and outs of it unless we study in those fields, which many of us here won't. It seems Studio P.A.Works realized that as well and decided to make an anime that can teach us a bit of what goes into making our favorite shows. Did it teach us some valuable lessons on the industry while still being an entertaining and satisfying experience? Of course! Then again, chances are, you're not here to find out that part. You're probably wondering why. Well, I guess it's my turn to give it a go, so if you are one of those people, then let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of 24 episodes, we get to see Musashino animation work on two interesting anime while dealing with loads of bumps on the road. One such member is Aoi Miyamori, leader of the anime club her 4 other friends were in during high school, the group consisting of: Aoi, Zuka, Ema, Midori, and Misa. The 5 of them take versions jobs in the anime industry, and suffer stress trying to find their place and in some cases, suffering stress trying to make it out there. Their paths are separate while working on the first anime, Exodus, but most of their paths converge when working on Third Aerial Girls Squad, until towards the end, Zuka manages to land a role for the series. We get to see the ups and downs of not just these 5 girls, but everyone working on the two anime series over the course of 2 years. Each end to an arc (the arc being the production of one of the 2 anime) is satisfying in their own right, especially due to the sheer amount of anime references that increase the more each arc nears the climax. We also get to learn a bit about key-animation, CGI, voice acting, adaptation,  editing, and so many other things that can really benefit someone trying to learn a bit about the inner workings of an anime. As for the last two episodes, they get absurdly over the top, but have some of the most satisfying and heart-warming moments in the series, like Ali crying when she hears Zuka reading her lines for Third Aerial Girls Squad, and the celebration of the anime's completion. It's not just educating us on anime, it's also giving us engaging and interesting stories with loads of references to real life studios, anime, and directors. Not to mention that the ending is great.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAoi is a bit nervous and friendly but assertive at the same time, all of which are shown in full display during production, and she is a really pleasant protagonist to follow. Shizuka and Ema are usually friendly and upbeat, but get a bit down due to circumstances regarding their work, especially Shizuka until her insanely emotionally resonant big payoff at the end of episode 23.. Midori gets inspired by the other girls and eventually becomes the most diligent of them all. Misa is also friendly, but eventually wants something more out of her job as a CG animator. I'm sorry for these shallow descriptions, but putting them into descriptions is a bit hard given how real they feel at times. Sure, Ema gets needlessly melodramatic at times, but we still care about the girls' endeavors, and that's partly due to these guys...\\n\\n\r\nThere is a gigantic cast of characters that work at Musashino and other studios, so I'll have to be a bit brief. Tarou is a bumbling idiot akin to the likes of Tamaki from Code Geass, but can still pull through here and there, and even has a pretty fun drunk scene with Daisuke. Seiichi and Honda are nervous wrecks that have to really pull through via pain in order for things to work at times given their flaws. Daisuke is a pessimist with terrible mindset of getting things done and nothing more: the mindset that allows works like Mahouka and Blazblue Alter Memory to spawn (not that I'm still angry about those series or anything), but we get to see just what horrible assholes pushed him that way, in the aforementioned really great drunk scene with Tarou, who often bugs hum about being buddies. So many of these characters have their own unique quirks, and are pretty fun to see, even if a lot of them butt heads, all except for Ai; she's annoying, and that's all I'm going to say about her botched attempt st a mute and shy character. They still can get work done when it gets down to the wire, no matter what he'll they go through in the process. Seiichi even gloriously goes to see the creator of the second anime and takes down the chronies that block his path, including that asshole \"funny story\" guy who keeps wrecking what they try to do by never doing his job right and being a pain in the dick. Hell, we get personified imaginations of a girl doll and a polar bear to entertain us and represent Aoi's thoughts occasionally. Talking about all of them will be daft given the given cast, but they're endearing and diverse, and all have at lest one moment in the spotlight, like Endou in episode 8 after his arc about trying to quit his position on Exodus. Also, try to guess which ones have real world parallels. I'll give you a hint. One of them is a reference to Hideaki Anno.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nStudio P.A. Works did a great job with this series. The animation during the normal scenes generally looks good, but the visual flares really kick in during the OPs and EDs, including some Ufotable level lighting. ED2 has it the best, with a packet that alerts which version of ED2 is being animated. Not to say that the animation in general isn't great, but it really stands out in the OPs and EDs. I love when they get into shading and coloring, and other animation moments since as you can no doubt guess, they do a great job at showing that. Why wouldn't they.It's a treat to be sure. Now if only the CGI were as good it kinda falters occasionally, but can still be decently done other times, like with the cars that are always speeding, and no, I will not dock points for the purposely clunky CGI in the CGI testing scenes since again, they were supposed to look like how bad CGI looks in anime. Regardless, it's a very pleasant show to look at, especially when they do such a great job at illustrating Re anime process, literally speaking of course.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOP 1 \"Colorful Box by Yoko Ishida\" is an extremely charming OP, and is a perfect way to draw you into the series. It screams pleasantness, putting a smile on my face every time. OP 2 \"Treasure Box by Masami Okui\" isn't as good brbis still a nice OP. Never thought I'd hear the accordion in an anime OP. ED 1 isn't anything special at all though. ED 2, Platinum Jet, was actually preformed by the seyuus of the 5 main girls, and is amazing. It is beyond pleasant, and is perfect to cheer yourself up to during night time, and is course, it's very catchy as well. Like Gurren Lagann's second ED, this was what convinced me that I really loved the show even more than i thought I did. The rest of the OST isn't anything noteworthy aside from a few moments here and there (like the song hat plays in the final scene of episode 23), but it works decently enough for what we got. Also, the Andes Chucky theme is catchy for me. Shaddup.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a very immersive show for me, so much so that at points, the scenes where characters get super stressed stress me out as well. I mostly grew out of that though,  it tenimmersik was still their, as each moment of relief for the characters was a relief for me, as the troubles were over for now. Each success was satisfying, especially the finale. Also, that scene in episode 23 with Aoi and Zuka was so heart-warming, especially when Aoi cried. I enjoyed the humor as well, and don't even get me started in the references, like the Studio Sunrise reference, the Hideaki Anno reference, or the Mariyama reference. I kept belly-laughing at some of those references, and believe me, there's a lot of them.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10    RAW SCORE: 8.68/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely an impressive and engrossing series to be sure. It teaches us some valuable things about anime while giving us some great stories and characters to get invested in. The references can be a real treat to almost anyone who has seen his fair share of anime and has some knowledge about certain studios and directors in the industry. This is easily recommendable to any anime fan, especially a seasoned veteran. Hell, show it to your local anime club if you have one, since it teaches a few things about the behind the scenes about anime. I'm sure it'll be worth it for the pleasant characters and amazing payoffs alone. Well, with all that said. I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "P.A Works has always been a company that reliably releases anime that keeps a consist quality of some sort, but when it came to the Summer season of 2014, Glasslip was a huge disappointment for the company, and for the fans. Yet, the season right after, Fall 2014, P.A Works took the initiative to air an anime to show the behind the scenes of creating just what the fans wait for. Isn't it amazing how anime has come so far to the point of releasing everything on a schedule of seasons and for fans to enjoy with a connection that is created through an industrythat's fairly new? The staff behind a \"legendary\" anime, or one that someone may enjoy, can be overlooked, but it wouldn't be the same without them, and Shirobako goes to show that.\\n\\n\r\nIf speaking about Shirobako, you're given two ways to approach the anime and its message to the audience. In one hand, it could be seen as a SoL type of anime just following 5 ambitious girls pursuing their ideals of the anime industry after their animation club in high school got them interested. But in the other, Shirobako can be seen as a message to the audience of fighting the obstacles in life that chain down dreams and making them realistic through hard work and dedication. The under-lying theme of that end goal is a quality that can be overlooked in the anime with all the subtle jabs at the concept, but it ultimately kept the anime together. Numerous examples of dreams can be seen throughout the 24 episodes from characters talking about what got them into the industry, to their wisdom coming in hand when the new comers are having a slump or break down and experience is all that is needed. The staff in the series are often imagining their anime character's coming to life when in a hard time, or speaking about the future, which can be a personification of the hard work put into creating them and the pay off when finished. \\n\\n\r\nAn odd quality that many people don't consider is the setting it has: young adult life. It seems as if many studios today are afraid of moving away from the typical high school setting and expanding on the adult life that many people are realistically having trouble dealing with. Without a doubt, the series does not hold back on the importance of keeping the job that the characters are currently holding. Countless times are the characters speaking about needing to provide food on the table to keep them alive with the job, and competition becoming more stiff as times are changing. 3D CGI vs hand drawn animation, lost in trust after massive blow out of production, the seemingly simple animation that we view actually has a intricate process behind it. Failures aren't taken lightly, as we view a studio going out of business, a voice actor struggling to get a role and debut, the industry isn't filled with rainbows and sunshine as some perceive it as. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of anime display the trope of characters being \"prodigies\" at a certain task, such as drawing or intellect, but the characters here display nothing of the sort. That doesn't mean they're talent-less, but rather, hard working and experienced. At one point in the show, Ema is having a roadblock in her creativity and art style, she's uncertain of how to approach it. It interferes with her work and shatters her confidence. The other artists assist in her issue and proclaim they've all been at that point, it's just a matter if she can find her muse to get out of it, or crash and burn. This alone creates a connection that many more people can enjoy as the series progresses through the trials and tribulations that they all face, knowing they weren't handed the job by talent alone while being fed with a silver spoon. \\n\\n\r\nWhen referring to the characters of the anime, it's amazing how only five of them are labeled as \"main character\", yet each individual one seem to make an impact that goes past the typical \"side character\" trope. All of them seemingly have the qualities that could take over and become the main focus at any moment, given the situation, but even without doing so, they have just enough air time to distinguish themselves from any stereotypical \"regular\" character that is in recent anime. Although some of them do make more of an impact than others, they're all equally needed completing a beautiful mural. To give light of some impressions and impact of the characters, some will be reviewed.\\n\\n\r\n\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f \\n\r\n\"I kept remembering when I was being interviewed, and it's depressing\". - Miyamori, Aoi. \\n\\n\r\nMiyamori, Aoi is the prime focus of the \"main characters\", as I would say, and definitely a realistic character. When she enters the industry, she's unsure about where she wants to pursue, unlike her co-workers. For example, her friend Ema has chosen the Artist path, Midori wants to become a Script writer, Shizuka strives to become a voice actor, and Misa wants to create 3D art. In more ways than not, Aoi is a character that many people can relate to, myself included. Her worry about a career and choosing a path is often taking over her outlook on things and indirectly steers her to be where she is now. Though her realism is quite stellar, it's her development that seems to be the biggest trait there is to offer. At the start of her job she's only a production assistant. Constantly making mistakes, apologizing to everybody, and even has a history of being denied job interviews from other studios. But throughout the entire 24 episodes, we witness what experience and support does to a person. Aoi becomes a person who's illuminating ambition as opposed to the wavering fragile girl she once was. The quote selected from her displays when she's put into a situation that requires her to become someone of high importance in the production team, and is constantly reminded of her failures, but overcomes her past to lead the studio she was accepted into.\\n\\n\r\n\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f \"\\n\r\n\"Well, I want to exceed the expectations, without betraying them\". - Kinoshita \"Director\" Seichii. \\n\\n\r\nThe director is an interesting character, as his overall personality seems to be more \"have fun doing your job\", rather than the serious tyrant. Throughout the series you learn that he's actually a person who has directed other anime in the past, but one bad mistake ended up ruining his image as a director, and ultimately his image in the industry. He has many philosophies in his work that can push him to become over the top to some staff members and to the audience, but in his mind, he's a child at heart. It's the free spirit that he has while also being able to take his own responsibility when times get tough that make him reliable. Whether it be his childish approach to getting around work or motivating ideals when beginning to actually do work, the director is a character that is used a comedy relief factor, yet impacts more than that. A fan of anime that stays true to what the audience wants, even if it has to stray from the creator's, a trait that seems to set himself apart from the other directors that appear throughout the run time. \\n\\n\r\n\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f \\n\r\n\"I'm excited, too. No matter how long I've been doing this, the feeling I get when I see my drawings move... There are no words\". - Iguchi, Yumi. \\n\\n\r\nYumi is just one of many examples in the anime that show experience is everything. While not being one of the highest known artists in the industry, she's enough to keep the art department going to motivate and help them out when in need. When Ema was in her road block to clear her mind of troubles, Yumi gives her advice that she actually got while she was in the same situation and is more of a figure of assistance. Although there are many characters that are in the same role as her, she becomes an individual as the series progresses to set herself apart and really show what she has to offer to the entire staff and audience watching. \\n\\n\r\n\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\\n\r\nFor a studio like P.A Works to produce an anime about animating, art would be a pretty big factor in itself to keep the concept of how hard it is to create one running. Luckily enough, P.A has never failed to produce great art that has their own style that indicates it's their studio, yet Shirobako has the detail and attention that goes beyond what they usually do. It's amazing how they capture the idea of producers and staff members as just usual people by the snip of their home and office space. Little figures of characters, a family to go back home to when done with work, over sleeping, nothing is left out in a way that focuses entirely on art detail, but also detail in life. As for the sound department, we actually even got to see how certain sounds are made in the anime, and by the looks of it, technology has come a long way, but making them right on the spot seems more enjoyable. In all honesty, sound probably isn't too notable in a series such as this, though not because it wasn't clicking together, but because of it's eccentric focus on the characters. Although, \"COLORFUL BOX\" has definitely become a piece that never gets old when watching. \\n\\n\r\nWhile a facade is created to follow 5 girls and their quest to impact the anime industry together, Shirobako is much more than that. It's a present to the anime industry and audience of hard work and enjoyment for all ages. There was no melodramatic theme to plague the series and create hard feelings to connect with, but rather a realistic approach to almost every aspect that can be experienced by adults. Rooting the foundations of creating an anime and centering it around that may seem strange, but it's a ride to experience once beginning. It's more than what it may seem like; fitting the saying \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" has never been more true.",

            "content": "Sunlight desperately pours through the windows of Kaminoyama High School's Animation Club, illuminating only the figures of five girls with nothing but donuts in hand. An unmistakable tension fills the air, yet a short battle cry ensures it's tainted by the faintest hint of commitment --  one that will hopefully lead those present to their dreams. \r\nCut to the same window drenched in rain, zooming out to reveal the same five (Ema, Zuka, Midori, Misa, and Miyamori) slaving away at their club's OVA in the shadows. Don't be mistaken by the gloominess of the scene, as it's clear\r\n their demeanour has changed: a glowof passion fills the girls' newly-inspired eyes as they discuss their lives and futures throughout the summer. Outside, even a wilted sunflower  cracks a sly smile. At graduation, the five girls promise to work together on an anime again, but this time their donuts are raised in pride. What is it that awaits them out there? \\n\\n\r\nAll of this happens within the first five minutes of the series, and it'd be hard to keep track of without some commendable observation skills. Mizushima is known for his extreme (and bizarre) attention to detail, but Shirobako brings this to a whole new level, all the while remaining funny, thrilling, and providing an experience all too heartwarming.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline is made up of two intertwining conflicts; one follows Musashino Animation's production troubles, where Ema also works, and the other focuses on Midori, Zuka, and Misa trying to find a job in the industry. The former is clearly more interesting, as aside from Miyamori, the other girls only serve as a backbone; their struggles are interesting to watch, but they're never really given much individuality, instead only differentiated by their career paths. Two of the main five don't really get enough time in the spotlight, and it's a little bothersome given how vital they are to the story. It does seem more due to time constraints than writing problems, however, as how they're executed is still somewhat meaningful. Some may even find their being pushed aside to be a nice thing because of how relatively boring they are. \\n\\n\r\nBy relatively, I mean that the blunders of the main characters are made up for by an excellent supporting cast, consisting of anime staff from multiple studios, new hires, and freelance individuals. They're the source of a lot of the story's progression and humour, but also its intensity. Much like in real life, not everyone you encounter is flawless or friendly, and they're always prone to butt heads with others. A somewhat simple office bickering can lead to verbal infighting, or even escalate to some physical violence. It's not something that happens often, and it's not abused to the point in which it becomes ineffective; it's as shocking and scary to see as it would be to any employee. Even the more distant or obnoxious of the staff have some substance or reason to their rude behaviour, and it's pretty much all explained by the end of the run, creating some gratifying character development for one and all.\\n\\n\r\nA more unconventional aspect of this anime is its intelligent use of lighting, as I touched upon earlier. Even the fluorescent lights of an office gleam upon the squeaky-clean walls that surround them, and different areas keep vastly different atmospheres -- you begin to feel and understand the area without needing to be there. For example, the cozy orange sheen of a pub is rightfully unlike the frigid mess that may lie outside. Instead, it's more reminiscent of a scene in one of the homes Miyamori may visit. Shirobako's art itself follows suit, with frames as carefully detailed as those created by Musashino. In fact, you'll end up seeing a lot of their anime while it's still a work in progress.  Everything from key animation to CGI is shown as it's constructed, and while it may be messy, it's an oddly charming way of displaying a fictional artist's hard work. I'm not as much a fan of the character designs, because while extremely nice, they're more or less on the safe side. Women in the show are largely more attractive than their male counterparts, which would usually be fine by me, but I find the characters are strong enough to make it unnecessary. To put it more bluntly, it sometimes feels that Shirobako relies too heavily on its more conventional appearance, and it lowered my expectations before watching.\\n\\n\r\nAlso unexpectedly, its sound goes on to impress. The seiyuus of the main five were all very unpopular prior to the show, but it gave them all a chance to make their big breaks. Famous voice actors are given smaller roles in the show, and Zuka's struggle as a newbie seiyuu could be seen as a commentary on why this choice was made. There are four main theme songs, obviously, and each is greatly uplifting -- from soaring piano harmonies in  Colorful Box to the simple yet catchy dance refrain of Platinum Jet, there's likely something to appeal to everyone. Even the background music is nice, but it doesn't tend to impress out of context. Not really a huge problem, I suppose. \\n\\n\r\nWhile definitely something that works best altogether, this is an anime that is just good in every aspect. It may not excel at one particular thing, but I probably wouldn't have it any other way; it seems a testament to the show's overall theme of hard work, and I'm more than satisfied with that. There are very few anime that I've enjoyed watching more, and funny story: this is the first time I've felt such a strong urge to vocalize my love for one. So despite what you may think of its appearance or synopsis, I urge you to experience it for yourself. I almost never watched Shirobako, and I still scold myself for that.",

            "content": "Shirobako is an anime about making anime. It portrays virtually every aspect of anime production with excellent detail, from the research and writing of a story, to the administrative operations and planning, to the making of 2D and 3D frames, to the animation process, to the voice acting and related auditions, to the sound effects and music recordings, to miscellaneous artistic contributions throughout the production. Sounds like a mouthful? You bet it is, and Shirobako has this tendency of cramming so much information in that your head will be spinning whether you paid full attention or not. But that's not all. Technical operations is onlyhalf the picture; the other half is much more universal to all work environments and industries: human relationships, interactions, and work-related issues. We're not dealing with robots that do all their jobs perfectly and on time; we're talking about people who get lazy, angry, demotivated, emotional, stressed out, make mistakes, and have other things in life to deal with besides their soul-crushing jobs. We're working with artists, each with their own aspirations, troubles, and outlooks on their careers. Not everyone is satisfied with their job, and heck, not everyone has a job. This is all taken into account in Shirobako's comprehensive look at the anime industry. \\n\\n\r\nYet with all that, I've only scratched the surface of what Shirobako has to offer. The real heart of the show is in its characterizations, conveyed piece-by-piece in a rich narrative of powerful, heartfelt character moments. We are shown the traps of getting caught in the daily doldrums of work life, with characters losing sight of the initial passion that motivated them to join the industry in the first place. We are shown harsh disillusionment, as characters realize that their dreams are either not as wonderful as they originally thought, or straight-up unattainable. We are shown that in anything the characters do, there will always be someone who does their job better, faster, and seemingly with less effort to boot. That talent is absolutely a thing. That luck is absolutely a thing. That effort without proper direction gets you nowhere, but effort with direction still only gets you so far. \\n\\n\r\nYet while Shirobako is unreserved in conveying these cold, hard truths, it never stops being an optimistic show. A beautiful poignancy is achieved whenever an industry veteran manages a light smile in recounting their earnest, yet tumultuous pasts. An inspiring piece is made whenever two quarreling characters settle their differences in a rekindling of passion. Whenever one character helps another with their artistic or professional troubles, that act of compassion is always nicely reflected in later episodes, whether that help is reciprocated, applied to great effect, or even passed on to the next generation of creators. And even as our characters get humiliated, beaten, and put down by their troubles, they continue onward. They push forth. They grow. Not everyone makes it, and those that do will always be plagued with stress and setbacks, but it's the fact that they put a genuine effort towards their passions that matters. Even for those with aimless direction, it's to continue working, creating, and helping others that they find a purpose. And at the end of the day, there will always be someone cheering them on in the background and giving them support. Understated moments like when Aoi's parents call Aoi to tell her how excited they were to see her name in the ending credits does wonders in bringing everything down to earth.  \\n\\n\r\nAs shown, Shirobako is ridiculously good at crafting characters from its flurry of scenes and subtleties, and substantiating a cast of over 50 named characters. How many of these characters have great scenes, distinctive personalities, and endearing quirks to attribute to their face (because I suck at remembering Japanese names)? In a rough count, I got at least 7 directors/producers/administrators, 8 animators and artists, 5 production assistants, and 4 miscellaneous roles. Do the math; it's absolutely nuts! \\n\\n\r\nThe show also performs extremely well in its command of tone and general storytelling. It balances a fast-paced, detail-filled story with a burgeoning and competent character cast so effectively, when it sounds like it'd be a horrid mess on paper. The ever-stressful environment of Musani Animations is complemented by sharp, slick comedy, constantly making me tense with anxiety over the characters' mounting troubles, followed by some scenes so hilarious they have ZeroHumor doubled over in laughter. With its many character moments, Shirobako maintains powerful heartwarm colored with poignancy throughout its course, as it balances its realism perfectly with its idealism. It's also worth noting that realism itself isn't Shirobako's aim; rather, it is to convey something meaningful within its realistic ideas and emotions that truly matters. Yes, Shirobako has talking dolls, exaggerated drag racing, and dream-like visions. But none of that detracts from what is real about this show, and what is truly significant: the passions and pursuits of art, the emotions in dealing with stress, and everything that makes this show extraordinary. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Shirobako proves to be an extremely well-written show. I was frankly shocked when I saw that this was an anime-original work, considering just how seamlessly this show flows from point to point, from theme to theme, from episode to episode. It's a really immersive experience, endowed with its outstanding cast of characters, engaging subject matter, competent storytelling, and filled to the brim with its own passion. You can clearly see just how much this work resonates with its own creators, and in turn, how much it emotionally resonates with its audience. It's one of the best, if not the best of 2014.",

            "content": "I like to eat cake, but that doesn't mean I am interested on learning the process of cake-baking. Safe to say the same theory applies to anime. If you're here on this site, then chances are high that you watch animes, and you love them.\r\nBut that doesn't mean an average anime viewer would want to be bothered with learning and understanding how an anime series is made, as long as we get to enjoy the final product, who cares?\r\nWhich is why Shirobako is such an entertaining watch. It manages to juggle around explaining the basic procedures of anime production, at the same time featuring agreat balance between comedy and drama to ensure that viewers are constantly hooked. The recipe is just right.\\n\\n\r\nRevolving around the tale of the five female leads who made their vow during their highschool days, we are told of the struggles they faced in the anime industry. Each of them ventured into vastly different roles: Aoi manages to land into the production line, Ema with her great drawing skills naturally plied her trade in animation, while Mika contributes by making CGs. And so and so. \\n\\n\r\nIn between them, we are also shown a myriad cast of characters with their respective roles in anime production. We have the goofy and enthusiastic director Kinoshita, the animation director Endou who doesn't really approve of the usage of CGs, the president of MusAni Marukawa who always provide mental support to his employees with his great cooking skills etc etc. Despite the huge cast, they are fleshed out sufficiently and will most often ended up being memorable and lovable. \\n\\n\r\nBeing a two-cour show, we are treated with the production of two anime shows by MusAni, one for each cour. It is truly an exciting ride often riddled by suspense and tension during the production process, with many different crisis popping out here and there to disrupt the otherwise smooth sailing. Watching how the crew of MusAni pull themselves together and made it all the way is undeniably satisfying and touching, it is not easy to hold up tears of joy as you celebrate together with the production crew when they succeeded in finishing an entire anime series. \\n\\n\r\nBesides having anime production as the main theme of the show, Shirobako also frequently entices viewers with what it takes to excel in a workforce. Is having an interest simply enough? Perseverance? The ability to notice and grab the opportunity when it presents itself? What will you do when things aren't going as you wanted? How would you stand up and face your challenges? So in the end, Shirobako does provide tons of moral values and inspirations for its viewers. Which is always something I like in an anime show. \\n\\n\r\nProduced by PA Works, you can expect high quality animation throughout the show. The buildings featured in the show are based off the real life locations found in Japan, and the amount of detail present in the backgrounds are amazing, for instance the dilapidated and neglected working room of Studio Taitanic really captured the glooming atmosphere lingering within. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs? Nothing that I can complain of. We have people from various ages joining in the fray, some are fresh into the working force with their innocent and naive look,  while some are seasoned veterans with grey hair and wrinkles around. We also have fat people around so it's quite realistic in a sense that most animes featured perfect and unrealistic bodies in them.\\n\\n\r\nI believe in order to convey the right emotions to the viewers, the music has to play a very important role, otherwise what supposed to be an intense scene filled with feels will be falling terribly flat. Thankfully, Shirobako manages to pull this one off very well, and the viewers will easily suffer an anxiety attack at the crisis scene; an adrenaline rush during a \"resolution\" scene; as well as shedding tears during the tear-jerking moments. \\n\\n\r\nNot much comment on the voices, as I think all of them portrayed their character well. It is always nice to see how the seiyuus in the show performing their different voices appropriate to the roles they are given. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a truly enjoyable watch. Perhaps the heavy jargon and slightly fast pacing in the first three episodes might turn some viewers off. But fear not, as the pacing eventually slows down and you will find yourself familiarize with the animation jargon pretty quickly.",

            "content": "Allow me to do a little intro, I have a friend working as an animator in an anime company and often did I heard that he would go home earliest by 2am or even 6am. I had no idea what dragged him from work but this anime cleared my curiosity.\r\nShirobako focuses on a group of five girls who were once members of an animation club getting together to produce an anime for their school festival. Soon after graduation, they dreamed that they would one day produce an anime together. And thus, the real plot begins. The story focuses the working environment of an anime companywhere the MC is working at.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does a magnificent job in explaining the steps and procedures on how an anime is produced. Beginning from the process of writing a storyboard to the step whereby it is delivered to radio station, it might not be very detailed but it is very sufficient enough to give us viewer a general idea on what's going on behind the scenes of the anime we watched today. \\n\\n\r\nApart from it being educational, the gem of this anime lies behind the characters development. The number of characters in this anime is quite enormous and almost most of them had made an appearance in episode 1. Sure enough I did not remember all of them but a few episodes later, I can roughly know them better. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the main point, the anime mentioned about the characters' pasts, fears, problems etc. Some with a depressing past, some facing with a bad situation in present, some with an aimless dream. Though the anime is fiction but all these are totally reflections of our reality. If I have to pick on a theme where the anime pay a lot of attention to, I would say \"dream\". From the anime you could see various characters (which sometimes reflects people around us) with different reasons of being in the anime industry, different objectives at the end of the road, different interests etc. And to add on, the anime also showed how did those characters work on achieving what they dream to be. Filling with element of surprise and emotions, the developments are very well delivered to the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nNext, climax. You don't need to have an extraordinary action or a tear-jerking drama to have climax into an anime. Even an anime as simple as showing the working environment could also provide tensions to the viewers. I'm not gonna spoil but all I could say that even though there isn't much climax, its a key element worth mentioning as I find them quite exciting!\\n\\n\r\nAlright, a short summary, Shirobako is a comedy, slice-of-life anime which centers around an anime industry with 5 friends dreaming to be together working on an anime. I apologized for not mentioning details like the art or sound as the other elements have brought my attention away. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR version: As a whole, I seriously enjoy this and if you are viewing this page wondering whether you should give it a try, then I will say to just go on ahead. Don't turn a blind eye on this or you'll miss a great series!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER: I love donuts too. :D",

            "content": "\"Don-Don donuts!  Let's go nuts!\" - Aoi, Ema, Midori, Shizuka, Misa\r\nShirobako is a wonderfully charming anime about five friends that make a promise to each other in highschool.  They promise that they will live out their life-long dream of making anime together, and the show follows them along their intertwined journey towards that goal and all the trials and tribulations that come with it.  It's an anime about making an anime.\r\nOn the surface that doesn't sound like a very interesting premise, and to be honest, I went into this show thinking it was going to be very bland and uninspired, but boywas I wrong.  This show, simply put, is a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako has a massive ensemble cast that can at times make your head spin, yet by the end of the show, you feel like you know them all and what makes each of them tick.  More importantly, you come to love and respect them all and their unique quirks.  It explores each character's motivations for ending up in anime, from animators, to production, to voice actors, to the director!  At some point they all had a dream, even if they lost track of it along the way.  It delves into what it means to be new in the industry, to be old, to be confident, to be scared, it gets down right into the very fibre of what drives us as human beings.  Hope.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is the central theme running throughout the show.  Always try your best, never give up, and live your life to the fullest!  It's somewhat of a trite message, but Shirobako makes it work with extremely endearing and relateable characters whose optimism shines through the rampant chaos of working life.  But it isn't all sunshine and lollipops, you are shown frustration as well.  One character in particular is shown to fail time and time again while her friends pass her by, and she ends up getting more and more depressed despite the brave face she puts on.  It's a very understandable and sombre demonstration of the reality of working adult life.  Sometimes, hard work doesn't always pay off, at least not in the way that you'd like.  These melancholic moments seem to punctuate the efforts of all the girls at times, eventually leading to probably the most cathartic scene I've ever experienced in anime when those left behind have their perseverance rewarded at long last.  It brought me to joyous tears!\\n\\n\r\nMoments of comedic relief are expertly threaded in throughout the show and really help you get attached to the characters and their struggles.  They don't stand out so much as to distract you from the story, but instead provide a welcome decompression when your heart is heavy and a bubbly energy to lift you sky-high when you're already smiling.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these moments are seamlessly carried along by the music to this show, providing soft-tenderness when required, unbridled enthusiasm at the light-hearted scenes, and finally powerful jubilance during character triumphs.  And as one would hope for a story about trying to create the best anime that one can, the animation quality itself is very solid.  Neither the music nor animation are mind-blowingly amazing or original, but they are still effected with the careful craftsmanship of a true master honed by time.  The voice-acting for the show could not have been more spot-on, the main girls absolutely nailed their roles and the emotions that come with them.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, Shirobako is one of the most enjoyable anime experiences I've ever had, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this show to all viewers, especially serious anime fans who will get some of the more outlandish references in the show.  The characters are perfect, the story is interesting and very relateable, the art and sound are very professionally done, the ending is beautiful and satisfying, I literally cannot think of any flaws with this show.  It has so much heart, and the characters are so adorable, that I find it impossible not to relish every moment with them.  It felt like saying goodbye to old friends when the last glorious frame of all the characters together was shown.  Watching Shirobako was an amazing and deeply fulfilling experience, and I'm glad to have had the privilege to be a part of it!",

            "content": "\"Whatever you do, if you can't picture yourself in the future, nothing will begin.\"\r\nShirobako. The show that defied my expectations so much, it changed my view on the anime industry forever. The anime industry is a harsh environment, that's for sure. Shirobako is the ingenious and simply brilliant show that delves into this harsh environment. The laughter, the struggles, the tears, and the sweat that goes into making an anime is expertly expressed in a way that I will never be able to forget. \r\nWhen it comes to pure entertainment, it's hard to surpass Shirobako. It drags you into a world that us anime viewerswere always curious about, and it keeps you there with its brilliant depictions of everyday life. Shirobako is quite possibly the most educational show I have ever watched. Not only does it show you the behind the scenes work of an anime, but it also uses the hard life of an anime studio to teach you some simple yet useful life lessons. Very relatable things such as chasing your dreams, planning your future, asking yourself \"Why am I doing what I am doing?\", and that it's ok to rely on others and that teamwork is important. The show also gives insights on how to be a leader. The way this show weaves in these messages with the story and the character development makes the lessons even more impactful, and that is why Shirobako is such a brilliant show.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, Shirobako is a great example of a show-don't-tell series.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Characters, man. The characters in this show are all unique from each other and have their own distinct personalities. All of the characters. And there are A LOT of characters.\\n\r\n- Art is gorgeous and the animation is amazing and creative. \\n\r\n- Voice acting is super on fleek. It's fabulous.\\n\r\n- Amazing messages and lessons are expressed. You've probably experienced these life lessons before, but Shirobako expresses them in a way that really engraves them into your heart.\\n\r\n- Amazing comedy! Whether it be plain old jokes or parodies on real life anime titles (Neon Generation Avangaldon xD), this show will make you laugh!\\n\r\n- This series has some really intense moments. Like a Thriller tag is applicable to some points of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Some of the main characters are underdeveloped, especially Shizuka, the redhead seiyuu. I feel like she deserved more love.\\n\r\n- Some of the jokes won't hit home to some, as you need some knowledge about anime to understand them.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe story follows the life of Miyamori Aoi, who is a production assistant at Musashino Animation. It mainly follows her and her friends' daily lives as they follow their dreams and work hard. The overall story may not seem special, but it will surprise you. The way they go in depth to the professions that the protagonists experience really takes you to another world. This was a show where a LOT of research was done to pull it off. The character development was amazing and the dramatic and comedic moments were very well written.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe animation of animators animating their animations was spot on. The animation of this series was very creative, as it highlighted many different animation techniques used in anime (cause it's an anime about making anime.) The way the show switches between the animating style of \"real life\" and other anime within this anime (this is getting confusing) was really amazing. Also, incorporating CG animations to showcase the CG animators inside this anime was also well done. This was also one of the few anime where background characters weren't still images and you can see them going about their lives. Anime-ception is now complete.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe OST was well suited for the series, and the OPs and EDs are all catchy! But it's all about the voice actors/actresses. Holy damn, they fit their roles and situations perfectly. The way they voice act a voice actresses in the anime who is voice acting for an anime within the anime (holy crap) was spot on. I felt like this show was one that required a lot of effort from the voice actors/actresses, and I feel like they pulled it off spectacularly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\n5 girls chasing their dreams in a way that only they can. This show is definitely a character driven show. Despite having a HUGE plethora of characters, they all have such diverse characteristics that make them very distinguishable from each other and very likable. They have their own ambitions and opinions and take shit from no one but themselves. They all have their nice and selfish sides. A lot of detail was put into their characteristics, even to the most irrelevant of side characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAn enlightening series that pasted a smile on my face and had me at the edge of my seat during the super intense moments. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI'm totally biased, but there is no such thing as a not-biased review. So I'm going all out. This show was an experience like no other.",

            "content": "\"An anime about making anime?!\"\r\nThese were the words that came out from my mouth the moment I read about the story that surrounds Shirobako. So after binge-watching the 24-episode series in about a week or so, I'm ready to share my thoughts about it.\r\nFirst the story: I like it, since there really isn't anything like it. Shirobako tells a story of 5 (female) best friends achieving their dream of making an anime production together. A story that surrounds the whats-and-hows of making anime may not be original, but when done right IT REALLY STANDS OUT.\r\nShirobako introduce the pleasures and struggles of making anime, the dailyinteractions of the studio's staff members and also, the main characters trying to figure out what or how their dreams are to be achieved. The latter may sound cheesy, but for the most part it's not that you can spat on. The story does well to shaken the hearts of its viewers with some plot-twists and unfortunate events done unto the characters. However, the story doesn't only takes place in Musashino Animations, but also on the household of our main characters, showing their daily lives and how they each maintained the friendships.\\n\\n\r\nDialogue is also spot-on since it greatly ties into the atmosphere of the story. Frankly, I can't quite comprehend on how anime production works but I think that's a good thing, since it made me realize that the anime industry can be harsh and quite unforgiving.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there really is nothing to complain about the show's storyline. If I have to be nitpicky, I think 24-episodes can have the tendency to be dragging, but again, the story is interesting and every minute I waste was worth it.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing about Shirobako that's diverse is it's wide cast of characters. There is a lot of people involved in the story, characters with colorful personalities, so much that the viewer may tend to forget about the main characters. Speaking of, the 5 aforementioned friends include Aoi Miyamori, the production assistant, Ema Yasuhara, the timid animator, Shizuka Sasaki, the red-heard voice actress, Misa Toudo, the 3D editor and lastly Midori Imai, the aspiring script writer. Among them Aoi gets the most screen time since she is the focal character. Fortunately, despite the populous cast, I can't help but care for the most of them since they where all created cute and all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is present as well, as characters tend to mature after gaining much experience in their workplace and after discovering their limits. Still, for a show that has a lot of cast but still end up loving and caring for most of them, speaks volume of how the show's creators were able to balance the story and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nStill, since there are a lot of characters, it is kind of hard to keep track of them, as some characters tend to be forgotten in subsequent episodes. But it's not really much to complain about since when they stand out, they really make an impact to the other characters and the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nFor the show's audio and aesthetics, I say they nailed it. P. A. Works have, again, done a great job of making the world of Shirobako come to life with their signature design motif. The character designs are, dare I say it, cute. The backgrounds are very pleasing to look at. And the animation is okay for anime standards. Overall, the visuals aren't overbearing, but aesthetically pleasing enough that it isn't out of place or just... ugly.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's soundtrack is also great, melding well with story's mood and ambiance. The instrumentals are also quite noteworthy, and pleasing to hear at. Overall, it's great.\\n\\n\r\nI'm glad I get to watch this show. It made me acknowledge the hard work that anime creators put in their production. It showed that dreams takes steps and not leaps to achieve. It showed me that achievements are to be treasured with friends whilst thanking them for their hard work.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a show that taught me a lesson. Cliche as it may sound, but this is a show worth watching and knowing, and I wish more anime can aspire the impact Shirobako had showed me.",

            "content": "//Review in English and Spanish// [No spoilers]\r\nEnglish\r\nThe story takes us to know 5 girls, who aspire to create their own anime together. Before graduating they were in the animation club and managed to do something similar, but promised that in the future, their dreams become true and they will fulfil it together.\r\nEach woman with a different goal but into the same direction as is the production of an anime, the first girl, which is what takes more prominence in the anime is Aoi Miyamori which was the who started with his dream, which was to be a anime producer. The second one is the onethat also carries some prominence, is Emma, his passion is drawing and his dream was to be a animator and create moving images with her drawings. The third is Shizuka, she want to be a voice actress (seiyuu), a career of so much demand in Japan in the world of anime, so she is the girl who need to working more hard to realize his dream, but she struggle to go ahead and get it. The fourth is Midori Imai, who wants to be a screenwriter and create stories. The fifth is Todou Mass, and her dream is to create a 3D animation.\\n\\n\r\nEach girl in separately will fight to advance to their dreams and take a step closer to fulfil it. It will not be easy, they will face many obstacles and difficulties which they will overcome in order to achieve what they want.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nPlot, setting, and character development\\n\\n\r\nThe plot and setting of these characters is the style of the \"slice of life\" genre, We see characters doing things of everyday life. Here we see 5 girls working on their dreams.\\n\\n\r\nWe have drama, that is present when the main and second characters decay because after a failure that include a lot of effort, but the situation will also help them to move forward, that is, learn from their mistakes as all people, and successfully passing the difficulties whith his willpower. And the comedy is also present, has several situations involving this genre, which makes entertaining this anime because the characters in this anime are quite nice and funny.\\n\\n\r\nYou could say that some people confuse this anime with Josei, because we see Young adults protagonists through the difficulties of his dreams, which adds a point in favor because we don't see so much anime with this style.\\n\\n\r\nI found it quite original and entertaining the plot, which teach us what is the process that takes to the screens an anime and the difficulties that people who are involved in this work have to carry, etc. I have to admit I was totally ignorant in this regard, I had no idea of \u200b\u200bhow people work for make an anime, and has also found it quite interesting just because of that.\\n\\n\r\nThe development of this anime is good, is enjoyable and personally not bored me at any chapter.\\n\r\nYou could compare this anime with \"Bakuman\" but with feminine version protagonists because each character struggles to reach his dreams in both animes, although Bakuman is to be mangakas and Shirobako to produce anime. They have some similarity.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the title, \"Shirobako\" means \"white box\", that are important files for the animation of this process were kept, as I understood.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and the plot is the strong point of this anime. Both major and minor characters have some prominence in the series, that is, not fully focus on the main characters, a good characterist that difference this anime to others.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nDrawing and animation\\n\\n\r\nDrawing and animation is is so good. Character design of the primary and secondary characters are well done in my opinion. A strong point of the anime is this, that makes entertaining to watch in conjunction with his good plot and characters.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is quite enjoyable, both openings (2) as the endings (2). Although I do not engage with any opening / ending in particular, except for the ending 2 song I found something sticky and nice, I sang in my mind several times after a chapter. For the rest, the ost I remembered something simple but sticks well with the plot.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this if you like animes with slice of life style and have some curiosity to see how the anime are made. Also if you like anime with good drawing-animation and characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nEspa\u00f1ol\\n\\n\r\nLa historia nos lleva a conocer a 5 chicas, que aspiran desde j\u00f3venes a poder crear su propio anime juntas. Antes de graduarse estaban en el club de animaci\u00f3n y lograron hacer algo parecido, pero se prometieron que en el futuro, har\u00edan algo m\u00e1s grande y lo har\u00edan juntas. \\n\\n\r\nCada una con una meta distinta pero hacia la misma direcci\u00f3n que es la producci\u00f3n de anime, la primera chica, que es la que lleva m\u00e1s protagonismo en la serie es Aoi Miyamori que fue la que primero empez\u00f3 con su sue\u00f1o, que era ser una productora de anime. La segunda que es la que lleva tambi\u00e9n cierto protagonismo es Emma, una joven que gracias a que su pasi\u00f3n es dibujar su sue\u00f1o era poder ser animadora y crear con sus dibujos im\u00e1genes con movimiento. La tercera es Shizuka una joven que desea ser actora de voz (seiyuu), una carrera de bastante demanda en Jap\u00f3n en el mundo del anime, por lo cual ella es la chica que le cuesta m\u00e1s trabajo realizar su sue\u00f1o, pero aun as\u00ed lucha para seguir adelante y conseguirlo. La cuarta es Midori Imai, que desea ser guionista y crear de historias. La quinta es Todou Misa, la cual su sue\u00f1o es crear animaci\u00f3n en 3D.\\n\\n\r\nCada chica por separado lucharan para poder avanzar y dar un paso m\u00e1s hacia su sue\u00f1o, el cual no sera f\u00e1cil, se toparan con varios obst\u00e1culos y dificultades los cuales trataran de sobrellevar para poder lograr lo que desean. \\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nTrama, ambientaci\u00f3n, desarrollo y personajes\\n\\n\r\nLa trama y la ambientaci\u00f3n de estos personajes es del estilo slice of lice, es decir, vemos a personajes haciendo cosas de la vida cotidiana. En este caso vemos a 5 chicas trabajando en sus sue\u00f1os.\\n\r\nTiene sus toques de drama, que es cuando los personajes principales y secundarios decaen debido a un primer fracaso despu\u00e9s de cierto esfuerzo, pero dicha situaci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n les ayudar\u00e1 a seguir adelante, es decir, aprender\u00e1n de sus errores como todas las personas y lograran superar las dificultades con su fuerza de voluntad. Y sus toques de comedia no se extra\u00f1aron tampoco, tiene varias situaciones que involucran este genero, lo cual hace ameno este anime, debido a que los personajes de este anime son bastante agradables y graciosos.\\n\r\nSe podria decir que algunas personajes confundir\u00edan este anime con un Josei, debido a que vemos a jovenes adultas atravesando las dificultades de sus sue\u00f1os, cosa que le agrega un punto a su favor a este anime, debido a que casi no se ven animes de este estilo. \\n\r\nMe ha parecido una trama bastante original y amena, en la cual nos ense\u00f1an cual es el proceso que se lleva para llevar a las pantallas un anime, las dificultades que las personas que est\u00e1n involucradas en este trabajo tienen que llevar, etc. Cosa que tengo que admitir que era totalmente ignorante en este aspecto, no tenia ni idea de como se las ingeniaban para trabajar los animes, y tambi\u00e9n me ha parecido bastante interesante justamente por eso.\\n\r\nEl desarrollo de este anime es bueno, el ritmo es ameno y en lo personal no me aburri\u00f3 ning\u00fan capitulo por lo que mencione anteriormente.\\n\r\nSe podr\u00eda comparar este anime con \"Bakuman\" pero versi\u00f3n protagonistas femeninas y m\u00e1s grandes debido a que cada personaje lucha por alcanzar su sue\u00f1o, aunque en Bakuman es para ser mangakas y en Shirobako para producir anime. Tienen cierta similitud.\\n\r\nTambi\u00e9n cabe resaltar que el titulo, \"Shirobako\" significa \"Caja blanca\", que es donde se guardaban los archivos importantes para el proceso de animaci\u00f3n de este, seg\u00fan entend\u00ed. \\n\r\nLos personajes y la trama es el punto fuerte de este anime. Tanto los personajes principales y secundarios ocupan cierto protagonismo en la serie, es decir, no se centran totalmente en los principales, cosa que me ha gustado de este anime. \\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nDibujo y animaci\u00f3n\\n\\n\r\nEl dibujo y la animaci\u00f3n es lo que m\u00e1s me ha gustado de este anime, el dibujo me ha gustado y fue lo que primero me llamo la atenci\u00f3n del anime. El dise\u00f1o de personajes de los principales y secundarios tambi\u00e9n cabe resaltar que esta bien hecho a mi parecer. Un punto fuerte del anime que lo hace ameno de ver en conjunto con su buena trama y personajes.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nBanda Sonora\\n\\n\r\nLa banda sonora me ha parecido acorde al anime y ameno, tanto los openings (2) como los endings (2). Aunque no me enganche con ningun opening/ending en particular, excepto con el ending 2, la canci\u00f3n me ha parecido algo pegajosa y agradable, la he cantado en mi mente varias veces despu\u00e9s de un capitulo. De resto, el ost me ha parecido acorde, algo sencillo pero pega bien con la trama.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nConclusi\u00f3n\\n\\n\r\nRecomiendo este anime si te gustan los animes estilo slice of life y tienes cierta curiosidad por ver como se hacen los animes. Tambi\u00e9n si te gustan los animes con buen dibujo-animaci\u00f3n y personajes.\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you want to know more about how anime is made or what it is like to work in the anime industry, Shirobako is the show for you. What we have is an office-themed slice of life series that focuses on an animation company's productions from the vantage point of a young production assistant and her friends.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story of Shirobako chronicles the company's creation of two anime series, an original series and one based on a popular manga. Each story arc explores the difficulties of creating each type of story, and the show presents the work environment as hectic and insanely busy. \r\nCharacters: 7\r\nWhilethe series has five protagonists, not all of them have equal screen time or character development. Beyond the main heroines, there is a large ensemble cast of characters who each play a role in the production of anime. Many of them are memorable and at first glance seem to be stereotypes, are given more character development as the show goes on. Learning how and why these characters do what they do and why they pursue their passions are very inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe music fits the mood, while mainly being upbeat and energetic. The Japanese dub is good, as characters each have a distinctive voice. And they talk about voice acting a bit in parts of the show when you see them dubbing the show!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nA lot of time is dedicated in the story to exploring the motivations and challenges faced by character designers and animators, explaining the difficulty of particular scenes that they are working on (such as a bunch of running horses) and then they proceed to show you that actual completed animation! The actual art of the series is bright and colourful in and of itself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI have always been fascinated by the animation process so learning how anime is produced and how many people are involved in the process was a great learning experience for me. There is a lot of people talking in jargon that is hard to understand, but that's true of any story involving an office environment. I also enjoy slice of life shows that show the progression of people through their daily lives. And it was refreshing to see a show about people pursuing careers as young adults as opposed to all the anime shows about teenagers dreaming about the future. Shirobako takes that next step and hows the struggles of establishing yourself as a professional, which speaks to where I'm at in life as well.",

            "content": "Truly beautiful. Great mixture of slice of life elements and comedy that's open to all audiences. Though I'm unfamiliar with the post-highschool setting, I'm very happy to say that this anime really pulled it off. The \"rookie\" characters in their own professions related to anime are all wonderfully portrayed and really contribute to the setting of anime production. If I am able to understand even a little of what it's like to be in the anime production business from the backgrounds of each character and the progressive storyline, then I am more than happy to recommend this to any anime fan no matter what genreor them you're into. I was unsure of it at first, but this anime truly is a great display of ups and downs in life.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9 - Although the episodes following the first progress through the story a bit slow, in my opinion, once the story picks up, it blazes through so many scenes without making you feel overwhelmed, and definitely kept me interested. The setting of an anime production company is very unique, in my opinion, as it's the first one that I've ever watched with this setting, but it does a great job pulling off the post-high-school setting. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 - I absolutely love the main art style of this anime, and I say main because of the fact that there are many times when the art style changes, but it's only when they are showing an anime within the anime. Although the animation isn't as fluid as say the \"Fate\" series, I actually really liked the animation of all of the anime displays, giving you a taste of each product that the characters got to experience in the past watching the animes they grew up with. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 - Although I absolutely love the soundtrack, anyone who watches this may not be tolerant of the fact that many of the songs within the OST are different versions of the same slice-of-life main theme; slowed down for sad and touching moments, or sped up and made with different more ambiguous sounds for serious moments. I love the voices of all of the characters, not a single bad thing to say about those beautifuls.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 - At first, it was a bit overwhelming for me to keep track of all of the characters within the company, because of the fact that I initially thought that the main character and her 4 highschool friends were going to be the main characters that everyone would get to see most of, but that is quickly discarded as you rarely see her highschool friends progress in their own solo storylines, and even more rarely see them all together, but it does happen, and that's not even that bad of a thing. The cast seen most often are the people within the main character's company, and geez I thought there were a lot of them. I'm sure the director/screen writer/whoever knew that the sheer number of characters to remember would be overwhelming so they do remind you somewhat of who each person is when they appear on screen the first few episodes, providing a name and occupation-title on each scene they appear, multiple times, which I found somewhat necessary. Since there are many characters you see often, but don't get many lines, it might be hard to like some of the characters presented, but my favorite characters of the anime were the ones that didn't talk much & the softspoken ones as I found them absolutely adorable and hilarious! (Ema & her future kouhai).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 - Unfortunately it's my own opinion of myself but I'm rating it this high because of the fact that I watched the entire series within a short amount of time (24ep within about 3 days). As I mentioned before, I did think the storyline moved somewhat slow in the beginning, but that could've been part of having the audience get accustomed to the whole setting of \"anime production company,\" as that is, in my opinion, an unusual setting for an anime. I'm sure if I would've graded my enjoyment differently if I had watched 1 episode per week, because I would've had to endure the slow-paced \"getting-used-to-the-environment\" episodes, but since I watched it pretty quickly, I didn't dwell on the early episodes much, as the later stream of back-and-forth comedy bits really sold me, and the real-life scenarios were also quite touching.",

            "content": "Shirobako Review (NO SPOILERS)\r\nHey, kid. We heard you liked anime. So we put some anime in your anime, by making an anime about anime, that way you can have anime with your anime, while watching anime about anime! In case you couldn't comprehend any of that nonsense, Shirobako is an anime about an anime production company. The concept alone sounds incredibly interesting. And I've definitely heard a lot of praise be sung about this show. So I was really happy to finally start watching it. Now that I've finally finished, let's get down to what I thought of the whole thing. So right off thebat, I gotta praise the heck out of the animation. When certain anime shows have episodes that involve the characters watching TV, you always wonder if they're watching something that's live action or that's animation, since you can't really tell in their world. Shirobako does a really good job at differentiating the \"real\" world and the \"anime\" world, within the show. They do this by having some of the most physically diverse characters I've ever seen in any anime to date... not counting stuff like One Piece, where everyone looks insanely ridiculous with their tea cup pants and pinwheel heads. I'm talking straight up diverse human bodies.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of the inclusion of the heavier characters that you don't really see in anime all that often, the thin characters look VERY built. Everything is proportioned very well and people look full and thick. Sure, they still have the big eyes and rainbow colored hair and the fact that I still can't tell the difference between a 16 year old girl and a 30 year old woman, but Shirobako has some of the most well built anime bodies I've ever seen. In their \"anime\" world, they give those characters the MEGA eyes and the hourglass waists, to make it look more unreal, within this world. I seriously cannot sing enough praise about the character animation in this show. You really gotta see it for yourself, to see what I mean. On top of the incredibly well built bodies, there are a lot of interesting shots in this show. Just stuff like people talking on a phone or putting their hand on someone's shoulder or brainstorming an idea by themselves. It's all done at really interesting angles, to the point of almost feeling like an art piece. Honestly, I can screen cap several hundred screenshots of this show and they'd all be very pleasant to have as a desktop background. Honestly, I would go as far as to give this show the same sort of recommendation as I did with Flying Witch. By which I mean I feel this would be a nice show to have play in the background, just for the visuals. Seriously, MAJOR props to P.A. Works for their outstanding performance on this show. They did not disappoint in the slightest, with this one.\\n\\n\r\nOk. Enough gushing about the gorgeous visuals and onto the meat and potatoes of this anime feast. (wut?) The story in this show is pretty straightforward. The first 12 episodes involve the company working on and finishing one show, while the last 12 focus on them working on another. So it's nice to have that variety in topics and projects. Now I'll admit that there are a few episodes here and there that seem a bit... weird. By that, I mean that there are a couple episodes that are just strictly communication throughout the office. A main objective isn't really presented, and it really does feel like you're just watching people work. The characters are still entertaining enough to make it enjoyable to watch, but it just seems a bit weird at times, to make those moments full-fledged episodes. But then again, there are several episodes in other anime that involve people trying to find a roommate at school or play a baseball game for the 80 millionth time. And we never really find those boring, because we're used to those sorts of plots in a slice of life anime. This is just a very different type of slice of life. And by different, I mean that it doesn't star a male high schooler, surrounded by a bunch of female high schoolers, exploring their lives in high school. It's actually something different! So even if I'm not entirely used to it and don't understand it right away, it's still exciting to be in a different setting that I've never experienced before.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters are just as fun to watch as their designs are intriguing and enjoyable to look at. Our protagonist is Miyamori Aoi who went off to work at an anime production company, along with her high school besties, in hopes of fulfilling their life long dream of creating an anime together. All 5 of the anime club members are a joy to watch on camera, as well as the plethora of other anime company employees who you'll be getting well acquainted with, throughout the show. While you most definitely will know who these characters are when you get to know them, you might have a bit of trouble remembering their names, because there are SOOO many characters. We see just about every nook and cranny of the industry. We see Miyamori's work in the production side of things, we see the inner workings and opinions of both 2D and 3D animation, this show literally has it all. The only part I wish I got to see more of was the voice acting side of process. That part does have its few moments in the spotlight, but not nearly as much as all the other parts. And it doesn't really talk much about the inner workings of voice acting, it just sorta shows it being done. The most detail you get, regarding the work behind the voice acting is seeing the people discuss and argue who to cast for certain parts. That's about the only thing I wish I got to see more of.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show is pretty stinkin good, not gonna lie. I got very attached to a lot of the background songs that played and I actually wound up liking BOTH of the openings and BOTH of the ending themes in this show. And that's not something I get to say, very often. The openings and endings got stuck in my head for a very long time and I am very much ok with that. The songs and visuals were both fantastic and I had no problem watching them before and after every episode. Now this show has 2 OVA episodes that are actually really cool ideas. They're both the first episode of the 2 anime shows that the characters in Shirobako were working on! It's really cool and interesting to see that and I'm so glad that they included that. The first one is a bit... ehh... but the second one is absolutely fantastic and REALLY made me wish it was a full blown show. Something I really loved in this show is to see the character's passion for the shows they were working on. There were several times where the anime employees would phantasize the characters in their shows standing right in front of them, cheering them on. And it would make them happy that their creations were proud of them and happy with how they got brought to life. That sort of magic is just so whimsical to watch and it always made me warm and fuzzy inside, whenever those moments popped up.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Shirobako was an absolute joy to watch. It's a fascinating look at the industry that we all hold so near and dear to our hearts, but never really got to see. Of course, this is most likely a very sugar coated interpretation of the actual anime industry, but a lot of characters and plot points were actually based off of real life people and past events, so that's really cool. I would definitely watch this show as an amazing piece of history, if nothing else. It might be a bit hard to follow at times and some episodes are a bit weird to be entire episodes, but the overall premise is nothing less than amazing to experience. And again, the animation is fantastic. I'd go as far as to say that Shirobako has the best animated humans in any anime I've ever seen. Whether it's for the stunning visuals, great music, or fascinating experience that you can't really get from any other anime, I can most definitely recommend this show to just about anyone.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako gets a 9/10",

            "content": "Shirobako is a very good anime. It takes a behind the scenes look at how anime are made in real life and portrays its characters realistically. Each of the five main characters (with the possible exception of Imai Midori) get good growth over the course of 24 episodes. The episodes themselves are beautifully realized. If you ever wanted to look at how anime are made in reality then Shirobako is it. It deals with a wide range of issues ranging from a director making last minutes changes to the script, to dealing with elusive authors and satisfying them. There is even bit of cozying upto the right people to get good contracts for the studio. Shirobako covers it all. It takes a realistic and non-romanticized look at anime production. It does a good job of portraying characters who aren't inherently good or bad but are all working towards the same goal. The path to the goal does not always match but the goals are the same. \\n\\n\r\nThe aninme is an enjoyable watch for what it is. And I would have rated it very highly if the narrative was not so skewed. From start to finish, the narrative has a single mission in mind and that is to push a feminist ideology where all the men are essentially losers and the women in the business are the ones behind the scenes working hard to make anime successfull. With no exception all the major main male leads have issues dealing with pressure/doing their job properly. Almost all of them need a woman's touch to get their shit together. Contrasting that are the female characters who face their fears/doubts by themselves and grow in the process. Let us look at some of the leads for example to illustrate what I mean. \\n\r\n - Seichi Kinoshita who is the director in the anime. A wishy-washy guy who is potrayed more like an otaku than as a serious face. Used mostly as a comic relief. Finds it difficult to really make up his mind. Eternally needs Miyamori's help. \\n\r\n - Masato Marukawa, president of Mushashino. Happy go lucky guy who cares more for the food he is cooking than the anime his studio is trying to put out. \\n\r\n - Yutaka Honda, production manager who is ever out of ideas. Partners with the director in the first half to provide comic relief. Leaves the team in the second half. \\n\r\n - Hiroshi Iketani, episode director who it is implied lives in poverty. Tries to run away from work every opportunity he gets. Used for comic relief. \\n\r\n - Tarou Takanashi, a production manager who is just about the most useless and inept person you would ever see anime or otherwise. Used for comic relief. \\n\r\n - Ryousuke Endou, animation director who appears to have grudges with everyone. Throws a childish tantrum early on in the series to add some drama. Used for drama. \\n\r\n - Shimeji Maitake, supposed scenario writer. Implied to be very slow in writing. Essentially acts as a foil for Imai Midori to grow. Delegates all his work to Midori later on. \\n\r\n - Daisuke Hiraoka, a PM who replaces Honda. Shown to be extremely disinterested in work. Included to add unnecessary drama towards the end. Also portrayed to be sexist. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEven relatively minor characters like the publishing house editors are shown to be extremely disinterested in their work who would rather play golf than sit down and talk about an anime production based on their publication. \\n\\n\r\nContrasting all this are the female characters. Almost unanimously, they are all hard workers and work with 10000000% diligence 24x7. Almost all the problems they face are due to them not having the skills necessary and all of them have their own growth moment where they face their demons and succeed. Even supposedly shallow female characters like Sara Satou are potrayed as hard working/diligent workers towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is a good story. However good the story is however, this is nothing more than a feminist narrative. This culminates in the final episode where the main character Aoi Miyamori is celebrated as an unsung hero. Miyamori wasnt even a hero in the production chain, that goes coincidentally to another female called Erika Yano, but fuck logic amirite?\\n\r\nOverall a good anime which could have been great if it hadnt been highjacked by a \"wimmen are awesome\" narrative. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Do you recall your high school days? Did you do club activities? I did. I was in the school newspapers. An English newspaper in a Korean school, producing a tabloid-size every year. The first time I attended the meetings, I remember, an English teacher took to the front of the classroom. She passed out a sheet of paper to every new member of the club. It contained 'useful phrases for easy article writing', with the title written in bolded and underlined Korean.\r\nI also did interviews with the newspaper. The mission was to interview a Chinese teacher and I was paired up with a senior todo it. I prepared the questions, and the senior was tasked with the interview itself. For the daunting and audacious task we were allocated fifty minutes, and the senior prepared a pen and a notepad for the interview, then... told our beloved teacher to write the answers on the notepad. We were done in no time. We returned to the classroom triumphant, thirty minutes spent chatting in the restroom.\\n\\n\r\nDid I care? No. Did anybody care? Probably not. Did you care about yours? I'd say most of you didn't. But...but they did. These five girls did. It was the true birth of their lifelong dreams. \\n\\n\r\nShirobako is too idyllic.\\n\\n\r\nDo you recall your college life? Some of you may not need to go there, but here in our place we need to go there, for economic reasons more than academic reasons. I remember about the entrance ceremony. Herded from the meeting place just inside the school gates, I sat in an auditorium, unwell from a cold caught some days before. They did congratulation gigs, they did speeches, they did 'explanations on campus life'...I was getting even sicker. And then a junior stepped onto the stage, and she talked about such an exciting subject. 'Things to keep watch on when you drink with higher grade students'\\n\\n\r\nI did part time jobs when I had free time. I needed the money. My major was 'istree, no way anybody would benefit on finding work from that. I resorted to managing a convenience store. It was close enough to the college itself. It was a run-of-the-mill job, mildly physically challenging, mildly mentally challenging. It's hard when you meet that drunkard on 3 AM. Then one day I met an instructor. He pulled out an energy drink and wanted a Marlboro. I duly gave it to him, and then he said...'Hey, working for your dream aren't you. Good luck.'\\n\\n\r\nI was a bit disillusioned. I guess you were too. But they weren't. At least, Midori wasn't. How easy does getting a seat next to your immediate boss does it get?\\n\\n\r\nShirobako is too idyllic.\\n\\n\r\nDo you recall the first day you went to work? I admit, it's not too far back for me. Maybe for some of you the day hasn't come yet. I still remember that day. I borrowed my parents' car for the day, seven in the morning, and drove there. It was a fair distance, thirty minutes on car. If I was still living in Holland, a bridge may had suddenly wrenched on its legs and stop me for fifteen minutes strong, but I was in boring old South Korea so the only roadblock I got was a traffic jam. The workplace was edgy for a beginner, I remember nothing of it, and after the day I have to go home, don't I. I hopped on the car, maybe I would get to race a rival company employee! Guess what, I got another traffic jam.\\n\\n\r\nTo quote Dick Ashcroft when he did Glasto, life's a struggle, and tomorrow is a Thursday not a Monday but anyhow Monday morning may be a struggle working in a job that you despise, and working for a bastard you despise. We're a slave to money then we die. Are you? I am. But they aren't. None of them are. All of them and maybe their colleagues too.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako is too idyllic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet I dream sometimes that those five girls will grace my screen again. No, not that actually. In the dark cloudy nights after a long day, when I look out the window of my high-rise flat, the neon rainbow-coloured ark would appear, with those five girls sitting in the middle of the ark, and fill my eyes with lunar light. What's happened? We've got Shirobako season two. What will happen now? Surely, heaven would be ours...\\n\\n\r\nDo I need to explain to you what the series contains? No ta, just watch it. Drink it in.",

            "content": "Fans of something not only love the products they consume, but they are also curious as to how exactly that product came to be. Shirobako knows that and scratches that itch by showing (almost) exactly how anime are made, and that is just part of its beauty.\r\nProduced by P.A. Works and directed by Tsutomu Mizushima (Another, Plastic Nee-san), Shirobako is a Slice-of-Life anime that aims to show the ins-and-outs of anime development and production by having main characters in every section of the industry.\r\nThe portrayal of the anime industry as shown here feels real, but also slightly exaggerated, to better create an enjoyable story andcast of characters. It also is very educational, showing step-by-step the production of anime and making each part seem equally important. I actually changed my view on producers because of it, as I originally thought they didn't do much for anime production, but I saw how wrong I was.\\n\\n\r\nBut that is not all of Shirobako. Beyond its \"gimmick\", there is a complex show with a vast cast of characters, that are actually developed and not only caricatures, and a fairly dramatic and well-executed story. The plot of the anime focus on the production of two anime and how the staff is affected by them. Despite the \"normalness\" of the story, it manages to make some fairly interesting twists along the way. Also, I felt that the story was perfectly paced and made the most of its 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is absolutely gigantic, the numbers can even be intimidating. But whatever doubts I had about the quality of the character are put to rest fairly early on. Shirobako is actually littered with humane and quirky characters that are never just an exaggerated archetype. The absolute majority of the cast is developed and fleshed out during the duration of the anime. At multiple points, I was actually surprised that the creators managed to do so much with almost all characters in an actually short time, considering the numbers.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Shirobako is pretty much always spot-on, from facial expressions to the background, despite not being that impressive to the eye. It never goes out of its way to exaggerate something, but what matters is detailed and well-thought by the art director.  One thing that I found to be amazing were the eyes. They were always incredibly beautiful and showed a great deal of emotion, which was absolutely vital to the more character-focused moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is mostly composed of orchestral pieces that varies in tone according to the atmosphere of the scene. Some of the tracks are memorable, while others are missing something. Despite that, the tracks were always used to enhance the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was, for the most part, great. Actually, some of the voice actresses were put in a fairly interesting position: they had to act out someone acting out, while still considering the feelings of the characters. I must say that the perfection of this particular scene was hugely impressive, specially in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nI, as a \"reviewer\", loved every second of it. I adored how I could learn more on how anime is made, and how it still managed to be incredible in basically every other regard also. At some moments, I was laughing a lot (Oops, forgot to talk about the comedy! Spoiler: it is also great), while at others I was at the verge of crying. Somehow, Shirobako managed to do everything and be everything, and a bit more after that.\\n\\n\r\nFor enthusiastic fans of anime, this is, in my opinion, a must-watch. After it, your consideration for the products and the effort put on them may change, it happened to me, actually. For people who love quirky, but fleshed out characters, it is also a great recommendation. The only case someone might not like is if they watch only action-focused anime or want to watch a thriller.",

            "content": "Introduction: Shirobako is an anime about an anime crew working in an anime studio to produce anime ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\r\nSo it\u2019s all about anime (\uff61\u25d5\u203f\u203f\u25d5\uff61)\r\nShirobako means white box in Japanese. In the anime industry, this refers to a video recording that is distributed to members of the production staff prior to airing. Nowadays they use discs for it.\r\nShirobako wasn\u2019t popular until middle of first half (eps 5-6) where the plot started to shine and otakus (or anime enthusiasts) started to spread this anime around forums and blogs. And that was the time where I jumped onto the bandwagon and started to follow the seriesweekly.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about anime production, and the CONFLICTS AND COMPLICATIONS in making an anime.\\n\r\nLife is hard when dealing with others,such as in real life and in Shirobako.\\n\r\nToo many arseholes around to make an easy job goes haywire.\\n\r\nSometime it\u2019s a studio,while the other time are the animators,or the production staffs who\u2019re responsible for the project.\\n\r\nA normal anime cast comprises of at least half a hundred of people. And the seasonal nature of anime production means the crew for each anime for a studio won\u2019t be the same.\\n\r\nThat\u2019s a perfect recipe for troubles and table-flipping.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the time management issue in this anime. Each episode\u2019s core is literally the race to meet the deadline.\\n\r\nThe tension between people is animated fabulously well here, as compromises need to be made all of the time to finish the targets. Quarrels are not rare for this anime. Just like our life.\\n\r\nHumors are placed perfectly, with some very stupid but heart-warming scenes.\\n\r\nFor example there\u2019s a scene where the director need to go through a hell\u2019s worth of obstacles just to meet someone important.\\n\r\nAND ALL THE DRIFTS INVOLVED DURING TRANSPORTATION OMG\\n\\n\r\nDetails of anime production are included in every episode. One will definitely be more informed about the production of anime for sure. And the characters in the show represents each side of it.\\n\\n\r\nMiyamori,the protagonist is a production assistant whose dream is to make an anime with her friends in high school\u2019s anime club. Her charm is outstanding and it\u2019s what that maintain the flow of first half of Shirobako.\\n\r\nThen you got her friends. Ema, whose dream is to become an animator. Midori who would like to write scripts for anime. Shizuka has a seiyuu dream. Misa is a 3D renderer.\\n\r\nEach of them covers an aspect of anime production, which Miyamori being the one taking the leading role and coordinating in an anime studio.\\n\r\nOTOH,Hiraoka is an arsehole who keeps whining about everything BUT is one interesting character to move the plot in second half.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all moe-ly designed, as you can expect from P.A. Works that brings us Angel Beats and Nagi no Asukara.\\n\r\nAnd they are moe in a correct way. Even the big guys are cute =D\\n\r\nThe characters are so important in a way that Shirobako is all about the interactions among all of them in making an anime.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that makes Shirobako so unique,and special is the critique towards the anime industry.\\n\r\nThe reuse, and recycle of assets are so frequent so that deadline can be met without the need to do a recap chapter.\\n\r\n*recap chapters happen when a studio can\u2019t finish the required episodes in time,so well some editing will grant them an extra week of time :D\\n\r\nThen we got one of the most serious issue, the mediocrity of anime rendering quality, let it be key animations or 3D animations or both.\\n\r\nThis happens when a big studio hires some random studios or animators to help with the animations and they have f***ed up.\\n\r\nSounds familiar isn\u2019t it?\\n\\n\r\nSoundtracks wise is average. Perhaps its the only weak point of Shirobako. BUT the second ending,Platinum Jet,is staggeringly awesome.\\n\r\nAlong with the art that showcases how a character is designed,coloured and applied into the background. And the\u2019re six of them. Oh boy 10/10 for that.\\n\r\nThe production value is beyond godlike. Every aspect from the opening until the ending is polished to make sure that the anime has an \u201canime-making\u201d vibe.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako is just so lovely, and special, and unique in its on way.\\n\r\nI just hope P.A. Works got a sequel ready by now, or stretch the current one to 50 episodes or whatsoever.\\n\r\nPeeps who know me will know that I\u2019m an anime hipster who opposes sequels, but for once in a while I just hope they do one for Shirobako.\\n\r\nBecause Shirobako is a gem. One that I found myself feeling so enjoyable and satisfied for the first time since I started my weekly anime watching habit.\\n\\n\r\nIn an era where anime industry has bloomed and gained international recognition,the quality control has gone with the past, all it\u2019s left is the swarm of mediocre adaptions for every season.\\n\r\nCurrent anime is just so generic and alike, shounen ones sure will have harem plot, harem ones will get some shounen plot because it\u2019s mainstream.\\n\r\nAll we can do is cross our fingers and hope for the best, and Shirobako S2 (\u3065\uff61\u25d5\u203f\u203f\u25d5\uff61)\u3065",

            "content": "Little Bit of Spoiler but not much to really spoil anything.\r\nShirobako is a dull anime with nothing special at what the other people have written in their reviews. I don't understand how people came up with its a beautiful anime, it's a masterpiece or a kiss to the anime production. The anime was very average and I believe it's a hit or miss anime and it was a miss for me. I will say that episode 1-12 was useless and watching from episode 13-24 is a much better choice. There is not much improvement still after episode 12.\r\nThe animation is smooth and beautiful, with greatmusic that was beautifully done. The Voice acting was amazing and was very fitting for each of the characters and their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nFor the characters it mainly focuses on Aoi with the occasional other 4 girls. It shows how Shizuka is struggling with finding a voice acting job, how Misa wanted a change of work and Ema finding her own style and the artist blocks she faced. However that was for only couple of episodes and what happened to Midori? It was like they were saying hey Midori is in college still so forget about her now as we still don't know what to do with her yet.  Oh nevermind lets just bring her to the same company as Aoi and Ema but as a person who's importance is only for researching and for nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nMajority of the episodes was about Aoi managing her job and the experiences she faced. The only characters who feel fully developed other than Aoi is Ema, Yano, Gothic Lolita-san (Ogasawara), Endou, Segawa and Andou. Hell even Kunogi feels like a fully developed character compared to the three other main characters, and she can't even finish one sentence at all. It was like hey first 12 episodes forget about all the 3 girls except Aoi and Ema, then to bringing the other 2 main girls in for just a small screen time with little to no importance at all.  Oh and forget about Shizuka and the fact that she even existed; she is more non-existant than Akari (Yuru Yuri)\\n\\n\r\nI feel for Shizuka cause I liked her the most from the 4 other main girls, however, it pissed me off that they just dropped her in the last two episodes just because they felt like it. They must have forgotten that there was a 5th character and were trying to remember who the hell the red haired girl was and her importance. They suddenly remembered her and was like oh shit she was supposed to be a voice actor ok lets just put her for this minor roll and just end the anime with that. \\n\\n\r\nThere were like only 4-5 good jokes, the comedy it tried to push was stale. The characters are what you expect, with the variety of personality where it just gets annoying. Everything is happy and nice, where no one pays for a mistake they made even if it was a major mistake. Everyone just apologized and the matter got settled, come on if this is about the job force in making anime, at least, make it realistic. \\n\\n\r\nThen there are those random daydreams with the two dolls, which didn't fit at all. It was fist at first as they only appeared once in a while. But after episode 12 they appeared constantly giving tips and descriptions for the anime industry. They had more speech dialogue than the actual characters and note that they don't even exist. Also WTF is with the unrealistic driving in this anime, are they trying to show  how important it the key files or other papers are, so lets drive fast, or that this is an anime so we have to show something cool and awesome. Another thing how the F**K did Yano learn to sail a boat? \\n\\n\r\nIf they were trying to make an anime about the jobs and hardship in the anime production, they need to take it seriously and not put the illusionary images like for example the last episode. It was like they never took this seriously. If there is anoter anime about making an anime or manga (unless it similar to Mangaka-San to Assistant-San) then I will not read or watch it. I didn't enjoy this anime at all, the reviews here are misleading and was not correct for me.",

            "content": "Take it with a grain of salt: this is my first MAL review(?) and I logged in to just write this; haven't logged on to MAL in year(s)?\r\nThe big reason why I like Shirobako a ton is because it is actually very typical of a PA Works product. I like most of them as they focus on intermingling the character development aspects with usually a solid appeal to some thematically relevant, emotional aspect of the story. I think what perhaps makes it a much more accessible crowd-pleaser than some of their other works is because the plot and direction are from \"Girls und Panzer's\" MizushimaTsutomu, and he was able to transform a mundane corporate environment into an exciting and dramatic struggle between an anime company and its obligations, between youthful dreamers and the cold, harsh reality they live in.\\n\\n\r\nBetter yet, what pushes Shirobako over is the plethora references for serious anime otaku, as in, people who actually don't consume anime as a bunch of files they collect but rather as the works themselves, as the creation of creators. And in Shirobako there is the whole gamut of famous people and nobodies in which the audience can draw connections with. It uses a tone that people who talk about anime online for a long time can get comfortable with. Sure, the educational aspect is good and people enjoy that, but it's more its ability to describe that work environment in a very personal way that makes the show so much more easy to connect. And that's how it handles the otaku side of the theme.\\n\\n\r\nNormally that stuff is esoteric and would be kind of boring, so being able to dramatically turn that into a weekly joy is quite spectacular. And maybe that's why Shirobako is such a well-accepted work.\\n\\n\r\nIt's still got tons of flaws, including the very same kind of production issues they had to deal with within the show, plus having to do retakes because of copyright issues, and many others. But it is what it is, and watching and understanding Shirobako puts all of its flaws in to perspective, too.",

            "content": "I am a sucker for media about creators making media, the artistic struggle and the pressure that producing entertainment brings, when well represented, can be pretty emotionally powerful while at the same time make for something really entertaining to watch.\r\nI have to admit that I was a bit taken aback by Shirobako approach though. Rather than focusing on telling us a story about people making Japanese animation, it puts on the forefront the actually process itself, often completely stopping the story to show us how some particular aspect of the media is produced. Fortunately all this stuff is quite interesting, and explained in a veryfast and snappy way (although I prefer very much scenes when we just see the character *doing* things, rather than the ones in which the two comic relief mascots just describe how something works).\\n\\n\r\nTying this \"technical showcase\" together there is what is actually pretty decent drama, with a large cast of characters characterized just enough to make the endless crunch time squabbles quite gripping and entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nWhat lacks though, is a bit of cynicism, which I honestly think is quite needed when talking about industrially produced art. This is not to say that the series pulls its punches about what happens in the industry (hell one of the first thing we see is an animator fainting from the sheer amount of work she had just completed), but more simply it just doesn't really seems to acknowledge that some things it's showing us are not necessarily... good... or normal. This get touched a bit in the second season, but quickly brushed away by... basically getting the character who was posing those issues drunk (lovely...).\\n\\n\r\nAbout the second season it is also worth to note that while the first one manages pretty well to be grounded and relatively serious, the second season has quite a bit of wackiness added to it. Not enough to really be off-putting, but still, the tone shift can be felt.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I quite enjoyed this. It takes an in-depth look at how Japanese animation gets made while at the same time managing to tell a good story about crunch time, creativity and industry issues.\\n",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: Miyamori Aoi (Kimura, Juri), a young production assistant at the animation studio Musashino Animation, entered into the anime industry in order to pursue her aspirations of making an animated feature with her high-school friends. Two years after graduating, Aoi and her friends have taken various career paths within the animation industry in order to reach their goal however their respective professions are far more challenging than they once imagined. Shirobako follows the day to day struggles of Aoi and Musashino Animation as well as the members of her high-school animation club as they all try toprogress within the industry, meet deadlines, and create a compelling animated feature.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]: \\n\\n\r\nShirobako has an enormous cast of characters and so rather than going one-by-one and talking about each one of them individually, I\u2019ll use this space to address the cast as a whole and highlight certain aspects of it with the exception of our main character Aoi who deserves her own description due to her central role in the show.\\n\\n\r\nMiyamori Aoi serves as our eyes through which we view Musashino Animation and therein the anime industry itself. She exhibits the enthusiasm and the uncertainty of someone new to the industry while still having a bit of time under her belt so that we aren\u2019t presented with an entirely novice viewpoint. She is hardworking and her determination makes her endearing in the face of the studio\u2019s many struggles and obstacles throughout the show. The one eccentricity that may come off as odd or ineffective within the show that concerns Aoi is her tendency to fantasize about her stuffed toys (a toy bear and a pirate girl) who share dialogue with one another and often speak to some element of the show sometimes in an explanatory manner. I didn\u2019t find their presence to be particularly helpful or funny and so they felt a little unnecessary and intruded upon an otherwise realistic setting but luckily they don\u2019t appear all that often and they are not nearly the main method of explanation.\\n\\n\r\nThe members of the cast that the show most frequently features are the members of Musashino ranging from the director to the key animators on top of all of the support staff involved. Each character has some history in the industry and their experiences and knowledge make them who they are as characters as well as their individual personalities and quirks such as the director\u2019s traumatizing last project Jiggly Jiggly Heaven and his tendency to always complete storyboards late. While the cast doesn\u2019t quite allow for full on character development of every member, there are more than a few that receive quite substantial attention and grow considerably throughout the course of the show. The cast is realistic, compelling, and lovable and a strong point of the show. One quick thing to note is that Shirobako makes constant references and homages to various voice actors, industry members, and other shows which can be interesting and fun to pick out.\\n\\n\r\nLastly I think it is an important thing to note that Shirobako plays out somewhat unconventionally in regards to Aoi\u2019s friends from high-school. While Yasuhara Ema works alongside her at Musashino her other friends are far less present than one might think based on the premise of the show. They each have their own struggles such as working an unpleasant job and breaking away from the pack and making an impact however the action and attention of the show is spent first and foremost at Musashino and so the full cast of Aoi\u2019s friends shows up less frequently than one might think. I think these characters were treated extremely fairly and there is still plenty of them to go around \u2013 they just aren\u2019t the central focus of the show. Their progression or lack thereof at times helps reinforce the daunting nature of the industry they work in and went well with the realistic setting of the show as they struggle to find jobs or determine what they want to do.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nI can hardly think of a better studio than P.A. Works to do a show like Shirobako which revolves around and discusses art and animation within itself. The quality of the show never drops noticeably, the character designs are unique, varied, and dynamic, and the setting itself, while having the potential to be bland, is anything but \u2013 the office setting is interesting and littered with various posters and utensils that give the setting life alongside the characters. The animation of the show is fantastic as well as the facial expressions of the characters especially in the infrequent emotional scenes. Shirobako, by means of its premise, felt highly aware of what it was attempting to do in this department and P.A. Works executed things excellently.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nWhile Shirobako has a handful of sub-plots within it, the main story is quite straightforward \u2013 it follows Aoi and Musashino Animation as they work on the studio\u2019s latest animated features, detailing each step of the process from the voice acting, to the key frames, to the impressions that the director wants the ultimate product to express and convey. Because of this, Shirobako ends up being quite informative of the process and techniques present in anime however it does so in clever ways and without hamfistedly explaining itself to the viewer. Nobody is going to break character, look directly at the screen, and lay out the finer points of key animation or why recuts are necessary \u2013 the work and the characters are mostly allowed to speak for themselves and this upholds the natural and realistic slice of life setting depicted in the show. The only instance where this might feel infringed upon is in the case of Aoi\u2019s stuffed toys however they exist more as a gag and to speak to her adolescence rather than as informative insert figures and the scenes where they end up explaining something are highly infrequent which I was thankful of.\\n\\n\r\nI think one of the strongest points of the show is in its depiction of the anime industry and the work done by Musashino Animation \u2013 Shirobako, for the most part, does not glamorize the process and speaks to a good many of the harsh conditions and inherent problems within anime and in this way becomes far more interesting as a show than if it tried to fully romanticize the stressful process. Despite the slice of life approach of the show which is normally associated with a relaxing atmosphere along with the other tenets of the genre Shirobako is often nerve-racking and anxious in its delivery which I thought was executed perfectly. I felt stressed along with the characters and between the realistic struggles depicted, the music, and the characters themselves I felt myself most drawn in to these tribulations. One of my favorite elements of Shirobako is its use of emotion and drama. I hardly think these moments are frequent enough in the show for it to truly deserve the drama tag however when these scenes roll around they are absolutely astounding and heartfelt. The show has a tasteful avoidance of melodrama which is something P.A. Works has struggled with in the past. Each stressful moment, character meltdown, and teary-eyed scene felt absolutely legitimized and their infrequency lent itself well to the realistic setting and characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show has a great number of outside references and homages to other works and real life people there is other interesting work being done within the shows Musashino is working on \u2013 the sub-shows. I think these shows bring a few things to the table, the first being that by being dramatic or action-based in their own right, Shirobako is allowed to experience these genres and scenes vicariously which can liven up the far more mundane setting of the show. Secondly, there are often parallels drawn between the characters and situations present in the sub-shows with those existent in Shirobako itself. One of the recurring themes or questions in the show is how those at Musashino Animation as well as those at other studios can rationalize working in such a difficult industry given all of their day to day struggles and this uncertainty plays out within the show\u2019s sub-stories in interesting and effective ways.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Shirobako takes an otherwise mundane setting full of complications and breathes life into it as well as its large cast of characters expertly. The show does a fantastic job of conveying each characters wonderment and enjoyment of their work while still presenting a difficult environment in which they struggle resulting in an ultimately realistic yet hopeful tone.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Shirobako was pretty par for the course insofar as it did not take center stage hardly ever and remained more or less unnoticeable throughout with a handful of exceptions. This approach felt typical due to its slice of life elements however I think the show does an admirable job in that, while the music existed simply to add to each individual scene without stealing the show, its presence greatly benefited certain individual scenes especially in the cases where there was a turn of events, a dramatic moment, or a stressful circumstance. There is not much takeaway in this category however the music does what it needs to and works well for the show.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nShirobako was fun from start to finish. Miyamori Aoi was an especially fantastic character and the greater part of the cast was highly enjoyable as well. The adult characters were a breath of fresh air in a medium rampant with high-school characters and clubs. I think Shirobako is a show that is far more enjoyable than its initial premise might let on and while it does not follow Aoi and her friends as they attempt to make a place for themselves in the anime industry as closely as its premise might suggest, I think the end product was more entertaining than it might have otherwise been. Definitely a must-watch for anyone interested in any of the elements present in the show.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 8\\n\\n\r\nI gave Shirobako an 8 because it was one of the better slice of life anime I have seen and deserves a high rating to match this praise. It was informative without feeling overly pandering to the uninformed individual. The emotional moments and self-doubts that the characters experienced were excellent and well-founded, avoiding the potential use of melodrama in full. The cast was full of unique characters and the vast majority of them avoided falling into one archetype or another which, along with every other element of the show, worked perfectly in order to bring about the realistic setting in which the story unfolded.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Shirobako to any lover of the slice of life genre however would caution that while the show's approach does mirror that of a slice of life show its setting and tone do not necessarily follow suit - it is stressful and uneasy more often than not and so it doesn't entirely capture the relaxed tones often present. That being said, it is still an excellent show in respects to that genre. While it does not rely on specific jokes or gags, Shirobako is a pretty decent comedy on top of everything else and the characters of Aoi and the director are quite fun. Lastly, anyone interested in learning about how anime is made and what kind of conditions and complications are present in the industry should absolutely pick up this show as it offers a unique and mostly realistic approach to the subject while remaining interesting on so many other levels simultaneously.",

            "content": "(I've kept it PG until now. Pardon my French.)\r\nEdited to add: Watch the end credits in the second half for a fast-forwarded look at how one frame of animation is made. Evolving credits animation like this is really cool in my book.\r\nEver wonder how anime is made? Well, wonder no more. Here's how a group of high school girls did it.\r\n... Yeah, not so easy, is it?\r\nSlight, slight tangent here: I used to edit anime articles in Wikipedia. One time, this editor was laying into an edit I made, ending with the assertion, \"Anime isn't done on a whim, it's meticulously planned.\"\r\nWhich is, of course,complete and utter bullshit-- GOOD anime is well-planned and organized, terrible anime is terrible because of even just one hasty, poorly-thought-out decision. I've seen terrible anime by the truckload. I can now pick apart where they went wrong to a reasonable degree (and the cause is so often in the (lack of) planning or scenario writing, or a director who just wants to see boobs), and that's largely due to how Shirobako exposed the entire sausage-making process, especially in cour 2. This show should be required viewing for anyone who aspires to be an anime critic. It's one thing to blast on Twitter DJT-style that you don't like a show, it's quite another to be able to point to where the bad decision was made, and how it affected the rest of the production.\\n\\n\r\n(To wrap up the tangent: that guy was correct according to the rules in place at the time, but he was also a typical WP asshole editor, kinda like a Japanese artisan: \"You're doing it wrong, and I'm not going to help you.\")\\n\\n\r\nThe themes of Shirobako are: (1) Anime is Hard, yo. (2) There are so many ways an anime production can go horribly, horribly wrong, and the audience never sees it. Seriously, there are so many powerful interests that can yank the chain of a small production house, you wonder how they get the job done, even knowing how the process works. There's also incompetent PAs, crappy animation studios, egocentric artists, a hard-to-handle director, and you can start to understand why the POC's favorite (?) phrase is \"I'm out of options!\"\\n\\n\r\nOf course, if the show was only about the sausage-making, it would be recommended as treatment for insomniacs. No, this show is also about the journeys of the aforementioned high school girls as they try to eke out careers in the anime business. This drama is probably the best part of the show-- the characters are relatable, their struggles are realistic, they are detailed, they grow, and when they reach the end of the show, that is a satisfying moment indeed. I can see someone griping that some of the girls are too whiny, well... put yourself in their shoes. You've taken a job you've always wanted, and you're slowly finding out it's not quite what you thought it was, and you're bashing your head against a wall, not sure if you want to change careers or soldier onward because you don't know if you'll really earn that next paycheck. Wouldn't you feel down in the dumps, even for a moment? If not, well, you're a better person than I am. I suppose some people don't really want to see those characters dwell on that, and perhaps an argument could be made that it does feel like filler.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had any complaints, it's probably the editing in some spots. In one scene a PA barges into a rogue production studio to get them on the right track, and in the next she's magically teleported to a fishing hole to convince a homeless guy to do some work. That's probably the worst example, but I bet I could find others when I watch it again.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is all right. There's a couple of tracks with a common theme, and it's a bit of a shame that this theme is just \"there\" rather than a more integral part of the show, but that sort of thing is actually rare in anime.\\n\\n\r\n(Abbreviations: I'm told these are actual Hollywood terms for these roles)\\n\r\nPA: Production assistant\\n\r\nPOC: Production office coordinator, or as the Japanese calls him/her, \"Desk.\"",

            "content": "(After watching final episode) I'm not crying, you're crying!\r\nOn to the review!\r\nI loved the story of this show, the premise immediately caught my attention when it was recommended to me and it did not disappoint. \"An anime about making an anime? Sure, that could be fun!\" I thought the insight into the effort (and all the frustrating delays) that go into making anime was wonderful to watch over the duration of the show. I'll admit that, as a creative freelancer myself, this story resonated with me on a personal level and I felt it reflected what it's like to work on a project as ateam of individuals all striving for greatness. I was surprised at the depth this anime had too, as it showed the path each person had in achieving/figuring out their dream.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is what let this show drop from what could've been a 9 rating to an 8. While it was not bad by any means and there were some lovely moments of animation, especially when reviewing the creative process of the anime they were creating, in general this type of design doesn't overly impress me. I tend to lean towards striking art styles that can look a bit ugly at times, perhaps somewhat sketchy, rather than the clean look that this show had for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were wonderful, while I thought the show would follow the five girls that are featured in the description I was pleasantly surprised at how much time was spent developing a vast cast of characters. I tend to gravitate towards female characters in general, but most of my favourite characters in this show were the men. They felt so genuine and for lack of a better description, real. I could tell that the writer of this show definitely used some real life experience to create such a colourful cast. I found myself pleasantly surprised at Shizuka's arc, which honestly had me crying like a baby by the end of it. The payoff of each character's story was so beautifully told and delivered, with minor exceptions such as with Misa and the late to the story Ai (who I found annoying for the most part!)\\n\\n\r\nIt's usually a good sign if I end up watching episode after episode of a show, one lazy Sunday I think I watched about 5 episodes in a row. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a funny, heart warming, slice of life story. For now I'll rate this an 8, but in time and with subsequent viewings it may creep up to a 9.",

It took forever to complete this one, but oh goodness, this show is awesome. If you want to know how the anime industry works and how your favorite shows are made, please, take a look at this series and you won't be disappointed.\r\nStory: 10/10.\r\nThe story seems pretty simple at first, maybe a bit boring if you are not a fan of slice of life, but each episode is dedicated to the difficult process of making anime. And what I like about this story is thefact that things do not always go well. It doesn't just show the process itself, explaining how things are done, it also shows the problems that may occur in the process and that's what makes it so awesome: all these complications that make this story believable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10.\\n\r\nMaybe it's not exactly unique, but I liked everything about it, from character designs to color schemes, as well as amazing, smooth animation. No complaints here at all, I enjoyed every single bit of it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10.\\n\r\nCan we take a moment to appreciate the voice acting in this anime? Opening songs and the soundtrack are a bit generic, which stops me from giving this aspect a higher mark, but trust me, this kind of anime doesn't have to rely on the soundtrack at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10.\\n\r\nI loved them. I loved all of them and I cannot believe how likable they all are. This show only seems long but, when you finish watching it, you're starting to miss these guys because it feels like they've become your good friends and you're not ready to say goodbye to them just yet. They make mistakes, they work hard and they are all dedicated to their job. In the anime industry, every single person is important regardless of their role and it's amazing. THEY are amazing. I love them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10.\\n\r\nSure, not all aspects of this difficult process may seem interesting. Sure, this show is not revolutionary. But it has a great atmosphere that makes you genuinely care for every single character. You worry about them when things go wrong and you're happy when they succeed and to me, it is very important.\\n\\n\r\nI can go on an on, saying how amazing and interesting this anime is, but guess what? There's no time to explain, just watch it and see it yourself.",

            "content": "Introduction:\r\nShirobako is a great example of the hardships any team project could undergo and the individual struggles the creators experience. It manages to convey a sentimental story with characters that feel real and their problems - relatable. In this review, I'll try to explain exactly why Shirobako might be considered a modern classic.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story revolves around five alumnae and their mutual goal of making an anime together. The plot revolves around the characters and relies on them to keep it moving, so if you expect a complex worldbuilding this anime is not for you. Otherwise the story is straightforward and simple, yet well-paced andgripping. Exception are the last few episodes for their misfitting over-the-topness. The series are deprived of plot-holes and the tastefully placed twists, while not so unpredictable, are still exciting.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is visually stimulating and fits the tone of the show. Even so, I think the style is a tad bit too \"moe\". While generally a comedy, the show also has its deeper mature moments and in these moments I was wishing for a style akin to something like Cencoroll or Kiznaiver. Despite that, all characters are well-animated and vibrant, with the low quality moments being countable on one hand. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThere is nothing in particular I want to note about the sound; it was pretty standard for a show of its kind. However, the OPs made me sing with the lyrics with my whole heart and I never missed an ED while watching.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nHere is where the show shines the most. As mentioned above, the characters' worries strongly related to me. I'm sure the very creators of these series used their own experience as a fuel for them. Beside the expected work-related problems, every now and then a more philosophical and existential problems appear, while still maintaining the lighthearted tone of the anime. The supporting cast is as strong as the leads. The only problem was that some characters were left underdeveloped and unexplored and I believe it is because of their large number.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\r\nI obviously enjoyed the ride this show provided (so much so that I watched it twice). However, there is still to be desired. That is why, even after claiming a spot on my list of favorites, I'll refrain from giving it a perfect score. If P.A. Works ever make a sequel, they are count me in as a potential viewer. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S.\\n\r\nEma-chan is best girl.",

Shirobako is that story, a well-written glimpse of the inner works done in the industry of anime.\r\nWhat makes Shirobako so great is that it is a creative slice-of-life that focused on the everyday struggles of being in the anime industry. That pretty much summed it up, simplicity in its perfect form. This anime combined information and entertainment into one flawless story. Insight and processes of the works done in creating an anime had a perfect pacing which was enoughto focus on different aspects such as storyboarding, animating, and voice-acting. The explanations were not too dumb-downed nor unnecessarily complicated, being sufficiently genuine towards its audience. I had a blast in seeing the behind-the-scenes through the huge cast of characters, each having their own dreams and skills to go about their career. Not only were they fleshed out and realistic in most parts, they had a diverse range of personalities that led to great character interactions between each other. In life, failures and successes will meet you along the way. How the characters support each other in the easy or harder times was an aspect that appealed to me. Even though they were adults, I can still feel their magnetic youthfulness in their heart, expressed through their passion for anime. Whether that'd be light banters of differing viewpoints (think 2D vs 3D) or their will to overcome all kinds of obstacles in producing their anime, they shone brightly in my eyes. Seeing their anime progress at the end of some episodes, you can say I shared their excitement as the finishing line became more visible.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show with creativity as one of its theme, the consistent art style removed any break of flow so the story was more enjoyable to absorb in. The modern setting of office rooms, city sceneries, and the characters themselves was mostly colored with bright cheerfulness. Character expressions amplified the positive tone as they were funny in the mature comedic situations that were not overly exaggerated. Like their personalities, they were diverse in appearance. There was the young and old, the fat and skinny, the big and small. Honestly, as odd as it may sound, it was a refreshing quality after watching a lot of anime with characters of similar body structures. In a way, they were adorable adults. The simple soundtracks matched the overall easy-going nature in the atmosphere, lifting up the mood. Seiyuus did an awesome job in being dynamic with their voices. Mild drama or lightheartedness, their voices brought in the right emotions and feelings in. They acted their respective dialogues well to make the communication with other characters more enjoyable to hear, creating many fun social times. And I have to appreciate the details present during the production of their anime. An example would be the sketches of the key animation and how they look in motion from one page to another. It's the little things in the visuals that made me admire the works done in making an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout watching, all the way towards the end, it felt like P.A. Works gave all their feelings in Shirobako, for us, themselves, and of course for the rest of the people in the industry. An original gift of well-made qualities, this is a show for anime fans to see the side of the ones who gave us their animation.",

It's a very human story, and at times very touching, especially as all the girls have to deal with failurein their own way, and you don't know whether they are all going to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nThere are surreal moments when a fantasy section is used (for the first half of the series it's only used for describing the protagonist's emotional turmoil, whilst in the second half it's also used for technical exposition).  These add an interesting and touching section to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very good, although at times could be more fluid.

The animation is bright and colorful but it doesn't feel annoying or hard-to-watch. The music doesn't have any stand out tracks, but it is used well to make the scenes have more impact be that the sad ones or happy ones. The Openings and Endings are alsovery catchy and I rarely skipped them.\\n\r\nIf you want to see how anime is made, am sure the show itself doesn't show it in detail, but if you want to have at least some knowledge i would recommend this to you.\\n\r\nThank you for reading ! :)",

This is going to be a hit or miss for some people; either you are interested in how anime is made or you aren't.\r\nI was pretty indifferent going in, but I'm actually glad i stuck it out.  For starters, there isn't much of a story here, its a semi-realistic look into how anime is made from the perspective of our lead Production staff member, Aoi.\r\nIt starts by throwing you into a whirlwind of terminology and the hectic pace of office life in a rather small production company.After the first few episodes it became quite apparent that this really was a true slice of life; comparable to Bakuman but without many of the fun quirks and fantastical drama and elements.\\n\\n\r\nLike i mentioned above, there isn't much story, but the premise centers around five female friends who vowed to work in the anime industry in highschool, fast forward a few years and most of the members have jobs and the naive dreams have somewhat faded with the reality of modern work life setting in.  Shirobako does a great job of setting up a pretty dismal view of life for an anime staffer: tons of overtime, lonely studio apartment, mountains of stress, endless workloads, etc.  While the overall tone is qutie cheerful, made so by our main heroine, the setting is pretty stark.\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't really the most amazing, but sometimes it really blows you away when they want to show off.  Sound was pretty forgettable but had alot of range and fit nicely for a slow moving slice of life with minimal setting.\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest part by far were the characters; this would be a horribly boring show without the quirkiness and diverse personalities that filled the series.  There's plenty of character progression, regression, and internal strife to go around, if you're into that sort of thing.  And not to mention the many hurdles and pitfalls that many of the characters need to overcome.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Many of us have aspirations throughout our lives. Whether it be that dream job you constantly thought about when you were younger or a recent goal you set for yourself, having aspirations will always be a vital part of reaching our goals. Shirobako aims to express the difficulties one may face in finding their own aspirations whilst also demonstrating the importance of having the drive and ambition to achieve them.\r\nTackling the mundane and sometimes, frantic workplace struggle, Shirobako still manages to be entertaining thanks to its snappy pacing which makes even the small indulgences that Shirobako gives itself in the form of explaining every tinydetail about a process, (which some may find unimportant) to not feel too wearisome on the viewer. Many of the workplace conflicts in the show revolve around the idea of meeting a deadline and the levels of drama or angst are never overblown, instead staying grounded to reality. There is also no shortage of charming side stories along the way and we even get a glimpse into the happenings of the old Musashino Animation way back when. The occasional over-exaggerated comedy routine or magical moments with those talking dolls also helps in adding some flavor to the narrative, making the series even more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako does a great job of utilizing the topical premise of 'making an Anime' to demonstrate its concepts and is actually rather informative for someone looking to get some detailed insight into the process of making an Anime. Nearly all of the aspects that go into making an Anime ranging from the creation of key frames to the voice selection process and even field research, are covered extensively. We are also offered a look into the everyday lives of the animators, production staff and many others in the industry.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the first few episodes, you may feel a little overwhelmed by Shirobako's huge cast of characters as many of the staff members of Musashino Animation are quickly introduced. Some of them (particularly the new recruits introduced towards the end) gave the impression that their development arcs were cut short but none of them felt completely unimportant or irrelevant to the story. For the duration of the show, a considerable portion of the cast get a certain degree of characterization and ultimately development through the struggles they encounter. As they go about their hectic work lives, you start to learn more about their personality quirks and flaws and hey, you might even end up empathizing with a few of them, cheering for them to succeed whenever they encounter any obstacles along the way.\\n\\n\r\nIt was also a welcome sight to see no traces of fan service in the form of beach visits, shower scenes or any other sorts of contrived events, even with the main cast being all females. That really allows us to appreciate the characters more so on their personalities rather than something trivial like how their bodies look.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest strength of Shirobako are its solid and ubiquitous themes about dreams and ambitions. Especially for those working in creative industries, some of the troubles the characters face throughout the show may hit close to home. Shirobako also manages to apply those themes to nearly every member of the cast, with each of them having or working towards dreams of their own, some examples being Shizuka's aspirations of being a voice actress, Honda's desire to run a bakery and the list goes on.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I can't deny that Shirobako's portrayal of the industry is somewhat idealized and definitely should not be taken as an entirely accurate representation of reality. However, a second glance may reveal that there is still an air of despondency looming in the background, with characters struggling with their self-worth and motivations. Even more so with Hiraoka, who is already feeling jaded and cynical after his experience in the industry. So, while you shouldn't expect Shirobako to be some sort of a pessimistic expos\u00e9 of the dark sides of the industry, it does not completely sugarcoat the experience of working in it either.\\n\\n\r\nWith the art and animation being provided by P.A. Works, expect to see many beautiful and detailed backgrounds. The colors were vibrant but not too overbearing. Many of the characters display some lovely and humorous expressions from time to time and the use of CGI is kept to a minimum. The soundtrack, although not having any exceptional pieces which stood out, still fits nicely to the wide range of atmospheres present in the show.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako is a love letter towards the industry itself. A passionate piece of work made by creators who want to showcase what they love. It manages to remain grounded with a tinge of over-the-top moments and fantasy elements thrown in to add to the amusement. With a huge cast filled with endearing characters, it executes its central themes splendidly while managing to provide a great deal of insight into the intricate process of making an Anime. If you're someone who has any sort of interest in how an Anime is actually made or are just simply looking for a nice piece of infotainment, Shirobako is certainly something you should consider checking out.",

            "content": "Shirobako is something that I picked up just out of chance. I've been meaning to watch it for a long time, but never really got around to it. But after finishing the series yesterday, I'm very glad that I did, and it easily storms it's way into my personal top ten list. \r\nThe story is that of Miyamori Aoi and her friends, who have made a promise to each other to continue their passion to create anime and turn it into a profession by working in the anime industry. At first, it seems like a regular high school anime, which almost made me want todrop after the first minute or two of the pilot. But I was very glad that I didn't. Fast forward to the future, Miyamori and her friend, Ema, have found a job in Musashino Animation Studios. Miyamori is a Production Assistant, and Ema works as an animator. The other friends each have their own talents, Imai is the script writer, trying to find work. Misa Todo is the CGI expert, working in a different studio. The final character is Miss Shizuka Sakaki, an aspiring voice actress trying to find work. This anime is very realistic of how the animation industry, or any office works. Most of the time, you see all the characters trying to meet the deadline, deliver stuff, get held up by delays, workplace arguments, etc. Through the story, you find each of the characters, both main and side, discover a reason why they work in the animation industry. Some of them came with bright dreams like Aoi and some just had nowhere else to go. It's very reminiscent of the real world, where not everyone is working in a place they want to be, where everyone doesn't like each other. Some of the characters downright hate each other, although they don't really show it in the office, because you'd get fired. The amazing thing about Shirobako is that almost every character in the anime develops and moves forward from who they were in the beginning, not just the main characters. Be it Aoi herself, or an artist who just goes about working daily and goes home, all of them transform and provide an incredibly dynamic atmosphere to this series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nYou could very well think that Shirobako almost didn't do anything in the sound department other than the acting. But that doesn't mean it's bad. In fact, this is one of the anime's shining points. Leaving the voice actors aside, who did a brilliant job (I often imagined Shizuka's voice actor smiling as she voiced her lines. A voice actor voicing an aspiring voice actor. How could you not?!) Shirobako doesn't go heavy handed with the music. It allows the dialogue to take the center stage, and just provides an accompaniment when required. There's even an episode where they discuss sound effects like walking in rain, monster sounds, etc. Overall, the only gripe that I had with Shirobako in the sound department was the OP and ED, which werent' really catchy or memorable. \\n\\n\r\nI think I speak for the majority when I say that modern anime art has become incredibly annoying. Most anime have over-sexualized characters, horrible choice of color palettes, bad animation work, or worse, a mix of all three. You don't really see quality work coming in nowadays, and even if you do, it's rare. I'm not sure how Shirobako avoided all of this. For an anime that has such a normal story of how the anime industry works, the art is amazingly vibrant and colorful. The characters are, by the strictest definition, moe, but in no way is that a bad thing. The characters look amazing and the vibrant color palette isn't jarring. In fact, it's pretty darn endearing to see such care and work go into this anime. You can tell the animators took extra special care with each frame, just to show the world how their world is. It certainly is a love letter to the anime industry and anime fans, from the anime industry itself. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime left me wanting more. If you're interested in knowing how the animation industry works, then this is the anime for you. If you want a realistic and emotional story, then this is the anime for you. If you want an inspiring tale of how to be better at what you do, whether it be school, college, or work, then this is the anime for you. If you want the usual tripe of huge breasted anime girls frolicking and panty shots every other scene, then this is not the anime for you. Shirobako is definitely one of the best anime to have ever come out, and I do not say this lightly. The amount of love and care PA Works put into this production is mind blowing. For me, it felt as though each person who worked on this wanted to tell me their story, their experiences with the industry. My dearest wish would be to face each person who worked on this anime and thank them for one of the most beautiful stories that I have ever come across. If you're confused about picking up this anime, then throw away the confusion and watch the anime. I can guarantee you that you will not be disappointed.",

            "content": "Ok, first off I would like to premise this is my first ever review so please don't flame me too hard if I mess something up. \r\nShirobako is a 2014 anime about... making anime. \r\nThe story starts off with 5 girls in a high school animation club trying their hardest to make a anime short. The anime then fast forwards up until 2 of the girls have acquired their dream job and continues to follow their endeavors to survive.\r\n------\r\nStory\r\n------\r\nThere is very little plot to this anime as it is mostly focused on the life of a production assistant and what it's like to be inthe anime industry. It mainly focuses on educating the viewer on the struggles and hardships of being an employee in one of these companies. One major gripe I have with this anime is that near the end of the anime, it flip flops constantly between the main story with the girls and the side story of trying to finish their anime. Like please Shirobako, make up your mind about who to focus on. Death Parade is an example of this as it also switches its main story constantly, but instead of anime and girls, they have Quindecim customers and the black haired woman. Overall, I give this story a 7/10\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nThe art isn't particularly good or bad. It does it's job well and that's that. \\n\r\nOne very minor flaw is that every girl's face looks almost identical. If it wasn't for their unique hairstyles and clothes, I wouldn't be able to distinguish them. 8/10\\n\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nThe sound is very good despite how little of it there is. Many scenes do not include music at all and is filled with a surplus of dialogue. However, when the music does show up, it captures the scene perfectly. Minor spoilers ahead? \\n\r\nOne example of this is when they almost fail to turn in an episode on time. The track really makes you feel the danger they are in and it gives off an immersive experience. 10/10\\n\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nThis show has one of the biggest casts I have ever seen for an anime that isn't one of the big three. 106 if I counted correctly. They throw a big chunk of these characters at you near the very beginning of the show and only provide a little text box on the side for their names. Never a proper introduction. This is very hard to keep up with at first, but will eventually settle down and you will get to know each character more and more as they flesh them out. \\n\r\nOne of the characters however, I feel is overly done. The shows slapstick comedy character, Takanashi Tarou, is beyond the funny aspect and is borderline obnoxious. I have found myself asking, \"Why in the world has this guy not been fired yet?!\" Literally every action he does somehow messes things up or angers the cast.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\n------------------------\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment\\n\r\n------------------------\\n\r\nThis show was an absolute blast to watch. I believe I did a marathon of the show and completed it within the course of two nights. Every single episode left me wanting more and I never felt like it was a chore, hitting that 'next episode' button. It was very relaxing and different compared to the darker, more serious works that I like to watch. The characters were very lovable and taught me quite a few things about the production of anime. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this a 9/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nSome recommendations I have are:\\n\r\nAll three seasons of Bakuman. Bakuman is very similar to Shirobako, but instead of anime, they include the production of manga. Includes a sweet love story on the side.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for a blind pick, I have Hibike!Euphonium. Hibike! and Shirobako have girls who are working hard striving for their dreams. Both include hardships between the girls, whether it be inferiority, or not being able to get your spot as a seiyuu.",

            "content": "Shirobako is a focused meta-anime (anime about people making anime). It centers around Aoi Miyamori, a young producer in a small anime studio, and it comprises of variety of characters who also work in the industry. \r\nDuring this review, I'll contrast two other anime with a strong meta focus; Bakuman (6.5/8.0/7.5), a story about two guys trying to make it as mangaka and Sore ga Seiyuu (7.0), a story about three girls who try to make it as (you guessed it) seiyu. \r\nThere is a fourth anime I haven't watch, called Love Get Tsu, but it doesn't seem as meta focused as the other threeand has a low rating, so I didn't bother. If someone has a strong opinion either for or against this anime, feel free to message me. \\n\\n\r\nLet's start discussing Shirobako. Like this review, it starts slow. The story begins with Aoi and her four high-school friends promising each other that sometime they will remake their high-school anime club production as full-fledged professionals in the anime industry. I cannot fathom why writers feel the need to use such clich\u00e9s. This subplot offers nothing to the story and whenever it comes up, it only drags the episode down. \\n\r\nA second fault with the the first episodes, is that Aoi interacts with a ton of characters and their dialogues are full of industry jargon, which can make the initial episodes tiring. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, after the viewer settles in, Shirobako picks up a pleasant pace and is entertaining to watch. There are many interesting characters occupying the various components of anime making.\\n\r\nOf course, with so many characters present, one can not expect any decent character development, even for the main ones. Instead, Shirobako focuses on the conflicts of the various personalities on work related themes. Those conflicts (and their resolutions) manage to be informative and pleasant.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the first few episodes, the writers continued their efforts to annoy me; Aoi has some crises, were she contemplates what she wants to do in her life, while she just got a promotion on a job she loves. I suspect that the whole charade was instigated so that she could give a \u201cheart-warming\u201d speech in the end. Which she does. And feels forced and unnecessary; the story was heart-warming enough without the use of such devices. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is nothing special. There was an scene where a traditional animator was rambling about how he doesn't like 3d animators and the fact that 3d seems to be the future of anime. In the next scene there is an ugly 3d-modeled car; I sure hope the creators didn't want to imply that we will have to make do with such unaesthetic 3d rendered objects.\\n\\n\r\nOut of the three anime mentioned, Bakuman is the clear winner on characters. Shirobako's and Sore ga Seiyuu's characters are nothing special. \\n\r\nBakuman has a stronger shounen element inside, meaning it offers some great peaks in some episodes, but the shounen element also means an annoying dose of stupidity at times. Shirobako is about as good as Bakuman and its quality is more even, especially after the first episodes. Sore ga Seiyuu is a close but distinct third. \\n\\n\r\nAs depiction of the industry goes, Sore ga Seiyuu wins by a large margin. While Shirobako doesn't go as far as to glorify the industry, it certainly offers a romanticized narrative. Bakuman has more realistic foundation on its depiction of the manga industry, but a lot of times goes all shounen on us. Sore ga Seiyuu, almost involuntarily, offers some visceral scenes regarding the seiyu industry which, I have to say, caught me off guard. But in a good way. \\n\\n\r\nIf you liked any one of three, I would recommend the other two. Shirobako, with its uplifting story, would speak to a wider audience; that's the one to start with. 7.5/10.",

            "content": "Genuine. That's the word I would describe Shirobako with. Its presentation of the struggles in professional careers are incredibly blunt yet sharp at the same time, and never pulls any punches. Sometimes this show hurts to watch because of how close it can hit home, but it's a good pain that'll ultimately leave you coming out happy. \r\nThe visuals are great, and PA Works deserve serious credit for all the effort they put in. They somehow made a show about animating things in an office look compelling without going overboard with nonsensical effects or backdrops typical of most (slice of life) anime. When a characterdraws, you see every detail in their hand movement, as well as their drawing. When an emotion's expressed, their face is exaggerated to an entertaining degree, but never obnoxiously breaks the character's figure.The colors are well chosen and vibrant, but restrained enough to keep some sense of realism. Thus, the visuals are very immersive and really suck you in, despite the show being about supposedly mundane workplace scenarios. \\n\\n\r\nDespite a huge cast, almost all the characters in this show are believable and likable, and because of this, you will relate to them even if you're not in their career. Whenever conflicts arise, both sides will have valid reasons for their beliefs, and everyone has their own charming personality quirks. Everyone also has their own moment to shine, elevating their characters, and even providing genuinely touching moments. The only character I didn't like was the one who can't seem to speak properly; she was annoying and just seemed to be there for the sake of having an overly moe character. The five main girls however, are all very well realized characters, but interestingly enough, they're really not the main focus of the show. You just happen to be viewing life through Aoi's perspective; the real main character is the production studio team, and the show portrays it exceptionally well. There's a real sense of comradery in Shirobako, and it's always a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can guess, the writing in general is superb. The storytelling is very grounded and relatable. When it does become exaggerated, it's only to provide a more impactful and interesting plot, and usually comes out quite charming since it's used sparingly. However, I can't recommend this show to anyone who is not very familiar with anime, because it expects you to know certain trends and other references within the industry. This isn't really a flaw though, considering Shirobako would become really boring if they info-dumped too much, and they do at least explain many technical terms used in the anime production for uninitiated viewers. Despite a barrier of entry, I can assure that any curious mind who passes it will become very interested. The way it presents awkward social situations or workplace troubles will likely manage to grip you every time from how well paced and honest Shirobako is. The writing is so natural that it honestly comes out looking effortless; a trait indicative of masterful work. \\n\\n\r\nShirobako isn't the most bombastic show of all time, but it doesn't need to be. It's a humble series that only tries to directly represent the struggles of real life. Despite this, or perhaps I should say because of this, it manages to be insightful, inspiring, thought-provoking, and even educational. The way Shirobako delivers all this is honestly second to none; it's a sorely under-watched crown jewel to the medium of television shows in general. Shirobako is the most well-made anime I've ever watched, and the first TV anime I gave a 10 to. I can't recommend it enough.",

The story also include the other character( female protagonist's friends) on their determination on achieving their own dream. Anyway, the story is nice and brings out a lot of moral value and it worth to be getting 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter:(10/10)\\n\r\nThe character in this anime is good and doesn't make the audience feels irritate or annoying. Every character has their own chance of showing their face in the anime. To be honest, i love all their character in the anime.\\n\r\nSound:(7/10)\\n\r\nAbout the opening and ending sound in shirobako, i feel like they lacks of something. They just cant attrack me but its not like they are not good. The songs are good but they just seems to be too general.\\n\r\nEnjoyment\uff0810/10)\\n\r\nI enjoy this anime really so much. I hope that it has second season as soon as possible. Although it doesn't has any true climax, but it still attract me to watch the next episode every time.\\n\r\nOverall:(10/10)\\n\r\nIn short, after watching this anime, i gaib knowledge about the difficultly and challenge s on making an great anime. I know more about the staff and procedure on making anime too. This anime is suitable for all the people to watch. I would recommend this anime to everyone who love drama type anime. Thank you.\\n\\n",

            "content": "MAL synopses are misleading. Shirobako is so much more than a show about anime production, or even about the five girls reuniting to work together on an anime project. Somehow, it manages to turn a mundane plot about relatively mundane people into an intriguing, fluid masterpiece.\r\nBy all means, the characters in Shirobako are not particularly spectacular. They can\u2019t pull off crazy, last minute miracles, nor can any of them arbitrarily come up with deep, intellectual messages on the spot like characters from many other shows \u2013 not one of the characters truly knows why they work in the anime industry. The same can be saidfor the setting. Musashino Animation is definitely not on either extremes of the anime spectrum. Yet still, P.A. Works has turned this seemingly generic material into one of the most absorbing and unique anime experiences.\\n\\n\r\nExcept in rare situations, all the characters exhibit a remarkable sense of realism. All in all, the characters span the gamut exhibit a wide range of personalities and physical appearances, but these features are kept at a reasonable level so that they don\u2019t become stereotypical tropes (okay, maybe except Kunogi). Not every character is a shining ideal of beauty, and nobody can perform their job exceptionally each time. Nobody knows for sure why they work in anime, but each one is passionate about their work and tries to discover true meaning behind their work. Most importantly, they go through the same daily struggles of work that everyone does. We feel empathy for the characters because they resemble us, not necessarily through their individual jobs but through their personalities and hardships.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, even though there aren\u2019t any overly dramatic developments, Shirobako still manages to maintain a sense of urgency throughout its entirety. The conflict usually doesn\u2019t escalate beyond struggling to overcome deadlines, but because we can so easily relate to the characters as viewers, we feel their struggles.\\n\\n\r\nWhat stands out the most is the wonderfully planned character development. There are a plethora of characters with varied personalities like Yano\u2019s cheerfully sarcastic tone and Miyamori\u2019s optimism, but no one character is overwhelmed by the others or left out of the story. Unlike shows like Code Geass R2 in which the character list is so massive that the majority of the characters are entirely static, each character in Shirobako plays an integral role in establishing the workplace environment. In fact, I would go so far to say that the story itself would not be complete without any one of them. The characters are dynamic, regardless of how much screen time they get. They all change their perspectives and viewpoints as they encounter the harsh reality of the anime industry and experience their daily struggle to meet the deadline. Even Kunogi, who seems to be the epitome of a static, meaningless character, undergoes a transformation by the end of the show by confidently speaking out to the producers and director.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is wonderfully written in a way such that each character\u2019s struggles are well infused into the plot and the overarching goal \u2013 to create an exceptional anime. The plot is not written in arc style storytelling \u2013 each individual episode can focus on one aspect of production, such as key animation or dubbing, and focus on a few characters, but no one character is completely left out. Although the five girls\u2019 dream of working on an anime together is essentially delegated to a side plot and doesn\u2019t materialize until the very end, I love the way it\u2019s written as it is. Life and careers are full of roadblocks, and the way the characters struggle for long periods of time to achieve their goal give their final achievements depth and meaning and creates a sense of realism. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that the show actually deals with anime production as a whole makes the story even more absorbing. I\u2019m guessing a lot of viewers probably stumbled across this show probably decided to just test it out solely based on its subject matter. Anime production is something that we as viewers care about, and the show itself gives a greater appreciation for the creation of anime. Of course, some aspects were exaggerated for comedic effect, like Miyamori\u2019s and Okitsu\u2019s driving, but for the most part the steps in anime creation as shown in Shirobako are realistic, with deadlines constantly hanging over one\u2019s shoulder. In particular, with so much hanging on the production desk, the show seems to emphasize that a mediocre show does not necessarily imply an unskilled staff; it could just mean that a logistical problem in production occurred. Even the most innovative and well-written plot could go down in flames with crappy animation caused by rushed deadlines.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, P.A. Works did not disappoint with the animation, art, and sound quality (It would be awfully ironic if a show explaining the struggles of creating anime and the consequences of lagging behind on the deadline ended up compromising the visual qualities!). The animation is fluid with no noteworthy flaws. The opening and ending songs and BGM aren\u2019t particularly spectacular or memorable, but they serve their purpose well by establishing a base for the overall feel of the plot. The art style is simple but surprisingly detailed, from the distinct features of each character to the tiny, but consistent anime figures on each character\u2019s desk, and is well suited to this type of show. \\n\\n\r\nShirobako is a godsend to anime. It is very informative about the production of anime and gives a greater appreciation for it. But beyond this and the superb character development, it is simply enjoyable. The plot moves along with a sense of urgency without going overboard on drama or action. The characters are well fleshed out, satisfying to watch, and for once not freaking high school students. We are not attracted to the characters because of fanservice, stereotypical tropes, or ridiculous talent, but because of their varied personalities and shortcomings. \\n\\n\r\nEven if you have little interest in anime production, Shirobako is worth a try. Sometimes, the seemingly mundane can be even more riveting than drama and action.\\n",

            "content": "So, I heard P.A. Works was hiring? Where can I sign up?\r\nA lot of time has passed between my first and second time watching this show, at least in terms of what happened in my life during that time. I got out of highschool and found a job, slowly working myself into a position of more responsibility. And, naturally, taking the blame for a good chunk of the mistakes or troubles of other people.\r\nBut it's not a job I love nor one I want do do for the rest of my life. Or even longer than another one or two years, securing some money inthe process.\\n\r\nBut how do I pursue what I want to work as? How can I even find out?\\n\\n\r\nMore than anything, an Anime is a group effort on a whole other scale with a lot of little things mattering enough to break pieces out of the whole if done incorrectly.\\n\r\nTiny little details can break the immersion, and if the entire production comes to a grinding halt because of unforeseen circumstances, no matter how well-prepared and smooth everything else was. \\n\r\nBut the moment that every piece falls into place and everything begins to shine as the completed picture that it is, is one to celebrate. The moment that makes up for all the stomachaches, headaches and pains in the neck bothering you for the past weeks or even months of hard, exhausting work.\\n\r\nMyamori and her four highschool friends all have very different personalities and approaches, with their love for creating animation uniting them in the pursuit of their goals, all of which are very relevant to jobs like these.\\n\r\nAm I doing what I really want to do? What is my reason for keeping up despite the hellride my job can be? Is this career going to remain enjoyable, is it going to keep me fed? Does it even make sense to pursue this insecure, rocky path? Should I risk what I have now in order to find something potentially even more fulfilling? \\n\r\nShirobako asks each of these likable, charming girls these questions and the answers can be very different.\\n\r\nThere is a huge cast of likable side characters as well, all of which have their own problems and even moments of character growth (or are Tarou).\\n\r\nAnd despite never getting too deep with most of them - there are limits to how close you should get most of your co-workers after all - everyone has a purpose and feels like a real person. I wouldn't be surprised in the dlightest to hear that most if not all of them are based on real people working at P.A. (not to mention of course the many, many guest stars and hommages).\\n\r\nThere are no villains in this show - safe for maybe one who gets his comeuppance by the end - because a work place doesn't need villains for things to get out of hand more than once.\\n\\n\r\nAnd naturally, with a cast of real people like these, Shirobako is a story about hope, good will, hard work and perseverance, all of which is rewarded by the end. But all of these characters did experience work-related failures one way or another and learned and grew from it.\\n\r\nSomeone who wants a more gritty portrayal might want to consider Girlish Number as companion piece.\\n\\n\r\nThat's only half of what's great about Shirobako, though. Another quarter comes down to a beautiful and poignant choice in color design, giving every character and scene even more personality while pleasuring the eye oh so satisfyingly. All of the character designs are great and come with a wide variety of facial expressions and gestures, all animated very vividly. \\n\r\nThe many, many visual nods to older shows, with Musashino Animation basically being a character in and of itself with a long history of Anime production, going from cells to digital, are also a very welcome little snack.\\n\r\nThe many tracks are all fitting, the OPs and EDs catchy and unskippable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the final stretch; How this show improves their viewers perception for and appreciation of the medium they love.\\n\\n\r\nSome people feel the need to complete every Anime they start out of sheer respect for all the hard work, sweat and tears that went into them. Some will feel the strong need to give every show a shot and not just discredit it for what's on the outside.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough for people who work 40-hour weeks, they can't possibly watch everything, or at least not everything at once. They'll have to carefully choose their priorities.\\n\r\nAnd that's ultimately what the show did for me, too; It helped me to realize that I love Treasure Hunting. I want to find all of these jewels where the planets aligned and all turned out well. I also want to find all the less polished ones among them and enjoy them for what they have to offer. I want to keep on learning which things will and won't work because I am a creator, too.\\n\\n\r\nAnd nothing is more inspiring than seeing a ridiculous, gamble like Anime work out in all its beauty.",

            "content": "This was an old review. It's horrible. I don\u2019t like it. Shirobako is a 10/10.\r\nThis is my first review, be gentle...\r\nWe never really think about the work that is put into the animes we\u2019ve watched. From the story boards to the voice acting, it\u2019s all hard work and problems occur all the time. Shirobako is an anime about creating anime. Well, that may sound strange to some of you, I mean watching something about creating what you\u2019re watching? If you\u2019re curious about this show, I highly recommend you watch it. You\u2019ll discover a great story about 5 girls with a dream to create their ownanime. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re reading this I assume you like anime, but have you ever wanted to create your own? A group of friends, Aoi Miyamori, Ema Yasuhara, Shizuka Sakaki, Midori Imai, and Misa Toudou all have a wish to create an anime together. After creating a short anime in the anime club during their time in high school, the 5 girls set out to find a career in anime. The girls struggle to pursue their dream as they run into problems such as not finding a job, not being able to work in what they want to work on, or even figuring out why they want to work in anime. Through this show, we discover a whole new story from behind the scenes that we would have never have thought of-\u2026. well I\u2019m sure there are some shows or movies out there with a similar concept. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways this show is great. With bits of slice of life, comedy, and drama, we see what the creators of our favorite shows go through as they work hard to entertain us. It\u2019s a perfect show to learn to appreciate the work that is put into the anime we watch every day. And possibly even be inspired to create your own anime. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10 \\n\r\nThe story is easily relatable if you\u2019ve ever tried to work hard on something but didn\u2019t succeed, or work on something without a clear sight on the future. \\n\\n\r\nThe main goal of the story is to get closer to the main characters goal, to create an anime together. \\n\r\n*spoiler alert* \\n\r\nWhich by the end of the show, they kind of did actually make an anime together, just not the anime they wanted. And with the announcement of a movie for Shirobako, I believe they girls will get closer to their goal. \\n\r\n*end of spoiler* \\n\r\nOverall great and relatable story! \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 \\n\r\nThe characters of Shirobako, especially the 5 main girls, go through problems throughout the show. And with some of the side characters who have gone through the same, many of them get through it with their help. It\u2019s like your sempai helping you with school issues or something I guess. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all really likable and relatable, some you just want to punch in the face (funny story guy), but overall, I think they each (the main characters) have an important role to play in the story. \\n\\n\r\nI personally really liked Shizuka and-\\n\r\n*spoiler alert* \\n\r\nafter seeing her in the last part of episode 23 where she finally got a voice acting role, I cried so GODDAMN HARD. \\n\r\n*end of spoiler*\\n\r\nAlso, she\u2019s very similar to Nanami from Sakura-sou no Pet na Kanojo (The Pet Girl of Sakurasou). \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 \\n\r\nThe art is easy to look at, though nothing special about it. \\n\r\nJust pretty standard. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI personally loved the openings and endings of the show. Though at first, they didn\u2019t seem all that special. I guess it grew on me, don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same for you. \\n\\n\r\nThe background music wasn\u2019t noticeable for me. I can\u2019t remember most of it since it didn\u2019t stand out at all. The only time I noticed it was when they played the ending song (I think) at the end of episode 24. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nDuring the first few episodes, I didn\u2019t get into the story as much. But as the story progress and I learnt more about the characters, I really started to enjoy the show more than I did at the beginning. I don\u2019t know about everyone else but I think you really got to get past the character introductions (there are so many characters) and world building to actually enjoy everything (probably like every show ever). \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.4/10 \\n\r\nShirobako, after finishing it became one of my favorite animes. I definitely cannot wait until the release of the movie. I\u2019ll be sure to review that too. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, great show! I recommend this if you\u2019re interested in the anime industry. \\n",

For some reason I like Bakuman but not this, maybe it's because of the artwork or something.... For those that might not know, Bakuman is an anime about making manga, and Shirobako is an anime about making anime.\r\nNevertheless, I can see how this anime might appeal to people who are interested in animeproduction, but I actually only wanted to watch a funny anime and this was listed as comedy (it wasn't funny). I decided to give it a shot anyways but I felt the pacing of the anime was really really slow.\\n\\n\r\nIf it was something like K-ON and had anime production inside a school setting, maybe it would've been more interesting. It's unfortunate but I didn't enjoy it despite liking the VA's, the artwork, and the sound. \\n\\n\r\nJust didn't tick for me.",

At the endingof anime, I wasn't really sure if they were sure to what age they were approaching with such ending. Of-course it was somewhat funny, but they could have done it better. \\n\r\nI would not re-watch it, but if there would be other season I would have an interest to see what the creators were thinking later on for the series...",

            "content": "Both a love letter to anime and a satirical view of the industry, this show's colorful animation, cheerful characters and light humor undermines the cold, harsh reality of working in the anime industry - tight deadlines, long hours, office politics and much more. \r\nIt does that by presenting the story of five high school friends who all wind up working in anime together. \r\nTrue, it sweeps many issues under the rug or hints at them (e.g. low animator pay, South Korea outsourcing), but it's a fair representation that serves the story it wants to tell.\r\nThe show has a wide array of side characters, as shouldbe in a realistic show about a realistic studio, yet it simultaneously manages to give them all decent screen-time and also give them very distinct personalities and appearances. Granted, some characters got too much screen-time and some got too little, but with that big of a cast, it's forgivable.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the technical aspects, the animation is fluid and expressive and the audio is fitting and high-quality but somewhat unremarkable, save for great OPs and EDs.\\n\\n\r\nIt's very much grounded in the \"Slice of Life\" genre, and so it may not be for you: it doesn't have life-or-death conflicts but rather realistic issues, situations, characters and drama, and it's surprisingly engaging, funny and heartwarming. It understands that life is about ups and downs, about moments of joy and happiness alongside moments of despair, crisis and loss, and it uses the realism of its setting to great effect, both for comedy and for heart-touching drama.\\n\\n\r\nSo, why a 10/10 score? Ever since I finished watching this anime in early February 2016, I pondered if I should give it a 10/10 score or a 9/10. To me, a 10/10 is a show so intricately designed, that every issue I have with it is so minuscule and banal that it doesn't detract from my experience. After rewatching it, I've concluded that Shirobako is that kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nSure, it starts slow, but it starts slow so that you'll have time to study the huge cast, and it quickly picks up from there. Yeah, it uses jargon from the industry pretty liberally, but the show is clear enough that you can understand what a term means by context alone. Although the series takes place in an ostensibly mundane office, each episode ends with an intense and genuinely interesting cliffhanger, to the point that I just couldn't put it down. \\n\\n\r\nBut most importantly, Shirobako was a masterful experience because I also learned something from it. I learned how hard it is to produce anime and how dedicated and determined the staff working on it are. I learned about hopes, dreams and friendship in a way I haven't experienced since playing Undertale. I learned that I should cherish my workmates and friends.\\n\r\nI learned all that through the personal story of five girls working in an office. And if it can affect me that way, I give it my full enforcement.",

The story was a wonderfully written love story that wasn't about romance, it was refreshing and entertaining. Conflicts within the story were realistic and made you feel for the characters. The individual yet overlapping story lines for each of the characters was well done and made the series an interesting watch and made it flow well. The sound used in this anime was also pretty good, I felt that there were a few moments that could've used different or better backgroundmusic but most of it fit well and I felt that the OPs and EDs were all very fitting for the series. This series was really inspiring and although it held some stressful and climatic moments it left me feeling happy and wanting more. All in all it was a great watch and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.",

            "content": "You anime fan, wanna know all the process that creates your favorite show? Well, look no further for this anime, Shirobako, is the best out there that can give you a glimpse of the production of an anime.\r\nIt all starts with a typical last episode from any slice of life anime: our cute group of girls are finishing their own cute project (in this case anime) for the cultural festival. And from there, we get to see how or cute group of girls grow in their professional lifes.They all have their own problems, their own struggles, and their own dreams. \r\nWhat amazed me the mostof the show was how developed where their characters. Remember Angel Beats?  Both Shirobako and Angel Beats share a thing in common: they both have a gigantic cast of characters. However, the lack of episodes in the latter left us without knowing the secrets behind some characters, such as TK. This didn't happen with Shirobako, as the 90\u2105 of its characters (which are all the main characters) got a well developed story. My two favorites were our main character, Aoi Miyamori, and the director, Kinoshita.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I loved about Shirobako is that it tells us that in the anime industry, the director is not the only important worker. Shirobako gives us a sneak peak at the work of the animators, the drawers, the writers, the actors and the producers. It makes us remember that behind a Shinichiro Watanabe, a Hayao Miyasaki, and a Gen Urobuchi, there are lots of workers that do their best to create the anime that we watch in the screen.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't think that this anime shows an ideal workplace, where everything goes how it was planned, and all the workers are happy and lively. This anime also shows us that working in this industry is not fun, is not easy, and is not what you think it is. It can be harsh at moments, really stressful, and can destroy your own dreams if you don't handle it properly.\\n\\n\r\nOn the production values, Shirobako doesn't suffer in the animation nor in the soundtrack. Both of them are strong all over the series. The OPs and EDs are cute, but didn't stand out that much. You may also want to check out some production terms before watching this, as it uses lots of them, which may be difficult for people who doesn't know or use those words.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, Shirobako teaches us that the anime industry is not fun all the day. It is like any other job: stressful, hard, and not what the watchers might think it is. All the cast is full of colourful, amazingly well developed characters. It sometimes is a bit fast in their dialogues, and there may be limited information about the terms they use in those dialogues. But in spite of these little difficulties, this anime has gained a space in my heart and in my shelf (I'll definitely buy it when it's available), and has also become one of my favourites anime of all time.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It\u2019s easy for anyone who had played in this hectic playground to be charmed and appreciate this piece of gem. \r\nThis show tried to be realistic by including the complexities and subtleties of production that we, consumers, always take it for granted.  Althoughthis show certainly succeeded on that with glowing feat, some idealism is kept high and strong here and there without being childish. It were those idealism that brought back the hope when the industries has fallen into paradigm \u201cBudget over quality and deadline not passion\u201d . That same idealism made this anime sweet and warm, and for some, brings back memories and nostalgic feelings; I could relate how I overflowed with emotions on some episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nShirobako in its execution is very well paced with a lot of interesting events that engage the viewers with high excitement until the very end. What astonished me the most is how they managed to depict very well developed characters in 24 episodes, regardless of the huge number of characters. The characters are strong, even for those who just appear every now and then, providing a well established basis for the elaboration of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, Shirobako in its deepest meaning (personal opinion involved), paint a beautiful picture that describes \u201cdream\u201d which can\u2019t be explained by any length of literal words.  Shirobako ask a fundamental question \u201cdo you need a reason to do what you love?\u201d . I recall when I worked on my assignment project where I had to code for 22.5 hours in one day. Why would I do that? I\u2019m not sure, but one thing, I enjoyed it to the fullest. Shirobako taught me that it's all that\u2019s matter.\\n\\n\r\nThe only small thing that refrain this show from getting my perfect score is how they made the pace of episode 13 and 14 slowed down with some unnecessary filler. But surely, a firm foundation won\u2019t budge by a mere breeze, so I would love to end this review with my sincere positive recommendation!\\n\\n\r\nScore : 9.5/10\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever wondered what it takes to make an anime episode? Why do some anime have amazing art while some suck? How are studios able to release episodes after just one week? Well, look no further because Shirobako gives all these answers and in a fun way. As a hardcore anime fan and editor (I make wallpapers, vector arts, AMVs and other anime stuff) I really really liked this anime since it tells you about all the hardwork, blood and sweat it takes to air a single episode. \r\nStory 9/10:\r\nThe anime shows the production of two anime series. I have given the story a9 out of 10 because it gives you a really good idea of how the anime industry works, the hardships faced by the workers and what it takes to air a series. Since the anime does this job really well, I find no other excuse to give it any less marks.\\n\r\nSure, some parts may have been over emphasized to add the drama and tense atmosphere to the anime but without that, it would feel more like a documentary.\\n\r\nAlmost all the cast are adults but the characters are still pretty relatable to which is a really good thing. Never giving up, tackling failures, working hard, these kind of attributes are shown throughout the series from which, I think, everyone can learn from.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nI'd say that this art style is perfect for this anime. The character designs are pretty cool. Each character having their own unique design which perfectly depicts what kind of personality the character has. Sure, the animation might not compare to other anime, but for a comedy type, slice of life-ish anime like this one, it fits the bill nicely.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nIt has two openings and two endings. Though I'm not a big fan of either but they still aren't all that bad. I can't say much in the sound department since this anime isn't much related to music or anything but it's definitely not something that would turn you away from this series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\r\nAlmost the entire cast is composed of people related to the anime industry; some are artists, some write stories, some do 3D motions, some take care of the colors and some do the video editing and dubbing. You can find almost any character doing a specific job here. \\n\r\nMore emphasis is put on the production team, the animation team and the director but the video editing, CGI, sound and dubbing staff also get their parts accordingly.\\n\r\nIt's hard to put a finger on any one character as the main lead since the whole staff is working to make the anime but more focus is on Miyamori Aoi (Production) and Yasuhara Ema (Animation). The other friends also come into the series but they don't play as much of a role as the above two.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nFrom start to end, this anime is a amazing one. It thrills you, amazes you and gives you a good lesson about how to tackle hardships and failures. If you're in anyway related to anime, be it editing pictures or writing stories or making art, this anime will definitely be one you'll enjoy since you know a bit about what it takes to make that stuff.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really liked this anime. Even though you may not be doing anything related to the anime industry, this anime is still a good watch for those who want to know more about how anime is made.\\n",

The thing that lured me, and probably most viewers, into watching Shirobako is because of the unique story about an anime about an anime as well as my curiosity ofhow an anime is created.\\n\\n\r\nOn the first episode, it started slow during the first half but that's when its about to go crazy, crazy in a good way and before i knew it i already finished all the episodes that were currently out. *insert sad music* Hence, the weekly (hellish) wait begun. >.<\\n\\n\r\nShirobako is one of those animes that you'll probably want to re-watch once a year at least it is for me.

Everyone I know RAVES about this show, but personally I found it unbearable to watch. \r\nI went into this show knowing it had a creative and unique plot, encompassing many of the decisions, methods, and qualities important to a successful anime studio. However, what this show did not have was something compelling to pull me in.  I found Episode 1-3 were bland, with little  character development and no entertaining components (neither comedy, climax, nor altercations). \r\nTo further explain my dissatisfaction in this show, Ill simply make a quick guide:\r\n1.)The plot premise was good, however I foundexecution lacking. The idea was great, but it was done in a boring and scattered way\\n\r\n2.) Artwork was nicely done with great color choices, and nice character models, as expected of PA Works\\n\r\n3.) The show to me seemed to get lost in the idea of the \"hustle\" of the anime industry, and the first episodes suffered by not making the cast interesting, relatable, and unique. \\n\r\n4.) I felt like scenes were missing, nothing was there to make me \"ooh\" or \"ahh\", it just felt like a chronology of scenes where one person had to correct another, or rather the cast was \"going through the motions\" without selling it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave Shirobako a 5, as the artwork and premise were quite nice, but overall, the show didn't have the components necessary to capture my attention. In the first 5 episodes, the Characters did not speak to me, and I didn't find myself wanting to know more of their endeavors. As a fan of Slice of Life, This show didn't have enough to keep me entertained, which, ultimately led me to drop the show.  I had high hopes, but in the end I was left quite disappointed.",

            "content": "IGN chose Shirobako as one of the Top Anime of the Year 2015. After seeing their list, I decided to give this anime a try and I can personally say that this is one of -- if not -- the most underrated/underhyped anime of all time. \r\n(There will be SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (8.5/10) (SPOILERS) \r\nAoi Miyamori is part of the high school Animation club along with her 4 friends Midori, Shizuka, Misa and Ema. They all have a dream: to one day work at the same animation company and make an anime of their own. Two years later, Aoi graduated and she now worksas a production assistant at the Musashino Animation. Despite the tough job, long hours and lousy pay, Aoi still hopes to fulfill the promise that she and her friends made. \\n\\n\r\nShirobako is an anime about making making anime. Now I know what you're thinking. You're probably thinking right now that Shirobako is a documentary that was turned into an anime and all they do is ask the employee a load of questions about the anime industry. In other words, a boring anime version 24 episode documentary. You sir/mam....couldn't be any more wrong. Calling this a documentary is just laughable. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime industry is a niche market. Just by looking at the sales, you'll immediately notice it. In the anime industry, selling...Oh Idk....24k copies is considered successful but in reality, it's not. Compare that to, let's say the movie industry or the Western TV industry..Hell, compare the anime industry to a Japanese Live-Action/Drama TV and you'll notice that 24k copies is not a lot. The industry is also a horrible place to work in. Being overworked and the salary that you get every month is barely enough to spend on yourself. Even so, we still see how much effort and hard work these guys put in just to produce a 1 cour anime show. Shirobako does a great job presenting the harsh atmosphere of the industry but that doesn't mean that the way they showed it is fully realistic. There were some fictional stuff and it's really not a problem since Shirobako never claimed to be a realistic \"how animes are made\" show. It's close enough to realism though.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Shirobako shows us the life in the anime industry, they also shows us  the process that the staff goes through just to produce a 1 cour series. For example, I never knew up to this point that the amount of Key Animation one episode has is a lot. I thought they would just draw the characters and make the characters move using a computer but it turns out that they all make them move by hand (or maybe some Motion Captures). No wonder, there aren't a lot of 2 cour series. It just goes to show how much work these guys put in and people would just fucking pirate the show. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the many things I love about the series isn't about the cute 5 girls. It's the 5 girls doing everything they can to meet their goals. We see them fail and we see them stand up again and not giving up. It was also interesting to see the staff in the studio all working together to create an anime show that we all consume. Even if they fail, they still try their best to to meet their goals. The grand power of teamwork, if I say so myself. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is separated into two arcs. The first half of the series focuses on the staff of Musashino Animation producing an original anime called \"Exodus\". It's fictional so don't bother searching for it on Google. In the 2nd half of the series, the company has been given a new project and this time, adapting a popular manga called \"Third Aerial Girls' Squad\". I love each of the arcs for very different reasons. In the first arc, we see all the issues that an anime studio might and will face when producing an original anime. Issues such as time frame, the director not being able to come up with ideas, and etc. There are at least 2 scenes in the first half that I found interesting. \\n\r\nFirstly, the director not giving up and trying his hardest to finish \"Exodus\". Exodus is his chance to prove that he's not a shitty director after that train wreck anime that he caused called \"Jiggly Jiggly Heaven\" (which is equivalent to P.A Work's Glasslip). The 2nd one is the part where the director wanted to change a 14 second short scene. I honestly can't believe it. Because of the director wanting to change that short scene, we see Aoi and the staff scramble just to change a short scene. The amount of time and work put in by the staff just to change said scene is really mind-boggling.    \\n\\n\r\nThe 2nd half really caught my eye. I feel like the 2nd half was a lot better than the first arc. It gives us an understanding on the process the studio goes through when adapting a material, in this case, adapting a manga. You know, I'm starting to understand why some animes that are adapted from a LN or a manga with such great story turns out to be so shitty when adapted into an anime version. It's really all on the author's hands whether he/she wants the studio to properly adapt his/her work or poorly adapt his/her work because he/she just doesn't give a shit. It's also based on how much agreements or disagreements between the author and the studio have and of course, the amount of episodes the show is allowed to produce on one season. There's also the difference in character designs between the anime and the source material and etc. Basically, the 2nd half half shows us the amount of issues that the studio has to deal with just to adapt a source material and I really loved the way they presented those issues. \\n\\n\r\nThere are 2 more points that I have to talk about. The comedy and the pacing. The show does not lack comedy nor is it over-bombarded with comedy. It's just a right amount of comedy. If I could post a video in my review, I would post the \"Angel Dance/Exercise\" scene because that scene was hilarious as hell. Secondly is the pacing. The first few episodes started out really slow which caused some people to just drop the show. I wasn't really bored with the slow pacing on the first few episodes so that wasn't an issue for me. The pacing did kind of pick up on the 2nd half. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (10/10)\\n\r\nFor a slice-of-life anime, I'm amazed at the show's animation. From characters to the background to how the environment looks, it looks so perfect and amazing. It's really a rarity for a slice-of-life show to have an animation that you'd only expect in action shows. P.A Works means \"Progressive Animation Works\" just in case you didn't know and they are definitely living up to their name. You know what I love about P.A Works? Their shows does not sexualize female characters and there's rarely any fanservice. Actually, there was one fanservice scene in Episode 1 but that's it. You don't see any fanservice scenes again. Even though some of the female characters here looks cute and beautiful, they don't have big breasts. I would love it if every anime studio treats their female characters with respect and follows P.A Works' non-existent fanservice. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is what you'd expect from a slice-of-life show..You know, like those soundtrack that usually plays when the tone of the show is dramatic or cheery or when they're having a normal conversation. Now, the OP and ED theme song(s). \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme songs are \"I'm Sorry EXODUS\" by Tracy (Mai Nakahara, Shizuka Itou, Ai Kayano), \"COLORFUL BOX\" by Yoko Ishida, and \"Takarabako -TREASURE BOX-\" by Masami Okui. The ED theme songs are Animetic Love Letter\" by Aoi Miyamori, Ema Yasuhara, Shizuka Sakaki, \"Platinum Jet\" by Doughnut Quintet, and \"Yama Harinezumi Andes Chucky\" by Miyuki Kunitake \\n\\n\r\nI consider the first 2 OP theme songs as 1 OP theme song separated into 2 two versions. That should make it easier for me. The first version is really catchy. It makes me want to race with someone on the street, just like what Aoi and a certain staff member from G.I Staff were doing. The 2nd version is a great song, in my opinion. I love the singer's voice. The 2nd OP...three words, I.Love.It! and I think it's way better than the first OP theme song. For the ED theme songs, I love the 2nd ED theme song and that's it. I don't like the 1st ED and I hate the 3rd ED. Although, someone might feel nostalgic just by watching and listening to the 3rd ED.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9/10)\\n\r\nShirobako has a large cast of characters and they introduced most -- if not -- all of them in the first and 2nd episode. I have a very hard time remembering Japanese names because I don't speak Japanese and I'm exposed to Western names pretty much every single day. They also have those last name, first name usage crap so that makes it even harder for me. My point is the show introduced the characters with no exposition whatsoever. They are introduced by having their names pop up on the top right/left hand of the screen.  It wasn't until the early 2nd half where I managed to remember all of the main character's name and some of the side character's name. Anyways...\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are great..They're entertaining, the character interactions are sometimes hilarious and fun to watch and surprisingly, there 's character development in a slice-of-life series. Notice how I said \"Most\"? There's one character in show which I found really annoying and that's Taro. I admit, he's kind of hilarious but he's fucking annoying. He's like one of my friends who screws everything up when I/we have him as a partner on some certain projects. Did I say one character? I lied..There's at least one more character who's 100% worse than Taro and I'll talk about him later.  \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters knows that it's not easy to enter the anime industry and yet, they didn't lost hope and kept going so they can fulfill their dream of working together and one day, turn their anime \"The Seven Lucky Gods\" into a reality. After high school, life is not going to be easy and most of us knows that. There are going to be times where the situation won't go in your favor and there will be times where you're going to be rejected on something like entering a certain industry just because someone is better than you even if you worked your ass off for like over a year. Life ain't easy and Shirobako did a great job showing us that. I'll use Shizuka Sakaki as an example because her pursuit of becoming a Voice Actor really touched me more than the other characters. Shizuka is shown to have attended auditions upon auditions but kept getting rejected because there are people that's always going to be better than her. We see that even though she works hard to get the role, she just doesn't get picked for said role. When she finally got a role in the latter half of the show, I actually cried a little bit because I know that feeling of being rejected countless times and having your hard work finally being paid off.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said above, I love the characters in the show. Especially that female character who barely speaks and Ema is pretty much her interpreter and she also somehow answers her unfinished questions. You know, I'm wondering how she passed that job interview but hey, the show did never claim to be fully realistic. Ema and Ai's character interactions is one of the entertaining and hilarious interactions in the show. They all have great personality and you'll pretty much like everyone in the show...except the \"Mr. Funny Story\" guy and probably Taro. \\n\\n\r\nI'll just call that asshole editor \"Mr. Funny Story\" because I don't know his name. You will definitely, and I mean definitely hate this guy. \"Mr. Funny Story\" here didn't want the staff of Musashino Animation to meet the author of \"Third Aerial Girls' Squad\", thus causing the production to be halted many many times and sometimes even scrapping the Key Animation cuts that they already drew. Because of him, I thought the author was a two-timed son of a bitch but it turns out, the editor is just a big asshat who glorifies the author as some sort of God.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (10/10)\\n\r\nI really thought Shirobako was going to be boring because of the concept. I didn't find the show boring though. I managed to watch all 24 episodes without sleeping and I was always engaged in what the characters were doing and the situation around them. What a fun ride this show was and 24 episodes just passed by way too quickly. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Shirobako\" is simply an amazing anime and it's definitely one of the most underrated anime that I have ever seen. If you want to take a break from all the cliche harem shows with girls screaming \"Iya! One-chaaan!!\" and all the big boobs being flashed at your face then you might want to give this show a try. If you're interested in learning how animes are made then this is definitely the show for you. However, I gotta warn you that this anime is simply not for everyone. The complaints that you might have are: there's a lot of talking and it's just office meetings. Otherwise, this anime is a must-watch!\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9.5/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+\"How Animes are made\" concept executed properly\\n\r\n+Accurate depiction of how animes are made and produced\\n\r\n+P.A Works living up to their name\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack and Great OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\r\n+Female characters aren't sexualized\\n\r\n+Non-existent fanservice\\n\r\n+Great cast of characters\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Too much characters introduced in a first couple of episodes.",

            "content": "Before I got into anime during the summer of 2015, I wasn\u2019t really sure what anime was or where it came from (aside from the obvious and rather unhelpful knowledge that it emerged from somewhere in Japan).  One evening, after running a few half-hearted Google searches, I stumbled across a show called Shirobako, an \u201canime about making anime\u201d that promised to answer all my burning questions about the medium, at least from a production standpoint.  And boy, did it deliver on that front.  As someone who knew next to nothing about storyboarding and would be hard-pressed to define what \u201ckey animation\u201d is,Shirobako offers an enlightening glimpse into how the anime industry operates, detailing the ins and outs of the production process in a manner that, while admittedly idealized, is not only educational but extremely engaging.\\n\\n\r\nBesides instilling in me a newfound respect for how much time and effort goes into getting an anime from the studio to the screen, Shirobako is an astoundingly good show.  Released by studio P.A.Works in the fall of 2014, it\u2019s easily one of the best animes I\u2019ve seen and one of the few I would label a \u201cmust-watch.\u201d  While Shirobako isn\u2019t perfect, whatever issues it has are minor and easily outweighed by the sheer amount \u201cwin\u201d contained in its 24 episodes and two entertaining OVAs (which I\u2019ll touch on in greater detail below).  \\n\\n\r\nBe warned: Shirobako has an enormous cast.  The size of the ensemble can be daunting for first-time viewers, making Shirobako a somewhat difficult show to get into.  The first two episodes throw a lot of characters and information at the viewer, and it\u2019s not until episode 3 that the pace slows down and the show settles into a more \u201cmanageable\u201d groove.  Each time a new character is introduced, the show helpfully provides a caption listing his or her name and occupation; however, trying to keep track of these captions while also following along with the dialogue subtitles can quickly get overwhelming.  Shirobako does not have (and likely will not receive) an English dub, so if you\u2019re not a fan of reading this might not be the show for you (indeed, I found myself pausing so much that it felt like I was watching the Monogatari series). \\n\\n\r\nTo mitigate some of these issues, Shirobako smartly focuses the story on five female friends who, as former members of their high school\u2019s Anime Club, are all pursuing different careers in the anime industry (with varying degrees of success).  These friends include the doughnut-obsessed Aoi (producer), the adorable Ema (2D animator), the resilient Shizuka (voice actor), the dissatisfied Misa (3D animator), and the perky Midori (writer).  These characters give the story a sense of direction: viewers can sympathize with their struggles while rooting for them to achieve their dreams.  My two minor complaints would be that Misa doesn\u2019t get as much development as the other characters and Shizuka seems to disappear during the show\u2019s second half; however, the first complaint is a nitpick and the second complaint is resolved by episode 23, which features the most moving scene in any TV show or film that I\u2019ve watched (just thinking about this scene while I\u2019m writing about it is making me tear up).   \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to these five main characters, the overarching plot of Shirobako is relatively straightforward.  The show is primarily centered on the inner workings of Musashino Animation, a fictional, down-on-its-luck anime studio looking to recapture some of its former glory.  Shirobako, which unfolds over the course of about two years, depicts in loving detail the various trials and tribulations endured by Musashino\u2019s staff as they work together to produce two anime series, Exodus! (about a trio of washed-up idols framed for murder) and The Third Aerial Girls Squad (about a squadron of female fighter pilots seeking to avert an alien invasion).  As I mentioned earlier, Shirobako has two OVAs, which are in fact the \u201cpilot\u201d episodes for these two shows-within-a-show.  While there are clips of Exodus! and Aerial Girls scattered throughout Shirobako itself, having a chance to see actual, full-length episodes of them is immensely satisfying, and I give major props to P.A.Works for going the extra mile to animate them in their entirety.  It\u2019s little things like this\u2014along with providing the full OP for Aoi\u2019s favorite show growing up, Andes Chucky\u2014that convince me Shirobako is in a class by itself with respect to its attention to detail.\\n\\n\r\nShirobako also contains a ton of references to real-life animators and anime studios, and several of the snafus suffered by Musashino\u2019s production team are based on well-known (and rather infamous) events in anime history.  Most of these references went over my head, though I remember one episode featured a Hideaki Anno look-alike discussing his anime \u201cNeon Generation Avangaldon.\u201d  Still, these references added to the show\u2019s realism and tied in to the show\u2019s ambition to provide a comprehensive record of anime as both a medium and a business.  In addition, some of the references piqued my curiosity so much that I went ahead and researched them on my own, making Shirobako the gift that truly keeps on giving. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a lot more I could write about Shirobako but, to sum up, it\u2019s a magical show.  To award it a 10/10 almost doesn\u2019t seem like enough.  While it can get confusing at times to keep track of all the characters and plot threads, the show never loses sight of its end-goal and manages to juggle all its competing elements with amazing aplomb.  Furthermore, the myriad intricacies and nuances in Shirobako give it a high rewatch value, and I for one look forward to revisiting this series many times in the future.",

The story itself is about how life works at an anime studio, so it tells us technically how these things that we watch are made, and of course, in a different and enjoyable way. We wouldn't want those kinds of \"documentary\" thingy in these kinds of anime.\r\nCharacter wise, the characters themselves are very appealing (cute, yeah.), but not in a flashy way. They keep the appeal in moderation while focusing on how those looks reflect their own personalities. The characters are also made quite, realistically. You are seeing an anime about people working,yet you can still see the qualities of each character like other Slice of Life animes do. The traits of each characters blends beautifully and making an environment that does reflect how real people work, yet enjoyable for us to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was, exceptionally unique. It's something you rarely see in the trend of animes these days. You can see how the characters struggle day by day in order to make their lives worth in the anime industry. They retell these daily lives with each characters' own story, while building up slowly to create an anime that will be memorable. The detail given to those character stories' are very detailed and immense, and sometimes it gave you life lessons for you to think.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short, I think this anime portrays the essence of reality the most compared to all of the animes I've seen. No characters are geniuses and prodigies. Teamwork and creativity is the root of everything. It's taking us away from the usual mainstream Slice of Life animes, and bringing us to a new vision of a world where reality is a thing to be concerned with, in an enjoyable experience.\\n",

It gives us a glimpse of the busy life of the Character Designers, Production Managers, Directors, Voice actors etc.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe story is nicely paced and simple to understand. It wasn't boring but wasn't too interesting either. Everything were predictable. Some parts were boring such as at the beginning they talk about many studio things which normal audience wouldn't understand. One doesn't have to understand these to understand the main story anyway.  There aren't any filler episodes.There aren't any recap episodes either. The story was told from the perspective of different charecters. Some jokes were funny and made me laugh. While watching this, I couldn't help but compare it to \"Bakuman.\" which is a popular manga about the life of two mangakas. I hoped that, Shirobako would be as enjoable as Bakuman but instead it concentrated solely on the studio life. \\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art style is realistic and the backgrounds are nicely done. It goes with the anime perfectly. Charecters are designed nicely too. Charecters' expressions were fun to watch. This is an anime about making anime. In this anime, we see two anime being made and both have different art styles. Iliked the art of those too.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nBackground music wasn't anything memorable. It was OK. It fits with the anime but it could be better. I didn't like the OP & ED that much. None of them are notable. Voice actors were fitting for the charecters they had potrayed.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nCharecters are the best point of this anime. Though the PA Aoi was the main character, about 10 or more characters were under the spotlight. As the story was being told from different characters point of view, we can see all kinds of characters including voice actors, director, production manager and assistants, character designer, keyframe artist, CG artist, script writer etc. Through the characters, all types of jobs were explained nicely. There are so many characters that the anime displayed the character names at the beginning of every episode upto the midpoint of the season.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI don't think non-anime or manga fans would like this anime. Only those who are regular anime watchers and want to know more about the industry would love this one. Don't think I will rewatch it, cause there are nothing more to find out after watching it one time. I don't want to own this series. This anime was informative indeed but not so memorable.",

            "content": "Shirobako is a series that i would deem near-perfect. It manages to provide us with a large amount of insight into the world of anime production (i assume most of the information shown is accurate) as well as giving us a compelling story involving several  likeable characters  to go alongside it.\r\nThe story follows five girls that want to work in the anime industry, but only follows two for a large portion of the story, with one as the main character. It starts with the five of them in their high school animation club and, after creating a short film for a school festival,pledge to work hard and get jobs in the anime industry. They each decide to go forge a career in a different part of anime production, animation, production, CG, voice acting and script writing.\\n\r\nThe animation is smooth and each character has a distinctive design that suits their personality, the backgrounds are also incredibly detailed with figures and the like scattered all over the desks of the staff members and keeping an eye out while watching is a good idea. Personally, this made me enjoy the series a lot more.\\n\r\nThe series has some pleasant background music that suits the mood of the various scenes without ever seeming overpowering or manipulative. The openings and endings suit all have good animation alongside good music that suits the tone of the series as a whole.\\n\r\nThis series struck me in particular as there wasn't a single member of the main cast that i didn't like, my favourite being Shizuka. First and foremost, we have Aoi Miyamori, who starts out as a production assistant working for Musashino Animation and one of the two who has a job in anime production from the beginning of the series. She is a hardworking and generally cheerful girl who struggles with finding inspiration for a direction to take her career in.\\n\r\nSecondly, we have Ema Yasuhara. She is the second character working at the start of the series, she works as a keyframer at Musashino Animation. She is a shy girl who worries if her work is good enough and seeks guidance from the other animators at the studio about how to get better.\\n\r\nNow next there is Shizuka Sakaki, my personal favourite character from the series. Throughout the show we see her struggling to find work as a newbie voice actress but only being able to find minor work in unnamed crowd scenes. Seeing how hard she tries makes you really care about her struggles and you find yourself hoping she succeeds.\\n\r\nNow we end up on characters that i like less, but are still great.\\n\r\nMidori Imai is an aspiring script writer. she is the youngest of the main cast, but that doesn't stop her from working towards large goals. Her willingness to help others caused Miyamori to turn to her regarding information to be used in the anime she is working on.\\n\r\nFinally we have Misa Toudou. Misa works at a CG production company and hopes to one day work on an anime using CG.\\n\r\nIt being an original anime is a positive in my books, because the story can be structured to flow better in an episode by episode format (although this wouldn't be a problem for me as i watched it in two sittings), this is also a good thing as i think that adaptations becoming the most prevalent form of anime can restrict creators and lead to many good and interesting stories never being made. I like how it talked about CG in anime as this has been a subject i have had many arguments about.  In Conclusion, this series in almost perfect and is well deserving of my 10/10 rating and i would recommend to anyone who is interested in the subject matter.",

(that was just a bit too cheesy) but I liked the overall. \r\nat least I would not be complaining about awful made anime from now on I guess. .. haha\r\n5 girls who wanted to make anime together in the future meet again at the end after fightingthe reality and overcoming troubles that people who will jump into this industry will experience in real life. I think that's what this anime is really good about. They really kept a good balance between reality and idealism. They really put a lot of work so it can be entertaining and heartwarming for the watchers while making us to think that it can really happen in real life.",

            "content": "anime about the making of anime, following in the occasional footsteps of other anime such as _Otaku no Video_ and _Animation Runner Kuromi_ and to a lesser extent shows about doujinshi like _Genshiken_ or _Comic Party_; a 2-cours anime, each cours focuses on, naturally enough, the making of a 1-cours show by the show's anime studio (mostly a stand-in for Studio Gainax, I thought, given how the in-show anime _Jiggly Heaven_ is said to have fallen to late storyboards by the director, like _Evangelion_, and the poor animation provoked a firestorm of Internet criticism, which happened with _Tengen Toppen Gurren Lagann_; but others argue it'smore akin to the producing studio itself, P. A. Works, due to the problems with their previous anime, _Girls und Panzer_, which if true would make the second half much more trenchant and the whole anime that much more meta).\\n\\n\r\n    _Shirobako_ is not a documentary so much as a brightly-colored love-letter to an idealized image of the anime world, sanding off the rough edges like the starvation wages of animators or the outsourcing of much work to other countries (China and South Korea do not exist in the world of _Shirobako_), in which everyone is attractive & well-dressed, no one lives down to their stereotypes, plucky wannabes can succeed if they work hard, and the assholes work outside the studio or are just traumatized by past experiences, but still focusing on all the steps that go into producing a single anime episode and the large cast that tames the chaos. (Ironically, I say that it's an idealized image, but the anime industry still comes off as sometimes quite vicious nevertheless...) Shonen-style (or given that anime are made by teams, perhaps that should be sports-manga style?), our protagonists will follow their dreams and tackle the obstacles as they pop up. Like in _Animation Runner Kuromi_, the lead protagonist becomes the Production Desk, in charge of coordinating all the disparate stages and having their fingers in everyone's pies. The plot twists are a bit telegraphed (was anyone surprised when the author caused problems a second time?) or have occasional holes (how exactly was Hiraoka cured of being a embittered slacker, anyway? and I always assumed that the old guy Sugie *was* working on their current show, so that he was the solution to their animal-animation crisis came as a total surprise to me and not in a good way), and the anime references & allusions are surprisingly sparse - I particularly enjoyed the _Initial D_ homage in episode 1, the very appropriate use of the themes of _Space Runaway Ideon_ in episode 5 to reconcile two feuding studio members, and the homage to the final scene of _Cowboy Bebop_ in episode 23. Apparently every other character is a _roman a clef_, but I must admit I only caught Hideaki Anno's unusually serious appearance and Itano (of the Itano Circus), and certainly none of the voice actors or their agencies. (The parodies of light novel-based series are self-explanatory.) And naturally in an anime about producing anime, the backgrounding and design is excellently realistic (\"In making the handle of an axe by cutting wood with an axe, the model is indeed near at hand.\") Overall, a great watch for anyone interested in the making of anime.\\n",

            "content": "Very rarely does an anime come out and I describe it as unique; Shirobako is an exception. I have a very hard time coming up with any anime that remind me of Shirobako, because it is just so unique. It's an anime ABOUT making anime, so it's almost as if P.A. Works knew they were going to have an instant success on their hands. Shirobako is much more than that. It is simply an amazing experience.\r\nStory - 9\r\nShirobako is about making anime. And that's it. They story just goes from there, talking about everything from production problems to character designers toeven 3D work. It's amazing how much detail they cram into only 24 episodes. The only reason it isn't a perfect 10 is because the story isn't incredibly strong, and relies heavily on its characters, which isn't really a bad thing, it's just that it isn't as strong as it could have been. That said, it is still better than 90% of other anime that came out in 2014/2015.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't the best P.A. Works has done (That would be Nagi No Asukara in terms of fluidity and Another in terms of art design), but it's still solid. It takes everyday situations, and designs them in fantastical ways that make it much less realistic than it could be, but that's part of it's charm, and I kind of prefer it this way. Also, the character designs are amazing and some of my favorite designs in a while, particularly the designs for Shizuka and Seiichi. Also, Ogasuwara.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack doesn't distract from the show, and there isn't much to talk about. I like the openings and endings, but they are nowhere near my favorites. The reason it gets a 7 is because of all the voices. Seiichi's voice in particular is so lovable, I don't know if any English voice actor will do any of the characters justice. Weird, because normally I'm not a dub hater, I rather like dub, in fact, but this might be one of the few shows that I won't be able to watch the dub for because I've gotten attached to the characters' voices so hardcore. They're that good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\\n\r\nThis. This is where Shirobako truly shined. I was gonna write a big long paragraph here, but I'm lazy, so let me just say that they are all brilliant and probably the best ensemble cast I've ever seen in an anime. My favorites are Miyamori, Shizuka, Seiichi, Iguchi, Okitsu(because she's a badass), and Ema(because of that dance in episode 16).  They are amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe show gets one point of for enjoyment because the opening episodes didn't grab me as much as the later ones. Still, amazing overall. Thoroughly entertaining, I was almost never bored.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\\n\r\nFor the longest time, I've been searching for an anime similar to the American version of The Office, and I finally found it in Shirobako. It's a workplace comedy that isn't just about the comedy, and all the characters gel so nicely with one another, it's insane. Most of all, though, is that after watching Shirobako, you gain an appreciation for every anime you've ever seen, because of all the hard work put into all of anime. This is why I consider Shirobako to be one of the 5 anime that I consider mandatory viewing for any anime fan, with the others being the anime closest to your other favorite TV show, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Cowboy Bebop, and School Days, all for varying reasons. But, those are reviews for another day. In the meantime, I'll just be here, in my room, waiting impatiently for Shirobako Season 2.\\n",

Luckily for me the school stuff is kept to a few minimum flashbacks and the majority of the show takes place in the present where the girls and their coworkers waste their lives away creating anime I can eviscerate in a second or two with some well placed smug criticisms.Negative asshole that I am I was pleasantly disappointed to find out this show was actually good in a lot of ways in fact it came so close to edging excellence, I felt a rumble at the edge of my desk while watching it. Speaking of school clubs a show I have mentioned before Girls Und Panzer was made by the same people and most importantly the same director who did this and while the only surface similarity is that some of the art of the people looks similar and by similar I mean Aoi kind of looks like my main tank Femme from across the Thames, Darjeeling. I cant help but feel a lot of the same things about this show that I thought about GuP. That it did most things right for it's genre and what it was aiming for and had utilized it's premise enough to be satisfying and neither show really had any major mistakes. Well actually that scene in GuP when the one girl starts dancing for no reason when they were all in that barn kind of made me want to die to stop feeling the intense cringe. I think the biggest problem with both shows is more what they didn't do, than what they did. So I will attempt to show why I think this was a pretty good show and then explain in some ways why I thought it was just inadequate enough to not be excellent. \\n\\n\r\nThe characterization and the general arc of this show is really strong. Each one of the characters helps us understand the world of an anime production studio and all of them have believable quirks, faults and positives given their personalities and they all have an interesting history. One small detail I like about this show is the characters appearance actually changes in regards to things going on in their life. In some cases this is drastic like when the former PM comes back and he has lost weight since he is no longer in such a stationery work place, but the other characters all have different outfits, their hair and facial hair changes and they have different postures and body language. They also don't all look like palette swaps of one another, the characters are different sizes and heights which seems like a low bar for an animated show but... Let me just tell you I have seen some laziness in my time regarding these things and it's a welcome change to finally have a show go out of their way to differentiate the characters this much in both looks and personality. \\n\r\nThe main character Aoi Miyamori is a PRETTY good businesswoman and I respect her ability to successfully manage a project of this size and scope. She has a cute- I mean she has an acute sense of what it takes to get things done in these harsh circumstances. I love her... Dedication to the job. Ok real talk ladies, I want to compliment Aoi's big ass- abilities and propensity for patience with all the other work she had to do. For real though, I would have told those bastards to neck themselves if they asked me to go get them tea. Aoi is the hardest working woman in show business, she ain't got time to make your weak ass tea, go make her a fucking sandwich assholes. I'm not even joking, it seems like both of the fictional anime shows they were creating would have been a complete failure if Aoi wasn't out there busting her ass to get things done. This is a main character that really earns their main character status, it feels laughably ironic that one of the shows I completed and reviewed right before this was K-on with one of the most useless protagonists of all time in Yui Hirasawa and then to see a character like Aoi who is likeable, useful and yet still has believable faults. I would ask you out on a date Aoi, but you're probably too busy doing the Sisyphean task of keeping Musashino Animation in business and you're probably too good for me. I will worship thy image and hope for your good fortune from afar. I wish only the best for you thy lady virtue Aoi Miyamori, a golden woman for the modern age. Salute her as she passes, she needs all the support she can get. Seriously, if you don't get up and clap for this character at the last episode, you just might be an asshole. \\n\r\nI also really like the character of Seiichi. There is something about a ridiculously pathetic, perverted, overweight, past his prime, unmotivated loser that is still trying to relive past glories that appeals to me for some reason... I mean, I might know someone like that. A-anyway, his voice actor was also really good and managed to convey some of the more nuanced aspects of this character really well. Jigguri Jigguri Heaven sounds like the type of terrible show I would be \"tricked\" into watching after seeing nonstop hot photos and WeBMs of it. It appears I have been bamboozled again good sirs. *Adjusts monocle to bring the jiggle physics in better focus.* Yes... \"Tricked\" indeed. \\n\r\nMost of the other characters serve their purpose well enough and have just the right amount of development and screen time. The only character I don't like is Ai Kunogi and she is kept at a bare minimum and isn't important to the plot. I think the biggest problem with her actually is that she is an unnecessary character and we would be better served just getting more time with one of the animators we already knew throughout the series. \\n\r\nYou know this show wasn't even trying to be inspirational but for just a second while watching episode twelve, I felt like that food critic in Ratatouille, I remembered the joy of creation and what it means to care about the thing's I'm criticizing. My heart made of burnt out ashen coal reignited with fire after seeing Sugie find meaning in his old busted life. It was like split second Ikiru. For just a minute there I thought of all the people who must have worked on the shows I gave extremely negative reviews for and for the ones I will probably give in the future and I felt a pang of genuine remorse for them. The hardships they go through and the harsh nature of this industry behind the scenes. Then I remembered Yasuna's voice from Kill Me Baby and Yui's terrible personality in K-on and I was brought back down to earth. The point is folks, sometimes you remember that as fun as it is to hate on something, these things were someones dream and someones toil at one point. I would say the single greatest thing about this show is showing all the bullshit and strain these people have to go through just to get a show done. In that way a big production like this are a small miracle even when they do end up being mediocre in some way. \\n\\n\r\nRelated to the writing one thing this show did that not many pieces of media do is it tore away just a little bit at the idea that we should hold the original creators of these stories up on a pedestal. The amount of strain and bullshit related to the erratic whims of an author who refuses to speak with the anime production staff directly is a Kafkaesque nightmare and indicative of those circumstances is the absolute unfairness of a nameless, judge who can eviscerate weeks of work, time and money because of a slightly differing interpretation of a story that he wont even discuss until the last minute with these people just trying to get a fucking job done. I like artists, writers and I would like to think I'm a fan of creativity, but these people have faults too and they can be inconsiderate to an insane degree in situations like this and I'm sure a lot of people adapting someone else's work can relate to the insanity of this situation at least a little bit. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is so-so. It isn't bad and everything that is represented looks alright to me, as stated earlier the the characters all look good and have a lot of uniqueness to each of their designs. I will say I thought the CGI water in this show looked terrible, but that was about the only detail I can say looked really bad in some way. With me admitting the shows adequacy in terms of art.  I think this is a show that should have went with a more realistic or a more radically stylistic look. What I'm about to say is sacrilege, I might even get my anime reviewing license revoked for suggesting that such heretical black magic be used but I might even suggest something as radical as blatant rotoscoping/penciled in photo realism in this case. I know, it's lazy, you hate it, only dat real hand drawn stuff gets you hard. I'm just suggesting something out of the ordinary here or some extreme stylistic choice. Maybe if that is too extreme how about something like Ping Pong: The Animation? The reason I think that this would help here is it would make it more easily discernible from the anime being made within Shirobako's universe from whats being shown to us all the time in the show. They try to change the styles of the fictional shows they produce, but it's not quite enough for me and part of the problem is the baseline art is very basic for a show with such a high concept and potential. Something about all the animation in universe and out, all running together with one seamless style doesn't quite work for me. \\n\r\nAgain I'm not saying this shows art is bad as is, but that I think this would have improved it's ability to tell it's story if it got more creative in this regard. \\n\\n\r\nI noticed that the VA's in this show talked really fast most of the time. Every other second was an affirmative and abrupt \"\u306f\u3044.\" This show had a tense fast paced atmosphere despite it's subject matter about a business and without much outside drama inserted in. I think this could have been aided a little with a more unnerving/fast paced  soundtrack. The tunes aren't bad but they detract a little from the atmosphere of the rest of the show. I think of the movie Birdman (2014) and one of the things that worked about that really well was it's tense jazz soundtrack and how it and the way it was filmed, edited and acted all gave this extremely tense atmosphere. That movie was also about creating a work of art and I could tell Shirobako wanted the same \u306f\u3044 tension surrounding the creation of anime but couldn't quite reach it and I think it's conventional soundtrack was one of the reasons why. \\n\\n\r\nI have already said some things like the art and sound could have been utilized to greater effect to reach some of what I think this show was missing, but I think there is something else missing here. As someone who has wasted a good portion of his life digesting media. I like to engage in a little imaginary diversion when I beat a game, finish a film or read a book when I think it was good, but there was just that little bit of extra missing that might have made it a personal favorite of mine. So to find that out what that missing element might be let me explain what that aforementioned game is. \"What would it be like if \"x\" made this?\" \\n\\n\r\n-What would it be like if From Software made an Elder Scrolls game? \\n\r\n-What if Nicholas Winding Refn directed this random romantic comedy I saw? \\n\r\n-What would a trap rap album by 2Pac be like? \\n\r\n-What if Michael Bay directed Shindler's List?\\n\r\n-What if Obsidian made a Warhammer RPG?\\n\r\n-What would a school club anime made by Shinchiro Watanabe be like?\\n\\n\r\nSome of these are just admittedly humorous random mix ups but there are times when I think mixing things like this can shed light on the latent potential of something that wasn't quite reached. So lets do this with a seemingly random anime creator I totally haven't preselected ahead of time and Shirobako. Hmmmmmmm who to pick... Ok, I got it! There is a little known anime director named Satoshi Kon and by little known I mean he is like one of five anime directors people know by name so that already puts him in the top one percent of people to care about in the media. So what if Satoshi Kon made Shirobako? \\n\r\nI think Shirobako came really close to being one of the best, if not the best anime of all time. In fact I would still say it's a great to excellent show, but there is just that slight amount missing to knock it down from being one of the best shows ever for me. I think what it's missing and what I'm trying to get at with the Satoshi Kon example I'm about to espouse on is a break from the general format of anime. A show about anime creation should really celebrate the media in a way that utilizes editing, creative illustration and the history of animation to really push it forward. Granted they do try to add in some surreal elements with the main characters figures acting out her emotions a bit and the girl's imagining their future in fanciful ways, but it's just not enough for me. I expect more unbridled creativity out of a concept like this, for a longer explanation as to why I might feel this way read my Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun review. I have a feeling if this show had someone like a Sotoshi Kon behind it we would see what I think is missing from this show and it's premise, we would still have the same great story but more of the emotions and sheer artistry of the \"in show\" animation would be shown. His surreal elements would have went even further and we would get more of the psychological aspects of being an artist. We would see more of the negatives and downsides of the industry more elaborately spelled out maybe even in his case it would go overboard and show too much negativity, but at least it would take that risk. Shirobako to it's credit does attempt to show some of the downsides and struggles of the industry and even praised that to a small extent earlier in this review, but it has this kind of constant ambient positivity about everything that makes it just the slightest bit unbelievable for me. I also think a more creative director would bring more themes and use this opportunity to commentate a bit on the anime industry as a whole. \\n\r\nI know we would get the things described from him because we got it in his own works particularly in Paprika, Paranoia Agent and Perfect Blue. Which is again why I choose him to explore what is \"missing\" from this show. I guess will never know if this would have made for a better or worse show, but it's something I was pondering while watching it.\\n\\n\r\nI wonder how many people will read the first sentence of this review and immediately tell me my obviously false translation of Shirobako is wrong? I guess we will see kids. This show even despite my small gripes is still an excellent anime take on the anime industry. If you even have the slightest inkling to watch it, I would suggest that you do. I wouldn't say it's an absolute favorite of mine, but it got really close to that. When someone asks you \"Whats that anime that got you hooked?\" Tell that normie shithead \"AND-DDESU CHUCGGKY!\" And then deny them a sauce. \\n",

A young producer learning (along with the viewer) the ropes of the anime industry and animation production. This is the overall strength of Shirobako, showing the difficulties of sharp deadlines, re-writes, competition and production restraint and how it effects everyone at the studio.\r\nThe characters of Shirobako are great; their personalities help them to be easily distinguished and their interactions with each other is realistic andyet highly entertaining. Plus, what I found really interesting was seeing where these people were in their careers and how they've been shaped by the industry and how they see their work. It's really engaging and rewarding to witness, helping you care more about them and the story being told\\n\\n\r\nOne the negatives I found with this show is how the length begins to hurt the story of the anime, as it begins to follow some overdone tropes i.e. \"will the 'anime' make it in time to TV\". Even so, the way it's executed helps to make feel fresher than when other series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall; I really enjoyed this anime and it's become my go-to anime when I want to relax (not really sure why) and I highly recommend it, especially to any who's interested in animation or wants to get-into the industry.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation(s): \"Bakuman\" and/or \"Sakura Quest\" and/or \"Genshiken\".",
