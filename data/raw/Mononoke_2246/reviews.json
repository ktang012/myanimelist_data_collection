            "content": "Wow, what a series. Mononoke is the spinoff/sequel of the Bakeneko arc (eps. 9-11) in Ayakashi ~ Japanese Classic Horror. This is not to be confused with the final arc in Mononoke, which ironically, is also called Bakeneko. Although the original Bakeneko tale was brilliant, Mononoke is just as enticing, beautiful and well written as its predecessor. This series lets its art tell the tales. It is not afraid to experiment and has its own distinct style. This is a truly wonderful series especially visually and thematically.\r\nStory: This anime is broken into five different stories lasting about 2 to 3 episodes each. Every one ofthese stories features a different supernatural spirit; many of them rooted from Japanese folklore. It is up to the Medicine Seller to uncover the Katachi (shape/form), Makoto (truth), and Kotowari (reason) of the spirit. Now, this sounds like your average, spirit-of-the-week sort of deal, doesn't it? But it isn&rsquo;t. That's one aspect that makes this series so great. All the stories are unique and do not feel like a rehash of the same story as the previous. Even by the final arc, I was still shocked and entralled by its revelations. So yes, there are unexpected twists in every arc. Each tale also holds very thoughtful themes. You would expect a series about supernatural ghosts to be about the, well, dead spirits, but that's also not the case. Most of the stories are quite deep and to some degree disturbing. In fact, Mononoke is very thematically based on human nature, since it's the humans and their actions that transform the spirits into these vengeful mononoke.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I&rsquo;ll say it now. The art style may put off some people, especially based on first impressions. I thought the art was absolutely gorgeous, fitting, and unique. Mononoke uses an art style that resembles the Japanese &quot;ukiyo-e&quot;, filled with vibrant and colorful backgrounds, textures and designs. Because of this two-dimensional, almost paper cut-out appearance, the anime uses a lot of camera movements and symbolism. This is why a few of the stories may need multiple viewings to get the full meaning of everything. In this way, I feel Mononoke uses its art to its full potential to present the story. I also loved how the style in each arc deviates just a bit so that each story distinguishes itself from the others. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound plays a very important role in this series. Because the art style somewhat limits what it can show on screen, sounds are used to reinforce that. It sets up the tense atmosphere, adding suspense and leaving you anticipating for more. The voice acting is very well done, especially hearing those screams of terror and shock. Other than that, I didn't really like the opening and ending songs. I actually liked the Ayakashi OP and ED better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There is only one reoccurring character in all the stories and that is the ever-so-awesome Medicine Seller! Yes, he is nameless and simply known as &ldquo;Kururi-uri-san/sama/insert other honorific&rdquo; or medicine seller. Although not much is known about him, I think it's very fitting since it adds to his mysterious nature. He does, though very subtly, develop. In all honesty though, I found it incredibly enjoyable watching him make deadpan comments while the other characters are freaking out over the weird happenings/hauntings. Lastly, the story-only-characters get a good deal of development despite each story being 2 to 3 episodes in length.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Final notes: I finished the series in 2 days, meaning I watched about 6 episodes per day. So yeah&hellip; I enjoyed it a lot. And as mentioned earlier, some arcs may take a second or even third viewing to get everything. I know I will watch it again. It's such an excellent anime and was so worth the watch.  \\n\\n\r\n9.6/10 easily rounded to a 10/10 for my list.",

            "content": "My initial impression of Mononoke was literally, \"...\". After giving it a chance I am glad that I wasn't quick to judge and saw it through. Mononoke is a collection of short stories revolving around mysterious spirits/creatures known as, from the title, Mononoke. The writing and directing of the series are excellently done and really immerse you in the story itself. Each arc is a new story with new characters that are well fleshed out in the beginning of each segment. The Medicine Seller, Kusuriuri, is the only recurring character and is mysterious as always with each new arc.\r\nThe artistic styling of Mononoke is trulyone of a kind, the colours are amazing and with HD encodes it truly shines. Each new environment is unique, colourful, and captivating. The colours and use of quick camera movements add to the suspense. The animations themselves are intentionally very stiff at times but as the action speeds up they become very fluid and top notch. The backgrounds are rarely stationary, but appear as though you are observing a painting at the same time. Often times the animations of common things such as snow or water are displayed in a very unique way that makes you simply want to get lost in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds of Mononoke are fantastic. There is often times complete silence, but that only adds to the suspense. The OP and ED are very nice, nothing exceptional, but nice. The use of sounds, such as screams, thumps and other such frightening sounds are extremely realistic. I hate to admit it but I was genuinely frightened at certain points.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the Medicine Seller, each arc sees the introduction of new characters. Each character usually represents a different Japanese stereotype. Samurai, priests, monks, government types, children, and many others. Kusuriuri's alternate self, I won't give anything away, is almost worth watching the story for on its own. The Medicine Seller is a very sarcastic person and often times at a very serious moment he'll crack a joke that is totally absurd and you can't help but laugh.\\n\\n\r\nAt only twelve episodes Mononoke is well worth the time and although it is very, very Japanese in respects to content, it doesn't take away from the enjoyment in the least. As I mentioned before, Mononoke is excellent at generating fear out of the simplest of situations with very little audio. The characters are all very genuine and are often times in tears and losing their minds in a very believable manner.\\n\\n\r\nI've wasted enough of your time, now go watch this show. You definitely won't regret it.",

            "content": "When someone talks about the genre of horror, immediately a few things come to mind: blood, violent motion, bone and flesh torn asunder, gore essentially approaching abundant forms of shock value. These are what characterize the images that litter the horror genre today. However, one cannot discount the impact of simpler techniques. Muffled voices, the bloodcurdling scream, the manic dip toward insanity; these are all subtler methods which give rise to the imagination and thus leave a more impressionable impact. Mononoke adopts such techniques in each of its standalone stories, and it may not be surprising that these implementations are often left unappreciated. Yet, byadapting these horror tools along with an artistic presentation, rhythmic score, and strongly representative story, it is no wonder then that Mononoke is an excellently produced work.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nBefore we embark on Mononoke's journey one may first need to understand the very concept of Mononoke. One of the basic types of Ayakashi (tl. \"unnatural spirit\") is formed from the soul of a living or non-living material. Oftentimes, regret causes this, and when an Ayakashi is merged with strong human emotions such as vengeance, sadness, or fear, it develops into a Mononoke (tl. \"hostile spirit\"). This is the foundation for conflicts in each story and what typically stems from each Ayakashi's backstory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself follows a Kusuriuri (tl. \"medicine seller\") who travels from one place to another exorcising each Mononoke he comes across. The anime presents five standalone arcs. Each one consists of 2 or 3 episodes, which may sound as if there is not enough time allocated to serve each story properly. Fortunately, this uncertainty is untrue. Each arc is thoroughly interesting, bizarre, and complex; viewers will be astonished by the profound impact each short story relays.\\n\\n\r\nEvery arc meticulously refines its pace in order to provide characters enough time to adapt to their roles. Once the primary conflict is staged and the Mononoke is revealed, Kusuriuri puts himself to the task of unraveling its Katachi, Makoto, and Kotowari (tl. \"Form\", \"Truth\", and \"Regret\") \u2014 the three requirements for him to release his \"Sword of Exorcism\". What makes Mononoke a highly commendable work is its highly structured format, as well as its exploration of every character's motives. Kusuriuri simply can't draw his sword and exorcise the Mononoke until a predetermined set of conditions is followed. Moreover, whilst watching Kusuriuri reveal a Mononoke's Form, Truth, and Regret, we come across a saddening tale of how it came into existence. Mononoke does an excellent job in attracting viewers with its harrowing tales, and its precisely carved narrative makes it an unforgettable experience.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, Mononoke is one of the most finely detailed pieces in existence. From vibrant and colorful backgrounds to highly detailed characters and costume designs, Mononoke has crossed every barrier in this field in order to achieve excellence. The pasty color palette may seem an odd choice for a horror anime, but make no haste; it merges perfectly with the setting and culture of this work. The backgrounds are perforated with different textures all of which that complement each standalone narrative.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally, Mononoke can exist in any form and in this anime they are designed explicitly (and sometimes intentionally vaguely) in order to vary with respect to their arcs. Toei Animation has done a wonderful job in designing every character intelligently and distinctively in correspondence to their personality. Kusuriuri's design in particular manages to stand out on every frame. Moreover, his climactic transformation remains one of the most excellent aesthetic achievements in anime: it produces such a profound form and with fantastically surreal animation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nMatching the astounding art, what makes the characters so memorable is how they are portrayed. Not only are they emotionally distraught and relatable, groups of them often form a well-represented allegory. Mononoke is also an eclectic social commentary, ranging from remarks on corruption within governmental policies to more localized analyses of vengeance and despair.\\n\\n\r\nOne role which continues to outshine all others is the recurring character Kusuriuri. Unnamed, unrevealed, and from beginning to end an unknown, this enigmatic figure is the lone consistent tool from story to story. He breathes ambiguity, and his role always wedges into the plot should it ever begin to stale. He also does not share any form of development, and yet his indecipherable status always mystifies viewers in order to keep Mononoke's harrowing atmosphere at its greatest.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening and Ending themes may seem peculiar, but they are certainly stylish, and as unhinged periodic pieces, they imperceptibly suit the series' direction. However, what marks Mononoke is not the music but the sound effects. Each opportuned implementation pervades the room with mystery and sheer awe. Mononoke also takes inspiration from kabuki plays, which is an interesting spin as much of its presentation follows panelwork very typical of this theatre current.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps above all, Mononoke is an experiment on convention. Its presentation offers a instantaneous, visceral reaction, and its story takes great efforts to rely on its atmosphere to tell the tale. However, it allow follows a highly structured narrative, which roots its foundation in order to prevent stories from becoming too insane. As a waltz through the Ayakashi mythos, Mononoke is one series never to forget.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nThis review is the final product of a team composed of members from the \"Critics and Connoisseurs\" club.

            "content": "The wooden curtain opens with a sinister smile revealing the first scene:\r\nA wave of vibrant, whirling umbrellas cascade down the street; the rain continues to pour in assorted shapes, accompanied by the patter of hollow conversations latching on to the sounds of its perpetual fall. On top of the path rests a towering hotel embellished by color, wood, and ruse. Slowly, an enigmatic wanderer appears at the gate of the inn, with a wooden box strapped on his back requesting to stay there. He is identified as the medicine seller. Shortly after, a young pregnant woman, dressed in desperation, finds herself at the same inn;seeking shelter and protection.\\n\\n\r\nThere is, however, something amiss in the rainbow-tinted inn, and right away, its secrets provoke the senses; they seem to be everywhere \u2013 in the walls, in the unseen guests, in the corridor. After a heated argument between the innkeeper and the girl, she finds herself in an isolated room, lathered in opulence but infested by shadows of all shades. Following this unsettling vision, the show starts to bare its true face. There is something indeed amiss here and the Medicine Seller\u2019s true purpose is brought forth: he came to hunt the horrors that plague the inn, otherwise known as \u201cMononoke\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThat is the basic premise of the 12-episode series titled Mononoke. The series is divided into five arcs, in which, the Medicine Seller (or Kusuriuri) attempts to seek, hunt, and exorcise these otherworldly spirits known as Mononoke. Essentially, Mononoke could be defined as a class of spirits, however, the ones Kusuriuri is concerned with are closest to humans, because they manifest from humans. These are corrupted entities that seem to bring sorrow, suffering, and destruction where they go and to who they haunt. Thus, this is a tale of the unknown, of mystery, of psychology and pathos, of ancient lore, and lastly, of horror that may disguise itself as a series of ghost stories, but only superficially. \\n\\n\r\nOne of Mononoke\u2019s greatest strengths is its ability to intertwine the aforesaid elements with subliminal insight that gives it its multi-dimensional form. Most supernatural stories will focus on the imminent horror factor, or inducing temporary fear simply by virtue. Mononoke does something completely different. Rather than focusing on the external fear synonymous with the spirit(s) and their curses, it looks inward, to the living, rather than the dead. This is meticulously explicated by Kusuriuri\u2019s methodology. In order to exorcise any Mononoke, he needs to first recognize its Form (physical), Truth (circumstance), and Reason (motivation). Much of this is revealed through digressing into the psyche of the parties involved in each arc, where Kusuriuri exploits the inner turmoil of each respective character and how that turmoil projects itself on to the Mononoke in ways that are not just terrifying, but often times, heartbreaking and utterly human. \\n\\n\r\nReally, it\u2019s the \u201chuman\u201d element of the series that makes it so compelling which is mostly through the manner it incites and decrypts human nature and its capacity to wander in the dark. It\u2019s carnivorous, yearning for fear and emotion; yet, it isn\u2019t done through manipulation, shock value, or contrivance. Rather, Mononoke opts for psychological precision. The show doesn\u2019t aim to deliver some insane amount of singular \u201ccharacter development\u201d but rather uncover what lies in the dark, and thereby showing the ability for what is presented as good, innocent, virtuous to be equally bad, tainted, and sinful. Consequently, the show is heavily driven by its themes and self-contained plot rather than individual characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe aforesaid will lead many to flock to the notion of \u201cbad characterization\u201d or not enough \u201ccharacter\u201d \u201cdevelopment\u201d, but one needs to contextualize what a work is actually trying to do/achieve before arbitrarily applying a set of self-drawn commandments. Characters can be utilized in many different ways as can a story be told in multiple ways. The characters of Mononoke are outwardly static, including Kusuriuri  but that does not mean they are superfluous. They are internalized or \u201cdeveloped\u201d/personified in many ways, whether it be through human analytics brought forth by yours truly ~the Medicine Man~ or the interactions, actions, and reactions that are revealed as a product of surfacing truths and unearthing secrets. Mononoke functions as a collective exploration of the temporal realm through the supernatural and both are interlocked by these ordinary characters that are deeper than they may initially look. Essentially, the characters are immensely important, for it is through them and their stagnation that the show is able to conduct its psychological experimentation. \\n\\n\r\nEach character\u2019s predicament is sealed by fate, but the stories aren\u2019t about the end; they\u2019re about how such an end could come about and the choices that led to it. By dissecting the unknown, Kusuriuri finds himself in the middle of intersecting realities that are as terrifying as they are tragic. What makes all the stories consistently effective is the finesse with which the show handles each character\u2019s state, and the mononoke that transpires from them (whether they be a projection of corrupted desires, or a product of unrequited yearning, or a manifestation of unspoken crimes). Therefore, the \u201cunknown\u201d or \u201chorror\u201d isn\u2019t really about the monsters or ghosts, but what creeps inside seemingly ordinary folk, and the will that could innately exist to ignite suffering. Through these various arcs, the characters in those arcs, and Kusuriuri himself, Mononoke presents accounts that are deeply disturbing and equally enlightening. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, this also reinforces the unacknowledged strength of episodic structures. Mononoke shows that the quality of the plot or other elements isn\u2019t internally compromised if the work lacks a continuous/overarching plot or a constant cast developing linearly and consistently. Its anthological nature fares well for it and its intentions for it turns out to be far more vicious in its horror, tragic in its drama and stylized in its art that every piece of it comes together effortlessly. It fully embraces the power of the medium and extends its boundaries far beyond traditional story-telling into a work of innovation, wonder, mysticism, and art.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd, elementally, nowhere else does this concentrated sublimity appear more than in Mononoke\u2019s visual presentation. The best way to describe the art and animation of Mononoke is: idiosyncratic. It is so particular and unique that I\u2019d be willing to wager it exists only to tell the stories that Mononoke did. \\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, the art style may come off as incredibly gaudy, over-the-top, and immensely theatrical (Curtains open and close at whim supported by decisive gongs dictating the flow of various scenes; highly sensitized color palettes are constantly at the forefront, clashing in folly, but never jarring; costumes and getups are so lurid that they seem to have fallen right out of a stage set; faces are painted with perfect expression that each frame seems like a change of masks, rather than emotion). Yet all of this works beautifully. Mononoke reminds me of something running in an aged-Kabuki theater, at least aesthetically, which is actualized through the bizarre sets of color, costume, and personalities, the artistically-tuned performances, and the emphasis on extravagance.\\n\\n\r\nMononoke\u2019s visuals are a feat in and of themselves, but the real laudable aspect is how that art is integrated into the narrative. The reason I stress to call this work, a work of \u201cart\u201d (besides its literal merits) is because of its ability to use its elements to create something whole that transcends its own platform and deliver \u2013 with individuality, acuity, and sincerity \u2013 its subject and themes with clear prowess and understanding (of itself and its ambitions). Take its approach to horror for example. Even though the art-style is the last thing from traditional horror, given how theatrical it is, the way it infuses horror is with complete subtlety.\\n\\n\r\nTo elaborate, each arc is extremely claustrophobic, as in, the framing or setting of the arcs always occur in a juxtaposed manner. Whether it be stuck in a room of a humongous hotel, or a ship on the open seas, or a prison cell, or a train car speeding through a tunnel, the unsettling feeling of being \u201cboxed-in\u201d never leaves. It produces this inescapable void from the get-go and maintains that in the background, but it\u2019s by far one of the most prominent things it does to invoke and sustain fear and discomfort. Not only are we forced into the corners of depraved minds, but we are confined there, with an evil that has the capability to exist everywhere, and within everyone. Furthermore, its usage of color is one of the best I\u2019ve seen. Works of horror will generally opt for a gloomy, desolate mood which favors subdued grays, blacks, with the exception of red for obvious reasons. Mononoke on the other hand probably utilizes every color on the spectrum but does so effectively. I would never have imagined that such a palette could ever tell stories so terrifying and do so with the power that they do. Combined with its psychological propensity, the visual direction of the series is one of the best I\u2019ve had the pleasure of experiencing; both as a work of Horror, and as a work of Art (and for once, we don\u2019t have to separate the two). \\n\\n\r\nMononoke is a superb show, but it isn\u2019t for everyone. It is unconventional in every sense of the word. It relies heavily on its own art, such as the barrage of interconnected, but flashing painting like images, or color-doused symbolism to tell its story. Not everything is spelled out here, and a lot of the stories feel like stories within stories since they do stem from various Japanese lore (such as about the concept of Mononoke itself, or what certain acts/paintings/symbols signify). Yet, it is accessible enough, universal enough, that it still communicates the stories of these people, spirits, and time wonderfully. Additionally, as much as I have praised the art, this style can be off-putting to many since often times it might prove to be distracting enough to deviate from the actual narrative. The cut-out style of many backgrounds is a good example of this. Lastly, people under the impression that this is a run-of-the-mill horror featuring gore porn or cool fights/deaths, let me be the first to convey that is not the case. The horror is more personalized through the tragedies of each situation, not through spirits killing randomly (as one would find in a Hollywood tale of biblical possession).  \\n\\n\r\nTruly, there is no better way to watch Mononoke, than as if watching a play. Yet, good art has the ability to transfer fiction into reality, and acquaint its consumer with its own feelings and dilemmas. In effect then, the shadows that lurk on the stage also lurk off-stage. And as the wooden curtain closes with the last gong and a similar smile, and the once busy street full of spinning umbrellas is left barren, Mononoke will also leave you with shadows of your own; standing on what you thought was a stage.",

Well, actually...\r\nThey both involve antagonists, usually out to terrorize or for revenge, who force the hero to hole themselves up in an interior location with troublesome civilians, while using their wits and skills to battle to an explosive and emotional resolution.  See?\r\nHere's where Mononoke carves itself an identity to make itself stand out from John McClane&rsquo;s frolics with Euro-trash in cramped quarters: (we're all ignoring the 4th instalment, right?)\r\nMononoke is a visual splatter of psychedelic imagery that's like thecreation of a prodigious savant child born from Stanley Kubrick, or Darren Aronofsky, take your pick.  The colours just jump out at you no matter where the scene is or what's occurring, they're alive and part of the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nA narrative that&rsquo;s kept lively through snappy editing.  Scene and shot transitions flow, snake, and leap all over the place, using every cinematic method available.

Only willing to speak when he has a reason to, if only more anime characters were like this.  There's no filler to be seen in this show, whether it's absent from the dialogue or story.\\n\\n\r\nBut for a show so dependant on scaring the viewer witless through bizarre imagery, narrative coherency isn&rsquo;t so important, mood is.  The use of colour is actually a really smart way to affect our mood, because scenes that are so bright and vivid actually work in a way that you wouldn&rsquo;t expect.\\n\\n\r\n&quot;Why am I getting freaked out by this empty room, even though it&rsquo;s decorated so colourfully?  Oh wait, because Yasaharu Takanashi's score is making creepy noises and I thought I just saw an Oompa Loompa in that corner for a moment but it must have been my imagination...&quot;\\n\\n\r\nThe set-up to each story arc is eerie, the climax visceral, and the resolution always emotional.  Mononoke is a brilliantly written, edited, and directed Edo-period-and-beyond horror that is inspiring in its design and delivery.\\n\\n\r\n12 episodes.  One medicine seller.  The odds are against Kusuriuri.  That&rsquo;s just the way he likes it.",

            "content": "Deadly monsters, haunting spirits, and supernatural entities that are beyond human to even describe with words are but a few examples of what makes horror an appealing genre to many. There are great examples of works of horror that can be considered real masterpieces in its kind. However, it is undoubtedly one of the most accessible genres to not succeed in garnering pure terror within its framework. Especially with anime, where there are only a handful of noteworthy horror shows and the rest only come up with predictable scares and horror tropes being used way too much. Mononoke fits, unfortunately, to the latter; but onlyby a very slim margin.\\n\\n\r\nTo expand on that last point, Mononoke is not what you would call a terrifying show to watch. It would be more accurate to describe it as \u201cstartling.\u201d It doesn\u2019t try to disturb you with its overly-bombastic imagery; it instead wants you to seek out the subtle artistic prowess that it has to show before it then starts to suck you into the horror by surprise. The execution of all of it feels very right and nicely spaced out so that they feel less tedious and uneventful to go through. Many horror anime, and especially horror movies today, think that if it throws in any ominous or thunderous music, blood splattering gore, or your usual horror cliche left and right that they can call their show a true horror show. In reality, they make it the opposite of their intention because you\u2019re already used to it after the twentieth time it has happened halfway through.\\n\\n\r\nMononoke proves that you don\u2019t have to use any of those aspects in horror to define yourself as one. The one thing that almost everyone can agree with is that the real source of horror is the \u201cunknown.\u201d The fact that you can\u2019t see something, yet you feel a presence within your surroundings can be one of the most genuinely terrifying things to experience in real life or film. Elements of this nature were put into full effect when H.P. Lovecraft first based his stories around this concept. You can see, quite clearly, that Mononoke does the same inflections of some of the stories Lovecraft put into his short stories and does them to brilliant effect. The only noticeable difference is that Mononoke shows the supernatural entities whereas Lovecraft never did.\\n\\n\r\nHow the show is set up is by the apparent inclination that this is a separate story based off of the character, \u201cMedicine Man,\u201d from one of the short stories from Ayakashi \u2013 Samurai Horror Tales. Before I discuss how the show structures its plot in each of the arcs, the one fundamental notion to mention that makes Mononoke a truly unique experience is how much creative detail it gives to the setting of historical Japan. Along with House of Five Leaves, this is one of the closest that anime has gotten, in recent memory, that truly captures the pure essence and atmosphere of what Japan was like during its later modern period. Obviously, without all of the supernatural elements to it, the artwork that is put on display feels like an ancient painting done by past painters from Japan that strengthens the atmosphere and its impact on the creativity put into the horror. Not only the artwork but also the little tidbits they put into the show that include various Japanese folklore that they tell us at the end are very inspiring and fascinating to experience.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the plot arcs themselves, they are, unfortunately, not the very highest point in terms of compelling storytelling. With about five different stories put into one show, only two of them stick in my mind as entirely memorable or thought-provoking. The one that can be considered excellent is the first one because of how it introduces us to Mononoke\u2019s world and its concepts of the Mononoke and is a good introduction to the show. The second arc consists of a very gripping story about each\u2019s goals of getting out of the mess that they have been brought to and each of them has this detailed back story makes them not just this throwaway character that our main protagonist steals the show from. Unfortunately, the rest suffer through, what I would call, overused tropes from the previous two episodes. Of the three last arcs, two of them both involve a group of people that Kusuriuri, our main protagonist, tries to investigate concerning the disturbance of Mononoke. It is almost as if the writer could not think of a new kind of formula he could put into his stories, so he decides to reuse similar tropes to his previous novels and put in a completely different spin on that original idea. It doesn\u2019t matter if the plot is entirely different from the previous one, it still follows the same formula and it feels repetitive and almost predictable.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say they are \u201cterrible\u201d to go by, not at all; it just feels mediocre compared to the previous ones. With that said, what makes the plot worthwhile to experience, for better or for worse, is Kusuriuri, or the \u201cMedicine Man\u201d as he\u2019s typically called. Similar to how great Ginko is in Mushishi, Kusuriuri has this aura around him that makes him very attention-grabbing. The only difference is that you don\u2019t know much about Kusuriuri\u2019s personal life, but only what he does in his job. His smart, fast-moving mind makes him a competent protagonist to root for only by how calculated he lays out his plans in getting the Mononoke and helping the people that need his help the most. It is one of the rare instances where the lack of personal development of one character doesn\u2019t hold back the quality of the them and just from how much he views the world from his own eyes and gives us his take on the mysteries involved in the plot. The unknown archetype adds to his depth and characterization so much more than almost any of the characters in Mononoke, who also have well-developed characterization.\\n\\n\r\nWhether you want to call the animation, provided by the most lauded Toei Animation, \u201cexperimental\u201d or \u201cclassic art,\u201d it nevertheless feels very dynamic. Toei has always wanted to stick to original roots when concentrating on their animation skills in most of their productions, and this is by far one of their best. The fluid motions of how the characters move, react and illuminate feel very human-like and provide a significant degree of hard-work put into each frame of animation. What is even more fascinating is how the animators put a lot of creativity into the actual Mononoke, which is influenced by Japanese folklore. Even though you don\u2019t see them for more than, say, five seconds, those five seconds will be burnt into your memory for years to come.\\n\\n\r\nMononoke is a different breed of horror that many anime have not attempted to replicate even in the past. There hasn\u2019t been a horror film or show that never makes you scream out in terror, yet in your mind, you feel almost as if you had gone through a night terror that you don\u2019t remember screaming, in sheer anguish and fear. While the show never really compiles to an important detail of a groundbreaking story, it surely is a sight to behold in grasping what can be done with an gorgeous setting with beautiful sets of animation to go with it. Let it be said; when it comes to creating great horror, there should never be boundaries that restrict what it wants to show in terms of pure terror. Otherwise, it would not be horror, one way or the other.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-\\n",

The main and the only recurring character is the Medicine Seller, a laconic man of whom we learn almost nothing, and who, throughout the series, only using his knowledge and a handful of tools, battles the various Mononoke. \r\nThe team at Toei Animation accomplished something quite unique - they brought a painting to life. The stationary, ever-present texture of marbled paper, reinforces the illusion of a canvas across which the characters move, in all their watercolour glory, somewhat reminiscent of Ukiyo-e prints. The art is highly stylised withits unique character design and rich, breathtaking backgrounds. This visual feast should be savoured and experienced again - it's hard to soak in every detail, particularly if you have to read the subtitles at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps having a peculiar taste for darker stories, where the horror is implied rather than shown, here paired together with exceptional style of the animation enabled me to tremendously enjoy this series. And, hence the high scores I gave.",

            "content": "Emotions, it's a powerful thing that lurks in human. It can manipulate your feelings, actions, and thoughts. Love, Hate, and other emotions can easily enter your inner-self, creating something we called Demons. Mononoke portrayed how atrocious human emotion can be, and how great an episodic anime can tell a story. \r\nThe series started in feudal Japan (probably in Edo Period), Mononoke its evil spirits that born from human emotions. There's one person that able to slay the Mononoke known as Kusuriuri or Medicine Seller, he has a mystic sword that can slay the spirits, but in order to slay it, he have to discover thethree essences of Mononoke. The Form, Truth, and  Reason of the Mononoke.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I thought the story concept will create a dull storytelling, but I was wrong. The story consists of 5 unrelated short stories. Each story has their own way, it has unique differences and unpredictable plot twists and makes me speechless because of it. They didn't recycle the same idea but they developed them to create intense storytelling. For a horror anime, Mononoke didn't need blood, gory action, and many other overly-used horror elements, it just need a suspense story. Mononoke successfully created that each story.\\n\\n\r\nThe animations have a dark but full of different color. They trying to achieve the real horror elements and they succeed. The characters emotions were nonetheless the best they could offer, manic, panic, fear, laugh. It has various different expression drawn fluidly. Some people may found the art quite disturbing, but if you look in a different perspective it is a brilliant effort indeed. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound setting was a total fit to this anime. I really amaze by the voice actors who can bring such emotion to the screen. Another good point is the sound effect, from screaming, pounding, whispering perfectly done which created a plus sign for the horror element. Opening song Kagen no Tsuki sung by Ryouta Komatsu and Charlie Kousei have succesfully portrayed the combination of old western music and old eastern music and classically fits the anime. While the Ending song Natsu no Hana sung by JUJU brings a tender yet calm moments after a terror comes. I also found out the back sound quite good indeed, its have dark feelings that increase the intense more demonic. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character, we have only one role that keeps the story rolling, and the person is the Medicine Seller or Kusuriuri. Kusuriuri-san stands anonymously to the end. There is little known about him, but his calm and collected nature makes Mononoke more interesting and enjoyable to watch. Each episode has their own characters, those episodes only characters have a great development despite being shallow because 2-3 episodes length. \\n\\n\r\nMononoke stands as a unique figure that has to be the role model to keep the horror genre stands top. The unpredictable plot twist, intense, drama, and even art and sound settings make this anime enjoyable. If you seek for an anime that depicts the horror genre successfully in a different way from it should be. Then you might have to check this anime.",

            "content": "Have you ever got to the point in watching modern anime where you're lacking that refreshing series? Do you sometimes feel the medium has become watered down and need something to reevaluate your interest in anime? To those of you who feel this way, your Lord and Savior has arrived. Enter Mononoke stage right. A bizarre 2007 release by animation giant Toei Studios (One Piece, Dragonball, Air Gear), Mononoke is unconventional, haunting, suspenseful and dramatic. Coupled with the most striking and unique art style I've come across in ages, Mononoke seeks to create a theatrical masterpiece through its uncanny vignettes. The verdict? Well, you\u2019ll justhave to watch it and see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nI want to preface my review with a mild disclaimer: this anime is not for everyone. If you find yourself to prefer very structured shows with your standard anime-isms (fanservice, lots of fight scenes and JPop soundtracks), I would not recommend devoting your time to Mononoke. This series is a large departure from the common anime stereotypes. It will not hold your hand, as there is a lot of mental deciphering to be had. It\u2019s more accessible than shows like Serial Experiments Lain and Texhnolyze, but there is some ambiguity about it. Mononoke\u2019s story is divided into 5 \u201cplays\u201d, each with their own beginning, climax and ending. Each anecdote features a similar character, Kusuriuri, a self-proclaimed medicine seller, who is drawn to the environment based on the presence of a mononoke, or spirit. Some stories involve possession, while others focus on the looming presence of a ghost seeking revenge on its killer. Each performance begins mostly innocent and quickly escalates into a mind-bending mix of trepidation and human psychology. Suspense is intricately woven into each tale via vivid imagery and ominous sound effects, some of them truly unsettling. I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like it. \\n\\n\r\nAnother important point to mention is that Mononoke doesn\u2019t center itself around the personified spirit in each tale, but moreso on the people affected by its presence. There isn\u2019t a lot of strong character development or backstory to be had, but that\u2019s not the point of the series. Mononoke illustrates the very depths of human emotion, the places people don\u2019t want to show others. These are instinctual, raw and terrifying feelings put on full display within each episode\u2019s structure. It\u2019s less about the individuals and more about the human psyche overall. Mononoke\u2019s scenes take place mostly in a stagnant area, causing an effect of isolation to be instilled on the characters affected. This aids the writers in being able to exemplify the state of someone in mental peril. Viewers witness a mental breakdown from beginning to end. It may seem long and drawn out, but it\u2019s impactful and unsettling nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThough its strong, theatrical approach to storytelling, the best advice I can give to watching it is in segments. Watch each story individually, and don\u2019t binge it. That way you can really feel the impact of each play as it unfolds, and nothing will blur together. Episodic shows like Mononoke and Mushishi can be difficult to recommend because you can\u2019t watch them like normal anime. Although Mushishi is one of my favorite anime, I had to take my time with it because of its languid,  atmospheric nature. A similar point can be made with regard to Mononoke. It\u2019s so different from other anime that it almost needs its own genre.\\n\\n\r\nKusuriuri as a character is enigmatic and entertaining. The way he constantly introduces himself as a medicine seller, only to almost instantly display his true abilities is mildly amusing. His exorcisms take something as impenetrable as the mononoke and deconstructs it down to a form, a truth and a reason, in order to expel it from existence. His past is unexplored, adding to the shroud of mystery surrounding him. I can\u2019t say I cared for him in the earlier portions of the series, but as the anime progressed, his presence in each tale was a comforting familiarity in the chaos of the unexpected.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters were all extremely unique. The character models were detailed and often exaggerated (i.e. the boy on the train). They wore their emotions on their sleeves so to speak, as their bodies would become red when frustrated or distorted when terrified. I especially enjoyed the episode with the fox-masked mononoke and how he would constantly don a new mask to portray the feeling that was present in the atmosphere. The character\u2019s relatability, although in a vastly different setting, was instrumental to getting the show\u2019s message across. Displaying how certain personalities would respond in certain harrowing situations really left an impact on me.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in Mononoke is unlike anything I\u2019ve seen before. The colors are vivid and characters are remarkably distinct in their features. The lucid sequences involving the unveiling of the various spirits are some of the most beautiful scenes I\u2019ve witnessed in an anime. The way the shots cut sporadically and blur fantasy and reality within a dream-like atmosphere are stunning. Honestly, I\u2019ve never seen fear and emotion better depicted than in the animation here. I know that may be a shocking statement for some, but the purely poignant aura the animators created in Mononoke is nothing short of brilliant. I can understand how some viewers may get caught up in the amount of \u201cthings\u201d in the background, possibility even distracting them from the associated scene, but it was a minor inconvenience for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound is also a masterful feat in Mononoke. Although I can\u2019t say I necessarily loved either the OP or ED, the tracks did fit the series well. The OP captured the whimsical nature of the art and the ED wrapped up the \u201cplays\u201d with a melodic ballad. The sounds effects were the strongest part of the anime\u2019s OST. Whether it was the crunching of bones, or blood-curtling screams, the sound designers must have had an immense amount of fun with Mononoke. The background music is rare but efficient, subtly adding to the corresponding scene as needed. The voice acting is a real gem as well, with strong performances by Takahiro Sakurai as Kusuriuru and Yukana and Tayo (the wide-eyed girl from the train).\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of Mononoke is largely based on my ability to take the series slow. As mentioned above, this is NOT a binge anime. Experience the plays one at a time, by yourself in the dark, much like I alluded to in my Mushishi review. If you truly close all expectations and stereotypes off, you\u2019ll find one of the most remarkable anime series in existence. Mononoke captures human emotion and psychology in one fell swoop, creating an atmospheric masterpiece with an intricate art style to go with it. This anime is a work of art, a drama for the ages, and one I\u2019ll most certainly remember as an instant classic.",

            "content": "I'll try too keep this review rather short and concise, but I'll probably just start rambling and won't be able to stop myself if I get out of hand. Since I'm such a rambler, please forgive me if it sometimes seems somewhat unorganized even though I'll do some organizing when it's done. If you're not bothered to read the whole things I wrote 3 pros and 3 cons at the bottom.\r\nPersonally I watched this before Ayakashi - Japanese Classic Horror which this is a spin-off from and you can go ahead and watch this without having seen it.\r\nFirst of let me start of with thatthe art was really intriguing. I like animes with a more experimental approach to the art. Not nearly as experimental and artsy as Mind Game, which remains as my favorite anime-art to date. Sometimes the art just feels like stylized art with a filter put on it, which is pretty lame. Despite that this is one of my favorite arts to date. It goes very well with the stories and really raises the mood and atmosphere rather than just being a medium of information. Not recommended for fans of the stereotypical huge eye school anime style.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good though it's fairly underused throughout the series. The sound effects feel fitting. The voice actors  do their jobs as they should, it feels natural and synchronized with the animation, correct tone etc.. Onto the substance of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nMononoke is composed of five arcs, all of which are only related by the recurrent main character and similar plotline. The story follows a wandering medicine seller who combats malicious spirits. One gets to observe group psychology as unsuspecting humans confront supernatural as well as life threatening situations. Note that I said observe, one never really feels 'connected' and feels for the characters. It is the result of a main character with nerves of steel and a heart of ice, I'm not saying his character is bad though, it's a very intriguing and interesting one. I really like the main character, I fell in love with him the first episode, so damn cool ^^. This is one of those odd and seemingly emotionless types. There are a few moments where he gets a little too flat (for example in the last arc). You never get a background or introduction on the arc characters, it charges almost immediately into the story. The result is as said before, makes you more of an observer instead of feeling with the characters. This deems the horror part of the story pretty useless since you won\u2019t feel their fear as a spectator. Or I don\u2019t know, maybe I'm just hard to frighten? I hope I don't seem like too much of a \"zomg-iem-totali-not-afread-off-anithyng\" type :P. \\n\\n\r\nThe most important part of the anime are the mystery aspects, figuring out the not so understandable main character and of course the mystery of the Mononoke - the supernatural haunter - itself. The medicine seller needs to know a mononoke's shape (Katachi), truth (Makoto), and reasoning (Kotowari) in order to combat it, as he tries to figure this out you get to know the story of the mononoke as well as the story of the people involved. The mysticism remains truly thick throughout the series. Though each arc has its conclusion, but if you didn't really pay attention and didn't try to figure it out at least partly by yourself the conclusion might not be so clear. One of my favourite pleasures while watching it was the almost surreal symbolism playing mind games with me. It's not quite surrealism though, since surrealism holds no sense at all and most usually no symbolism. This is one of the most thought provoking anime titles I've ever seen. Though I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who have seen A LOT more thought-provoking animes than me, but I'd say that I've had my fair share, I'm pretty sure they'd agree with me anyway. \\n\\n\r\nHere are a few pros and cons. I tried to write what others might consider as cons and pros.\\n\\n\r\n3 Pros (if you consider these as pros):\\n\r\n- Thought-provoking\\n\r\n- Atmospheric\\n\r\n- Interesting and realistic* group psychology scenarios\\n\\n\r\n*Not realistic in the sense that nothing out of this world is occurring but in the sense that the characters react as real human beings would.\\n\\n\r\n3 Cons (if you consider these as cons):\\n\r\n- Unscary horror\\n\r\n- Unsympathetic characters\\n\r\n- You may find the conclusions blurry\\n",

            "content": "Mononoke appears as the continuation of the adventures of a certain character of the last arc of the series Ayakashi. To complement our viewing pleasure, some more arks were added, using an original art style and ingenious storytelling with the sole and honest objective of telling us about stories that could be our own.\r\nThe art is, by far, the most impressive part of this series. An explosion of colour that reminds us of the artistical epitome of ancient Japan, intelligent use of mixed media and a careful design for each theme make of Mononoke a treat for our eyes. Each detail is worth of admiration,like a painting in motion. The animation is simply superb, constantly adapting to the new styles and themes that are used for each story.\\n\r\nThe characters end up being a part of their background, in an almost absolute bidemensional existance. However, they are still highly detailed, especially considering all the intricate patterns of clothing and body styling that decorate their personality.\\n\\n\r\nIn continuation, the characters may be well designed in visual terms, but what makes this all unique is the way they were made emotionally. Each character has a distinct existance, even though some of them appear in later occasions. The characters of each art are truly dependable on the story they belong to, but would still make sense as indivituals outside of it. However, the astounding element from this crowd is the main and recurring character, Kusuriuri. Unnamed, unrevealed and, from the beggining to the end, an unknown creature. This mysterious man is the tool that makes the anime go further, within the same stories and from story to story. He does not have any kind of characterization however he appears to the viewer as the most palpable of characters. For some reason, he steps from an (eventual) imaginary or mistic being to someone that exists.\\n\\n\r\nKusuriuri, the mysterious medicine seller, moves from arc to arc solving strange occurances that assault the other characters. The only thing common between all of this is that every problem is provoked by a monster, a phantom or a spirit, something created to specifically haunt that group of people. As he discovers more about the occurances, the events behind the appearance of the haunting unveil themselves. And the result is, most of the times, something of extreme beauty. The narration is very basic in the sense that characters reveal their actions and the chronology of the story, but each story is treated with so much care that even the most simple event is turned into poetry.\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening theme and the Ending theme are less than memorable. However what marks Mononoke is not the music, but the sound. The use of the correct effects at the right moments give an effect of mistery and fear. In a sense, it may be inspired in kabuki plays*. It is original in this sense but, otherwise, rather average.\\n\\n\r\nA series of amazing tales that touch every theme of the Japanese folklore, leaded by one of the greatest characters ever created and crowned by a truly original art. A masterpiece in artistic terms. Watching Mononoke is like reading a poem from the Heian time: small, sometimes even simple, but so rich in detail that we can't help to \"let the dew wet our sleeves\"\\n",

            "content": "First of all: this anime is a masterpiece, and I do REALLY mean it.\r\nLet's start from the beginning, the story. Being composed of five arcs, the anime doesn't really connect any of them, the main character appart, which is quite unique. The style changes from arc to arc, some of them are more disturbing, others are more laughable. The last one, however, has kind of an \"end\". And this is what made me give not a 10, but a 9 to the story.\r\nIf everything was so perfect and unconnected, why put an \"end\" to it? Let we tell ourselvesl the story continues forever! >_<\r\nNow theart... Well, this anime's art is what I can really call Art! It isn't common, not at all, so if you like the traditional anime art, you won't like this. If you have a taste for something more artistic and unique, you'll probably love it as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound. It's perectly synched and everything. The sound AND the very lack of sound put you really in the mood of the anime. The voice acting is great, featuring some well-known guys, but what caught my attention was the fact that every voice in the anime fits it's character. Every single one. The voice of the main character is EPIC, it makes him too smexy. I'm saying this and I'm a guy, this character was really something.\\n\\n\r\nWell, for the characters, I already said much about Mr. Medicine Seller, the mc of the show. He is misterious, sexy, has a sexy voice, and is very sarcastic. The other characters are perfect for their purpose: make the viewer feel sick of humanity. Almost every human in the series is particularly disgusting, what leads the viewer to feel pity for the Mononoke's fate, generally.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? I watched the whole series in a row, in one night, and wasn't bored for a second. I even wanted more, in fact, I need more right now, so I'll end this review and search for some similar stuff.\\n\\n\r\nEnd.\\n\r\nPrinceArthas",

            "content": "Lately I have found that I like shows that have an overall goal for the plot and character development in stead of the episodic, story-arc-of-the-week, formula, but Mononoke is an example of the episodic formula done right while also going all-out, resulting in a very unique show.\r\nThe strength of this show is the stories so I'll start with that. As much as I like an over-arching storyline all five of the stories in this show were memorable and strong stories on their own part. Each story is given enough to flesh out character motives and back story while also giving us quite a great dealof action when in reality they are only ever move into a few rooms. For a Japanese-style ghost story collection it requires not a lot of knowledge of Japanese culture, which makes it more accessible. (Just maybe wiki Genji Monogatari before watching the Nue episodes.) All the stories are well-paced and have satisfying conclusions. The only one I can think of which perhaps I did not enjoy as much as the rest would have to be the Sea Monster one. But even then I was fascinated by the concept of the hollow boats and the fact that one of the supposedly one-shot characters actually questioned the Medicine Seller's motives. This is probably just me being hard on it because I loved the rest so much (particularly the first and the last one.) (9)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design of this show is very well done.  In short, it replaces any type of  body horror they could show, and somehow that is more creepy than actually showing it. For example, in episode two at an especially creepy moment, not to get too far into spoilers, they show cracked daruma dolls and strips of cloth. That image itself is not scary, symbolic, but no enough to get goosebumps over. However, with the sounds that go on during that sequence you actually feel violated in a way because even if it is just symbolic representation on screen the noise is enough to make you not want to look. (9)\\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame though, if you close your eyes. The art style for this show is very unique and the sheer amount of detail they put into their backgrounds is lovely. This show is probably one of the most screencap-able ones as it is fashioned to look like a painting in every frame. Also, symbolic representation is something you don't see very much in anime nowadays. My only complaint is that sometimes the characters look a little, shall we say .. off? Sometimes facial features aren't consistent and there are these odd rare cases where the characters move a little unnaturally especially in the mouth without any reason in the story to do so. It can be a little jarring, but it doesn't happen often. But, when this anime does movement well, they do it very well. I remember being really taken with is one shot of the Medicine Seller's feet while he's running through a train car on geta. (8)\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the real strength of this show lies in it's strong writing and atmosphere. When you are not being simultaneously dazzled and confused by the imagery, the sound is genuinely creepy (and well timed with the animation, I might add) but there is also our main character who is, in his own respects, unsettling as well, right down to the way he delivers each line. He has this genuinely odd habit of making long unnatural pauses in the middle of each sentence. His features are quite demonic even compared with the most unattractive members of the cast and his clothes aren't like what the rest of the cast wears. (Given, he does make a comment about this in one of the episodes but that was mainly to explain why he was dressed like that in that time period.) The only problem in the character department is that, given the format of the show, it can only develop a character other than the protagonist for a certain period of time. But they do do a good job with the time they have with these characters as finding out what their motivations are is essential to each of the plots. But, because the show needs to keep the protagonist enigmatic, they cannot have just one big episode where they explain his back story like so many other animes feel they need to do. While we don't have to sit through a long back story session, I do feel a little disappointed that we don't learn more about the Medicine Seller because he is, in fact, that mysterious.  (7) \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment (10)\\n\r\nObjective score overall (8.5/10) \\n\r\nI'd recommend this show to, well, anyone actually. Even those who are not considered 'anime fans'. Mononoke is Japanese horror storytelling at it's finest. With impressive art and sound direction and the strength of the writing to tell very Japanese tales without having to have a PhD in Asian studies. Whether it's for unique eye-candy or for the simple pursuit of a summer ghost story, it's a good watch.",

The medicine seller goes around places encountering mononoke.\r\nArt: \r\nSomething mononoke does very well.

Ireally enjoy the OP soundtrack, its something i could listen to repeatedly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNow this is admittedly a weak point of mononoke, it doesn't do much to develop the medicine seller, there is \"just enough\" told about him, but in mononoke's defense i think this is what they were going for. A mysterious unknown medicine seller that slays mononoke. Now the mononoke themselves are fleshed out through the 3-4 ep arcs, you get to learn about them and why they are that way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThere's a lot to enjoy here from the story telling of each mononoke and how they were formed.

            "content": "Mononoke is a supernatural, fantasy, historical horror series that came out in 2007. It was brought to us by our old friends at Toei animation. That's right, the studio behind Kuuchuu Bruranko and a lot of people's first anime with franchises like Dragonball and Sailor Moon. I've been told that this one is really good so let's have a look and see if that is the case.\r\nStory:\r\nWe follow a \u201csimple\u201d medicine seller as he goes from place to place and hunts down mononoke. Which are a form of ayakashi, not the princess. The series gives us five short stories, each one lasting two or threeepisodes, about the medicine seller getting into some strange situation caused by a mononoke and seeking out its shape, truth and reasoning so that he can exorcise it. It's kind of reminiscent of Mushishi, which isn't a bad thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe only real narrative problem with the series is that it can get repetitive. Not in terms of the set ups or anything like that. Rather, the resolutions are a bit repetitious. Our Medicine Seller finds the mononoke's shape, truth & reasoning, draws the blade of exorcism and then he briefly talks to the audience. Although, in all fairness, there are exceptions where he ends up not drawing the blade but those stories where he does get kind of reiterative in their resolutions.\\n\\n\r\nStill, that's a fairly minor complaint given how many things the series does well. It's really good at setting up interesting scenarios and at developing those scenarios in a way that keeps you interested. The pacing is also really well done. The series takes its time to build things up and really delve into a situation before moving into the action. The whole necessity of getting information about the mononoke really benefits the series in that respect. I also do like the way the series handles the medicine seller directly addressing the audience. They basically present the series as though it's a play with the way they use transitions and the medicine seller's final bits of dialogue when closing a story. It's a decision that could have very easily gone wrong, but the execution here is superb and it really works to its utmost, or close to it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nEach story has its own cast with the only reoccurring character being the unnamed medicine seller. This is another aspect that could have very easily not worked. Since the medicine seller is, in many ways, an archetypical trickster character. He doesn't let anything agitate him and always seems to be in control of a given situation. You never feel like he's in any real danger. However, what makes the character not just work, but work really superbly, is a combination of the play aesthetic and the fact that he devotes so much time to information gathering without any real concern for protecting the ordinary people who are caught up in the situation. Usually because there's some karmic element involved. He'll warn people and give them advice, but he's more interested in unravelling the facts. I also do appreciate the way that every single side character has some contribution to make to the narrative. The side characters also do have relatable factors surrounding them. A lot of them aren't good people, but they have enough complexity that you can understand them and why they've made the decisions they have. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this is an interesting case. Toei elected to make the artwork evocative of illustrated manuscripts. They were very meticulous about it with the character designs, backgrounds and even the colour palette. It doesn't look like many other anime but in a way that's dynamic and interesting. There is also something vaguely disconcerting about the more intense animation when paired with that art style which, ultimately, pairs well with the writing aesthetic. The imagery can also be pretty disturbing when it needs to be. The transitional artwork is really well handled, tying in with the theatrical feel nicely. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of really strong performances in this series. Yukana, Tanaka Rie, Wakamoto Norio & Midorikawa Hikaru to name a few. The strongest performance, though, comes from our protagonist voiced by Sakurai Takahiro. That's right, Cloud Strife, Rockman X, Kururugi Suzaku, Endou Kazuki, Okada Joe, Osomatsu & a whole bunch of other characters. The music was handled by Takanashi Yasuharu. The same composer who worked on Shiki & Gantz. He does a really good job. His music for this really supplements the art and narrative style. Which helps forge a really strong atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't any in this series. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nSo, was this series as good as I'd been told? Honestly, I'd say that it is. It has an amazing narrative with intriguing characters, coupled with art and music that complement the narrative style and excellent acting. All in all, I do recommend this one & I have to give it an enthusiastic 9/10. Next week's review will be for another Toei production, Futari wa Precure: Max Heart Movie 2- Yukizora no Tomodachi.",

            "content": "I wonder what would happen if I watched this high? \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nFormed around four separate stories with two acts, Mononoke sets up an epic, twisted tale in each of them. Each them very different in their own way, but very much the same, holding a similar type of theme: secrets. We all have them. Some secrets are small. Some are massive and can hold us hostage in our minds, whether the case this anime makes us bring out those dark secrets and makes a nightmare a reality. Illusions. It's all in the head. This is true horror and it absolutely terrified me.  I lovedthe cinematography and the way the camera captured the mood of the anime. It gave the every single scene strong emotion. Everyone things that horror is a scary serial killer coming after them with a mask or a dead girl dressed in white with blood all over her face haunting a house, but no. This is true horror. It's more historic too with using Mononoke (monsters) as the antagonist. There are so many legends, myths, and stories about these monsters. Many going back hundreds and hundreds of years! Goes to show that Japan can be one scary place. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLook at all the pretty colours! Terrifying, but pretty! I loved how they did a rendition of Japanese historic artwork. The style was just breathtakingly beautiful! And man did it ever tie in well with the horrific and suspenseful mood of the stories. The art...it was what gave the anime the genre we call Horro. I'm going to let you all know this is probably the most beautiful Japanese animation I've ever seen. The camera angles they used were unique and mind messing. And not only that, the style of these characters designs are just so unique and fancy! It's creepy yet inspiring. This animation almost made me feel like I was high. lol\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who doesn't do subbed, I really loved the VA that were used. The one who voiced Kururiuri held a strong tone who brought the character to life. The beginning and opening songs held a great beat that made the episodes even more exciting! And the music in the episodes really made the scene more eye catching, more eerie. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nKururiuri, the medicine vendor, plays with people's mind on making them confess to their deepest darkest secrets while hunting and slaying monsters around the country side. He's like a drug dealer. He puts thoughts into peoples heads, messes with them to hunt down the Mononoke hidden either inside of them or around him. He's a perfect character who can show he is not to be messed with. \\n\\n\r\nThrough the many other characters throughout the four mini stories, each one brought on a creepy aspect of the story. They might've not been the ones who gave the anime a horror theme, but they did give out dark and anticipating parts of their stories that were absolutely addicting to witness.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI could not stop watching this.  I actually ended up jumping a few time! Blood is the colour of orange. Up is down. Right is left. It's a huge mind fuck that will leave you wanting more. I think the only reason why it isn't one of my favourites was because the lack of plot. This could've gone so much farther with just ONE mini story they used. At least twenty episodes per mini story. But never the less, this anime is totally worth the watch. Just don't watch it high. Or if you do...let me know what it's like. I'm curious. \\n\\n\r\nI give this anime 90% on the Monster level.",

            "content": "Mononoke is a spin-off based on the final arc of Ayakashi: Classic Japanese Horror. And I have to say, it does extremely well as a stand-alone series.\r\nThe series consists of several arcs, 2 to 3 episodes each. During each arc the main character, known simply as \"medicine seller\", will find himself in a situation where a mononoke (vengeful spirit) is going to be involved and will kill people if nothing is done about it.\r\nEach arc, although short, has an interesting story with a deep, underlying theme relating to the reason for the mononoke's existence. The main character will converse with the other characters involved andobserve their behavior to uncover the truth of the matter. The deeper into the arc you get, the more twists there are until eventually the core of the matter is revealed. The mononoke's Form, Truth and Regret are deduced and the medicine seller will use his Sword of Exorcism to purify the spirit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story of every arc was unique and great, with each character being in some way vital.\\n\\n\r\nThe art-style is certainly unique for anime, reminiscent of ukiyo-e woodblock prints. There is a paper-like filter over the screen and there is heavy use of bright and vibrant colors, giving the series a particular feel. It works surprisingly well for the horror it tries to evoke.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did not like either the opening or ending theme very much, the sounds used in the series are phenomenal in getting the atmosphere just right.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I enjoyed the series quite a bit.",

            "content": "Wow, what a series. Mononoke is the spinoff/sequel of the Bakeneko arc (eps. 9-11) in Ayakashi ~ Japanese Classic Horror. This is not to be confused with the final arc in Mononoke, which ironically, is also called Bakeneko. Although the original Bakeneko tale was brilliant, Mononoke is just as enticing, beautiful and well written as its predecessor. This series lets its art tell the tales. It is not afraid to experiment and has its own distinct style. This is a truly wonderful series especially visually and thematically.\r\nStory: This anime is broken into five different stories lasting about 2 to 3 episodes each. Every one ofthese stories features a different supernatural spirit; many of them rooted from Japanese folklore. It is up to the Medicine Seller to uncover the Katachi (shape/form), Makoto (truth), and Kotowari (reason) of the spirit. Now, this sounds like your average, spirit-of-the-week sort of deal, doesn't it? But it isn&rsquo;t. That's one aspect that makes this series so great. All the stories are unique and do not feel like a rehash of the same story as the previous. Even by the final arc, I was still shocked and entralled by its revelations. So yes, there are unexpected twists in every arc. Each tale also holds very thoughtful themes. You would expect a series about supernatural ghosts to be about the, well, dead spirits, but that's also not the case. Most of the stories are quite deep and to some degree disturbing. In fact, Mononoke is very thematically based on human nature, since it's the humans and their actions that transform the spirits into these vengeful mononoke.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I&rsquo;ll say it now. The art style may put off some people, especially based on first impressions. I thought the art was absolutely gorgeous, fitting, and unique. Mononoke uses an art style that resembles the Japanese &quot;ukiyo-e&quot;, filled with vibrant and colorful backgrounds, textures and designs. Because of this two-dimensional, almost paper cut-out appearance, the anime uses a lot of camera movements and symbolism. This is why a few of the stories may need multiple viewings to get the full meaning of everything. In this way, I feel Mononoke uses its art to its full potential to present the story. I also loved how the style in each arc deviates just a bit so that each story distinguishes itself from the others. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound plays a very important role in this series. Because the art style somewhat limits what it can show on screen, sounds are used to reinforce that. It sets up the tense atmosphere, adding suspense and leaving you anticipating for more. The voice acting is very well done, especially hearing those screams of terror and shock. Other than that, I didn't really like the opening and ending songs. I actually liked the Ayakashi OP and ED better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There is only one reoccurring character in all the stories and that is the ever-so-awesome Medicine Seller! Yes, he is nameless and simply known as &ldquo;Kururi-uri-san/sama/insert other honorific&rdquo; or medicine seller. Although not much is known about him, I think it's very fitting since it adds to his mysterious nature. He does, though very subtly, develop. In all honesty though, I found it incredibly enjoyable watching him make deadpan comments while the other characters are freaking out over the weird happenings/hauntings. Lastly, the story-only-characters get a good deal of development despite each story being 2 to 3 episodes in length.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Final notes: I finished the series in 2 days, meaning I watched about 6 episodes per day. So yeah&hellip; I enjoyed it a lot. And as mentioned earlier, some arcs may take a second or even third viewing to get everything. I know I will watch it again. It's such an excellent anime and was so worth the watch.  \\n\\n\r\n9.6/10 easily rounded to a 10/10 for my list.",

            "content": "My initial impression of Mononoke was literally, \"...\". After giving it a chance I am glad that I wasn't quick to judge and saw it through. Mononoke is a collection of short stories revolving around mysterious spirits/creatures known as, from the title, Mononoke. The writing and directing of the series are excellently done and really immerse you in the story itself. Each arc is a new story with new characters that are well fleshed out in the beginning of each segment. The Medicine Seller, Kusuriuri, is the only recurring character and is mysterious as always with each new arc.\r\nThe artistic styling of Mononoke is trulyone of a kind, the colours are amazing and with HD encodes it truly shines. Each new environment is unique, colourful, and captivating. The colours and use of quick camera movements add to the suspense. The animations themselves are intentionally very stiff at times but as the action speeds up they become very fluid and top notch. The backgrounds are rarely stationary, but appear as though you are observing a painting at the same time. Often times the animations of common things such as snow or water are displayed in a very unique way that makes you simply want to get lost in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds of Mononoke are fantastic. There is often times complete silence, but that only adds to the suspense. The OP and ED are very nice, nothing exceptional, but nice. The use of sounds, such as screams, thumps and other such frightening sounds are extremely realistic. I hate to admit it but I was genuinely frightened at certain points.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the Medicine Seller, each arc sees the introduction of new characters. Each character usually represents a different Japanese stereotype. Samurai, priests, monks, government types, children, and many others. Kusuriuri's alternate self, I won't give anything away, is almost worth watching the story for on its own. The Medicine Seller is a very sarcastic person and often times at a very serious moment he'll crack a joke that is totally absurd and you can't help but laugh.\\n\\n\r\nAt only twelve episodes Mononoke is well worth the time and although it is very, very Japanese in respects to content, it doesn't take away from the enjoyment in the least. As I mentioned before, Mononoke is excellent at generating fear out of the simplest of situations with very little audio. The characters are all very genuine and are often times in tears and losing their minds in a very believable manner.\\n\\n\r\nI've wasted enough of your time, now go watch this show. You definitely won't regret it.",

            "content": "When someone talks about the genre of horror, immediately a few things come to mind: blood, violent motion, bone and flesh torn asunder, gore essentially approaching abundant forms of shock value. These are what characterize the images that litter the horror genre today. However, one cannot discount the impact of simpler techniques. Muffled voices, the bloodcurdling scream, the manic dip toward insanity; these are all subtler methods which give rise to the imagination and thus leave a more impressionable impact. Mononoke adopts such techniques in each of its standalone stories, and it may not be surprising that these implementations are often left unappreciated. Yet, byadapting these horror tools along with an artistic presentation, rhythmic score, and strongly representative story, it is no wonder then that Mononoke is an excellently produced work.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nBefore we embark on Mononoke's journey one may first need to understand the very concept of Mononoke. One of the basic types of Ayakashi (tl. \"unnatural spirit\") is formed from the soul of a living or non-living material. Oftentimes, regret causes this, and when an Ayakashi is merged with strong human emotions such as vengeance, sadness, or fear, it develops into a Mononoke (tl. \"hostile spirit\"). This is the foundation for conflicts in each story and what typically stems from each Ayakashi's backstory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself follows a Kusuriuri (tl. \"medicine seller\") who travels from one place to another exorcising each Mononoke he comes across. The anime presents five standalone arcs. Each one consists of 2 or 3 episodes, which may sound as if there is not enough time allocated to serve each story properly. Fortunately, this uncertainty is untrue. Each arc is thoroughly interesting, bizarre, and complex; viewers will be astonished by the profound impact each short story relays.\\n\\n\r\nEvery arc meticulously refines its pace in order to provide characters enough time to adapt to their roles. Once the primary conflict is staged and the Mononoke is revealed, Kusuriuri puts himself to the task of unraveling its Katachi, Makoto, and Kotowari (tl. \"Form\", \"Truth\", and \"Regret\") \u2014 the three requirements for him to release his \"Sword of Exorcism\". What makes Mononoke a highly commendable work is its highly structured format, as well as its exploration of every character's motives. Kusuriuri simply can't draw his sword and exorcise the Mononoke until a predetermined set of conditions is followed. Moreover, whilst watching Kusuriuri reveal a Mononoke's Form, Truth, and Regret, we come across a saddening tale of how it came into existence. Mononoke does an excellent job in attracting viewers with its harrowing tales, and its precisely carved narrative makes it an unforgettable experience.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, Mononoke is one of the most finely detailed pieces in existence. From vibrant and colorful backgrounds to highly detailed characters and costume designs, Mononoke has crossed every barrier in this field in order to achieve excellence. The pasty color palette may seem an odd choice for a horror anime, but make no haste; it merges perfectly with the setting and culture of this work. The backgrounds are perforated with different textures all of which that complement each standalone narrative.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally, Mononoke can exist in any form and in this anime they are designed explicitly (and sometimes intentionally vaguely) in order to vary with respect to their arcs. Toei Animation has done a wonderful job in designing every character intelligently and distinctively in correspondence to their personality. Kusuriuri's design in particular manages to stand out on every frame. Moreover, his climactic transformation remains one of the most excellent aesthetic achievements in anime: it produces such a profound form and with fantastically surreal animation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nMatching the astounding art, what makes the characters so memorable is how they are portrayed. Not only are they emotionally distraught and relatable, groups of them often form a well-represented allegory. Mononoke is also an eclectic social commentary, ranging from remarks on corruption within governmental policies to more localized analyses of vengeance and despair.\\n\\n\r\nOne role which continues to outshine all others is the recurring character Kusuriuri. Unnamed, unrevealed, and from beginning to end an unknown, this enigmatic figure is the lone consistent tool from story to story. He breathes ambiguity, and his role always wedges into the plot should it ever begin to stale. He also does not share any form of development, and yet his indecipherable status always mystifies viewers in order to keep Mononoke's harrowing atmosphere at its greatest.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening and Ending themes may seem peculiar, but they are certainly stylish, and as unhinged periodic pieces, they imperceptibly suit the series' direction. However, what marks Mononoke is not the music but the sound effects. Each opportuned implementation pervades the room with mystery and sheer awe. Mononoke also takes inspiration from kabuki plays, which is an interesting spin as much of its presentation follows panelwork very typical of this theatre current.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps above all, Mononoke is an experiment on convention. Its presentation offers a instantaneous, visceral reaction, and its story takes great efforts to rely on its atmosphere to tell the tale. However, it allow follows a highly structured narrative, which roots its foundation in order to prevent stories from becoming too insane. As a waltz through the Ayakashi mythos, Mononoke is one series never to forget.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nThis review is the final product of a team composed of members from the \"Critics and Connoisseurs\" club.

            "content": "The wooden curtain opens with a sinister smile revealing the first scene:\r\nA wave of vibrant, whirling umbrellas cascade down the street; the rain continues to pour in assorted shapes, accompanied by the patter of hollow conversations latching on to the sounds of its perpetual fall. On top of the path rests a towering hotel embellished by color, wood, and ruse. Slowly, an enigmatic wanderer appears at the gate of the inn, with a wooden box strapped on his back requesting to stay there. He is identified as the medicine seller. Shortly after, a young pregnant woman, dressed in desperation, finds herself at the same inn;seeking shelter and protection.\\n\\n\r\nThere is, however, something amiss in the rainbow-tinted inn, and right away, its secrets provoke the senses; they seem to be everywhere \u2013 in the walls, in the unseen guests, in the corridor. After a heated argument between the innkeeper and the girl, she finds herself in an isolated room, lathered in opulence but infested by shadows of all shades. Following this unsettling vision, the show starts to bare its true face. There is something indeed amiss here and the Medicine Seller\u2019s true purpose is brought forth: he came to hunt the horrors that plague the inn, otherwise known as \u201cMononoke\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThat is the basic premise of the 12-episode series titled Mononoke. The series is divided into five arcs, in which, the Medicine Seller (or Kusuriuri) attempts to seek, hunt, and exorcise these otherworldly spirits known as Mononoke. Essentially, Mononoke could be defined as a class of spirits, however, the ones Kusuriuri is concerned with are closest to humans, because they manifest from humans. These are corrupted entities that seem to bring sorrow, suffering, and destruction where they go and to who they haunt. Thus, this is a tale of the unknown, of mystery, of psychology and pathos, of ancient lore, and lastly, of horror that may disguise itself as a series of ghost stories, but only superficially. \\n\\n\r\nOne of Mononoke\u2019s greatest strengths is its ability to intertwine the aforesaid elements with subliminal insight that gives it its multi-dimensional form. Most supernatural stories will focus on the imminent horror factor, or inducing temporary fear simply by virtue. Mononoke does something completely different. Rather than focusing on the external fear synonymous with the spirit(s) and their curses, it looks inward, to the living, rather than the dead. This is meticulously explicated by Kusuriuri\u2019s methodology. In order to exorcise any Mononoke, he needs to first recognize its Form (physical), Truth (circumstance), and Reason (motivation). Much of this is revealed through digressing into the psyche of the parties involved in each arc, where Kusuriuri exploits the inner turmoil of each respective character and how that turmoil projects itself on to the Mononoke in ways that are not just terrifying, but often times, heartbreaking and utterly human. \\n\\n\r\nReally, it\u2019s the \u201chuman\u201d element of the series that makes it so compelling which is mostly through the manner it incites and decrypts human nature and its capacity to wander in the dark. It\u2019s carnivorous, yearning for fear and emotion; yet, it isn\u2019t done through manipulation, shock value, or contrivance. Rather, Mononoke opts for psychological precision. The show doesn\u2019t aim to deliver some insane amount of singular \u201ccharacter development\u201d but rather uncover what lies in the dark, and thereby showing the ability for what is presented as good, innocent, virtuous to be equally bad, tainted, and sinful. Consequently, the show is heavily driven by its themes and self-contained plot rather than individual characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe aforesaid will lead many to flock to the notion of \u201cbad characterization\u201d or not enough \u201ccharacter\u201d \u201cdevelopment\u201d, but one needs to contextualize what a work is actually trying to do/achieve before arbitrarily applying a set of self-drawn commandments. Characters can be utilized in many different ways as can a story be told in multiple ways. The characters of Mononoke are outwardly static, including Kusuriuri  but that does not mean they are superfluous. They are internalized or \u201cdeveloped\u201d/personified in many ways, whether it be through human analytics brought forth by yours truly ~the Medicine Man~ or the interactions, actions, and reactions that are revealed as a product of surfacing truths and unearthing secrets. Mononoke functions as a collective exploration of the temporal realm through the supernatural and both are interlocked by these ordinary characters that are deeper than they may initially look. Essentially, the characters are immensely important, for it is through them and their stagnation that the show is able to conduct its psychological experimentation. \\n\\n\r\nEach character\u2019s predicament is sealed by fate, but the stories aren\u2019t about the end; they\u2019re about how such an end could come about and the choices that led to it. By dissecting the unknown, Kusuriuri finds himself in the middle of intersecting realities that are as terrifying as they are tragic. What makes all the stories consistently effective is the finesse with which the show handles each character\u2019s state, and the mononoke that transpires from them (whether they be a projection of corrupted desires, or a product of unrequited yearning, or a manifestation of unspoken crimes). Therefore, the \u201cunknown\u201d or \u201chorror\u201d isn\u2019t really about the monsters or ghosts, but what creeps inside seemingly ordinary folk, and the will that could innately exist to ignite suffering. Through these various arcs, the characters in those arcs, and Kusuriuri himself, Mononoke presents accounts that are deeply disturbing and equally enlightening. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, this also reinforces the unacknowledged strength of episodic structures. Mononoke shows that the quality of the plot or other elements isn\u2019t internally compromised if the work lacks a continuous/overarching plot or a constant cast developing linearly and consistently. Its anthological nature fares well for it and its intentions for it turns out to be far more vicious in its horror, tragic in its drama and stylized in its art that every piece of it comes together effortlessly. It fully embraces the power of the medium and extends its boundaries far beyond traditional story-telling into a work of innovation, wonder, mysticism, and art.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd, elementally, nowhere else does this concentrated sublimity appear more than in Mononoke\u2019s visual presentation. The best way to describe the art and animation of Mononoke is: idiosyncratic. It is so particular and unique that I\u2019d be willing to wager it exists only to tell the stories that Mononoke did. \\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, the art style may come off as incredibly gaudy, over-the-top, and immensely theatrical (Curtains open and close at whim supported by decisive gongs dictating the flow of various scenes; highly sensitized color palettes are constantly at the forefront, clashing in folly, but never jarring; costumes and getups are so lurid that they seem to have fallen right out of a stage set; faces are painted with perfect expression that each frame seems like a change of masks, rather than emotion). Yet all of this works beautifully. Mononoke reminds me of something running in an aged-Kabuki theater, at least aesthetically, which is actualized through the bizarre sets of color, costume, and personalities, the artistically-tuned performances, and the emphasis on extravagance.\\n\\n\r\nMononoke\u2019s visuals are a feat in and of themselves, but the real laudable aspect is how that art is integrated into the narrative. The reason I stress to call this work, a work of \u201cart\u201d (besides its literal merits) is because of its ability to use its elements to create something whole that transcends its own platform and deliver \u2013 with individuality, acuity, and sincerity \u2013 its subject and themes with clear prowess and understanding (of itself and its ambitions). Take its approach to horror for example. Even though the art-style is the last thing from traditional horror, given how theatrical it is, the way it infuses horror is with complete subtlety.\\n\\n\r\nTo elaborate, each arc is extremely claustrophobic, as in, the framing or setting of the arcs always occur in a juxtaposed manner. Whether it be stuck in a room of a humongous hotel, or a ship on the open seas, or a prison cell, or a train car speeding through a tunnel, the unsettling feeling of being \u201cboxed-in\u201d never leaves. It produces this inescapable void from the get-go and maintains that in the background, but it\u2019s by far one of the most prominent things it does to invoke and sustain fear and discomfort. Not only are we forced into the corners of depraved minds, but we are confined there, with an evil that has the capability to exist everywhere, and within everyone. Furthermore, its usage of color is one of the best I\u2019ve seen. Works of horror will generally opt for a gloomy, desolate mood which favors subdued grays, blacks, with the exception of red for obvious reasons. Mononoke on the other hand probably utilizes every color on the spectrum but does so effectively. I would never have imagined that such a palette could ever tell stories so terrifying and do so with the power that they do. Combined with its psychological propensity, the visual direction of the series is one of the best I\u2019ve had the pleasure of experiencing; both as a work of Horror, and as a work of Art (and for once, we don\u2019t have to separate the two). \\n\\n\r\nMononoke is a superb show, but it isn\u2019t for everyone. It is unconventional in every sense of the word. It relies heavily on its own art, such as the barrage of interconnected, but flashing painting like images, or color-doused symbolism to tell its story. Not everything is spelled out here, and a lot of the stories feel like stories within stories since they do stem from various Japanese lore (such as about the concept of Mononoke itself, or what certain acts/paintings/symbols signify). Yet, it is accessible enough, universal enough, that it still communicates the stories of these people, spirits, and time wonderfully. Additionally, as much as I have praised the art, this style can be off-putting to many since often times it might prove to be distracting enough to deviate from the actual narrative. The cut-out style of many backgrounds is a good example of this. Lastly, people under the impression that this is a run-of-the-mill horror featuring gore porn or cool fights/deaths, let me be the first to convey that is not the case. The horror is more personalized through the tragedies of each situation, not through spirits killing randomly (as one would find in a Hollywood tale of biblical possession).  \\n\\n\r\nTruly, there is no better way to watch Mononoke, than as if watching a play. Yet, good art has the ability to transfer fiction into reality, and acquaint its consumer with its own feelings and dilemmas. In effect then, the shadows that lurk on the stage also lurk off-stage. And as the wooden curtain closes with the last gong and a similar smile, and the once busy street full of spinning umbrellas is left barren, Mononoke will also leave you with shadows of your own; standing on what you thought was a stage.",

Well, actually...\r\nThey both involve antagonists, usually out to terrorize or for revenge, who force the hero to hole themselves up in an interior location with troublesome civilians, while using their wits and skills to battle to an explosive and emotional resolution.  See?\r\nHere's where Mononoke carves itself an identity to make itself stand out from John McClane&rsquo;s frolics with Euro-trash in cramped quarters: (we're all ignoring the 4th instalment, right?)\r\nMononoke is a visual splatter of psychedelic imagery that's like thecreation of a prodigious savant child born from Stanley Kubrick, or Darren Aronofsky, take your pick.  The colours just jump out at you no matter where the scene is or what's occurring, they're alive and part of the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nA narrative that&rsquo;s kept lively through snappy editing.  Scene and shot transitions flow, snake, and leap all over the place, using every cinematic method available.  There's even flip-book mimickery; character reactions told through pages turning one after another furiously, for no reason other than to jar the viewer and emphasise the stark dialogue being delivered.\\n\\n\r\nOur hero, the medicine seller with ears from Middle-earth, surely has stark delivery.  Only willing to speak when he has a reason to, if only more anime characters were like this.  There's no filler to be seen in this show, whether it's absent from the dialogue or story.\\n\\n\r\nBut for a show so dependant on scaring the viewer witless through bizarre imagery, narrative coherency isn&rsquo;t so important, mood is.  The use of colour is actually a really smart way to affect our mood, because scenes that are so bright and vivid actually work in a way that you wouldn&rsquo;t expect.\\n\\n\r\n&quot;Why am I getting freaked out by this empty room, even though it&rsquo;s decorated so colourfully?  Oh wait, because Yasaharu Takanashi's score is making creepy noises and I thought I just saw an Oompa Loompa in that corner for a moment but it must have been my imagination...&quot;\\n\\n\r\nThe set-up to each story arc is eerie, the climax visceral, and the resolution always emotional.  Mononoke is a brilliantly written, edited, and directed Edo-period-and-beyond horror that is inspiring in its design and delivery.\\n\\n\r\n12 episodes.  One medicine seller.

            "content": "Deadly monsters, haunting spirits, and supernatural entities that are beyond human to even describe with words are but a few examples of what makes horror an appealing genre to many. There are great examples of works of horror that can be considered real masterpieces in its kind. However, it is undoubtedly one of the most accessible genres to not succeed in garnering pure terror within its framework. Especially with anime, where there are only a handful of noteworthy horror shows and the rest only come up with predictable scares and horror tropes being used way too much. Mononoke fits, unfortunately, to the latter; but onlyby a very slim margin.\\n\\n\r\nTo expand on that last point, Mononoke is not what you would call a terrifying show to watch. It would be more accurate to describe it as \u201cstartling.\u201d It doesn\u2019t try to disturb you with its overly-bombastic imagery; it instead wants you to seek out the subtle artistic prowess that it has to show before it then starts to suck you into the horror by surprise. The execution of all of it feels very right and nicely spaced out so that they feel less tedious and uneventful to go through. Many horror anime, and especially horror movies today, think that if it throws in any ominous or thunderous music, blood splattering gore, or your usual horror cliche left and right that they can call their show a true horror show. In reality, they make it the opposite of their intention because you\u2019re already used to it after the twentieth time it has happened halfway through.\\n\\n\r\nMononoke proves that you don\u2019t have to use any of those aspects in horror to define yourself as one. The one thing that almost everyone can agree with is that the real source of horror is the \u201cunknown.\u201d The fact that you can\u2019t see something, yet you feel a presence within your surroundings can be one of the most genuinely terrifying things to experience in real life or film. Elements of this nature were put into full effect when H.P. Lovecraft first based his stories around this concept. You can see, quite clearly, that Mononoke does the same inflections of some of the stories Lovecraft put into his short stories and does them to brilliant effect. The only noticeable difference is that Mononoke shows the supernatural entities whereas Lovecraft never did.\\n\\n\r\nHow the show is set up is by the apparent inclination that this is a separate story based off of the character, \u201cMedicine Man,\u201d from one of the short stories from Ayakashi \u2013 Samurai Horror Tales. Before I discuss how the show structures its plot in each of the arcs, the one fundamental notion to mention that makes Mononoke a truly unique experience is how much creative detail it gives to the setting of historical Japan. Along with House of Five Leaves, this is one of the closest that anime has gotten, in recent memory, that truly captures the pure essence and atmosphere of what Japan was like during its later modern period. Obviously, without all of the supernatural elements to it, the artwork that is put on display feels like an ancient painting done by past painters from Japan that strengthens the atmosphere and its impact on the creativity put into the horror. Not only the artwork but also the little tidbits they put into the show that include various Japanese folklore that they tell us at the end are very inspiring and fascinating to experience.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the plot arcs themselves, they are, unfortunately, not the very highest point in terms of compelling storytelling. With about five different stories put into one show, only two of them stick in my mind as entirely memorable or thought-provoking. The one that can be considered excellent is the first one because of how it introduces us to Mononoke\u2019s world and its concepts of the Mononoke and is a good introduction to the show. The second arc consists of a very gripping story about each\u2019s goals of getting out of the mess that they have been brought to and each of them has this detailed back story makes them not just this throwaway character that our main protagonist steals the show from. Unfortunately, the rest suffer through, what I would call, overused tropes from the previous two episodes. Of the three last arcs, two of them both involve a group of people that Kusuriuri, our main protagonist, tries to investigate concerning the disturbance of Mononoke. It is almost as if the writer could not think of a new kind of formula he could put into his stories, so he decides to reuse similar tropes to his previous novels and put in a completely different spin on that original idea. It doesn\u2019t matter if the plot is entirely different from the previous one, it still follows the same formula and it feels repetitive and almost predictable.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say they are \u201cterrible\u201d to go by, not at all; it just feels mediocre compared to the previous ones. With that said, what makes the plot worthwhile to experience, for better or for worse, is Kusuriuri, or the \u201cMedicine Man\u201d as he\u2019s typically called. Similar to how great Ginko is in Mushishi, Kusuriuri has this aura around him that makes him very attention-grabbing. The only difference is that you don\u2019t know much about Kusuriuri\u2019s personal life, but only what he does in his job. His smart, fast-moving mind makes him a competent protagonist to root for only by how calculated he lays out his plans in getting the Mononoke and helping the people that need his help the most. It is one of the rare instances where the lack of personal development of one character doesn\u2019t hold back the quality of the them and just from how much he views the world from his own eyes and gives us his take on the mysteries involved in the plot. The unknown archetype adds to his depth and characterization so much more than almost any of the characters in Mononoke, who also have well-developed characterization.\\n\\n\r\nWhether you want to call the animation, provided by the most lauded Toei Animation, \u201cexperimental\u201d or \u201cclassic art,\u201d it nevertheless feels very dynamic. Toei has always wanted to stick to original roots when concentrating on their animation skills in most of their productions, and this is by far one of their best. The fluid motions of how the characters move, react and illuminate feel very human-like and provide a significant degree of hard-work put into each frame of animation. What is even more fascinating is how the animators put a lot of creativity into the actual Mononoke, which is influenced by Japanese folklore. Even though you don\u2019t see them for more than, say, five seconds, those five seconds will be burnt into your memory for years to come.\\n\\n\r\nMononoke is a different breed of horror that many anime have not attempted to replicate even in the past. There hasn\u2019t been a horror film or show that never makes you scream out in terror, yet in your mind, you feel almost as if you had gone through a night terror that you don\u2019t remember screaming, in sheer anguish and fear. While the show never really compiles to an important detail of a groundbreaking story, it surely is a sight to behold in grasping what can be done with an gorgeous setting with beautiful sets of animation to go with it. Let it be said; when it comes to creating great horror, there should never be boundaries that restrict what it wants to show in terms of pure terror. Otherwise, it would not be horror, one way or the other.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-\\n",

            "content": "Emotions, it's a powerful thing that lurks in human. It can manipulate your feelings, actions, and thoughts. Love, Hate, and other emotions can easily enter your inner-self, creating something we called Demons. Mononoke portrayed how atrocious human emotion can be, and how great an episodic anime can tell a story. \r\nThe series started in feudal Japan (probably in Edo Period), Mononoke its evil spirits that born from human emotions. There's one person that able to slay the Mononoke known as Kusuriuri or Medicine Seller, he has a mystic sword that can slay the spirits, but in order to slay it, he have to discover thethree essences of Mononoke. The Form, Truth, and  Reason of the Mononoke.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I thought the story concept will create a dull storytelling, but I was wrong. The story consists of 5 unrelated short stories. Each story has their own way, it has unique differences and unpredictable plot twists and makes me speechless because of it. They didn't recycle the same idea but they developed them to create intense storytelling. For a horror anime, Mononoke didn't need blood, gory action, and many other overly-used horror elements, it just need a suspense story. Mononoke successfully created that each story.\\n\\n\r\nThe animations have a dark but full of different color. They trying to achieve the real horror elements and they succeed. The characters emotions were nonetheless the best they could offer, manic, panic, fear, laugh. It has various different expression drawn fluidly. Some people may found the art quite disturbing, but if you look in a different perspective it is a brilliant effort indeed. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound setting was a total fit to this anime. I really amaze by the voice actors who can bring such emotion to the screen. Another good point is the sound effect, from screaming, pounding, whispering perfectly done which created a plus sign for the horror element. Opening song Kagen no Tsuki sung by Ryouta Komatsu and Charlie Kousei have succesfully portrayed the combination of old western music and old eastern music and classically fits the anime. While the Ending song Natsu no Hana sung by JUJU brings a tender yet calm moments after a terror comes. I also found out the back sound quite good indeed, its have dark feelings that increase the intense more demonic. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character, we have only one role that keeps the story rolling, and the person is the Medicine Seller or Kusuriuri. Kusuriuri-san stands anonymously to the end. There is little known about him, but his calm and collected nature makes Mononoke more interesting and enjoyable to watch. Each episode has their own characters, those episodes only characters have a great development despite being shallow because 2-3 episodes length. \\n\\n\r\nMononoke stands as a unique figure that has to be the role model to keep the horror genre stands top. The unpredictable plot twist, intense, drama, and even art and sound settings make this anime enjoyable. If you seek for an anime that depicts the horror genre successfully in a different way from it should be. Then you might have to check this anime.",

            "content": "Have you ever got to the point in watching modern anime where you're lacking that refreshing series? Do you sometimes feel the medium has become watered down and need something to reevaluate your interest in anime? To those of you who feel this way, your Lord and Savior has arrived. Enter Mononoke stage right. A bizarre 2007 release by animation giant Toei Studios (One Piece, Dragonball, Air Gear), Mononoke is unconventional, haunting, suspenseful and dramatic. Coupled with the most striking and unique art style I've come across in ages, Mononoke seeks to create a theatrical masterpiece through its uncanny vignettes. The verdict? Well, you\u2019ll justhave to watch it and see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nI want to preface my review with a mild disclaimer: this anime is not for everyone. If you find yourself to prefer very structured shows with your standard anime-isms (fanservice, lots of fight scenes and JPop soundtracks), I would not recommend devoting your time to Mononoke. This series is a large departure from the common anime stereotypes. It will not hold your hand, as there is a lot of mental deciphering to be had. It\u2019s more accessible than shows like Serial Experiments Lain and Texhnolyze, but there is some ambiguity about it. Mononoke\u2019s story is divided into 5 \u201cplays\u201d, each with their own beginning, climax and ending. Each anecdote features a similar character, Kusuriuri, a self-proclaimed medicine seller, who is drawn to the environment based on the presence of a mononoke, or spirit. Some stories involve possession, while others focus on the looming presence of a ghost seeking revenge on its killer. Each performance begins mostly innocent and quickly escalates into a mind-bending mix of trepidation and human psychology. Suspense is intricately woven into each tale via vivid imagery and ominous sound effects, some of them truly unsettling. I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like it. \\n\\n\r\nAnother important point to mention is that Mononoke doesn\u2019t center itself around the personified spirit in each tale, but moreso on the people affected by its presence. There isn\u2019t a lot of strong character development or backstory to be had, but that\u2019s not the point of the series. Mononoke illustrates the very depths of human emotion, the places people don\u2019t want to show others. These are instinctual, raw and terrifying feelings put on full display within each episode\u2019s structure. It\u2019s less about the individuals and more about the human psyche overall. Mononoke\u2019s scenes take place mostly in a stagnant area, causing an effect of isolation to be instilled on the characters affected. This aids the writers in being able to exemplify the state of someone in mental peril. Viewers witness a mental breakdown from beginning to end. It may seem long and drawn out, but it\u2019s impactful and unsettling nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThough its strong, theatrical approach to storytelling, the best advice I can give to watching it is in segments. Watch each story individually, and don\u2019t binge it. That way you can really feel the impact of each play as it unfolds, and nothing will blur together. Episodic shows like Mononoke and Mushishi can be difficult to recommend because you can\u2019t watch them like normal anime. Although Mushishi is one of my favorite anime, I had to take my time with it because of its languid,  atmospheric nature. A similar point can be made with regard to Mononoke. It\u2019s so different from other anime that it almost needs its own genre.\\n\\n\r\nKusuriuri as a character is enigmatic and entertaining. The way he constantly introduces himself as a medicine seller, only to almost instantly display his true abilities is mildly amusing. His exorcisms take something as impenetrable as the mononoke and deconstructs it down to a form, a truth and a reason, in order to expel it from existence. His past is unexplored, adding to the shroud of mystery surrounding him. I can\u2019t say I cared for him in the earlier portions of the series, but as the anime progressed, his presence in each tale was a comforting familiarity in the chaos of the unexpected.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters were all extremely unique. The character models were detailed and often exaggerated (i.e. the boy on the train). They wore their emotions on their sleeves so to speak, as their bodies would become red when frustrated or distorted when terrified. I especially enjoyed the episode with the fox-masked mononoke and how he would constantly don a new mask to portray the feeling that was present in the atmosphere. The character\u2019s relatability, although in a vastly different setting, was instrumental to getting the show\u2019s message across. Displaying how certain personalities would respond in certain harrowing situations really left an impact on me.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in Mononoke is unlike anything I\u2019ve seen before. The colors are vivid and characters are remarkably distinct in their features. The lucid sequences involving the unveiling of the various spirits are some of the most beautiful scenes I\u2019ve witnessed in an anime. The way the shots cut sporadically and blur fantasy and reality within a dream-like atmosphere are stunning. Honestly, I\u2019ve never seen fear and emotion better depicted than in the animation here. I know that may be a shocking statement for some, but the purely poignant aura the animators created in Mononoke is nothing short of brilliant. I can understand how some viewers may get caught up in the amount of \u201cthings\u201d in the background, possibility even distracting them from the associated scene, but it was a minor inconvenience for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound is also a masterful feat in Mononoke. Although I can\u2019t say I necessarily loved either the OP or ED, the tracks did fit the series well. The OP captured the whimsical nature of the art and the ED wrapped up the \u201cplays\u201d with a melodic ballad. The sounds effects were the strongest part of the anime\u2019s OST. Whether it was the crunching of bones, or blood-curtling screams, the sound designers must have had an immense amount of fun with Mononoke. The background music is rare but efficient, subtly adding to the corresponding scene as needed. The voice acting is a real gem as well, with strong performances by Takahiro Sakurai as Kusuriuru and Yukana and Tayo (the wide-eyed girl from the train).\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of Mononoke is largely based on my ability to take the series slow. As mentioned above, this is NOT a binge anime. Experience the plays one at a time, by yourself in the dark, much like I alluded to in my Mushishi review. If you truly close all expectations and stereotypes off, you\u2019ll find one of the most remarkable anime series in existence. Mononoke captures human emotion and psychology in one fell swoop, creating an atmospheric masterpiece with an intricate art style to go with it. This anime is a work of art, a drama for the ages, and one I\u2019ll most certainly remember as an instant classic.",

            "content": "I'll try too keep this review rather short and concise, but I'll probably just start rambling and won't be able to stop myself if I get out of hand. Since I'm such a rambler, please forgive me if it sometimes seems somewhat unorganized even though I'll do some organizing when it's done. If you're not bothered to read the whole things I wrote 3 pros and 3 cons at the bottom.\r\nPersonally I watched this before Ayakashi - Japanese Classic Horror which this is a spin-off from and you can go ahead and watch this without having seen it.\r\nFirst of let me start of with thatthe art was really intriguing. I like animes with a more experimental approach to the art. Not nearly as experimental and artsy as Mind Game, which remains as my favorite anime-art to date. Sometimes the art just feels like stylized art with a filter put on it, which is pretty lame. Despite that this is one of my favorite arts to date. It goes very well with the stories and really raises the mood and atmosphere rather than just being a medium of information. Not recommended for fans of the stereotypical huge eye school anime style.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good though it's fairly underused throughout the series. The sound effects feel fitting. The voice actors  do their jobs as they should, it feels natural and synchronized with the animation, correct tone etc.. Onto the substance of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nMononoke is composed of five arcs, all of which are only related by the recurrent main character and similar plotline. The story follows a wandering medicine seller who combats malicious spirits. One gets to observe group psychology as unsuspecting humans confront supernatural as well as life threatening situations. Note that I said observe, one never really feels 'connected' and feels for the characters. It is the result of a main character with nerves of steel and a heart of ice, I'm not saying his character is bad though, it's a very intriguing and interesting one. I really like the main character, I fell in love with him the first episode, so damn cool ^^. This is one of those odd and seemingly emotionless types. There are a few moments where he gets a little too flat (for example in the last arc). You never get a background or introduction on the arc characters, it charges almost immediately into the story. The result is as said before, makes you more of an observer instead of feeling with the characters. This deems the horror part of the story pretty useless since you won\u2019t feel their fear as a spectator. Or I don\u2019t know, maybe I'm just hard to frighten? I hope I don't seem like too much of a \"zomg-iem-totali-not-afread-off-anithyng\" type :P. \\n\\n\r\nThe most important part of the anime are the mystery aspects, figuring out the not so understandable main character and of course the mystery of the Mononoke - the supernatural haunter - itself. The medicine seller needs to know a mononoke's shape (Katachi), truth (Makoto), and reasoning (Kotowari) in order to combat it, as he tries to figure this out you get to know the story of the mononoke as well as the story of the people involved. The mysticism remains truly thick throughout the series. Though each arc has its conclusion, but if you didn't really pay attention and didn't try to figure it out at least partly by yourself the conclusion might not be so clear. One of my favourite pleasures while watching it was the almost surreal symbolism playing mind games with me. It's not quite surrealism though, since surrealism holds no sense at all and most usually no symbolism. This is one of the most thought provoking anime titles I've ever seen. Though I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who have seen A LOT more thought-provoking animes than me, but I'd say that I've had my fair share, I'm pretty sure they'd agree with me anyway. \\n\\n\r\nHere are a few pros and cons. I tried to write what others might consider as cons and pros.\\n\\n\r\n3 Pros (if you consider these as pros):\\n\r\n- Thought-provoking\\n\r\n- Atmospheric\\n\r\n- Interesting and realistic* group psychology scenarios\\n\\n\r\n*Not realistic in the sense that nothing out of this world is occurring but in the sense that the characters react as real human beings would.\\n\\n\r\n3 Cons (if you consider these as cons):\\n\r\n- Unscary horror\\n\r\n- Unsympathetic characters\\n\r\n- You may find the conclusions blurry\\n",

            "content": "Mononoke appears as the continuation of the adventures of a certain character of the last arc of the series Ayakashi. To complement our viewing pleasure, some more arks were added, using an original art style and ingenious storytelling with the sole and honest objective of telling us about stories that could be our own.\r\nThe art is, by far, the most impressive part of this series. An explosion of colour that reminds us of the artistical epitome of ancient Japan, intelligent use of mixed media and a careful design for each theme make of Mononoke a treat for our eyes. Each detail is worth of admiration,like a painting in motion. The animation is simply superb, constantly adapting to the new styles and themes that are used for each story.\\n\r\nThe characters end up being a part of their background, in an almost absolute bidemensional existance. However, they are still highly detailed, especially considering all the intricate patterns of clothing and body styling that decorate their personality.\\n\\n\r\nIn continuation, the characters may be well designed in visual terms, but what makes this all unique is the way they were made emotionally. Each character has a distinct existance, even though some of them appear in later occasions. The characters of each art are truly dependable on the story they belong to, but would still make sense as indivituals outside of it. However, the astounding element from this crowd is the main and recurring character, Kusuriuri. Unnamed, unrevealed and, from the beggining to the end, an unknown creature. This mysterious man is the tool that makes the anime go further, within the same stories and from story to story. He does not have any kind of characterization however he appears to the viewer as the most palpable of characters. For some reason, he steps from an (eventual) imaginary or mistic being to someone that exists.\\n\\n\r\nKusuriuri, the mysterious medicine seller, moves from arc to arc solving strange occurances that assault the other characters. The only thing common between all of this is that every problem is provoked by a monster, a phantom or a spirit, something created to specifically haunt that group of people. As he discovers more about the occurances, the events behind the appearance of the haunting unveil themselves. And the result is, most of the times, something of extreme beauty. The narration is very basic in the sense that characters reveal their actions and the chronology of the story, but each story is treated with so much care that even the most simple event is turned into poetry.\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening theme and the Ending theme are less than memorable. However what marks Mononoke is not the music, but the sound. The use of the correct effects at the right moments give an effect of mistery and fear. In a sense, it may be inspired in kabuki plays*. It is original in this sense but, otherwise, rather average.\\n\\n\r\nA series of amazing tales that touch every theme of the Japanese folklore, leaded by one of the greatest characters ever created and crowned by a truly original art. A masterpiece in artistic terms. Watching Mononoke is like reading a poem from the Heian time: small, sometimes even simple, but so rich in detail that we can't help to \"let the dew wet our sleeves\"\\n",

            "content": "First of all: this anime is a masterpiece, and I do REALLY mean it.\r\nLet's start from the beginning, the story. Being composed of five arcs, the anime doesn't really connect any of them, the main character appart, which is quite unique. The style changes from arc to arc, some of them are more disturbing, others are more laughable. The last one, however, has kind of an \"end\". And this is what made me give not a 10, but a 9 to the story.\r\nIf everything was so perfect and unconnected, why put an \"end\" to it? Let we tell ourselvesl the story continues forever! >_<\r\nNow theart... Well, this anime's art is what I can really call Art! It isn't common, not at all, so if you like the traditional anime art, you won't like this. If you have a taste for something more artistic and unique, you'll probably love it as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound. It's perectly synched and everything. The sound AND the very lack of sound put you really in the mood of the anime. The voice acting is great, featuring some well-known guys, but what caught my attention was the fact that every voice in the anime fits it's character. Every single one. The voice of the main character is EPIC, it makes him too smexy. I'm saying this and I'm a guy, this character was really something.\\n\\n\r\nWell, for the characters, I already said much about Mr. Medicine Seller, the mc of the show. He is misterious, sexy, has a sexy voice, and is very sarcastic. The other characters are perfect for their purpose: make the viewer feel sick of humanity. Almost every human in the series is particularly disgusting, what leads the viewer to feel pity for the Mononoke's fate, generally.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? I watched the whole series in a row, in one night, and wasn't bored for a second. I even wanted more, in fact, I need more right now, so I'll end this review and search for some similar stuff.\\n\\n\r\nEnd.\\n\r\nPrinceArthas",

            "content": "Lately I have found that I like shows that have an overall goal for the plot and character development in stead of the episodic, story-arc-of-the-week, formula, but Mononoke is an example of the episodic formula done right while also going all-out, resulting in a very unique show.\r\nThe strength of this show is the stories so I'll start with that. As much as I like an over-arching storyline all five of the stories in this show were memorable and strong stories on their own part. Each story is given enough to flesh out character motives and back story while also giving us quite a great dealof action when in reality they are only ever move into a few rooms. For a Japanese-style ghost story collection it requires not a lot of knowledge of Japanese culture, which makes it more accessible. (Just maybe wiki Genji Monogatari before watching the Nue episodes.) All the stories are well-paced and have satisfying conclusions. The only one I can think of which perhaps I did not enjoy as much as the rest would have to be the Sea Monster one. But even then I was fascinated by the concept of the hollow boats and the fact that one of the supposedly one-shot characters actually questioned the Medicine Seller's motives. This is probably just me being hard on it because I loved the rest so much (particularly the first and the last one.) (9)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design of this show is very well done.  In short, it replaces any type of  body horror they could show, and somehow that is more creepy than actually showing it. For example, in episode two at an especially creepy moment, not to get too far into spoilers, they show cracked daruma dolls and strips of cloth. That image itself is not scary, symbolic, but no enough to get goosebumps over. However, with the sounds that go on during that sequence you actually feel violated in a way because even if it is just symbolic representation on screen the noise is enough to make you not want to look. (9)\\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame though, if you close your eyes. The art style for this show is very unique and the sheer amount of detail they put into their backgrounds is lovely. This show is probably one of the most screencap-able ones as it is fashioned to look like a painting in every frame. Also, symbolic representation is something you don't see very much in anime nowadays. My only complaint is that sometimes the characters look a little, shall we say .. off? Sometimes facial features aren't consistent and there are these odd rare cases where the characters move a little unnaturally especially in the mouth without any reason in the story to do so. It can be a little jarring, but it doesn't happen often. But, when this anime does movement well, they do it very well. I remember being really taken with is one shot of the Medicine Seller's feet while he's running through a train car on geta. (8)\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the real strength of this show lies in it's strong writing and atmosphere. When you are not being simultaneously dazzled and confused by the imagery, the sound is genuinely creepy (and well timed with the animation, I might add) but there is also our main character who is, in his own respects, unsettling as well, right down to the way he delivers each line. He has this genuinely odd habit of making long unnatural pauses in the middle of each sentence. His features are quite demonic even compared with the most unattractive members of the cast and his clothes aren't like what the rest of the cast wears. (Given, he does make a comment about this in one of the episodes but that was mainly to explain why he was dressed like that in that time period.) The only problem in the character department is that, given the format of the show, it can only develop a character other than the protagonist for a certain period of time. But they do do a good job with the time they have with these characters as finding out what their motivations are is essential to each of the plots. But, because the show needs to keep the protagonist enigmatic, they cannot have just one big episode where they explain his back story like so many other animes feel they need to do. While we don't have to sit through a long back story session, I do feel a little disappointed that we don't learn more about the Medicine Seller because he is, in fact, that mysterious.  (7) \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment (10)\\n\r\nObjective score overall (8.5/10) \\n\r\nI'd recommend this show to, well, anyone actually. Even those who are not considered 'anime fans'. Mononoke is Japanese horror storytelling at it's finest. With impressive art and sound direction and the strength of the writing to tell very Japanese tales without having to have a PhD in Asian studies. Whether it's for unique eye-candy or for the simple pursuit of a summer ghost story, it's a good watch.",

That's the simple answer to \"what's the story?\" The deeper analysis are each story arc itself. The medicine seller goes around places encountering mononoke.\r\nArt: \r\nSomething mononoke does very well. The color use and art style itself is different from many modern and old animes as well, it's unique and something i really enjoyed myself. \r\nSound:\r\nThe medicine sellers VA is great, that mono tone voice just sets the mood of the anime, ofc expressing emotions when needed. Ireally enjoy the OP soundtrack, its something i could listen to repeatedly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNow this is admittedly a weak point of mononoke, it doesn't do much to develop the medicine seller, there is \"just enough\" told about him, but in mononoke's defense i think this is what they were going for. A mysterious unknown medicine seller that slays mononoke. Now the mononoke themselves are fleshed out through the 3-4 ep arcs, you get to learn about them and why they are that way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThere's a lot to enjoy here from the story telling of each mononoke and how they were formed. To the people involved in the making of the mononoke. As well as for the medicine seller, i just find him a badass and enjoyable main character and he just fits the series great.",

            "content": "Mononoke is a supernatural, fantasy, historical horror series that came out in 2007. It was brought to us by our old friends at Toei animation. That's right, the studio behind Kuuchuu Bruranko and a lot of people's first anime with franchises like Dragonball and Sailor Moon. I've been told that this one is really good so let's have a look and see if that is the case.\r\nStory:\r\nWe follow a \u201csimple\u201d medicine seller as he goes from place to place and hunts down mononoke. Which are a form of ayakashi, not the princess. The series gives us five short stories, each one lasting two or threeepisodes, about the medicine seller getting into some strange situation caused by a mononoke and seeking out its shape, truth and reasoning so that he can exorcise it. It's kind of reminiscent of Mushishi, which isn't a bad thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe only real narrative problem with the series is that it can get repetitive. Not in terms of the set ups or anything like that. Rather, the resolutions are a bit repetitious. Our Medicine Seller finds the mononoke's shape, truth & reasoning, draws the blade of exorcism and then he briefly talks to the audience. Although, in all fairness, there are exceptions where he ends up not drawing the blade but those stories where he does get kind of reiterative in their resolutions.\\n\\n\r\nStill, that's a fairly minor complaint given how many things the series does well. It's really good at setting up interesting scenarios and at developing those scenarios in a way that keeps you interested. The pacing is also really well done. The series takes its time to build things up and really delve into a situation before moving into the action. The whole necessity of getting information about the mononoke really benefits the series in that respect. I also do like the way the series handles the medicine seller directly addressing the audience. They basically present the series as though it's a play with the way they use transitions and the medicine seller's final bits of dialogue when closing a story. It's a decision that could have very easily gone wrong, but the execution here is superb and it really works to its utmost, or close to it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nEach story has its own cast with the only reoccurring character being the unnamed medicine seller. This is another aspect that could have very easily not worked. Since the medicine seller is, in many ways, an archetypical trickster character. He doesn't let anything agitate him and always seems to be in control of a given situation. You never feel like he's in any real danger. However, what makes the character not just work, but work really superbly, is a combination of the play aesthetic and the fact that he devotes so much time to information gathering without any real concern for protecting the ordinary people who are caught up in the situation. Usually because there's some karmic element involved. He'll warn people and give them advice, but he's more interested in unravelling the facts. I also do appreciate the way that every single side character has some contribution to make to the narrative. The side characters also do have relatable factors surrounding them. A lot of them aren't good people, but they have enough complexity that you can understand them and why they've made the decisions they have. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this is an interesting case. Toei elected to make the artwork evocative of illustrated manuscripts. They were very meticulous about it with the character designs, backgrounds and even the colour palette. It doesn't look like many other anime but in a way that's dynamic and interesting. There is also something vaguely disconcerting about the more intense animation when paired with that art style which, ultimately, pairs well with the writing aesthetic. The imagery can also be pretty disturbing when it needs to be. The transitional artwork is really well handled, tying in with the theatrical feel nicely. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of really strong performances in this series. Yukana, Tanaka Rie, Wakamoto Norio & Midorikawa Hikaru to name a few. The strongest performance, though, comes from our protagonist voiced by Sakurai Takahiro. That's right, Cloud Strife, Rockman X, Kururugi Suzaku, Endou Kazuki, Okada Joe, Osomatsu & a whole bunch of other characters. The music was handled by Takanashi Yasuharu. The same composer who worked on Shiki & Gantz. He does a really good job. His music for this really supplements the art and narrative style. Which helps forge a really strong atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't any in this series. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nSo, was this series as good as I'd been told? Honestly, I'd say that it is. It has an amazing narrative with intriguing characters, coupled with art and music that complement the narrative style and excellent acting. All in all, I do recommend this one & I have to give it an enthusiastic 9/10. Next week's review will be for another Toei production, Futari wa Precure: Max Heart Movie 2- Yukizora no Tomodachi.",

            "content": "I wonder what would happen if I watched this high? \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nFormed around four separate stories with two acts, Mononoke sets up an epic, twisted tale in each of them. Each them very different in their own way, but very much the same, holding a similar type of theme: secrets. We all have them. Some secrets are small. Some are massive and can hold us hostage in our minds, whether the case this anime makes us bring out those dark secrets and makes a nightmare a reality. Illusions. It's all in the head. This is true horror and it absolutely terrified me.  I lovedthe cinematography and the way the camera captured the mood of the anime. It gave the every single scene strong emotion. Everyone things that horror is a scary serial killer coming after them with a mask or a dead girl dressed in white with blood all over her face haunting a house, but no. This is true horror. It's more historic too with using Mononoke (monsters) as the antagonist. There are so many legends, myths, and stories about these monsters. Many going back hundreds and hundreds of years! Goes to show that Japan can be one scary place. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLook at all the pretty colours! Terrifying, but pretty! I loved how they did a rendition of Japanese historic artwork. The style was just breathtakingly beautiful! And man did it ever tie in well with the horrific and suspenseful mood of the stories. The art...it was what gave the anime the genre we call Horro. I'm going to let you all know this is probably the most beautiful Japanese animation I've ever seen. The camera angles they used were unique and mind messing. And not only that, the style of these characters designs are just so unique and fancy! It's creepy yet inspiring. This animation almost made me feel like I was high. lol\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who doesn't do subbed, I really loved the VA that were used. The one who voiced Kururiuri held a strong tone who brought the character to life. The beginning and opening songs held a great beat that made the episodes even more exciting! And the music in the episodes really made the scene more eye catching, more eerie. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nKururiuri, the medicine vendor, plays with people's mind on making them confess to their deepest darkest secrets while hunting and slaying monsters around the country side. He's like a drug dealer. He puts thoughts into peoples heads, messes with them to hunt down the Mononoke hidden either inside of them or around him. He's a perfect character who can show he is not to be messed with. \\n\\n\r\nThrough the many other characters throughout the four mini stories, each one brought on a creepy aspect of the story. They might've not been the ones who gave the anime a horror theme, but they did give out dark and anticipating parts of their stories that were absolutely addicting to witness.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI could not stop watching this.  I actually ended up jumping a few time! Blood is the colour of orange. Up is down. Right is left. It's a huge mind fuck that will leave you wanting more. I think the only reason why it isn't one of my favourites was because the lack of plot. This could've gone so much farther with just ONE mini story they used. At least twenty episodes per mini story. But never the less, this anime is totally worth the watch. Just don't watch it high. Or if you do...let me know what it's like. I'm curious. \\n\\n\r\nI give this anime 90% on the Monster level.",

            "content": "Mononoke is a spin-off based on the final arc of Ayakashi: Classic Japanese Horror. And I have to say, it does extremely well as a stand-alone series.\r\nThe series consists of several arcs, 2 to 3 episodes each. During each arc the main character, known simply as \"medicine seller\", will find himself in a situation where a mononoke (vengeful spirit) is going to be involved and will kill people if nothing is done about it.\r\nEach arc, although short, has an interesting story with a deep, underlying theme relating to the reason for the mononoke's existence. The main character will converse with the other characters involved andobserve their behavior to uncover the truth of the matter. The deeper into the arc you get, the more twists there are until eventually the core of the matter is revealed. The mononoke's Form, Truth and Regret are deduced and the medicine seller will use his Sword of Exorcism to purify the spirit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story of every arc was unique and great, with each character being in some way vital.\\n\\n\r\nThe art-style is certainly unique for anime, reminiscent of ukiyo-e woodblock prints. There is a paper-like filter over the screen and there is heavy use of bright and vibrant colors, giving the series a particular feel. It works surprisingly well for the horror it tries to evoke.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did not like either the opening or ending theme very much, the sounds used in the series are phenomenal in getting the atmosphere just right.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I enjoyed the series quite a bit.",

            "content": "after finishing this momentous series it immediately went on my top favorite animes!!\r\n*DISCLAIMER: TRIGGER WARNINGS: GORE, INCEST, ABORTION* also if you are epileptic, there are a lot of flashing and bright colors watch at your own risk!!!!!!!!\r\nMononoke is a dynamic, dramatic and suspenseful anime about a mysterious wanderer who is only known as \"the medicine seller\" who travels from place to place in search of the Mononoke (harmful spirits who are not at rest which can cause death, disease or injury). he has a special sword to kill the Mononoke which needs Form, Truth and Reason (in some subs its regret). \r\nSTORY 10: the basicstory is really interesting. i dont think ive ever come across any sort of anime like this before. in the anime there are 12 episodes which are broken down into 4 arcs (obviously each arc lasting 3 episodes). the three episodes are basically allocated to finding one of the three things needed to summon the sword to kill the Mononoke (one episode to find truth, the next to find form, the last to find reason then a new arc starts). I thought that was really interesting because if they were to try and fit all of that into one episode it would almost be undigest-able and the series would have gotten boring. the arcs were exciting and fresh. they were also VERY creepy and VERY gorey. if you have a faint heart or a weak constitution please dont watch!\\n\\n\r\nART 10: the art was absolutely beautiful! the colors, the drawing style, the animation, were all fantastic. first impressions are the most important and when i saw the first episode my mind was blown. it was fantastic!! the animation was very choppy at points for dramatic effect and such but as the series went on all of the jump cuts and such really didnt happen that much almost as if animation itself was going through time (because there is a time skip im going to assume the series takes place over a long period of time)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 10: sound is really important in animes like this because its a horror series so the ambient noises and music really have to be on point and in my opinion they were!! every creepy moment had eerie ambient noises in the background to fix perfectly. i was always on the edge of my seat watching this!! even the softer moments had the perfect soundtrack to it. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 10: the medicine seller was displayed perfectly. the viewer really doesnt know much about him other than he is a humanoid with supernatural powers that doesnt seem to age that has the power to put mononoke to rest. we really dont know his back story and i think that fits the mysterious vibe of the anime. it really isnt even about him personally but him getting the mononoke. the supporting characters in each arc were great too! they all had their own personal stories to share and their own emotional burdens to work through. it was honestly amazing how the animators and producers packed so much into something so short\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 10: i loved it. i loved the topics. i loved feeling uneasy. i loved the jump scares. i loved the characters. i loved the music. i loved the animation. i loved the color scheme. i loved the concept. i loved what time it took place. i loved the historical significance of the mononoke. i loved he idea of the arcs. i loved it all. i finished the series in like 3 hours because i was watching the episodes back to back. i never got bored or tired or anxious for something exciting to happen.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 10: i loved it. i want everyone on earth to at least see the first episode. it was so captivating you have no idea!!! I LOVED IT!!",

            "content": "I try to write as concise as possible, but if you're still too lazy to read (like me), here is a shorter version: if anime means anything to you more than just pure entertainment or an activity to kill time \u2013 do check out Mononoke. You WON\u2019T regret it. \r\nI got pulled in the \"anime/manga zone\" in junior high and I've loved it 'til now. I know some people who share this interest and lots who don\u2019t. But this is the type of anime that I\u2019m not afraid to show it to anyone, say my 32-year-old brother who has absolutely zero interest in Japanese animation.This is the type of series that actually makes you use your head to watch. It doesn\u2019t give you answers, it provides you with opinions. In my most humble language, Mononoke is Japanese animation at its peak.  A truly captivating and memorable series.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you're reading past that line and are ready to embark on the once-in-a-lifetime experience namely \"Mononoke\", you might wonder: \"Surely there are many awesome series out there with exceptional plot and cast, but what makes this series so damn special that I should watch it?\"\\n\\n\r\nWell, to start off - Mononoke's protagonist is someone who - throughout the whole series - doesn\u2019t have a name; to be more precise, his name is never revealed. He is simply known as \u201cthe medicine seller.\u201d But watching the show, you will realize that the name is indeed not needed. In fact, the aspect of the nameless protagonist adds to the mysterious identity of his, and to the ghostly atmosphere of the stories presented. \\n\r\nAnd if I forget to mention, Takahiro Sakurai did a splendid job voicing this awesome main character. \\n\\n\r\nNext comes the core concept of the series - \"Mononoke.\" While this isn't particularly a new \"term\", it\u2019d be a far cry from the truth if one were to simply think of it as \u201cyoukai\u201d or \u201cghosts\u201d or \u201cmonsters.\u201d And even though the \u201cmononoke\u201d theme isn\u2019t new, the way it unfolds through individual enchanting tales is what engrosses viewers \u2013 purposefully engaging them in the twisted emotions of the human nature presented in the series. And here is where the art and sound blend in. \\n\\n\r\nIn Mononoke, you are introduced to 5 different stories which share but one thing in common - dark and somewhat disturbing themes Yet, these very eerie stories are illustrated through unbelievably bright colors with \u201cstatic\u201d frames, making the whole series like a moving painting. Sounds fair?\\n\\n\r\nWhat if I continue to tell you the show gets even \u201cweirder\u201d as some scenes just have absolutely no sounds. It\u2019s just pure silent with still frames. You think I\u2019d be bored - but no, it makes me hold my breath, feel slightly uneasy, and wonder what\u2019s coming next. Still not interested?\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately then,\u2026. I have nothing more to offer. I know this sound clich\u00e9, but what this show does to you is it makes you think and feel. And everybody does it differently. But Mononoke delivers its message so well that it definitely deserves the title namely masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nYes, I am (slightly) biased in this review but who doesn\u2019t, especially when they are talking about the things they are in love with? \\n\\n\r\nSo to make this review less biased, I will end it with a *flaw* that is absolutely \u201cfatal\u201d \u2013 it wasn\u2019t long enough. I sure as hell wished there were more to it. Yup, that\u2019s the flaw, you\u2019re happy?\\n",

            "content": "This anime feels like a true gem of this medium to me. I've never seen anything like it and am honestly surprised it isn't more popular (a big shame imo). I love it when shows take risks to stand out and don't just go for the most generic look or story structure imaginable, which this one certainly does. \r\nHORROR AND PALATE \r\nI don't think anyone would see this and at first glance say: \"Wow... so many colors. It has to be a horror piece.\", because that statement just doesn't seem all to logical. But in this case, it passes with flying colors. This show pullsthe psychological horror so well, even one-upping other horror anime which can't do it even with their dark and bleak color designs.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY AND ARCS\\n\r\nThat doesn't mean the story is just mindless gibberish outside the horror. This anime itself is split into 5 different arcs, all sharing only the haunting of a mononoke and the mysterious medicine man, who is set on ridding the world of those monstrosities. I'm not going to go into further detail so as to not spoil anything to you, but I can say that I was constantly surprised at the sudden story twists and turns which would almost always catch me off guard. Every arc may at first appear to make no sense, but at it's end everything that seemed like randomness before gets a new meaning and the message shifts immeasurably. I just finished the whole anime and I'm already looking forward to a second viewing in anticipation of noticing new things that I missed now that I know the endings to all arcs. Having said that, I also look forward to seeing the second arc (Umib\u014dzu) again, because at the moment it feels like the one I least enjoyed. I don't rightfully know the full reason, especially because it's a who-dunnit (and believe me, I am quite fond of those), but I wasn't too fond of the slow development in it and the ending was the first one I guessed before the last episode of the arc.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nI was really impressed with the characters in this show. The medicine man was great, especially his voice actor (but seriously, some of the line delivery with pausing for dramatic effect was incredible), but the side characters were also pretty good. Every side character gets a backstory, even if only a small one, but every one also represents a certain type of person in our society. You have a representation of people with too much pride, those who only care about being famous, those who betray others for their own benefit, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\nThe animation in this show is... kinda meh. It certainly does have it's high points but never goes to insane levels of quality. That being said, I am an animator myself and am constantly pulled out of shows with lame or lazy animation. But it didn't happen with this show. The show actually gets away with this with some clever stylistic choices of showing movement, which wouldn't really work in standard anime, but are quite effective here because of the whole art style and atmosphere of this show. Having said that, the worst one of those was the blur-moving shot style. It isn't used mostly, but when it is used in the very first episode, it actually made me a little dizzy watching it unwind (the stairs scene, you know which one).\\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHT\\n\r\nI didn't really expect much before my first watch, but now I am proud to say it is in my top 5 anime of all time. For those who feel like they are bored of the common style of anime or want a change, or are cult horror fans like myself, this anime should be a great breath of fresh air. You don't get many shows as unique as this one, so why not just give it a shot. \\n",

Yet I most say it's not for all the public, it's stories show the worst of mankind andoften talk about very morbid sides of it, so beware of many suggestive topics.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10): Very unique, fits perfectly with the traditional horror feeling and the details and color are simply gorgeous. The charcters look very disturbing sometimes, but I think it's a great way to convey the temperament or feelings in each character, as well as all the details involved in each picture.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10): The music, sound and voices, just like in ayakashi, convey perfectly the whole feeling of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10): Very original and well developed, specially Kusuriuri, got to say this guy is one of my favorite characters of all times. Sometimes he gives you the creeps, while trying to figure what's happening behind his eyes and other times, you have to smile for his soft, ironic or cool side.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): If you like mistery and deep reflexions about life and beings, and are not afraid of taking a look at the morbid side of people, you'll love it, I could hardly keep from watching it all at once.",

            "content": "One of the best anime in the present era.\r\nThis is literally a piece of art, both in a literary and visual sense. Since the aesthetic effects are easier to describe, I'll start there. The art and sound follow a semi-traditional Japanese style, but with modern twists here and there. The art makes Mononoke something distinctly different from all the other anime in the world (except the last bit of Ayakashi, I suppose). It also really helps bring out the incredibly high level of disturbance that defines the plot of Mononoke.\r\nThe story of Mononoke is about a mysterious medicine seller with crazy but limited powers whogoes around and slays demons known as Mononoke or Ayakashi. In order to do so, he must find the Form, Truth, and Regret of the monster (a very unique idea, in my opinion).\\n\\n\r\nThere are five or so plots, each about 2-3 episodes each, totaling to 12 episodes of Mononoke. What makes the story amazing also brings it down, though. The tales are very, very confusing, bringing the mood of the anime to an almost surreal sense. In fact, the more you think about it, the less answers you'll find. I don't know if what the makers have done is justified by \"artistic license\", because it frankly is very hard to follow and doesn't make much sense. That being said, the story also makes you think very hard to find some well-hidden symbolism, so it's definitely not a passive anime that you can just watch and be done with. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is really cool but confusing, the art and sound are unique and well done, and the medicine seller and his abilities are a praiseworthy concept. This anime brings a new definition to an old genre (horror) and I recommend that you go and see why that is.",

            "content": "I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve never been keen on anime with a strong sense of art house artistry. I\u2019m talking about the visually strange shows with unnaturally colored objects, settings designed like an abstract picture, or characters who move and look like something from a manga instead of anime. They give a sense of arrogance that they need nothing else so long as they have unique aesthetics.\r\nMononoke does not have this arrogance.\r\nThe show follows an enigma known as the Medicine Seller as he wanders feudal Japan and exorcises evil spirits known as mononoke. To do so, he must uncover the mononoke\u2019s Shape, Truth, and Reason. Despite itsmystical trappings, every mystery in Mononoke feels realistic. That is, they\u2019re more about the people plagued by them than the mononoke themselves. Every spirit slain is prefaced by at least one other person whose secrets are revealed.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s this detective work on each \u2018client\u2019 that the Medicine Seller shows a penchant for exposing skeletons in the closet. His knowledge on the occult is matched by his intuition on other people, and perhaps eclipsed by his perpetual calm and facetious tone. In other words, the guy is hot shit and he knows it. How he became this way is never explained, but knowing the story behind that disinterested wit is secondary to the lives of the people he encounters.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the inability to admit one\u2019s fears to the paranoia of inadvertent sin, the show\u2019s greatest strength is when it revels in its characters\u2019 crippling weaknesses. Their every motive, every action, and every fault is mercilessly uncovered, and by the end of each mystery we know them better than we know the Medicine Seller. And yet, they\u2019re not sympathetic but uncomfortably familiar. They\u2019re reminiscent of the monsters we can easily be.\\n\\n\r\nThis is horror.\\n\\n\r\nHorror is not about a bloodbath soaked with jump scares. Horror is the examination of the human condition as its furtive faults grant an uncanny power to do the unthinkable. It unleashes a despicable flurry whether we\u2019re willingly heinous or acting out of desperation. This is something many horror films today fail to comprehend, but a truth that Mononoke lives by.\\n\\n\r\nThe show reinforces this truth through its visual direction. It rarely hides its horrors in the cover of darkness, forcing us to confront them where we think we\u2019re safe. From unnaturally round eyes to a toothed mask, the show has no qualms about being too obvious in its frights. But rather than illicit groans of \u2018get on with it!,\u2019 it dredges a powerless feeling as if saying \u2018we\u2019re ruining your life and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u2019\\n\\n\r\nAdding to the visceral visuals is an atmospheric sound design. Empty hallways are lined with children\u2019s laughter to unnerving effect. Chatter and banter play from a still picture to reflect a woman\u2019s detachment from her own life. The rumbling of a train\u2019s track traversing rises and falls with the tension of who the story focuses on. The show doesn\u2019t lack music, but prefers mood. It \u2018speaks\u2019 with minimal effort for maximum effect.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to point out one thing I didn\u2019t like, it\u2019s how each mystery varies in quality from one to the other, especially \u2018Faceless Monster\u2019 and \u2018Japanese Chimera.\u2019 The former treads ground the first two mysteries already covered, making it very formulaic. The latter either has no examination of the human condition, or one so understated that it\u2019s out of place entirely. But the quality difference between each mystery is a pittance when the show is still good even at its worst. I might as well say \u2018I didn\u2019t enjoy this luxurious train ride as much as I enjoyed this luxurious cruise ship.\u2019\\n\\n\r\nThis is what I mean by Mononoke not being arrogant. It knows it needs more than a unique look if it wants to be fondly remembered. There\u2019s a conscious effort to want to make a good story as well as make the aesthetics its own. It knows it wants to be horror, and it knows what horror truly is. Through it all, more than anything else, Mononoke is simply an emotionally resonant piece.\\n\\n\r\nWho knew a story about spirits could feel so human?",

            "content": "Hey now here's an obscure series you should watch!  Yeah!\r\nThe first thing that'll stand out when you look at Mononoke is the art. I'm not going to mince words: Mononoke is the best-looking animated show I have ever seen. The art is styled after traditional Japanese art, which means it's brightly colored, detailed, and everything feels kind of flat.  I can't say enough about how amazingly gorgeous the art and color is in this series.  It's used to maximum effect too, because the series is filled with all kinds of surreal visuals to let the art really stretch out.\r\nConceptually, Mononoke could bethought of as a really sinister version of Mushishi: The Medicine Seller shows up at a place and deals with some sort of haunting by a spirit, a Mononoke.  Whereas Mushishi trades in a sense of tranquility though, Mononoke is effectively a horror mystery series.  In order to exorcise a Mononoke, the Medicine Seller needs to figure out the spirit's Form (what it is), Truth (why it's here), and Regret (what it wants).  Of course these are always tied into the secrets of the people the Mononoke is haunting, so each episode is an attempt to figure out what bad thing the characters did that caused the Mononoke to show up in the first place.  Sounds formulaic, but each arc (which consist of 2-3 episodes) puts a new spin on the search for truth, and the show never repeats itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe only persistent character in Mononoke is the mysterious Medicine Seller.  A strange fellow who looks like a Final Fantasy character in the middle of feudal Japan, he's... uh... enigmatic.  He's also kind of an asshole.  Unlike Ginko in Mushishi, The Medicine Seller isn't really made out to be a truly sympathetic or relatable character.  He's mysterious and sinister, and it frequently seems like he cares more about vanquishing the Mononoke than the safety of anyone involved.  Not to mention everything about him is left up to interpretation, there's no expanding on his character or history at all, although his personality does get some subtle development (such as in the Incense arc when he reveals a bit of a sense of humor).  This isn't really a criticism though, he just plays a different role in the story than you might expect.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the other characters only show up for an arc, but they tend to be well-developed.  After all, the stories pretty much all concern the character's histories and actions, so it's natural they'd be pretty well developed.  They also tend to be the more relatable characters for the audience.  They're the ones who are confused and freaked out by all the scary stuff going down, while the Medicine Seller remains constantly cool and mysterious.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty nice, although there's not that much in the show itself.  The opening is a nice piece that's less ominous than you might expect, and the ending is a fairly typical ending ballad sort of thing.  What really does stand out though is that the sound itself is absolutely fantastic.  Visually, Mononoke isn't actually that creepy.  Oh sure it has it's moments, but an enormous amount of the tension comes from the sound design.  When the creepy ambient noises pipe up you know something creepy's gonna happen.  Or maybe not?  When's it gonna happen?  Tension!\\n\\n\r\nMononoke is an absolutely outstanding series, and definitely a new favorite of mine.  The stories are great and the art is dazzling.  It's not for everyone, some might be put off by the slow pace, but it really is a great show.",

            "content": "Okay, this was... unlike anything I'd seen before. I was enamored with the series from the get-go, and that fascination only deepened with time. It's a brilliant, one-of-a-kind piece of art that definitely will stay with you for a long time.\r\nThe story is divided into 5 separate arcs, all happening at undisclosed, scattered points in time and in unrelated locations, each however involving the Medicine Seller as a hunter and slayer of a different demon -- a Mononoke. His process, or M.O. if you will, comprises of getting to the root of the Mononoke's \"form\", \"truth\", and finally, \"regret\" (or \"reason\", the translations vary onthis one). Knowing all of those allows him then to draw his magical sword and kill the demon dead. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as personal opinions go, I think I enjoyed the three middle stories the most; the third one (Noppera-b\u014d) was probably my favorite of all of them. No details though -- wouldn't want to spoil a thing.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this series most outstanding is its use of visuals and sounds as a means to induce very particular moods. Since this is supernatural horror we're talking about, there's a perpetual feeling of unease in the air, and boy, does it make your skin crawl at times. (There are humorous elements as well, and those do take you by surprise, strangely only adding up to the comedy.)\\n\\n\r\nListen, it's not enough to say the colors are beautiful -- virtually each shot is worthy of putting it in a frame and hanging it somewhere... which would however, now that I think about it, take a lot away from the *animated* aspect of the sheer beauty in so many of these scenes. So I take that back. The shaking frames combined with the crazy saturation AND the creepy, abrupt sound effects give way to something entirely unusual and enchanting altogether.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are built wonderfully, with each individual arc, short as it is, allowing the viewer to get to know each backstory and judge its protagonist individually. The Medicine Seller himself is a largely mysterious figure who just materializes in different locations and most of the time, speaks in riddles (the man also loves his dramatic pauses). But all of it makes sense in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just... too bad there's no more than a mere 12 episodes of this. Whatever way you look at it, this series is an Experience, capital E.",

            "content": "[general]\r\nThis series is a spin-off from the thrid arc of Ayakashi~Classic Japanese Horror, Bakeneko.\r\n[storyline]\r\nIt is made up of 5 main stories, each spanning 2-3 episodes. All of which deals with the concept of mononoke, a spirit that combines with strong negative human emotions, becoming a malevolent being that creates trouble. The tone of the story is pretty serious, and usually manage to create the sense of tension desired. Most of the stories are very interesting, though sometimes confusing. But if you can take sometime to work out the flow of the story, it actually makes alot of sense.\r\n[music]\r\nThe sound effects in this series are probablyworth more than the actual music, because in most scenes it's the silence that does most of the work. An appropriate sound effect simply enhances the whole errie atmosphere. In terms of OP and ED songs, I can't say I liked it, but it somehow fits to the weird tune of the whole show.\\n\\n\r\n[characters]\\n\r\nDo not expect nice looking characters. Because most of the characters inside are, by general anime standards, ugly. But one main purpose of the stories is bringing out the ugliness in human nature, so the appearance of the characters actually serve to enhance the entire visual experience and well, it worked for me. The main character is certainly good-looking, but rather in the odd way. And the main attraction from this protagonist actually lies in his demeour, which is certainly unique whichever way you look at it.\\n\\n\r\n[animation]\\n\r\nAnother main attraction factor of this show. The bold and imaginative approach towards the animation takes a big step away from the usual Toei animation style. In fact, it's pretty much different from almost all of the styles out there. The only similar one i can think of is gonzo's Gankutsuou, the count of monte cristo. But Mononoke takes the style further- it focuses a lot on the 2D elements, the job here is no longer making it seem realistic or even anime-like, but rather make it into a piece of art, with an abstract edge. The vibrant palette brings out the gaudy nature of the characters and story, while the animation experiments with pace, style and an entirely different form of art.\\n\\n\r\n[in the end]\\n\r\nSo, why should you watch this if you're looking for something different? Well, basically the style- the way of storytelling and the art in this show is simply different and a pretty risky venture. In the sense you'll either love it all or hate it. For me, it is one of my top horror shows, where you'll feel the tension and fear not from the usual black-shadow-at-the-back-and-blood-all-over-the-place scenes but rather from the oddly paced story and effective pauses in dialogue. And of course, not forgetting the weirdly vibrant colours, which at times seems gaudy, but seemingly fits into the picture just fine. Just watching this show for the effects of storytelling would be more than worth your time.",

            "content": "For me, Mononoke feels to be a true masterpiece. It's strange, I didn't want to watch it first... I just saw the animation, and it seemed too absurd, too colourful, also the main character was weird... and then I started it with two friends, and in three episodes, I grew to love the series.\r\nThe art is still weird, but the best type of weird you can imagine. Like an old japanese painting, which suddenly came to life, and started to move, you could stop it any time, and you would get an amazing picture. It is tiring for the eyes because of the colours, butI was absolutely stunned by the weird beauty of some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there is an amazing soundtrack as well, perfectly matching with what you see. I listened to it many times since I finished the series, and it was worth, since now I can really appreciate it, outside the story as well. Sometimes it is dark, mysterious, and sometimes simply uplifting, but anyway, one of the best soundtrack I ever heard. If I remember well, it is composed by the same person, who composed the soundtrack of Naruto Shippuuden... Well, he did an amazing job in both series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is really dark, and it is horror, but not the kind of horror that tries to scare you. You will be afraid, you will feel nervous, but it is totally because of the atmosphere. The world Mononoke portrays is crazy, full of human greed, secrets, horrible fates, and decisions... it is a morbid, and dark tale not really about demons and a demon hunter, but humans themselves. I wouldn't say it is enjoyable... but you won't be able to stop watching it, and you will think a lot on it days, and weeks after you finished the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd last, but not least, the characters. We know awfully little about the main character, we can create theories, but no real information, and what's great about Mononoke, is that he is still amazing, without name, without past. I really grown to like his character, because he has a dark, cynical sense of humor, and a strange character development, which can only be realised, if you watch the bakeneko arc from the ayakashi series... there, you can see the Medicine Seller as a younger, much more inexperienced demon hunter, who still believes in humans, who really wants to save people, and even can get exited over facts... and then you see the person he becomes by the end of this series, and it's really sad. You can see, from story to story how he loses faith in humanity, and starts to care less and less, to the point where he doesn't really want to save anyone anymore. And besides this character, there are many interesting figures in every story, who are all too human. They are sometimes understandable, sometimes it is plain horrible what they've done and why did they do it, but they are all totally unique and interesting characters, perfect for their roles in the story.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is an outstanding anime in every way. If you tolerate a darker story, which will have a deep impact on you, then I suggest you start it. For me, it's one of my favourites by far.",

            "content": "Mononoke presents an artistically unique series of eerie ghost stories. Each story arc is akin to a mini detective novel, the central aspect of which is always an otherworldly spirit\u2019s form, truth and regret. When all these mysteries are solved, the \u201cmedicine seller\u201ds power is unleashed, and the mononoke may finally be put to rest.\r\nThe \u201cmedicine seller\u201d, our mysterious main character, is never named, but always present. As each mononoke (a type of evil spirit) appears, only through him are the characters able to exorcise it, but first, our \u2018heroes\u2019 must find its form, truth, and regret. Each arc takes us through a new setof characters, new scene, and new mononoke, as the medicine seller calmly discovers the three aspects. From unborn babies to unearthly cats, each story entwines a unique set of terrified and utterly flawed characters with an equally disturbed spirit.\\n\\n\r\nMononoke is a curious series. On the one hand, its eccentric artistry and historical influences mixed with occult mystery makes for a wonderfully enveloping experience. However, I must admit that if one is looking to follow deep and complex characters, I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d find that here. Instead, we are given message driven stories, as if to produce a modern expression of ancient yet quaint Japanese myths and fairytales.\\n\\n\r\nWe certainly have a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The medicine seller\u2019s mannerisms and dress make for a memorable character, and the search for the form, truth, and regret of each mononoke is deeply immersive. I found myself glued to the screen more than once in giddy anticipation as to how the mystery would unfold.\\n\\n\r\nAdd to that the gorgeous visuals, bringing such a powerful dimension with traditional Japanese artistry as the inspiration. The show easily spirits you away to a different time and place, away from the overdone landscape of the modern Tokyo area to a new envisionment of historic Japan, as if looking directly into an oriental tapestry.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, however, is only one side of the coin. To have memorable impact as a series, one hopes that the plot or characters touch us deeply, embedding seeds of wisdom deep within our minds, pulsing with sentiment. Mononoke is one such series that skirts the edge of this line. Each character and story holds close the potential to express something profound, but it takes at least a nudge of effort to come to understanding them. The dazzling displays and engrossing mystery within the series can actually be to the determent of the story\u2019s moral trying to be expressed. It becomes up to the viewer to choose which aspect they\u2019d like to gain out of the series, and perhaps with close enough attention, glean just a tad of both.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nEasily one of the more unique offerings in the field of anime, Mononoke is for anyone looking for something just that much different, especially from the artistic perspective.",

            "content": "Mononoke was something of a little gem to me. I first heard about it on one of Pewdiepie's videos, and I was really surprised by his taste in anime. It was definitely better than mine. A while after watching that video, I decided to attempt Mononoke. It was... definitely interesting. In the end, I eventually couldn't stand it. I thought it was boring for some reason. Two years later, I tried it again. It proved successful this time. \r\nThe quality of this show surpasses most of this decade. Its unique art distinguishes itself from pretty much any other anime, with texture that takes time gettingused to, but is satisfying when you can finally appreciate it. The anime brings its episodic structure to its advantage, managing different stories and executing them perfectly. The transitions, the imagery, it really brings the adventures to life, making them really engaging. Because of the way the animation directs the narrative, it helps viewers to actually delve deep into the world of Mononoke. The abstract approach is a huge risk initially, but it presents and executes the ideas presented in clear quality, giving out a real good time for anyone willing to appreciate this stylistic gem. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is stellar. It hits all the right notes at the right times, making the atmosphere tense when it needs to be, and humorous in other scenes. The sounds of the demons and ghosts are just awesome to listen to. The voice actors are impressive as well, fitting into their roles with ease, none of them feeling out of place. \\n\\n\r\nAnd who am I to not talk about the Medicine Seller? With little to say but a whole lot to offer. His personality is certainly intriguing and there is some clarification, but at the end of the day, we are left at the dust. Yet that doesn't prove to be detrimental. He ultimately becomes a fan-favorite and, once again, the animation brings his climactic combat scenes to its full scope and highlights the beauty of this beloved character. Trust me. Those fight scenes are amazing and beautifully animated. \\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists are also something to talk about. These villains serve their role perfectly, and none of them ever annoy or bore you. Really. They're the perfect complimentary to the Medicine Seller. Ranging from demons to ghosts, Mononoke, if you will. Just like the title. And sometimes, sometimes, the villains themselves are the victims. Because of circumstances, the victims who were supposed to be innocent, ultimately become the catalyst to their own demise. This generates complexity in the plot, and makes the overall experience much more fitting.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this anime. It's one of my favorites now. It takes some time to get used to because of its distinct presentation and art, but it proves to give the audience a heck of a good time. Definitely one of the best horror pieces.",

            "content": "Mononoke feels like a cross between The Twilight Zone and Mushishi. This is an episodic show- the series is split into five short stories. You could watch each arc out of order and be completely fine. The show is not about developing the Vendor as a character, rather, just telling some fun horror stories. The horror lies in disgust, freaky surrealism and terrifying sound design.\r\nThe art style is reminiscent of Edo-period wood prints. The anime tends to use color to tell the story as well. The animation tends to be minimal until the climax of the arc in which a short fight will occur betweenthe Medicine Vendor and the Mononoke. The Vendor\u2019s transformation sequence is currently my favorite, and his fights are a sight to behold. \\n\\n\r\nMononoke is not for everyone. It is for a niche audience- if you are not the most analytic viewer, you will most likely be bored or confused. I had a bunch of fun with this anime. It was so different both in artistic style and genre (not a whole lot of horror anime, huh?) making it for a refreshing watch.\\n",

It is a true avant-garde in the anime field, for mainly three reasons.\r\nFirst is it exquisite monolytical artistry: the jouissance of colors (and the lack of it), the details of the mononoke (ayakashi demons that gain material life when they meet a human despair, revenge, pain or other ungrateful feeling), the play on dimensions and perspectives, everything on the anime drawing makes reference to Japanese classical illustration and, to a certain extent, it represents a critique on the lack of artistry to other \"regular\" anime you can watch.\r\nSecond reason is the existencial intensity with which the medicine seller - ournot-so-regular exorcist - deals with the mononoke. Whenever he seeks for the Form of the mononoke, for the Truth and the Reason behind its existence, the medicine seller brings to the reality of the anime the deepest motives of literature and theater.\\n\\n\r\nThird reason i the genre. The plot, in general, is horror. Pure horror. But when mixed with the intensity of each arc character story and with the colorful scenarios, the plot gains in uniqueness and becomes a remarkable horror anime - definitively one to be remembered.",

            "content": "Mononoke is an experimental abundance of art, tragedy, horror and it dares to be different making it an interesting watch. \r\nThe art is by far the best aspect of Mononoke. All the clothes, surroundings and sometimes even faces are covered with color. On top of that there appears to be a grainy texture covering all of it which also doesn\u2019t seem to move, as if a colorful drawing were to be covered with a transparent sheet with multiple scattered smudges of white and grey. \r\nWhen the story of an arc fails to be mind blowing, the art makes up for it as I get lostin the beauty of the visuals. It was much like Gankutsuou but it had a more dispersed variety of color. \\n\\n\r\nThe stories of every arc are simple and some quite common but are packed with loads of emotions. But what makes them so different and great? Well, that\u2019s where the Mononoke come in. The idea of Mononoke and a lot of mythical Japanese creatures make it seem like it\u2019s very unique and makes it stand out a lot. None of the stories hold back and are brutal, dealing with the \u2018harsh\u2019 truth and many depressing realities of life although in a very exaggerated way. \\n\\n\r\nThe downfall of this anime is that it tires way too hard to show it\u2019s viewers that it\u2019s outrageous and sometimes forces the viewers to feel the emotions that it wants them too. It repeatedly drags things out and tries to make them as dramatic as possible to be extremely dark. It told more than it showed. It would have been even better if the darkness was conveyed mostly through their actions and the plot but it has a habit of repeating things in the form of dialogues or random sound effects to make the matter at hand obvious to the viewer so they recognize the unbelievable situation.\\n\\n\r\nEach arc was however quite different from the previous one and each has it\u2019s own speciality. What was best about them was that they completely absorbed me into the intense story. Each arc was nerve wrecking and I wouldn\u2019t be able to look away for even a mere second. It told simple stories in a very hyped, complexed and brilliant way. The beauty of it lies not in what it had to say but how it said it. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it to a great extent though. It was as if reading about ancient Japanese folklore and it had this sense of mystery and suspense topped with stunning art and it\u2019s own way of doing things. \\n",

            "content": "Mononoke is a great choice for you if you enjoy bizarre stories or you're interested in seeing some classic japanese horror stories told with their own creative spin.\r\nThe art of the show is simply amazing, it's unique, and it does its purpose of setting the story in a bizarre scenery with really unique imagery. The art bears similarity to classic japanese art, so it is possible you might not enjoy it if you don't enjoy that style, but I'd say it's done in a dynamic way, so I suggest at least try finishing the first story of Mononoke before deciding on how you view theart. \\n\\n\r\nThe show keeps its bizarre nature through its art and sound which it uses in an unique manner to present a really great atmosphere. It greatly fits the theme and tone the stories should be delivered in and I found them that many times more enjoyable due to the atmosphere. Everything in the series seems really well designed and I enjoyed the design of everything done there in general.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime presents 5 short stories mostly comprised of 2 to 3 episodes, in which a \"simple medicine seller\" who hunts Mononoke, which are vengeful spirits that have gotten a form due to the intense emotions they have felt before their demise. Each story deals with one such spirit in them and the medicine seller slays them by using an enchanted sword known to be able to kill such creates in one blow, but what's not as known is the fact it that requires the knowledge of the Form, the Truth & the Regret of the spirit to be drawn. Through this requirement for the sword to be drawn, the story of the spirit envelopes, as its intense emotions are revealed to us. The sword is  a smart plot device to unravel the events under the spirit came to be what it has become and how the characters are related to the spirit itself, since due to it the writer is forced to bring as many details as it would make sense for the sword to be able to take effect, thus not having any details left out. Each story is bizarre and interesting and have some conclusions you could draw from them. I'd say the stories are even memorable through the nature they were presented and their content even, since while I'd say the strongest point of the show was the way it presented everything, the content of the stories themselves was really intriguing as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe show explores the motives of all the characters it comes across, while the medicine seller as he is used as a tool to tell this story throughout, so he is kept as mostly mysterious and there's not a whole lot of depth to him. However every other character's nature and actions are gonna be explored throughout their stories, fully coming to understand how they came to be what they are and why they did what they ended up doing. \\n\\n\r\nI'd say anyone who enjoys stories that are bizarre by nature should be able to find enjoyment out of this The only thing I can think of that could be a roadblock for you is the art, if you possibly if you dislike the artstyle since it is sorta experimentalor obviously if you don't like anything that is bizarre. I won't detail how the stories are bizarre since it's best to experience that rather than read about it, so you should give this a try, since it is indeed a really unique experience.",

            "content": "Mononoke stands out through its peculiar but enchanting art style and its acid trip sort of stories and presentation.\r\nPeople's evil thoughts and feelings are merged with demons, or Mononoke, giving them power and a goal of destruction. The main character, the medicine seller, which is in fact some sort of exorcist, has to find out the Form, Truth and Regret of each Mononoke in order to vanish them from the human realm. The show is episodic and formulaic with arcs lasting 2 to 3 episodes.\r\nFinding out the Form, that is, the type of the Mononoke, really has no meaning whatsoever but usually comes after afew people get killed in some odd supernatural ways. This would be horror if you'd have a reason to care for those characters, but these get introduced only to be killed. Thus the suspense of this show is instantly gone. What is left is the mystery.\\n\\n\r\nA few more rather insignificant people will have to die to find out the Truth, which will basically shed some light over the person which the Mononoke tries to avenge. This is slightly less boring, as we will finally get some information and a bit of story. The pacing, however is still rather slow, characters will lie about their true past, hide information, multiple characters will be asked multiple questions or put to the test in some way until the last one finally breaks.\\n\\n\r\nAfter one breaks, all the rest will fall like dominoes, and eventually we will find out exactly what happened, what is the reason the humans had those feelings which empowered the Mononoke. This is always a tragic reason that hits quite hard, thanks to some believable set-ups. It will always reveal the psychotic side of us and thus also provide a moral to the arc.\\n\\n\r\nMononoke is mediocre during 2 out of 3 parts of each arc but the general aesthetics and the endings of each arc will make up for it, just not enough to make it a \"great anime\". The horror has no impact, but I didn't judge it based on that, it's just so you know that this won't scare you, even if it is labeled as horror.",

            "content": "Horror can take many forms. In this day and age, it seems like a relentless, blood lusted slaughter, jump scares abound, and stories that don't really matter, so long as the content tries to shock or scare people.\r\n   Let's look at it in another light. I myself am quite neutral to such things, but I can understand when the constant barrage of mediocre sameness can get... Tiring..... Mononoke is simply wonderful, for how it manages to be scary, calming, thoughtful, disturbing and artistic without ever seeming forced.\r\n   The series is composed into several short tales. The takes consist of the curiousMedicine Seller, an intriguing man who for the most part, lies in much mystery, and who carries a sword, something only Samurais do during the time period he is in.  If you are expecting to have in depth back story for this character, then you will be sad to find that there really isn't any. To the characters credit, however, they are themselves quite fascinating, and that air of mystery surrounding the character does work more for them then against, as much as I would have liked to know more about such a person.\\n\r\n   The main characters in each tale, however, will have enough back story covered for them to give then a motive and a reason for what they have done and are doing. The stories have a theme going through them, in a sense that the Medicine Seller has to get rid of demons, essentially, in a certain way. He cannot go in and kill them straight out with his sword. He must find answers to certain driving forces before he has the ability to use his weapon. This mechanic is essentially the driving narrative of the show, helping us explore the characters and what is happening around them.\\n\r\n   Now, onto the driving visuals for the show, as it were...It just looks.... So.... Stunning! Have you ever seen chiyogami paper? Those incredibly colorful sheets full of intricate patterns, high detail, and have a variety of designs to show? Do a google search, I insist. The show doesn't hold back at all in coloring its peculiar eastern folklore inspired world with as much style as it can do. This even extends to the characters, as most everyone besides the Medicine Seller himself looks rather...Off. The protagonist himself is quite handsome in a way, especially when compared to everyone else. Whether this is a way to drive home the point that he is quite unusual, or that everyone else is rather odd is up to interpretation. He contrasts so much with everyone that he almost seems like he doesn't fit into the show, which helps contribute to the bizarre feel of the series.\\n\r\n   The music fits the atmosphere perfectly to what is happening at a given moment. It is gentle when needs to be, and thunderous when required. The opening is both fitting to the feel of the show and somehow feels not quite right. Give it a few listens and decide yourself.\\n\r\n   The animation itself is quite good. While you won't be seeing the most amazing action sequences and such, it can boost it up when it really needs to, and the amazing style really helps in this department. You'll be going back to some scenes again because you had missed something previously.\\n\r\n   The biggest complaint I really have for the show is that...It isn't long enough! Honestly, it is a shame that such a wonderful anime only gets a mere 12 episodes. This would seem more fitting for a 20-ish series, and even an average of a 50 ish episode anime wouldn't be a bad choice, considering that the show can do so much with the creativity it has available to it. I will admit that this show would not be to everyones tastes, however, so as usual, the most profitable audience is the every person audience, something that this show isn't likely to garner to. A  minor complaint is never finding out much about our intelligent...Protagonist. The Medecine Seller is a good blend of calm, humorous and observing. The things he can do is also worth a look into, and to what exactly he is. Due to the short nature of the show, it doesn't feel like we got...Burned, as it were. The mystery of him does add to the intrigue, after all. \\n\r\n    This series receives a marvelous score of 9. Watch it when you can, and buy it if possible. If more people discover this secretive jewel of the anime world, perhaps more people would open up to the possibilities of anime being an excellent storytelling medium.\\n",

            "content": "The only thing I regret about Mononoke is the fact that we get to know next-to-nothing about the Kusuriuri. I guess that mysterious side is what makes him particularly charming in the end, but I would have loved to know more about his innermost motivations and his \u201chuman\u201d side; his own Form (well, we get to see some of it\u2026), Truth and Regret, quoting his own words. We only get a few hints through some scattered misogynistic remarks and, above all, that moment in episode 4 where he kind of confesses what he fears the most. And if you stop to think, being such atranscendental, existentialist confession it actually could have turned out to be a hell of a horrific psychological moment among those we come across throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, Mononoke is one of the most unjustly overlooked and underrated anime masterpieces ever. Everything about it is absolutely mesmerizing, and particularly the fact that it's a weird mixture of different styles, elements and genres but it manages to pull it off with such artistry and skill that it keeps you glued to the screen. That psychedelic, James Bond-ish intro; the storytelling, staged as a traditional Japanese theater piece \u2013traditional Japanese musical instruments and grotesque supporting characters included-; those colorful, hallucinatory settings, something you wouldn\u2019t expect at all when watching a horror tale series, but that ends up making total sense with those trippy nightmarish vibes and those four-walled spaces; and that protagonist\u2026 a guy who\u2019s like an H\u00e9rcules Poirot, a brilliant detective of the supernatural\u2026 just extremely enticing in terms of visuals (plus Takahiro Sakurai\u2019s amazing dubbing, which helps conveying half of the character\u2019s mysterious personality). \\n\\n\r\nIf you look for something different in anime every now and then, something a little more challenging, watching this is absolutely mandatory. Besides, it\u2019s just 12 episodes long -12 episodes that have you begging for more-, so there\u2019s no excuse whatsoever not to watch it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "It's a very interesting serie for every fan of horrors. It's continuation of last story from anime \"Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror\" made because of number of fans of main character - Ksuriuri.\r\nFirst thing which you see is art. At start it can be difficult to watch because, to be honest, it's weird. For sure someone was hay or drunk, that would be your first thought. But it's very importatnt part of it. Colours, shapes and everyting... It's scary even when you don't think about plot. Colour are light, but sometimes disturbing. Bacgroung tends to move, when characters are not, face are expressive. It's like intraditional Japaneese paintings. It is impossible to describe by words.\\n\\n\r\nPlot. In this anime are four or five short two- or three-episode stories, every one with diffrent characters, problem and place. The only one which you always see is Ksuriuri, someone whose aim is killing a kind of demons called \"mononoke\". To kill them he needs to know how they were created, how they look and what happened in the past - than he can do something more. He's more a viever than anything else and he doesn't really participate in fights and problems till end. He's trying to find answers and persuade people to admit what happened. Episodes mostly focus on those stories, psychology of characters and their motives. You dive deep into human psyche to find out what's in there.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a scary anime, so if you don't like stuff like this don't even start it. But it's a very, very good anime. Masterpice for me, fan of horrors. Oh, and if you don't like controversial (I hope I wrote it correctly?) topics you can omit first case. I can't tell what is it about, but at first it shocked me a bit and it can discourage you to watch the rest of them.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nI wasn't a fan of opening at start, but know I think taht it's really good (and even more insane that rest). I don't really care about music, so I won't tell much, expecially that I know nothing about this topic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter.\\n\r\nI've already spoken about Ksuriuri, so here I'll tell something about otehr characters. They seem to be real, they have feeling and you can really understand why they did something and how they did feel. This anime is basicly about them - mononoke is created by human feelings so that is the main subject.\\n\\n\r\nSo I can honestly tell that it's amazing, and worth of spending time watching it.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for mistakes, but English is not my first language. Please, forgive :) If you notice any, don't hestitate and write me about it.",

            "content": "Okay, so I had been putting off watching Mononoke for a long, long time. I watched the first episode at the suggestion of a friend, thought it was cool, and put it on my list of things to watch. Big mistake! I wish I had watched this anime years ago because it is so, [i]so[/i] worth the watch. Easily one of the best anime I've seen in a long time.\r\nStory: So, the way the story works is that it centers around the adventures of the Medicine Seller as he travels around exorcising evil mononoke. The series is slightly episodic in that there's no overarching plot,so much as a set of five mini-arcs that are each about two/three episodes long. This might sound boring or not worth the time to those who prefer plot and long story arcs, but don't be mistaken: despite the mini-arc aspect, each arc is extremely interesting and each has its own unique plot with twists and turns the whole way through. It really keeps the viewer guessing right on the edge of their seat. Honestly, to me, it was excellent. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I've seen some comments that the art is off-putting to viewers, but for me, I thought this was absolutely beautiful, based off of classic Japanese artowrk. It's a completely unique style that I've never seen before. My sister who watched the series with me said that it reminded her of a moving story book, and I think that this is quite accurate. Honestly, for me, the artwork was one of the best parts of the series, and I absolutely adored it. Even if it's off-putting at first for those who aren't expecting it, I think you'll come to appreciate it in the end. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The music, too, is extremely nice. Much of it is classic Japanese style, and it really aids in the development of the story and the suspense of the viewer. Really top notch; I loved it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Each mini-arc has its own unique set of characters for the most part, with the only constant being the Medicine Seller. That being said, I think that this helps to maintain the mystery surrounding the various stories, and despite the short presence of each of the characters, they go through almost as many changes as the plot does, so it's all very dynamic. Also, the mystery surrounding the Medicine Seller himself is very helpful to the story, because while watching, I often found myself wondering if he really was a 'good' guy. Just watch the series and you'll see what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nI think by now if you're still reading this review, you can surely tell that I greatly enjoyed this series. I really wish that I had watched it sooner instead of putting it off, because I really think it's great. I pretty much found myself watching it all in one sitting because I couldn't bring myself to stop. Very riveting. Overall, I'm rating this one a 10 out of 10.",

I don't mind horror so much but I needed a little bit of thriller and decided to watch this.\r\n(I know nothing about that which this was adapted from, keep that in mind)\r\nThe story is mainly unified through the main character when he finds business to do, in other words it's almost like an episode to episode story. Each individual story has a specific universal theme attached to it and sub characters in a predicament. \r\nThe art style was beautifully done! The 3dcgi goes virtually unnoticed because of the unique style of bright colors(however this is also a tiny bit of a set back because it's hard to process what's happening sometimes). The backgrounds and effects really added to the mystery aspect and often make you go \"now wtf is going on here???\". Despite the often grotesque scenes, the style and choice of color really make it into its own work of art. It made me hard to believe I was even watching a horror anime at times! The fight scenes (or \"final boss\" type scenes) were very creative; it made you feel everything that was happening! The music was typical for the genre but I liked the way traditional Japanese music was incorporated into it to give you that kind of experience. Characters change with almost every story. The character design made me think of something from the 90's cartoons and along with the color style, it added a bit of a retro (yet very modern) feeling. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I seriously enjoyed this show. It felt like the kind of show where if it was a long time runner, you would always be able to enjoy it and probably never be dissatisfied. \\n\\n\r\n\u2014review number 7 (\u00b4\uff65u\uff65`)",

This anime is quite creative, it combines artistic experimentation, historical content*, mystery (ect.) all in a very unique mix. It left me wanting more, gladly i didn't know about the prequel!\r\n*I love the end-episode notes some of them have\r\nI'm not much of a reviewer.

Can i just say.. i'm jealous of the creator of Kusuriuri?\\n\r\nThe opening/ending themes are kinda different in aesthetics than the rest of the show, which -although i'm not sure i'm a fan of- still remains unique and creative (bit overdone for me, but it's 10 yrs ago, those people were bold and daring / something that is absent from many shows nowadays).\\n\\n\r\nAfter the final episode & Kusuriuri's last words.. I have to do some self-research, it was striking to me, X'D\\n\\n\r\nOverall -& this might be too bold to say- Mononoke is one of these anime series that if i was told \"as long as you watch only these series it will continue airing\", i would actually consider it.

If you have watched \"Ghost Hunt\" they somewhat belong in the same category, but this one uses abstract imaging in order to portray something of the past.\r\nDespite the Medicine Man(not even sure if he is human) being the main protagonist. We really never know much about him since the story focus on him, but rather his adventures to rid spirits or bring them to rest. This makes him one of the favorite characters in which he always brings about a mysteriousair especially when he turns into his other \"self\".\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing is the perspective of life in anime. No matter who or what, the story always tries to give them solace. In some way its a feel good anime, but in a horrifying, brutal fashion. At the very end, there will always be death, but the Medicine Man calms them so they can go on the afterlife.",

            "content": "Mononoke\r\nThis anime is truly something on an entirely different level. No silly, it\u2019s not Princess Mononoke from Studio Ghibli, it\u2019s on a different spectrum of anime! Mononoke is harrowing, scary, intense and one of the best visual experiences I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019m going to have trouble explaining it, because honestly, even after a week has passed since I\u2019ve seen it, I still can\u2019t make out what the heck I just watched.\r\nBefore I even begin, Mononoke follows the tales of someone called the Medicine Seller and yes, that\u2019s the only name we\u2019re ever given throughout the 12 episodes, he sells medicine, buuuut not at all. Theformat of Mononoke mimics that of Mushishi and even the Medicine Seller reminds me of Ginko. It\u2019s not episodic, it\u2019s more like\u2026. Arc-based, some arcs last two episodes, others last three, so I can\u2019t call this format of anime episodic at all. Medicine Seller travels to places where he believes Mononoke reside in, similar to how Ginko travels the world and helps out people with Mushishi problems; though the stark difference is that with Ginko, we sort of have an idea about the resounding world, in Mononoke however, Medicine Seller just appears at these places (As in, the episode already starts with events in motion).\\n\\n\r\nSo Medicine Seller is a Ginko type of person and the world isn\u2019t really explained. On top of all this the Medicine Seller himself is rather strange, he chooses his words extremely carefully, to the point of only saying a few phrases, at most a couple paragraphs an episode, honestly, the guy just doesn\u2019t talk much. He\u2019s also unfazed by the events that occur around him and it\u2019s\u2026 so bad ass. The way he reacts to things is just astounding. So he\u2019s not really a Medicine Seller, in-fact he seems hell-bent on destroying Mononoke (I\u2019ll get to it in a moment, I promise!!), but for good reason. Mononoke, from what I was able to comprehend, are Ayakashi that have latched onto a human emotion\u2026. or rather, a specific emotion that is incredibly strong, like deep hatred, regret and things like that (all dark emotions). Now the Ayakashi, from what I was able to understand, are like demons, they\u2019re powerful, similar to gods, but not quite. Mononoke on the other hand are like Ayakashi, since they emerge from them, but they are considered god-like and could be considered above gods in power. Now not all Ayakashi are evil creatures, in-fact we meet one in the 2nd arc that starts on Episode 3, but\u2026. Well I\u2019ll let you experience that harrowing event.\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s even more interesting about this Medicine Seller is what he carries around with him, it\u2019s like a huge Medicine cabinet, but one of its\u2019 contents is a sword; more specifically the Sword of Exorcism; now this sword is super crazy, it requires three things about the Mononoke, its\u2019 true form, its\u2019 regret and its\u2019 truth, once all these things are known, the sword will unleash itself from its\u2019 own sheath and honestly\u2026. what happens when all those things are known, the way the sword looks, I\u2019ll just leave that for all you to witness and experience because it\u2019s craaaaazy. I was going to screen cap what happens to the Medicine Seller when these events occur, but that\u2019s a spoiler and should totally be experienced naturally without spoilers. It\u2019s not even explained what happens, the sword and the Medicine Seller; don\u2019t expect to know what the heck is going on, which is quite a shame because it would probably be mind shattering material.\\n\\n\r\nNow the stories within Mononoke are\u2026\u2026uhm\u2026\u2026 I can\u2019t even describe them. At first I thought they were Japanese legends or Japanese mythology or something, but doing some quick Google-fu, not much comes up. Like\u2026 I mean I was blown away at the contents that I witnessed. The first arc throws you into the world fast, the 2nd arc does some more exposition, but not enough at all and the consequent arcs just go crazier and crazier, I would honestly expect no one to really know what\u2019s going on. It looks like there are manga for this anime too, but I\u2019m unsure if things are better explained there too. It\u2019s not just the crazy stories, it\u2019s how they\u2019re solved/handled, now of course the Medicine Seller kills the Mononoke and he is 100% unfazed by the events; but he\u2019s not that important, it\u2019s the supports. These people have no idea what\u2019s going on and the way they\u2019re shown to us, eyes moving sporadically, shivering, gasping for air because of shock, sweat pouring down their faces, shivering in place, crying uncontrollably, it\u2019s harrowing, it\u2019s so ridiculous and I had full-body goose bumps throughout the entire anime, it gets even crazier and then my eyes tear up, like\u2026. What did I just watch? I had my brother watch the first arc\u2026\u2026\u2026 he came back with the biggest what the heck face in the world and that seems to be the norm.\\n\\n\r\nNow one of the best things about Mononoke is the absolutely insane art style it uses; it\u2019s drawn on what appears to be Rice Paper (not my words, my brother thinks this is the case). It\u2019s super unique because you can actually see the grains on the paper, like it looks hand-made and things. The colors are wild and the animation to go along with it is just as insane. Things like the snow and wind and rain are animated differently than you would expect. They\u2019re not realistically depicted in Mononoke, instead they\u2019re visualized in a way that you wouldn\u2019t ever expect; rain doesn\u2019t fall down straight, it goes down, wind blows a droplet so it takes a 90 degree turn to a new position and then continues to fall towards the ground, snow looks bizarre, the wind is visualized as air streaks accompanied by flowers; it\u2019s beautiful, but it has this Mononoke darkness looming over it. I normally don\u2019t do this, but I feel like I should when I talk about art styles, I\u2019ll have a few samples from Episode 3 below, to show off what I mean about this insane style for art, it\u2019s jaw dropping-ly good and 100% the most unique type of art I have ever seen, like\u2026 ever.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Mononoke is\u2026. well it\u2019s what you\u2019d expect from an anime that has an arc about \u2026. Ahhh I wish I could tell you. It\u2019s spine tingly good, it\u2019s somber and dark, but somewhat soothing and smooth. The instruments, the overall choreography of the music and the animation/scenes that we witness, it aligns so freaking well. I have no words, expect the sound design in Mononoke to send chills up your spine, I\u2019m almost positive it will happen. The OP is good, but it\u2019s the ED I really like; I\u2019ll just leave a link of the ED here for you all to listen =).\\n\\n\r\nI was told about Mononoke a long while ago about an anime that was different from anything else, so off base from what you\u2019d ever watch and honestly, it is just crazy. From what I can tell, (thank you Wikipedia), Mononoke is a spin off series from a horror series titled Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales, and after watching Mononoke, I\u2019m pretty sure I need to watch this one too. I will tell you right now, your head will spin trying to understand what\u2019s going on with the story, but watching some of the earlier episodes again, Mononoke has so much detail in the words and backgrounds and actions of the characters that if you really pay attention, you might be able to figure out the plots really early on, but honestly, you\u2019ll be caught off-guard and stay off-guard. It\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s ridiculous and it is by far a most definite must watch for people looking for something not moe, not cute, no lolis and something rather serious. (Just watch something happy and cute after this)\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: Holy crap, I didn\u2019t research the word Ayakashi until just now\u2026.. it is based on Japanese Mythology and\u2026. yeah supernatural monsters and things, so holy crap at that.\\n",

            "content": "Right off the bat, the art in this series blew me away. It is visually stunning, and the soundtrack goes perfectly with the style. There are small arcs taking up 2-3 episodes at a time. Really, each arc could be one episode, but the slow pace paired with the art style makes it extremely suspenseful, and well worth the wait. The style make take a little getting used too, there are a lot of colors and patterns going on in each frame.\r\nThis is definitely a series for patient people, as conclusions only come every few episodes, and there is a lot of waiting involved asfar as when the viewer receives information. There are twists and turns to each storyline, and each arc involves digging under the surface of the characters and scenery. Each episode has many layers.\\n\r\nThe characters in each arc are compelling and believable. All the characters seem to be flawed, and I wouldn't say there are any heroes or villains, the monsters in this kind of exist outside of good and evil. \\n\r\nIt's worth taking a look at if you enjoy visual art and creepy stories.",

The plot and symbology of the first two episodes dealing with a monster spawned of abortions is fascinating and hard to interpret (the girl is depicted as stereotypically foreign, but with one ambiguous exception, not the slightest reference or explanation is made to that), but that art style...! It's not too great in motion, but the backgrounds are beautiful. In general, it's as if _Gankutsuou_ and _Mushishi_ had a bastard love-child. Didn't think much of the fox arc, and the ghost cat storyline isn't impressing me, but the nue/incense story was pretty nifty.  And now both story arcs featurebirth body-horror! What the heck. o.0 _Mononoke_ was pretty excellent, but never quite made it to a 9 or 10, I think.",

            "content": "You'll hardly find an anime that is as difficult to grasp than Mononoke. The very concept is hard to understand, from the requirements of exorcism to each act's storyline. Nonetheless, it is exactly this intricate, dreamy insanity and the seemingly incohesive plot that makes Mononoke one of a kind. What happens if you get Expressionism and Symbolism and ask some Japanese masterminds to animate the quintessential allegory of them? You'd have this. I can't think of a better definition of visual avant-garde.\r\nThe storyline (for each act) is generally really great, and for as much as the nuances most likely won't be understood by non-genius viewers(such as me) right away the narrative as well lessons can be understood if you pay attention. The art is simply put fantastic. The sound is good, but it deserves 8/10 thanks to the Chorinho-inspired intro song. The characters are the high point of the anime, as the Medicine Seller slowly crawls through the psychological insanity of each seemingly sane character, and we are left with a completely naked, primitively emotional creature. We see their motivations, their hopes, their dreams, their suffering, exactly how they are, and not how they pretend it to be. The Medicine Seller's apathetic approach is really important so we can see the characters REALLY showing their faces: they're not angered because the Seller said something mean, they're angered because that's their state of spirit. They're not sad because The Medicine Seller mocked of them, they're sad because that's what they are. Spoiler: The Medicine Seller is OP. Honestly, the objective of the anime really isn't to be \"action\" in any way so his ridiculous One Punch Man-esque invulnerability is a mere plot device that makes no different (unless you're expecting some shonen action). I really enjoyed the anime, and I think it's worth the flawless 10/10.",

I actully read the manga but  it doesn't update i was hoping to learn his origin how did he get his powers ... The only problem in the anime is that we need moreinformation because people  get confused... But the visual is beautiful!! it's original to see how they put the past, present and flashback in a single scene..\\n\\n\r\nbut this Anime is good! we i need to watch more anime like this :)",

Ma ny countries in asia including japan are almost all have mystical beliefs,history and even supernatural peoples and that kind of things are still debated until today by scientists ppl claims that every supernatural,mystical events must be have some science explanations. And mononoke displaying a good example of those paranormal events its hard to understand and its cant not logical. Sometimes i dont understand some of the mystery or the riddles too but this anime plot are deep, the cases can be unlogical but and leave a question marks in the end but this anime is amazing and maybe will be one of the most epic mystery anime u'll ever see(if you're a mystery genre fans)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10/10",

            "content": "Like any anime first impressions are everything, Mononoke does not fail in this regard.\r\nMononoke is about a traveling 'medicine-man' who's integrity out weighs any Seinen character I've ever seen. The story is tale-by-tale so you can watch it in any order. \r\nA fair warning, if you're looking for something conventional, this anime is not for you. Mononoke is like watching a painting, the unconventional art-style will have you reeled in for more; the studio did not squander their budget. \r\nThere is little character development as the show itself focuses on the main protagonist, but side characters are noted for being memorable. \r\nTL;DR\r\nUnconventional art-style, physiological thriller.\r\nThisis not a horror.\\n\r\nHighly recommend.",
