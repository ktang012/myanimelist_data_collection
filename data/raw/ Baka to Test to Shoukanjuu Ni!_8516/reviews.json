            "content": "Updated up to the Final Episode!\r\nBaka to Test to Shokanjuu Ni! where to start... Haha. After I saw the first season when it came out I was left wanting more. What with the unique battle system they have in the series and the amazingly hilarious cast of characters, I totally wanted another season, and here my prayers were answered with another season of Baka!\r\nStory:\r\nNot really sure how to describe the story, there is a story behind it all, its just overshadowed by the fact that the anime is hilarious at every turn. Its not the main drive for the anime, the characters interactions and hilaritydrive the show. This season actually did have more story elements in it than the last though, and it was pretty well written, becoming quite emotional at some points as we learn about how Minami falls for Aki and how Shouko fell for Yuuji. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI love the character designs in Baka, especially since they are able to make a wonderful mix of amazingly cute chibis to MEGA SERIOUS FACE transitions superbly. The chibis are used during discussions between the characters at some points and of course during summon battles where their summons are actually the characters themselves chibi-fied and armored. This season also threw in one last artistic win with the final two episodes changing the summons into a Halloween-esc theme, with the summons ranging from headless to vampires to brick walls!\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nI didn't really like the Opening and Ending for this one. Compared to Season 1 and the OVA Opening and Endings this was subpar at best. They aren't catchy or memorable like the others and you can't really say, \"Oh my god, another musical ear worm from Baka!\". Though as the season went on the OP and ED did become an earworm to be honest. I guess it was the kind of music you had to listen over and over to to become addicted, not sure if its a good or bad thing. The soundtracks in the background were also fantastic, especially in the episode about Minami's past.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI love the characters. They have a little bit of everything in this anime! Aki is the idiot that all animes need (He might just be a little to idiotic sometimes). But when push comes to shove he always come through like a true anime idiot does! Yuuji is the total badarse of the anime, with the epic character design and attitude to go with him. Mutsurini... I love Mutsurini, he is an idol to all men everywhere, he's a ninja, photographer and somehow he's a pervert that girls don't hate. I want him to teach me his ways. Hideyoshi the trap... He never gets old, right from the get go they still won't let him be a boy, and honestly, it never gets old. Then the girls themselves are amazing as well. Minami is amazing with her tough attitude and abuse of Aki. Himeji is the shy girl that turns into an evil demon when things go wrong (evidence = end of episode one). Shoko.... She terrifies me with how she abuses Yuuji, honestly, I think she could kill us all. I love it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWell if it isn't obvious yet I love Baka to Test to Shokanjuu Ni!. The second season is everything I wanted it to be, with its hilarity, serious moments, cross dressing, and idiocy! What more could I ask for? (Maybe some moar Mutsurini awesomeness... The show might implode if we get too much though. I thought it was going to implode, freaking assassination's he pulled this season were epic!)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm sittin' here waiting for more episodes because honestly, nothing will stop me from watching this amazingly hilarious anime that is Baka to Test!",

            "content": "Baka to test to shoukanjuu 2 was a worse scam than when I sell ice lollies made of my own frozen piss to children on my street for 5 dollars as \u201clemon flavour\u201d\r\nno fuck that, it was like when I sell my patented \u201ccancerbegone\u201d drug to terminally ill patients for their life savings. It was that bad, I mean the first series of Baka to test to shoukanjuu was no work of art but it had its good moments, it could be funny and clever with some interesting ideas like the whole battling thing and the division of classes based on test scores, there wasroom for some potential there.\\n\\n\r\nBut this sequel just threw all that out the window in favour of a story-less, plot-less, one dimensional, boring Harem with nothing more than episode after episode of unoriginal rom-com stuff that we've seen a million times  before, you know what I mean, with misunderstandings between the main character and the girls and more shots of  female characters bodies than you'd find in a playboy magazine, in fact one of the best ways to describe this series would be as a fucking Hentai without the sex.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen I looked closely I discovered that this series is a good example of so many romance comedy  sequels out there that I felt sick, where after the first series is successful because of its good ideas or good characters etc they for some reason abandon all that in the sequel in favour of whats called the \u201csafe route\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nThe safe route basically means taking no risks by insuring the sequel will make money from DVD sales and toys by appealing to the Otaku types. Those who spend tons of money on shit like this with ridiculous amounts of fan service to appease theses dumb idiots that think that a series is good as long as it has cute girls in it. Other good examples of this is Nisemonogatari and Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu 2  both of these sequels to relatively good and okay animes were total scams where no thought at all was put into them, (see my Nisemonogatari review for more details) they are just there as manufactured scams to make money by tricking people into thinking that what they're watching is a sequel when really its just a colourful mishmash of crap.\\n\\n\r\nNow maybe you think im being to harsh, you say, \u201cits not supposed to have a deep story\u201d, or \u201csome people just like to watch cute girls do cute things and don't want anything more from an anime.\u201d To that I say \u201cthat's fine,\u201d I also didn't expect a moving story from this anime or deep characters and some fan service is nice, its good to be able to shut off my brain from time to time and just watch a dumb love comedy with summoned beings in it. \\n\\n\r\nBut this just went too far with the complete lack of any kind of story or character development and throwing all the stuff that made the first series good out the window, right next to my stock of piss flavou... I mean lemon flavoured ice lollies. If you would like one please email me at www.thisisdefiantlynotascam.co.fuckyousucker  \\n\\n\r\nto make matters worse they continually repeat the same jokes over and over again..  example...\\n\\n\r\n guy and girl A are doing something, accidentally get in a provocative position, girl B walks in, sees this and gets angry, chaos ensues.   lather, rinse, repeat.        \\n\\n\r\nGuy says something, girl misunderstands, gets angry.   Lather, rinse, repeat,  \\n\\n\r\n\u201cdon't worry the audience wont notice if we use the same jokes again and again, just throw in a shot of some girl breasts and they'll forget all about, it doesn't matter about originality as long as the girls say something cute or we see their panties then it all good. Don't worry i`ve made tons of this shit, we can slap the story together in an afternoon, throw in some scenes of a girl blushing and we`ll make millions, who gives a fuck about art, as long as we can sell lots of crappy merchandise and I can buy myself a new boat then alls right with the world.\u201d        \\n\\n\r\nNow its not all bad there were still some good elements in this series, despite the overuse of some jokes there was still some funny moments here and there and we do learn some things about the past of some of these characters, and if you like cute anime girls doing cute but pointless things then this series may appeal to you. There some okay music and some nice art here and there but nothing really to right home about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would only recommend this series to die hard fans of the original or to people that really just want to see big breasted girls say cute things and flat chested girls do violent things, if your looking for a good romance comedy with a good story or good comedy then look else where.\\n\\n\r\nIf you click this review was helpful I promise to send you one of my new chocolate flavoured ice lollies (chocolate not guaranteed) in the mail or my new \u201ccancerbegone\u201d spray tan, for people who want to look good while they die. (warning \u201ccancerbegone\u201d may cause cancer)",

Forget the subtleties, plot development, give the people what they want, and that is a good laugh. Slapstick, foreshadowing, innuendo, its all there. I can sit here and comment on all of the tiny things that make Baka great, but its pointless unless you've seen it yourself. This is my third time watching the entire series, and I have cracked up laughing during every single episode. The only problem with the anime is that there aren't more. Why won't you give us more?????!!!! Overall greatanime. The plot line is very random and if youve seen season 1, nothing really changes. Akira and Minami are still going at it, but its still hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nThat's about it, go watch it now. Best continuous anime out.",

            "content": "I'm going to go ahead and say it. Baka and Test is DEFINITELY my favorite anime. Tons of colorful characters, comedy, and story. \r\nSeason 2 was mostly about character development rather than keeping up with the story, but that's not a bad thing. Some shows don't do character development without terrible terrible filler. Some don't at all!\r\nStory: 10 \r\nSeason 2 focused more on developing the characters through individual stories than one full story throughout the season, BUT they did it right. Baka and Test Shokanjuu Ni incorporates excellent use of story arcs within it's episodes to keep the audience from that \"filler\" feeling. From crazybeach days, to Minami's backstory, to peeking into girls' bathing rooms, this season took it around and back.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nOnce again the animation is amazing. It retains that manga feel to it with it's \"pop-art\" look. The movement of the characters is smooth, and the detailed and whacky expressions of the characters in \"extreme\" times for them really show us what the animators can do. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe voice acting in this season (I'm referring to the Japanese voice acting) is greatly improved from the first. It's much more believable and adds a whole lot to the humor. As for the English Dub, it's not set to release until early 2013, but fingers crossed for it to be just as good or better than the fantastic first season. To go along with great voice acting, season 2 adds a whole new soundtrack of music to play through the series, ranging from epic battle themes to soft romantic jingles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nYou gotta love it when writers dedicate time to letting the audience know about a show's characters, without giving you a filler feeling. In the first season you got a feel of who the characters were and a general understanding. In this season you get a full on background check on several characters, and their motives to do what they do. As always we have a wonderful variety of characters in personality and looks, always a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nYES. If I wasn't entitled to write more for the sake of potential viewers that's all I'd write. Simply yes, I enjoyed it. Take time to understand the systems in the show and what's going on and who the characters are, I admit it can be random, but once you get a feel for who is who and what is what, you'll love the show to no end. (To be honest its really not that hard, but I've known people who don't even try). There's also so many characters in this show, you're bound to relate to one of them and say \"Hey that's me!\" and put yourself in their world if only for a minute. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10:\\n\r\nWATCH IT. Watch it, enjoy it, and don't read online reviews from critics that don't enjoy a show for what it is, and instead pick it apart by flaws that don't matter in the long run. (Just look at Pokemon -__-) \\n\\n\r\nI don't recommend it if you don't like to laugh. (Ha)\\n\\n\r\nIt's a nice blend of action, highschool life, just the right amount of fan-service (nothing over the top), comedy, and more all in its own unique way!\\n\\n\r\nHere's hoping for a 3rd season and more, just get it marketed damn it! :D\\n\\n",

Well, here's my review for this anime.\r\nBaka and Test: Summon the Beast 2, or Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni!, is one of the greatest anime I've ever watched. If you guys watched School Rumble, Angel Beats, or Lucky Star, then you would most likely enjoy school comedies. Baka and Test basically exceeds those three previously mentioned. It reaches to new heights with it's amazingness. There is so much to talk about with this anime.\r\nLet's begin with the story. The story is easy to keep up. It also had some funny moments, which I shallnot mention. It kept me laughing. There was no dull moment in this anime. You could be in the worst mood possible, and watching one episode of this anime will get you excited.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so respectable. It is hard to find one that you cannot respect, and even if you do find one that you can't really respect, it'll be one small issue at best. I never found a characte that I can't respect; they're all enjoyable in their own way. The anime's uniqueness comes from the characters, but not just them.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is catchy. Once I heard them, I just kept listening to them. I don't really care that they're in Japanese. It's just so uplifting.\\n\\n\r\nThe art's well done. The characters all look nice. The scenery is also nice. I don't think that they had the background characters with bo eyes and the back-background characters as dotted cardboard cutouts, as composed to season one when they did. It's not that that is an issue, but it's still an art design, right?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\u2026 if I had to sum it up in one go, it'll go like this:\\n\r\n\"This is the greatest anime I've ever watched; the characters are funny and a bit goofy in a good way, the jokes never get old, and you could keep watching this anime over and over again.\"\\n\r\nThat's the simple way, but you get the picture.\\n\\n\r\nAll and all, the anime is a must watch. I give this anime a 10/10. Like I said, it is funny as all hell. If you haven't seen this anime yet or haven't wayched it in a while, stop reading this and go watch it! I highly recommend this to you all. Why? Well, the biggest reason isn't mentioned above. It's really how there is something for EVERYONE to enjoy.",

They were fast, they were fluid, they showed off a lot of what to expect from the characters without giving away the plot (well... what little plot there was). I even caught myself laughing at some of the imagery in OVAs opening, and that was a first as far as openings go. The second seasons opening just feels like a drag. The music is much the same as its predecessors, but the images are just so dull. Still shots, and random images of items that are somewhat connected to the show (like a nail bat, or that fox doll thing that minami has). It was just a bit of a bore, after how fun the first 2 openings felt is all... but again its just an opening so the show can't really lose any marks for it. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, on to the actual meat of the series. Baka to test to Shokanjuu... was never really a series that strong in plot. It was a fairly mindless rom-com... but it certainly had a lot more going for it than this season did. It had an overall goal to say the least... The down trodden F class is sick of being considered the scum of the earth, and needs to work its way up the intellectual ladder to show that they aren't any less human than anyone else, by beating the top of the school class A. It was simple but effective, and even helped learn us a lesson: Just because your grades are bad, doesn't mean you can't achieve greatness. \\n\\n\r\nBut season 2 is... well... really just a bunch of filler stringed together. I kid you not, the first not 1, but 2 episodes open with a \"beach\" episode (you know... that episode thats in almost every rom-com, where they go to the beach really just as an excuse to show off the main female in a bikini). It actually takes until episode 4 before you even see the little summons, and thats really in a filler episode as well. In fact, they avoid having tests and summoned beings in the show so much, that I kind of wonder why they didn't just call the season \"Idiots\". Anyways, while Idiots doesn't really have any one big plot to string the series together like the first season did, it does have a variety of sub plots that span over 1 - 3 episodes, so its not totally without merit. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing that really bugs me about this second season is that it really seems to be trying to alienating a good portion of its fan base. Since a sequel will primarily be aiming at current fans of the show, it should aim to build up what it already established and improve the formula that apparently worked out the first time. Instead, Idiots seems to take the show in a different direction. The first season was a light hearted comedy, with a touch of romance and a little bit of tactical warfare. Season 2 on the the other hand... is really looking to be more of a romance with some comedy filler put in here or there. \\n\\n\r\nNow there's nothing wrong with that formula either, in fact the first season had some rather touching and more serious moments to it as well. However... it never did this at the expense of comedy. This is again, because the first season WAS a comedy, it made sure every episode was a laugh, and added those little touching scenes as a drizzle of caramel on top of the already delicious chocolate fudge sundae. Idiots however, decides to put romance on equal grounds to comedy. There are a couple episodes that are almost devoid of comedy actually, and look more like something I would see in Ef - a tale of memories rather than a show that has \"Idiots\" in the freaking title. \\n\\n\r\nIn any case, none of the above grievances really makes Idiots a bad show. I would prefer a more linear story like the first season but its not totally necessary. The characters are more of the same, if you liked 'em in the first season, you'll still like 'em here. The show does suffer a tiny bit from the usual trap that sequels fall into... that is over abusing certain popular aspects or quirks of characters to the extreme (like always making Akihisa cross dress... it was funny in the OVA but if you keep making it a running gag it loses the charm) but its not enough to really do any harm. The art is still really really nice to look at, although with today's sophisticated technology that doesn't really say a lot since looking nice is easier than ever. The comedy... while a lot more sparse than the first season, is still relatively funny. My only problem was that it was a more generic rom-com style comedy, where as I feel the first season had a bit of a more unique sense that made it stand out as an anime. \\n\\n\r\nReally, to sum up, Idiots just shouldn't bear the Idiots and Tests and Summoned Beings name. On its own its a pretty solid anime, the comedy again holds up fairly well, and I was even fairly touched by some of the character back stories. It's just that it's too different from the original... and I felt a little betrayed is all. If it had been its own series I probably would have felt a lot kinder to it. I feel like a child whos been hoping and asking for a new set of roller blades all year long... but when christmas comes round I get a pogo stick. Sure its fun at times and I found a few new things to do I didn't know about before... but its just not what I hoped for. Oh well, its fun enough for now... maybe next christmas.",

            "content": "This is only my second review so please leave  some feed back and rate the review if you read it!\r\nStory: 7\r\nFor the most part the show is what you would expect from Baka and Test, light hearted silly and fun to watch with loads of comedic tid bits that will have \"ROFLing\" your ass off, but with more to it this time around.\r\nThe series starts where it left off, a weak (Story wise) love triangle between Akihisa, Minami, and Himeji that is and really isn't the main focus of the show. However this season changes that a bit in the second half and givesus the much needed character development that was virtually (More literally) nonexistent in the first season. During these episodes we learn a lot more about the characters pasts which makes the triangle more interesting and is definitely paving the way for a third season.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately there are some problems with it as well. The main one being the arc centered around peeping on the girls. It lasted way too long and should have been at least an episode shorter. It simply didn't bring much value to the show as a whole, and to me felt like a filler arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is my favorite part of the show, everything from all the various character designs to the sometimes simple, but unique backdrops. The entire style of this show is just fun to look at and really fits the mood of the show. I'm particularly fond of the way they treat the shading by putting little circles inside everything in the backgrounds. Animation is solid and consistent throughout the entire show and never fails to just look good and fluid. Simply put I think this show looks awesome and have yet to adore any other show as much as this.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nI'm a dub fag so please forgive me dub haters but it is what it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe dub for Baka has always been good to me, and it definitely has one of the better dubs that much is for sure. The cast sounds pretty decent without any (Maybe one or two) annoying sounding characters, and all the voices fit the characters pretty well. The music in the show however is really nothing special; in fact I can't even recall any BGM that I can even replay in my head which is a little disappointing because I felt the music for the show could have been great given the art style.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are nothing that special either but that's really just personal preference more than anything. I will say that the ending is fun to watch though and grew a little on me after I had watched it a few times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe cast itself is not very large compared to some shows and is relatively easy to follow, relate to, and recognize at a moments notice. Each is designed very well and look great. The only problem is other than the main characters not much is discovered or explored in the way of back story or development. Many of the characters just always act the same as they have and don't really change. Which given the show is mostly a comedy is not necessarily a bad thing either. Each brings their own amount of oomph to certain jokes in the series, but I felt they could have explored the others, at least some; a little bit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to not enjoy this show there is plenty of comedy (Most of which is slightly clever, but not as much as the first season.) to keep you laughing and character development is never a bad thing as far as I am concerned. Everything looks great and sounds good so there's nothing distracting and it's just an overall good experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nBaka and Test is just an all around good show with a lil\u2019 of something for almost everybody. It looks great and has a wide variety of comedic elements that can really make you laugh and it's at times hard to stop watching. Even when it gets serious about its characters they find a way to keep it light hearted and yet still emotional while being fun to watch. I think if you sat down and watched it with a close friend you would have an unforgettable time laughing it up just as I did with season one. This is one of those must try series that almost everyone can enjoy and it\u2019s not very long so you have nothing to lose giving it a try.\\n",

            "content": "A lot of times, the second season is not really as good as the first one but not here. Everything is just the same fun as the first season and it doesn\u2019t really get old at all. Some jokes are played off but they put it a little different so it feels new. Some of it actually becomes even funnier because of Yoshii\u2019s sister playing more of a role in it.\r\nAgain, the show follows the characters and actually doesn\u2019t really have much of the avatar battles that I would have liked to see more of. I feel that they sort of skipped out a biton the battles again. If the name has summon the beasts in it, wouldn\u2019t you think that they would have more of the beasts in it instead of a romantic comedy?\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes do have a lot more about romance and what the characters are feeling to one another to a point you think it would end up having an explosive ending that would shock you. I can\u2019t tell you if it does because of spoilers but it\u2019s what I felt around the 5th episode. Other then that, pretty much the same as the first season with every once in a while having battles. I guess the one thing that seems different is that there is a lack of main story that the first had with them trying to help Mizuki by getting better items. This one has more of a by episode comedy skit sort of style to the story that can get from really strange to just a average day in the park.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one character that does make a bit more of an appearance in this sequel then in the first, Aiko Kudou. Surprisingly I like her being brought in and being sort of the rival of Kouta in a sense. She teases him so much that I have a small feeling that she likes him a bit more then she lets on to prove even a pervert can be loveable if stupid enough. Ok\u2026 so I\u2019m making a small exaggeration but it gives us another romance train to look at. Before this, the only romance trains we had going was Yoshii\u2019s triangle with Mizuki and Minami and then Yuuji\u2019s problems with Shouko. To have a bit of different love train going on does keep the show refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nNow if only we could get an actual girl for Hideyoshi\u2026 of course I know that probably will never happen because the writers are having way to much fun with the idea that Hideyoshi being mistaken for a girl all the time. If this was real life I would feel very sorry for him but as its not, the yoai lover in me screams for that idea.\\n\\n\r\nNow do you have to watch the OVA before the second series? No but you will miss so many things if you don\u2019t they do occasionally talk about what happened during them.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation is the same as before though they do a lot more pastel scenes then before. It doesn\u2019t bother me much since the comedy kept me laughing. I am also not really happy about how Hideyoshi keeps talking in a Shakespearian tone. I liked the way he spoke in the English version instead. The \u2018thou\u2019 and \u2018aren\u2019t\u2019 just bother me and make me feel like I\u2019m reading Romeo and Juliet, not watching a Japanese comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is just as good as the first again, a rather good beat although I don\u2019t know if I would put it on a ipod. It can get a little annoying to listen to it over and over again. The ending song isn\u2019t really that special, pretty much blends together with all the other pop songs that are used in anime. This isn\u2019t dubbed so the voices kind of made me cringe a little. Some of the girls voices just felt a little two high pitched.",

Of course Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni! didn't fail at delivering those funny knacks and beautiful animation the first season portrayed.\r\nStory:9/10\r\nAlthough there isn't a major storyline in the series it still kept me on my toes. Few bits of piecesmay have needed some more thought into it but overall I loved it. Even without a storyline it was extremely funny and an anime for anyone to watch. \\n\\n\r\nArt:10/10\\n\r\nThe art of the anime was still amazing, maybe even better than the prequel. It maintained that modern art mixed with pop-art, and the chibi forms of the characters were superb (and cute if I may add :p). The animation of the movements and action scenes were detailed and crisp.. *applause*\\n\\n\r\nSound:10/10\\n\r\nAs always, the voice actors for each character in Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni! played their roles perfectly. I was happy to see they kept the same voice actors from the first season because I couldn't, or should I say wouldn't, picture them with different voices at all. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10/10\\n\r\nIn this anime we see more character development which is wonderful seeing how each character in the anime is unique through numerous displays action and humor. I know for sure that I instantly loved each character in the anime and I know you will too :)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nBaka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni! has gotta be one of the funniest and most entertaining series I have watched. Not once did I think about dropping or changing to a different anime. It's also easy to relate with and maybe you might even find a character that you can see yourself as.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10/10\\n\r\nFor anyone who is looking for laughter and a hint of romance and action then this is the anime you need to watch...screw it, I recommend this to anyone and everyone (but if you really hate comedy, then too bad.. watch it :p)\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of my favourite series and I would watch it over again if i ever get bored or if it's just a Friday night.\\n",

            "content": "Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni! follows up the first season with pretty much more of the same. If you liked the first installment, you'll probably like the second too. Nothing really changes, but they do add some more serious episodes. \r\nThere's no real story in the show. The premise is that students from 6 classes (A to F) can have battles with each other using summoned monsters. The skill of the monsters are based on that student's score in whatever subject the current judging instructor teaches. \r\nThe characters are the same from the first season, as are the gimmicks and jokes around them. However,as mentioned earlier there are types of \"origin\" episodes for a few cast members which sheds more light on their personalities. These seem a little out of place with the comedy in the series, but helps to add depth. Each of them are especially thoughtful and touching. Something you would expect to see from a show like Clannad. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you're looking for progression with things like the Aki love triangle (err Pentagon?) or the Yuuji/Shouko relationship you'll probably be disappointed. Except for using the situations to make uncomfortable and hilarious moments, it gives little in the way of seeing an end to show. (Which is good and bad.)\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen the first season then you'll be able to spot most of the jokes coming from a mile away. Ni does not really break any ground in originality. However, the execution for the humor is great. The show manages to tell the same joke 100 times, but they do it in 100 different ways. Don't worry everything is back from nose bleeds, cross dressing, and the class F single army. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Baka To Test Shoukanjuu Ni! is an excellent follow up to the first season. Despite the shortcomings, it manages to be a hilarious, yet thoughtful show that makes the grade. \\n",

            "content": "A perfect 10 ^_^\r\nI watched the first Baka to Test and when I heard they were making a season 2, I got excited instantly! And it was worth the wait. Right from the get-go it was great. Watching the first episode of the second season reminded me why I feel in love with this anime so much. I laughed so hard watching the first episode. This anime is not to be take literally in any way. Its a goofy, silly, with some what romance thrown in to it and it works perfectly. Heck if it ain't broken don't fix it right. \r\nThe first couple ofepisodes, I want to say 6 or so episodes, don't take place in the high school. The first 3 episodes take place on a beach trip and the other 3-4 episodes take place in a training school. Then its back to its roots. \\n\\n\r\nBut the main reason to watch Baka to Test is for the characters. How each one of them interacts with one another is whats the anime a must watch. The episodes are filled with jokes that will make you laugh and even some call back referencing things that happen in the ova's or in the first season, which makes some jokes even better. I love the relation ship between Shouko and Yuji, they might even be the best couple ever... even if Yujj doesn't want to be with her.^_^  But to be truly honest I love the narration more then anything, well that is for the English dub, with his wise crack remarks and and comments make watching even better. Hes the bow on the present so to speak makes it just a tad better. All the original charters are still here, the truly lovable Hideyoshi with his devilish female body, and Akihisa the dumbest main character ever who has two beautiful female after him, the athletic and yet charming, Minami, and who could forget the pink haired, bombshell, Mizuki which Akihisa doesn't get that they love him.This time around there is more of a love story toward the end that will make you rip out you hair leaving you with no answer on who he want to be with but I hope he gets with Mizuki, shes just so cute ^_^ as of now there is no word of season 3 but I'm crossing my fingers on this one, this story is nowhere close to done\\n\\n\r\nThe art style from the first season is still the same. Which isn't a bad thing. The back round has a feel good feel to it where  shadows are so post to lie it colored in by green, red, blue, etc with poke-a-dot pattern. When large crowds are on scene only a few of them are drawn and the rest are outlined and filled in with this pattern. Which is new idea and an easy way to cut corners and ends up being very created and you end up loving this shadow pattern.Same as in the original Baka to Test the intro song is amazing along with the video, not as good as the original, but still good. The ending song and video are well done and is worth watching every time.  \\n\\n\r\nI don't think I can explain how enjoyable this is to watch. Its nonstop fun from the beginning to the end after the credits are done and even then the last key after that the \"Next time on...\" is really funny to hear with the narrator asking a character a question and them getting it wrong. and hearing \"This is will be on the test\" has already became iconic to me like Funimation \"You should be watching\". Its a must watch to all anime lovers out there. It might look like a average high school Anime but I can tell you, you have been fooled this is a one of a kind anime that you wont get the same satisfaction in other high school anime. THIS IS NOT LIKE OTHER ANIME'S!!!  \\n\\n\r\nDon't forget to hit that \"Helpful button\" if you found this helpful in any way so others can find this review. Don't be afraid to send me a message if you want to talk more about this anime or had any comments with my review. ^_^",

So there is no story, drawing and story is just okey, characters are boring stereotypes.\r\nWell if you like simply animes then you gona like it then you gona enjoy this but be warned, Dragon Balls is very complicated compared to this anime.",

The art was perfect and the music was great including the ending song which I listened to a lot of times. \r\nThe cast really spend time with each other, getting to know one another and share the bonds together. Even including the Yukata contest where the guys make funny poses and WOW! I cannot stop laughing. Even especially, like love interests sometimes they might fall apart due to one mistake. Yuuji and Shoko started to love each other when they were kids and I was so sad tosee that Yuuji protected Shoko from the bullies but he ends up getting beaten. \\n\\n\r\nI loved the part on episode 4 where Himeji asks the guys to taste her food and they freaked out. Even also the part on where the summoning portal. When the person says \"Summon\", the little guy speaks on his/her true intentions.\\n\\n\r\nThe haunted place in the final episode is the epic moment where Akihisa & Yuuji defeated the 3A class. This also shows that even though they have poor grades, that doesn't mean they are complete washouts. They can excel in some things way better than those who have good grades.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character still remins as Hideyoshi Kinoshita. As stated in my previous review on Baka & Test: Matsuri\\n\\n\r\nI do believe that this is also a good lesson to learn that even though your grades may be low, you are still a brighter genius. Grades don't distinguish a person's character which is a statement which I will never forget.\\n\\n\r\nI will give it a perfect score of 10/10.",

            "content": "[I haven't finished all of the episodes yet so this review is up for change]\r\nBaka to Test to Shoukanjuu is a hit-or-miss series, depending on whether you enjoy the humour or not.\r\nAs someone who's quite tired of harem anime and the cliches that come with it, I wasn't really looking forward to getting into this anime. However, once I got started, I found out my worries were for nothing: sure, there are quite a few cliches in this show. All of them get blown up in such a way, however, that the show basically turns into one big joke.\r\nWhile the first season mainly focused onthe battles, for me, the second season felt like it needed the first season in order to properly introduce the characters of the show so that the second season could be all sexually tinted jokes. At this point in the show, not much of  a plot remains. Instead, you watch the wacky cast of characters interact with each other in settings that result in jokes that work surprisingly well, even for someone who's done with the harem genre. The show goes as far as to ridicule its own stereotypes, which makes it even better.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, typical tropes can be recognized in most of the characters. This might be a bother to some people, but I found the way the anime handled them and the way they got implemented quite refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is very unique and recognizable thanks to its use of colors and its use of patterns in the background, such as stripes and polka dots. Your eyes certainly won't be disappointed!\\n\\n\r\nThe music fits each scene really well, and the opening and ending theme also fit the anime, with their catchy sounds sticking around in your head for days after you've seen an episode. It really gives the anime an extra boost.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're here for an anime with a story, you're probably better off watching something else. However, if you're looking for a good laugh, you don't mind the cast of characters shamelessly exploring their newfound sexual desires and you just want to have a few hours of fun, you should definitely give this anime (and its prior season) a go.",

            "content": "This anime is pretty average (or below average) in all aspects, but it manages to somehow be charming enough that it no longer matters whether the technicalities are good or not. Somehow, it's refreshing and funny in a way that's difficult for shows nowadays. \r\nTo begin with, this season has even less of a story than season one. At least in season one, there was somewhat of a point to what was happening and some sort of build up and climax. In this season, it's become short story arcs, each one spanning over a couple of episodes. Somehow, the lack of an overarching plot (otherthan the overly cliche romance) didn't make it boring. It was still fun and engaging without occupying my mind for the whole day. It was laid back, to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was nothing special. I really liked the popart shadows, but other than that, everything was pretty average and simple. Nevertheless, it was appealing to the eye because it was bright and fun to look at. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also nothing special, though the special effects noises and the gag background music were a special treat. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty cliche, but there are some things I appreciated. I loved the character development between Shouko and Yugi. Even if Aki wasn't as developed, he was still a fun main character mainly because he's unfathomably dumb. Also makes him pretty relatable. ;D I liked the character development with Minami as well, but all the other characters remained as flat stereotypes for the most part, even if that was a little fun to watch still. \\n\\n\r\nI think the main selling point of this series was the interactions of the characters. Their dynamic and the way the plot is constructed around them really made the monumental difference in this being a success or failure.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I enjoyed this far more than I thought I would. I'm not sure what made me want to pick this up (it really isn't my type of show) but I'm really glad I did! \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if you: would like to see a stupid version of Assassination Classroom, like dumb characters, like the idea of harems, don't mind repetitive jokes, like running gag jokes, think oblivious characters are funny\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if you: require variety in your comedy, prefer intellectual jokes, don't like running gags/repetitive humor, prefer satire\\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

            "content": "My first review, let\u00b4s go!\r\nAh, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni!\r\nMore of the same? Or something completely different?\r\nSome might say that it's one or the other, I myself say that it's both at the same time.\r\nThis will be a retrospective on the second season of Baka to Test, and will contain little to no spoilers, so let's dive right into it.\r\nBaka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni! is just like it's first season a true comedy. And it very much stays in the roots of the genre. The amount of jokes thrown at the viewer is very high, and just like the first season of highquality. All the jokes used in the series get refferenced or come back multiple times, and that was made the first season very great. As where a lot of people would agree that the jokes are being reused like the knife and fork you use each and every meal, I actually think this is a good thing. Because it works. Truelly this is a matter of oppinion, but I quite like the jokes.\\n\r\nDuring the first two episodes you can emidiately notice that the creators tried to get even new viewers up to date with the characters and with the jokes from the first season so that anyone can jump in and enjoy the fun. Because essentially that's all this anime is. Fun. Or atleast that's what it was in season one.\\n\r\nWhat I really did not expect from the anime is the amount of background story they add to a lot of the characters. I will not say which characters get their own \"arcs\" but I will say that it greatly improves some of the characters, whereas you wouldn't normally understand why they act in a certain way or why they feel like they do. And this give the anime a lot more depth then it had in season one, which to everyone who watched the first season is quite shocking. And I personally like that. Speaking of character developement.\\n\r\nAll the characters from the first season are back, and none get added, this means that the anime spends most of it's time building on the already existing characters and this makes for quite a good amount of character developement. Not only on a personal level, but also on a more social level. A lot of characters have had their role thrown all over the place, whereas Yoshi's sister used to have a pretty decently sized role, she now only has about 20 lines of dialogue. And characters like Hideyoshi and Voyeur have been greatly build opon and improved. Again, I like this. Especially Voyeur, who went from being a supportive character to being an actual main character, and man he has been improved. And so has Hideyoshi.\\n\r\nAs you may have noticed, I have paid little to no attention to the female characters yet (apart from Hideyoshi) and this is for a very good reason.\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, but the girls get a lot better of a role in season two. In season one they were kind of there and did not really accomplish much, this has totally made a 180\u00b0 turn. They become much more relevant to the plot and the actual overal experience, which in my oppinion should've been done in season two.\\n\r\nAnother welcome addition to the series is how not everything takes place inside of the school anymore and I like how the plot has been greatly improved. What am I saying, I like how there IS plot now. And that makes it already a lot more interesting to watch.\\n\r\nThe art and animation has also had an incredible boost in quality. This is very noticable and just like the first season fits the show perfectly. You can truely see how much it has improved in the character specific episodes how much effort they put into them, just from the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nYou might ask yourself this: \"Is it truely without flaws?\" And, well... no. Offcourse not. No show is without flaws. However, all the flaws that there were in season one have been pollished and refined. The episodes aren't as repetitive anymore, the story is actually there and most importantly, the characters actually have something about themselves to say, a story to tell, sometimes even quite literally.\\n\r\nThe only actual flaw that I DID have with the anime is how it sometimes feels that the show is flying all over the place, especially in dialogue. There's not much transition between events and some stuff it just flat out skimmed over. But I guess this can be forgiven because at heart, this anime is and stays a comedy for viewing pleasure only.\\n\\n\r\nSome people might say they were disapointed with the second season, and I can see why you would think that, if you like change. But honestly, the formula worked great, so there is no need for any change.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with those words I leave you with my thoughts on Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni!\\n\r\nWhich is in my oppinion worth watching.\\n\\n\r\n- The Randor69",

It doesnt get as stale.\r\n+ The Art design was very appealing (SO MANY COLORS!!!)\r\n+ I didn't have any problem with any of the performances (except one). Even the supporting cast was great. Trina Nishimura and Todd Haberkorn both have small but enjoyable parts. Plus I like how Brina Palencia practically has half an episode to herself :P\r\n+Haunted House arc.\\n\r\n(Personal) + I really dug the amplified romantic element :3\\n\r\n(Sp)+ That one joke with Minami summoning during the Haunted House arc almost killed me\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- There's almost little to no cohesive plot in this season. Ultimately, it just feels like a filler season.\\n\r\n- The sequencing and format of episodes. Some episodes were split in two, some episodes have arcs(The peeking one dragged a bit for me personally), episodes of Exposition were introduced, and the everything about it all felt scrambled.\\n\r\n- The Backstory episodes completely felt out of place. (Sp) Not a fan of the German accent.\\n\r\n- Moments of serious tone can take you out of it sometimes.\\n\r\n- Sadly, Summoner Test Wars are used as a gimmick......... once again\\n\r\n(personal) - Akihisa Yoshi, GAWD YOU ARE SO DENSE!!! Making male otaku rage!\\n\\n\r\nFinal Note: Don't consider this season of Baka and Test as one that would focus on plot, but one that focuses on amplifying it's already present humor. In that sense, it succeeds in vibrant colors.\\n\\n\r\nRecommends: To those who really enjoyed the humor of the first Season.",

(What those are is up to you to find out.) And the anime did not cover all of the light novel. Nevertheless, Baka to Test is still one of the best anime out there, and is a classic must-watch. The review will be based solely on the anime.\r\nStory - 10\r\nBaka to Test has a very interesting premise: a school where you \"fight\" for your classroom status based on your score tests. Thatin itself was enough for me to grab this anime to my watch list. The story has a nice plot twists on it. Very humorous. The side stories does not bore you, and develops the characters thoroughly.\\n\\n\r\nI have no negative thoughts to say.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nWasn't good nor bad. Just average, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nAwesome VA. Good OP and ED. My fave: Getsuyuo wa Kirai (OVA ED)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nNice lineup of characters. Each one of the usual cast is more or less developed, and suits the series well. Each one has uniqueness. They were able to enhance the beauty of the already good premise, which led to a well-told story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nI can't help but enjoy this. High rewatch value.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nI'd say: YOU ARE MISSING OUT A LOT IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED BAKA TO TEST!\\n\\n\r\nWhy not 10? Unfinished.",

            "content": "Updated up to the Final Episode!\r\nBaka to Test to Shokanjuu Ni! where to start... Haha. After I saw the first season when it came out I was left wanting more. What with the unique battle system they have in the series and the amazingly hilarious cast of characters, I totally wanted another season, and here my prayers were answered with another season of Baka!\r\nStory:\r\nNot really sure how to describe the story, there is a story behind it all, its just overshadowed by the fact that the anime is hilarious at every turn. Its not the main drive for the anime, the characters interactions and hilaritydrive the show. This season actually did have more story elements in it than the last though, and it was pretty well written, becoming quite emotional at some points as we learn about how Minami falls for Aki and how Shouko fell for Yuuji. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI love the character designs in Baka, especially since they are able to make a wonderful mix of amazingly cute chibis to MEGA SERIOUS FACE transitions superbly. The chibis are used during discussions between the characters at some points and of course during summon battles where their summons are actually the characters themselves chibi-fied and armored. This season also threw in one last artistic win with the final two episodes changing the summons into a Halloween-esc theme, with the summons ranging from headless to vampires to brick walls!\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nI didn't really like the Opening and Ending for this one. Compared to Season 1 and the OVA Opening and Endings this was subpar at best. They aren't catchy or memorable like the others and you can't really say, \"Oh my god, another musical ear worm from Baka!\". Though as the season went on the OP and ED did become an earworm to be honest. I guess it was the kind of music you had to listen over and over to to become addicted, not sure if its a good or bad thing. The soundtracks in the background were also fantastic, especially in the episode about Minami's past.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI love the characters. They have a little bit of everything in this anime! Aki is the idiot that all animes need (He might just be a little to idiotic sometimes). But when push comes to shove he always come through like a true anime idiot does! Yuuji is the total badarse of the anime, with the epic character design and attitude to go with him. Mutsurini... I love Mutsurini, he is an idol to all men everywhere, he's a ninja, photographer and somehow he's a pervert that girls don't hate. I want him to teach me his ways. Hideyoshi the trap... He never gets old, right from the get go they still won't let him be a boy, and honestly, it never gets old. Then the girls themselves are amazing as well. Minami is amazing with her tough attitude and abuse of Aki. Himeji is the shy girl that turns into an evil demon when things go wrong (evidence = end of episode one). Shoko.... She terrifies me with how she abuses Yuuji, honestly, I think she could kill us all. I love it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWell if it isn't obvious yet I love Baka to Test to Shokanjuu Ni!. The second season is everything I wanted it to be, with its hilarity, serious moments, cross dressing, and idiocy! What more could I ask for? (Maybe some moar Mutsurini awesomeness... The show might implode if we get too much though. I thought it was going to implode, freaking assassination's he pulled this season were epic!)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm sittin' here waiting for more episodes because honestly, nothing will stop me from watching this amazingly hilarious anime that is Baka to Test!",

            "content": "Baka to test to shoukanjuu 2 was a worse scam than when I sell ice lollies made of my own frozen piss to children on my street for 5 dollars as \u201clemon flavour\u201d\r\nno fuck that, it was like when I sell my patented \u201ccancerbegone\u201d drug to terminally ill patients for their life savings. It was that bad, I mean the first series of Baka to test to shoukanjuu was no work of art but it had its good moments, it could be funny and clever with some interesting ideas like the whole battling thing and the division of classes based on test scores, there wasroom for some potential there.\\n\\n\r\nBut this sequel just threw all that out the window in favour of a story-less, plot-less, one dimensional, boring Harem with nothing more than episode after episode of unoriginal rom-com stuff that we've seen a million times  before, you know what I mean, with misunderstandings between the main character and the girls and more shots of  female characters bodies than you'd find in a playboy magazine, in fact one of the best ways to describe this series would be as a fucking Hentai without the sex.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen I looked closely I discovered that this series is a good example of so many romance comedy  sequels out there that I felt sick, where after the first series is successful because of its good ideas or good characters etc they for some reason abandon all that in the sequel in favour of whats called the \u201csafe route\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nThe safe route basically means taking no risks by insuring the sequel will make money from DVD sales and toys by appealing to the Otaku types. Those who spend tons of money on shit like this with ridiculous amounts of fan service to appease theses dumb idiots that think that a series is good as long as it has cute girls in it. Other good examples of this is Nisemonogatari and Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu 2  both of these sequels to relatively good and okay animes were total scams where no thought at all was put into them, (see my Nisemonogatari review for more details) they are just there as manufactured scams to make money by tricking people into thinking that what they're watching is a sequel when really its just a colourful mishmash of crap.\\n\\n\r\nNow maybe you think im being to harsh, you say, \u201cits not supposed to have a deep story\u201d, or \u201csome people just like to watch cute girls do cute things and don't want anything more from an anime.\u201d To that I say \u201cthat's fine,\u201d I also didn't expect a moving story from this anime or deep characters and some fan service is nice, its good to be able to shut off my brain from time to time and just watch a dumb love comedy with summoned beings in it. \\n\\n\r\nBut this just went too far with the complete lack of any kind of story or character development and throwing all the stuff that made the first series good out the window, right next to my stock of piss flavou... I mean lemon flavoured ice lollies. If you would like one please email me at www.thisisdefiantlynotascam.co.fuckyousucker  \\n\\n\r\nto make matters worse they continually repeat the same jokes over and over again..  example...\\n\\n\r\n guy and girl A are doing something, accidentally get in a provocative position, girl B walks in, sees this and gets angry, chaos ensues.   lather, rinse, repeat.        \\n\\n\r\nGuy says something, girl misunderstands, gets angry.   Lather, rinse, repeat,  \\n\\n\r\n\u201cdon't worry the audience wont notice if we use the same jokes again and again, just throw in a shot of some girl breasts and they'll forget all about, it doesn't matter about originality as long as the girls say something cute or we see their panties then it all good. Don't worry i`ve made tons of this shit, we can slap the story together in an afternoon, throw in some scenes of a girl blushing and we`ll make millions, who gives a fuck about art, as long as we can sell lots of crappy merchandise and I can buy myself a new boat then alls right with the world.\u201d        \\n\\n\r\nNow its not all bad there were still some good elements in this series, despite the overuse of some jokes there was still some funny moments here and there and we do learn some things about the past of some of these characters, and if you like cute anime girls doing cute but pointless things then this series may appeal to you. There some okay music and some nice art here and there but nothing really to right home about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would only recommend this series to die hard fans of the original or to people that really just want to see big breasted girls say cute things and flat chested girls do violent things, if your looking for a good romance comedy with a good story or good comedy then look else where.\\n\\n\r\nIf you click this review was helpful I promise to send you one of my new chocolate flavoured ice lollies (chocolate not guaranteed) in the mail or my new \u201ccancerbegone\u201d spray tan, for people who want to look good while they die. (warning \u201ccancerbegone\u201d may cause cancer)",

Forget the subtleties, plot development, give the people what they want, and that is a good laugh. Slapstick, foreshadowing, innuendo, its all there. I can sit here and comment on all of the tiny things that make Baka great, but its pointless unless you've seen it yourself. This is my third time watching the entire series, and I have cracked up laughing during every single episode. The only problem with the anime is that there aren't more. Why won't you give us more?????!!!! Overall greatanime. The plot line is very random and if youve seen season 1, nothing really changes. Akira and Minami are still going at it, but its still hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nThat's about it, go watch it now. Best continuous anime out.",

            "content": "I'm going to go ahead and say it. Baka and Test is DEFINITELY my favorite anime. Tons of colorful characters, comedy, and story. \r\nSeason 2 was mostly about character development rather than keeping up with the story, but that's not a bad thing. Some shows don't do character development without terrible terrible filler. Some don't at all!\r\nStory: 10 \r\nSeason 2 focused more on developing the characters through individual stories than one full story throughout the season, BUT they did it right. Baka and Test Shokanjuu Ni incorporates excellent use of story arcs within it's episodes to keep the audience from that \"filler\" feeling. From crazybeach days, to Minami's backstory, to peeking into girls' bathing rooms, this season took it around and back.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nOnce again the animation is amazing. It retains that manga feel to it with it's \"pop-art\" look. The movement of the characters is smooth, and the detailed and whacky expressions of the characters in \"extreme\" times for them really show us what the animators can do. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe voice acting in this season (I'm referring to the Japanese voice acting) is greatly improved from the first. It's much more believable and adds a whole lot to the humor. As for the English Dub, it's not set to release until early 2013, but fingers crossed for it to be just as good or better than the fantastic first season. To go along with great voice acting, season 2 adds a whole new soundtrack of music to play through the series, ranging from epic battle themes to soft romantic jingles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nYou gotta love it when writers dedicate time to letting the audience know about a show's characters, without giving you a filler feeling. In the first season you got a feel of who the characters were and a general understanding. In this season you get a full on background check on several characters, and their motives to do what they do. As always we have a wonderful variety of characters in personality and looks, always a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nYES. If I wasn't entitled to write more for the sake of potential viewers that's all I'd write. Simply yes, I enjoyed it. Take time to understand the systems in the show and what's going on and who the characters are, I admit it can be random, but once you get a feel for who is who and what is what, you'll love the show to no end. (To be honest its really not that hard, but I've known people who don't even try). There's also so many characters in this show, you're bound to relate to one of them and say \"Hey that's me!\" and put yourself in their world if only for a minute. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10:\\n\r\nWATCH IT. Watch it, enjoy it, and don't read online reviews from critics that don't enjoy a show for what it is, and instead pick it apart by flaws that don't matter in the long run. (Just look at Pokemon -__-) \\n\\n\r\nI don't recommend it if you don't like to laugh. (Ha)\\n\\n\r\nIt's a nice blend of action, highschool life, just the right amount of fan-service (nothing over the top), comedy, and more all in its own unique way!\\n\\n\r\nHere's hoping for a 3rd season and more, just get it marketed damn it! :D\\n\\n",

Well, here's my review for this anime.\r\nBaka and Test: Summon the Beast 2, or Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni!, is one of the greatest anime I've ever watched. If you guys watched School Rumble, Angel Beats, or Lucky Star, then you would most likely enjoy school comedies. Baka and Test basically exceeds those three previously mentioned. It reaches to new heights with it's amazingness. There is so much to talk about with this anime.\r\nLet's begin with the story. The story is easy to keep up. It also had some funny moments, which I shallnot mention. It kept me laughing. There was no dull moment in this anime. You could be in the worst mood possible, and watching one episode of this anime will get you excited.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so respectable. It is hard to find one that you cannot respect, and even if you do find one that you can't really respect, it'll be one small issue at best. I never found a characte that I can't respect; they're all enjoyable in their own way. The anime's uniqueness comes from the characters, but not just them.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is catchy. Once I heard them, I just kept listening to them. I don't really care that they're in Japanese. It's just so uplifting.\\n\\n\r\nThe art's well done. The characters all look nice. The scenery is also nice. I don't think that they had the background characters with bo eyes and the back-background characters as dotted cardboard cutouts, as composed to season one when they did. It's not that that is an issue, but it's still an art design, right?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\u2026 if I had to sum it up in one go, it'll go like this:\\n\r\n\"This is the greatest anime I've ever watched; the characters are funny and a bit goofy in a good way, the jokes never get old, and you could keep watching this anime over and over again.\"\\n\r\nThat's the simple way, but you get the picture.\\n\\n\r\nAll and all, the anime is a must watch. I give this anime a 10/10. Like I said, it is funny as all hell. If you haven't seen this anime yet or haven't wayched it in a while, stop reading this and go watch it! I highly recommend this to you all. Why? Well, the biggest reason isn't mentioned above. It's really how there is something for EVERYONE to enjoy.",

            "content": "And so ends another season of the show with one of the most cumbersome names imaginable. Yes I'm not really sure a title would fly over here in the western hemisphere... what if shows like Lost were called \"Islands and Passengers and Smoke Monsters\"... but I digress. Yes Baka to Test to Shokanjuu (missing out on an excellent opportunity to call itself Baka 2 Test 2 Shokanjuu... provided it used the english pronunciation of the number 2... blah) has finally ended and its left... a strange taste in my mouth. Its definitely not what I expected from a Baka to season, so lets elaborate shallwe. \\n\\n\r\nLet me start for once with the OP of this season (how appropriate?). I normally don't care much about the opening of a series but this time was an exception. Baka to season 1... and even the ova, had 2 really fun openings. They were fast, they were fluid, they showed off a lot of what to expect from the characters without giving away the plot (well... what little plot there was). I even caught myself laughing at some of the imagery in OVAs opening, and that was a first as far as openings go. The second seasons opening just feels like a drag. The music is much the same as its predecessors, but the images are just so dull. Still shots, and random images of items that are somewhat connected to the show (like a nail bat, or that fox doll thing that minami has). It was just a bit of a bore, after how fun the first 2 openings felt is all... but again its just an opening so the show can't really lose any marks for it. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, on to the actual meat of the series. Baka to test to Shokanjuu... was never really a series that strong in plot. It was a fairly mindless rom-com... but it certainly had a lot more going for it than this season did. It had an overall goal to say the least... The down trodden F class is sick of being considered the scum of the earth, and needs to work its way up the intellectual ladder to show that they aren't any less human than anyone else, by beating the top of the school class A. It was simple but effective, and even helped learn us a lesson: Just because your grades are bad, doesn't mean you can't achieve greatness. \\n\\n\r\nBut season 2 is... well... really just a bunch of filler stringed together. I kid you not, the first not 1, but 2 episodes open with a \"beach\" episode (you know... that episode thats in almost every rom-com, where they go to the beach really just as an excuse to show off the main female in a bikini). It actually takes until episode 4 before you even see the little summons, and thats really in a filler episode as well. In fact, they avoid having tests and summoned beings in the show so much, that I kind of wonder why they didn't just call the season \"Idiots\". Anyways, while Idiots doesn't really have any one big plot to string the series together like the first season did, it does have a variety of sub plots that span over 1 - 3 episodes, so its not totally without merit. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing that really bugs me about this second season is that it really seems to be trying to alienating a good portion of its fan base. Since a sequel will primarily be aiming at current fans of the show, it should aim to build up what it already established and improve the formula that apparently worked out the first time. Instead, Idiots seems to take the show in a different direction. The first season was a light hearted comedy, with a touch of romance and a little bit of tactical warfare. Season 2 on the the other hand... is really looking to be more of a romance with some comedy filler put in here or there. \\n\\n\r\nNow there's nothing wrong with that formula either, in fact the first season had some rather touching and more serious moments to it as well. However... it never did this at the expense of comedy. This is again, because the first season WAS a comedy, it made sure every episode was a laugh, and added those little touching scenes as a drizzle of caramel on top of the already delicious chocolate fudge sundae. Idiots however, decides to put romance on equal grounds to comedy. There are a couple episodes that are almost devoid of comedy actually, and look more like something I would see in Ef - a tale of memories rather than a show that has \"Idiots\" in the freaking title. \\n\\n\r\nIn any case, none of the above grievances really makes Idiots a bad show. I would prefer a more linear story like the first season but its not totally necessary. The characters are more of the same, if you liked 'em in the first season, you'll still like 'em here. The show does suffer a tiny bit from the usual trap that sequels fall into... that is over abusing certain popular aspects or quirks of characters to the extreme (like always making Akihisa cross dress... it was funny in the OVA but if you keep making it a running gag it loses the charm) but its not enough to really do any harm. The art is still really really nice to look at, although with today's sophisticated technology that doesn't really say a lot since looking nice is easier than ever. The comedy... while a lot more sparse than the first season, is still relatively funny. My only problem was that it was a more generic rom-com style comedy, where as I feel the first season had a bit of a more unique sense that made it stand out as an anime. \\n\\n\r\nReally, to sum up, Idiots just shouldn't bear the Idiots and Tests and Summoned Beings name. On its own its a pretty solid anime, the comedy again holds up fairly well, and I was even fairly touched by some of the character back stories. It's just that it's too different from the original... and I felt a little betrayed is all. If it had been its own series I probably would have felt a lot kinder to it. I feel like a child whos been hoping and asking for a new set of roller blades all year long... but when christmas comes round I get a pogo stick. Sure its fun at times and I found a few new things to do I didn't know about before... but its just not what I hoped for. Oh well, its fun enough for now... maybe next christmas.",

            "content": "This is only my second review so please leave  some feed back and rate the review if you read it!\r\nStory: 7\r\nFor the most part the show is what you would expect from Baka and Test, light hearted silly and fun to watch with loads of comedic tid bits that will have \"ROFLing\" your ass off, but with more to it this time around.\r\nThe series starts where it left off, a weak (Story wise) love triangle between Akihisa, Minami, and Himeji that is and really isn't the main focus of the show. However this season changes that a bit in the second half and givesus the much needed character development that was virtually (More literally) nonexistent in the first season. During these episodes we learn a lot more about the characters pasts which makes the triangle more interesting and is definitely paving the way for a third season.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately there are some problems with it as well. The main one being the arc centered around peeping on the girls. It lasted way too long and should have been at least an episode shorter. It simply didn't bring much value to the show as a whole, and to me felt like a filler arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is my favorite part of the show, everything from all the various character designs to the sometimes simple, but unique backdrops. The entire style of this show is just fun to look at and really fits the mood of the show. I'm particularly fond of the way they treat the shading by putting little circles inside everything in the backgrounds. Animation is solid and consistent throughout the entire show and never fails to just look good and fluid. Simply put I think this show looks awesome and have yet to adore any other show as much as this.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nI'm a dub fag so please forgive me dub haters but it is what it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe dub for Baka has always been good to me, and it definitely has one of the better dubs that much is for sure. The cast sounds pretty decent without any (Maybe one or two) annoying sounding characters, and all the voices fit the characters pretty well. The music in the show however is really nothing special; in fact I can't even recall any BGM that I can even replay in my head which is a little disappointing because I felt the music for the show could have been great given the art style.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are nothing that special either but that's really just personal preference more than anything. I will say that the ending is fun to watch though and grew a little on me after I had watched it a few times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe cast itself is not very large compared to some shows and is relatively easy to follow, relate to, and recognize at a moments notice. Each is designed very well and look great. The only problem is other than the main characters not much is discovered or explored in the way of back story or development. Many of the characters just always act the same as they have and don't really change. Which given the show is mostly a comedy is not necessarily a bad thing either. Each brings their own amount of oomph to certain jokes in the series, but I felt they could have explored the others, at least some; a little bit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to not enjoy this show there is plenty of comedy (Most of which is slightly clever, but not as much as the first season.) to keep you laughing and character development is never a bad thing as far as I am concerned. Everything looks great and sounds good so there's nothing distracting and it's just an overall good experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nBaka and Test is just an all around good show with a lil\u2019 of something for almost everybody. It looks great and has a wide variety of comedic elements that can really make you laugh and it's at times hard to stop watching. Even when it gets serious about its characters they find a way to keep it light hearted and yet still emotional while being fun to watch. I think if you sat down and watched it with a close friend you would have an unforgettable time laughing it up just as I did with season one. This is one of those must try series that almost everyone can enjoy and it\u2019s not very long so you have nothing to lose giving it a try.\\n",

            "content": "A lot of times, the second season is not really as good as the first one but not here. Everything is just the same fun as the first season and it doesn\u2019t really get old at all. Some jokes are played off but they put it a little different so it feels new. Some of it actually becomes even funnier because of Yoshii\u2019s sister playing more of a role in it.\r\nAgain, the show follows the characters and actually doesn\u2019t really have much of the avatar battles that I would have liked to see more of. I feel that they sort of skipped out a biton the battles again. If the name has summon the beasts in it, wouldn\u2019t you think that they would have more of the beasts in it instead of a romantic comedy?\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes do have a lot more about romance and what the characters are feeling to one another to a point you think it would end up having an explosive ending that would shock you. I can\u2019t tell you if it does because of spoilers but it\u2019s what I felt around the 5th episode. Other then that, pretty much the same as the first season with every once in a while having battles. I guess the one thing that seems different is that there is a lack of main story that the first had with them trying to help Mizuki by getting better items. This one has more of a by episode comedy skit sort of style to the story that can get from really strange to just a average day in the park.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one character that does make a bit more of an appearance in this sequel then in the first, Aiko Kudou. Surprisingly I like her being brought in and being sort of the rival of Kouta in a sense. She teases him so much that I have a small feeling that she likes him a bit more then she lets on to prove even a pervert can be loveable if stupid enough. Ok\u2026 so I\u2019m making a small exaggeration but it gives us another romance train to look at. Before this, the only romance trains we had going was Yoshii\u2019s triangle with Mizuki and Minami and then Yuuji\u2019s problems with Shouko. To have a bit of different love train going on does keep the show refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nNow if only we could get an actual girl for Hideyoshi\u2026 of course I know that probably will never happen because the writers are having way to much fun with the idea that Hideyoshi being mistaken for a girl all the time. If this was real life I would feel very sorry for him but as its not, the yoai lover in me screams for that idea.\\n\\n\r\nNow do you have to watch the OVA before the second series? No but you will miss so many things if you don\u2019t they do occasionally talk about what happened during them.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation is the same as before though they do a lot more pastel scenes then before. It doesn\u2019t bother me much since the comedy kept me laughing. I am also not really happy about how Hideyoshi keeps talking in a Shakespearian tone. I liked the way he spoke in the English version instead. The \u2018thou\u2019 and \u2018aren\u2019t\u2019 just bother me and make me feel like I\u2019m reading Romeo and Juliet, not watching a Japanese comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is just as good as the first again, a rather good beat although I don\u2019t know if I would put it on a ipod. It can get a little annoying to listen to it over and over again. The ending song isn\u2019t really that special, pretty much blends together with all the other pop songs that are used in anime. This isn\u2019t dubbed so the voices kind of made me cringe a little. Some of the girls voices just felt a little two high pitched.",

Of course Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni! didn't fail at delivering those funny knacks and beautiful animation the first season portrayed.\r\nStory:9/10\r\nAlthough there isn't a major storyline in the series it still kept me on my toes. Few bits of piecesmay have needed some more thought into it but overall I loved it. Even without a storyline it was extremely funny and an anime for anyone to watch. \\n\\n\r\nArt:10/10\\n\r\nThe art of the anime was still amazing, maybe even better than the prequel. It maintained that modern art mixed with pop-art, and the chibi forms of the characters were superb (and cute if I may add :p). The animation of the movements and action scenes were detailed and crisp.. *applause*\\n\\n\r\nSound:10/10\\n\r\nAs always, the voice actors for each character in Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni! played their roles perfectly. I was happy to see they kept the same voice actors from the first season because I couldn't, or should I say wouldn't, picture them with different voices at all. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10/10\\n\r\nIn this anime we see more character development which is wonderful seeing how each character in the anime is unique through numerous displays action and humor. I know for sure that I instantly loved each character in the anime and I know you will too :)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nBaka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni! has gotta be one of the funniest and most entertaining series I have watched. Not once did I think about dropping or changing to a different anime. It's also easy to relate with and maybe you might even find a character that you can see yourself as.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10/10\\n\r\nFor anyone who is looking for laughter and a hint of romance and action then this is the anime you need to watch...screw it, I recommend this to anyone and everyone (but if you really hate comedy, then too bad.. watch it :p)\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of my favourite series and I would watch it over again if i ever get bored or if it's just a Friday night.\\n",

            "content": "Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni! follows up the first season with pretty much more of the same. If you liked the first installment, you'll probably like the second too. Nothing really changes, but they do add some more serious episodes. \r\nThere's no real story in the show. The premise is that students from 6 classes (A to F) can have battles with each other using summoned monsters. The skill of the monsters are based on that student's score in whatever subject the current judging instructor teaches. \r\nThe characters are the same from the first season, as are the gimmicks and jokes around them. However,as mentioned earlier there are types of \"origin\" episodes for a few cast members which sheds more light on their personalities. These seem a little out of place with the comedy in the series, but helps to add depth. Each of them are especially thoughtful and touching. Something you would expect to see from a show like Clannad. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you're looking for progression with things like the Aki love triangle (err Pentagon?) or the Yuuji/Shouko relationship you'll probably be disappointed. Except for using the situations to make uncomfortable and hilarious moments, it gives little in the way of seeing an end to show. (Which is good and bad.)\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen the first season then you'll be able to spot most of the jokes coming from a mile away. Ni does not really break any ground in originality. However, the execution for the humor is great. The show manages to tell the same joke 100 times, but they do it in 100 different ways. Don't worry everything is back from nose bleeds, cross dressing, and the class F single army. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Baka To Test Shoukanjuu Ni! is an excellent follow up to the first season. Despite the shortcomings, it manages to be a hilarious, yet thoughtful show that makes the grade. \\n",

            "content": "A perfect 10 ^_^\r\nI watched the first Baka to Test and when I heard they were making a season 2, I got excited instantly! And it was worth the wait. Right from the get-go it was great. Watching the first episode of the second season reminded me why I feel in love with this anime so much. I laughed so hard watching the first episode. This anime is not to be take literally in any way. Its a goofy, silly, with some what romance thrown in to it and it works perfectly. Heck if it ain't broken don't fix it right. \r\nThe first couple ofepisodes, I want to say 6 or so episodes, don't take place in the high school. The first 3 episodes take place on a beach trip and the other 3-4 episodes take place in a training school. Then its back to its roots. \\n\\n\r\nBut the main reason to watch Baka to Test is for the characters. How each one of them interacts with one another is whats the anime a must watch. The episodes are filled with jokes that will make you laugh and even some call back referencing things that happen in the ova's or in the first season, which makes some jokes even better. I love the relation ship between Shouko and Yuji, they might even be the best couple ever... even if Yujj doesn't want to be with her.^_^  But to be truly honest I love the narration more then anything, well that is for the English dub, with his wise crack remarks and and comments make watching even better. Hes the bow on the present so to speak makes it just a tad better. All the original charters are still here, the truly lovable Hideyoshi with his devilish female body, and Akihisa the dumbest main character ever who has two beautiful female after him, the athletic and yet charming, Minami, and who could forget the pink haired, bombshell, Mizuki which Akihisa doesn't get that they love him.This time around there is more of a love story toward the end that will make you rip out you hair leaving you with no answer on who he want to be with but I hope he gets with Mizuki, shes just so cute ^_^ as of now there is no word of season 3 but I'm crossing my fingers on this one, this story is nowhere close to done\\n\\n\r\nThe art style from the first season is still the same. Which isn't a bad thing. The back round has a feel good feel to it where  shadows are so post to lie it colored in by green, red, blue, etc with poke-a-dot pattern. When large crowds are on scene only a few of them are drawn and the rest are outlined and filled in with this pattern. Which is new idea and an easy way to cut corners and ends up being very created and you end up loving this shadow pattern.Same as in the original Baka to Test the intro song is amazing along with the video, not as good as the original, but still good. The ending song and video are well done and is worth watching every time.  \\n\\n\r\nI don't think I can explain how enjoyable this is to watch. Its nonstop fun from the beginning to the end after the credits are done and even then the last key after that the \"Next time on...\" is really funny to hear with the narrator asking a character a question and them getting it wrong. and hearing \"This is will be on the test\" has already became iconic to me like Funimation \"You should be watching\". Its a must watch to all anime lovers out there. It might look like a average high school Anime but I can tell you, you have been fooled this is a one of a kind anime that you wont get the same satisfaction in other high school anime. THIS IS NOT LIKE OTHER ANIME'S!!!  \\n\\n\r\nDon't forget to hit that \"Helpful button\" if you found this helpful in any way so others can find this review. Don't be afraid to send me a message if you want to talk more about this anime or had any comments with my review. ^_^",

So there is no story, drawing and story is just okey, characters are boring stereotypes.\r\nWell if you like simply animes then you gona like it then you gona enjoy this but be warned, Dragon Balls is very complicated compared to this anime.",

The art was perfect and the music was great including the ending song which I listened to a lot of times. \r\nThe cast really spend time with each other, getting to know one another and share the bonds together. Even including the Yukata contest where the guys make funny poses and WOW! I cannot stop laughing. Even especially, like love interests sometimes they might fall apart due to one mistake. Yuuji and Shoko started to love each other when they were kids and I was so sad tosee that Yuuji protected Shoko from the bullies but he ends up getting beaten. \\n\\n\r\nI loved the part on episode 4 where Himeji asks the guys to taste her food and they freaked out. Even also the part on where the summoning portal. When the person says \"Summon\", the little guy speaks on his/her true intentions.\\n\\n\r\nThe haunted place in the final episode is the epic moment where Akihisa & Yuuji defeated the 3A class. This also shows that even though they have poor grades, that doesn't mean they are complete washouts. They can excel in some things way better than those who have good grades.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character still remins as Hideyoshi Kinoshita. As stated in my previous review on Baka & Test: Matsuri\\n\\n\r\nI do believe that this is also a good lesson to learn that even though your grades may be low, you are still a brighter genius. Grades don't distinguish a person's character which is a statement which I will never forget.\\n\\n\r\nI will give it a perfect score of 10/10.",

            "content": "[I haven't finished all of the episodes yet so this review is up for change]\r\nBaka to Test to Shoukanjuu is a hit-or-miss series, depending on whether you enjoy the humour or not.\r\nAs someone who's quite tired of harem anime and the cliches that come with it, I wasn't really looking forward to getting into this anime. However, once I got started, I found out my worries were for nothing: sure, there are quite a few cliches in this show. All of them get blown up in such a way, however, that the show basically turns into one big joke.\r\nWhile the first season mainly focused onthe battles, for me, the second season felt like it needed the first season in order to properly introduce the characters of the show so that the second season could be all sexually tinted jokes. At this point in the show, not much of  a plot remains. Instead, you watch the wacky cast of characters interact with each other in settings that result in jokes that work surprisingly well, even for someone who's done with the harem genre. The show goes as far as to ridicule its own stereotypes, which makes it even better.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, typical tropes can be recognized in most of the characters. This might be a bother to some people, but I found the way the anime handled them and the way they got implemented quite refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is very unique and recognizable thanks to its use of colors and its use of patterns in the background, such as stripes and polka dots. Your eyes certainly won't be disappointed!\\n\\n\r\nThe music fits each scene really well, and the opening and ending theme also fit the anime, with their catchy sounds sticking around in your head for days after you've seen an episode. It really gives the anime an extra boost.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're here for an anime with a story, you're probably better off watching something else. However, if you're looking for a good laugh, you don't mind the cast of characters shamelessly exploring their newfound sexual desires and you just want to have a few hours of fun, you should definitely give this anime (and its prior season) a go.",

            "content": "This anime is pretty average (or below average) in all aspects, but it manages to somehow be charming enough that it no longer matters whether the technicalities are good or not. Somehow, it's refreshing and funny in a way that's difficult for shows nowadays. \r\nTo begin with, this season has even less of a story than season one. At least in season one, there was somewhat of a point to what was happening and some sort of build up and climax. In this season, it's become short story arcs, each one spanning over a couple of episodes. Somehow, the lack of an overarching plot (otherthan the overly cliche romance) didn't make it boring. It was still fun and engaging without occupying my mind for the whole day. It was laid back, to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was nothing special. I really liked the popart shadows, but other than that, everything was pretty average and simple. Nevertheless, it was appealing to the eye because it was bright and fun to look at. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also nothing special, though the special effects noises and the gag background music were a special treat. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty cliche, but there are some things I appreciated. I loved the character development between Shouko and Yugi. Even if Aki wasn't as developed, he was still a fun main character mainly because he's unfathomably dumb. Also makes him pretty relatable. ;D I liked the character development with Minami as well, but all the other characters remained as flat stereotypes for the most part, even if that was a little fun to watch still. \\n\\n\r\nI think the main selling point of this series was the interactions of the characters. Their dynamic and the way the plot is constructed around them really made the monumental difference in this being a success or failure.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I enjoyed this far more than I thought I would. I'm not sure what made me want to pick this up (it really isn't my type of show) but I'm really glad I did! \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if you: would like to see a stupid version of Assassination Classroom, like dumb characters, like the idea of harems, don't mind repetitive jokes, like running gag jokes, think oblivious characters are funny\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if you: require variety in your comedy, prefer intellectual jokes, don't like running gags/repetitive humor, prefer satire\\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

            "content": "My first review, let\u00b4s go!\r\nAh, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni!\r\nMore of the same? Or something completely different?\r\nSome might say that it's one or the other, I myself say that it's both at the same time.\r\nThis will be a retrospective on the second season of Baka to Test, and will contain little to no spoilers, so let's dive right into it.\r\nBaka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni! is just like it's first season a true comedy. And it very much stays in the roots of the genre. The amount of jokes thrown at the viewer is very high, and just like the first season of highquality. All the jokes used in the series get refferenced or come back multiple times, and that was made the first season very great. As where a lot of people would agree that the jokes are being reused like the knife and fork you use each and every meal, I actually think this is a good thing. Because it works. Truelly this is a matter of oppinion, but I quite like the jokes.\\n\r\nDuring the first two episodes you can emidiately notice that the creators tried to get even new viewers up to date with the characters and with the jokes from the first season so that anyone can jump in and enjoy the fun. Because essentially that's all this anime is. Fun. Or atleast that's what it was in season one.\\n\r\nWhat I really did not expect from the anime is the amount of background story they add to a lot of the characters. I will not say which characters get their own \"arcs\" but I will say that it greatly improves some of the characters, whereas you wouldn't normally understand why they act in a certain way or why they feel like they do. And this give the anime a lot more depth then it had in season one, which to everyone who watched the first season is quite shocking. And I personally like that. Speaking of character developement.\\n\r\nAll the characters from the first season are back, and none get added, this means that the anime spends most of it's time building on the already existing characters and this makes for quite a good amount of character developement. Not only on a personal level, but also on a more social level. A lot of characters have had their role thrown all over the place, whereas Yoshi's sister used to have a pretty decently sized role, she now only has about 20 lines of dialogue. And characters like Hideyoshi and Voyeur have been greatly build opon and improved. Again, I like this. Especially Voyeur, who went from being a supportive character to being an actual main character, and man he has been improved. And so has Hideyoshi.\\n\r\nAs you may have noticed, I have paid little to no attention to the female characters yet (apart from Hideyoshi) and this is for a very good reason.\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, but the girls get a lot better of a role in season two. In season one they were kind of there and did not really accomplish much, this has totally made a 180\u00b0 turn. They become much more relevant to the plot and the actual overal experience, which in my oppinion should've been done in season two.\\n\r\nAnother welcome addition to the series is how not everything takes place inside of the school anymore and I like how the plot has been greatly improved. What am I saying, I like how there IS plot now. And that makes it already a lot more interesting to watch.\\n\r\nThe art and animation has also had an incredible boost in quality. This is very noticable and just like the first season fits the show perfectly. You can truely see how much it has improved in the character specific episodes how much effort they put into them, just from the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nYou might ask yourself this: \"Is it truely without flaws?\" And, well... no. Offcourse not. No show is without flaws. However, all the flaws that there were in season one have been pollished and refined. The episodes aren't as repetitive anymore, the story is actually there and most importantly, the characters actually have something about themselves to say, a story to tell, sometimes even quite literally.\\n\r\nThe only actual flaw that I DID have with the anime is how it sometimes feels that the show is flying all over the place, especially in dialogue. There's not much transition between events and some stuff it just flat out skimmed over. But I guess this can be forgiven because at heart, this anime is and stays a comedy for viewing pleasure only.\\n\\n\r\nSome people might say they were disapointed with the second season, and I can see why you would think that, if you like change. But honestly, the formula worked great, so there is no need for any change.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with those words I leave you with my thoughts on Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Ni!\\n\r\nWhich is in my oppinion worth watching.\\n\\n\r\n- The Randor69",

It doesnt get as stale.\r\n+ The Art design was very appealing (SO MANY COLORS!!!)\r\n+ I didn't have any problem with any of the performances (except one). Even the supporting cast was great. Trina Nishimura and Todd Haberkorn both have small but enjoyable parts. Plus I like how Brina Palencia practically has half an episode to herself :P\r\n+Haunted House arc.\\n\r\n(Personal) + I really dug the amplified romantic element :3\\n\r\n(Sp)+ That one joke with Minami summoning during the Haunted House arc almost killed me\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- There's almost little to no cohesive plot in this season. Ultimately, it just feels like a filler season.\\n\r\n- The sequencing and format of episodes. Some episodes were split in two, some episodes have arcs(The peeking one dragged a bit for me personally), episodes of Exposition were introduced, and the everything about it all felt scrambled.\\n\r\n- The Backstory episodes completely felt out of place. (Sp) Not a fan of the German accent.\\n\r\n- Moments of serious tone can take you out of it sometimes.\\n\r\n- Sadly, Summoner Test Wars are used as a gimmick......... once again\\n\r\n(personal) - Akihisa Yoshi, GAWD YOU ARE SO DENSE!!! Making male otaku rage!\\n\\n\r\nFinal Note: Don't consider this season of Baka and Test as one that would focus on plot, but one that focuses on amplifying it's already present humor. In that sense, it succeeds in vibrant colors.\\n\\n\r\nRecommends: To those who really enjoyed the humor of the first Season.",

(What those are is up to you to find out.) And the anime did not cover all of the light novel. Nevertheless, Baka to Test is still one of the best anime out there, and is a classic must-watch. The review will be based solely on the anime.\r\nStory - 10\r\nBaka to Test has a very interesting premise: a school where you \"fight\" for your classroom status based on your score tests. Thatin itself was enough for me to grab this anime to my watch list. The story has a nice plot twists on it. Very humorous. The side stories does not bore you, and develops the characters thoroughly.\\n\\n\r\nI have no negative thoughts to say.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nWasn't good nor bad. Just average, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nAwesome VA. Good OP and ED. My fave: Getsuyuo wa Kirai (OVA ED)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nNice lineup of characters. Each one of the usual cast is more or less developed, and suits the series well. Each one has uniqueness. They were able to enhance the beauty of the already good premise, which led to a well-told story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nI can't help but enjoy this. High rewatch value.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nI'd say: YOU ARE MISSING OUT A LOT IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED BAKA TO TEST!\\n\\n\r\nWhy not 10? Unfinished.",

            "content": "I was completely pulled in by the charms of the first season. I admittedly laughed so hard that I was actually shedding tears in some episodes. That's how strong the first season's charm is. Of course, it's just natural that I was expecting a lot more from the show's second season.\r\nThe second season, however, was something I didn't expect. Don't get me wrong; I think the second season is much better than the first, and I'm not just talking about the comedic scenes.\r\nSeason 2, titled \"Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu: Nii!,\" still revolves around Yoshii Akihisa and his hilarious friends through all of their crazyantics. However, Season 2 builds upon what Season 1 left for speculation: character development, especially romantic development. Season 1 was just all laughs and more laughs; Season 2, however, actually devotes a few episodes for specific character development--specifically, for Shimada Minami and Kirishima Shouko. (By this time, I assume that you guys already know who I'm talking about.)\\n\\n\r\nHowever, don't let the dramatic moments stop you from loving Season 2. All episodes don't fall short of comedic moments (yes, even the episodes that focus on character development get their own hilarious trips), and some episodes more than make up for it by having moments that beat even the most hilarious moments of Season 1 (or the OVA, for that matter).\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nI truly appreciate the effort the creators made in making sure that characters get their own spotlight this season. It helps make the entire story coherent.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nArt didn't change for this season, and this is a good thing. Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu's art is key to the series' success as a comedy series, and the second season adds to this.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI guess it sounds repeated (if you've read my past 2 reviews for Season 1 and the OVA, that is), but this season still makes use of sound to amplify the series' funniest moments. To be honest, I think they did it better this time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nSeason 2 builds upon Season 1. Season 1 introduces the characters, and Season 2 gives them depth and personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nIt's a comedy series, and it's Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu. What else is to expect from enjoyment?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nSeason 1 introduced Akihisa and his friends to all of us. Season 2 gives us all the more reason to love them more. On top of that, it just leaves you wanting more from the series. This, on top of all those tear-jerking funny moments, makes Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu a great series which doesn't lose its touch, even with the second season. Here's hoping that I get to laugh again with a third season.",

The episodes fit together into a continuous story. It could go better with more episodes but it was good enought. In other matters, the story was Simplistic with little miniplots for complexity but they work for the  main story. The ending is predictable but still enjoyable. The ending is satisfying but open so you can\u00b4t have a complete ending.\r\nArt\r\nIt has an amainzing art.  The drawings were made of especifics situations and make and hilariousmoments that become Memorable. The backgrounds were poorly desinged but maybe with a purpose so i wont discard that option. The desing of the characters were complementing with the personalities making a good combo. Each one of them were make different.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe songs were good enought. They make you get into the story and give you a little of fun so you get ready to laugh. They were not amaizing but i really enjoy them. About the voices, there is not much i can say but they were great to me. About the background music i would say that i have never listen anyone of them... and i saw this anime 3 times...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nAll the characters are unique. They are really dummys but in a sweet way. Theirs personalities match with the story and between them making a great combo and  make really enjoyable time.  The background of each character were designed with care. The mains characters were given 1 or 2 episodies so you can really meet them and why they act like that. \\n\r\nThe characters were growing in every episode  and give more resourses to use for the main plot.\\n\r\nThere is no character to dislike in my opinion. And the Narrator is selected in a funny way and he make a good narration.\\n\r\nDo you think you will remember any of these characters in the future? I must save this question. I would always remember all of them. They make me happy/laugh in so many ways. I would love to see them 10 years in the future or at least more of them in other series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nBaka to Test series is a really good comedy/romance that you can enjoy in any moment. It have funny jokes and situations that could make you laugh or at least make you happy. Its a comedy that anyone could enjoy and have a lot of Re-watchability. \\n\r\nIt promise a really enjoyable and memorable moments that can be watched with other people or gf.\\n\\n\r\nSorry if i make a writing mistake in my review",

            "content": "Overall: After rating each separate aspect of the anime, the overall score averaged to 5.6, which I rounded to 6. For my review, I decided to break it down into the five parts.\r\nStory: I felt as though the plot was just continued because of the fans that wanted more, like me. What happened to the summoner test wars? They were fairly nonexistent here. Most of the season consisted of what should be filler episodes. I'd expect something better especially from a season opening, which was a useless trip to the beach. The flashback episodes were good, though. I loved the one showing Shuoko and Yuujias children because I was always wondering what the cause of Shuoko's infatuation was. I actually liked the last two episodes with the haunted house too. To make things short, the anime took a big dip from the first season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I thought the visual effects were great, from the silly nosebleeds to the adorably sketched characters. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound wasn't spectacular nor terrible to me. I rated it a 5.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I liked the characters. Sure, they could perfectly fit certain stereotypes, but I easily fell in love with them. In the second season, one thing I can commend the series for doing was delving deeper into each character. I didn't think it was anything amazing, though. I think my rating of 6 is fairly generous.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I so adored the first season. I was so addicted I re-watched it three times. I was anticipating for the second season to be released on Netflix. I decided to watch it on a different website anyways. I was disappointed. You can see why from my review of the story line. It's not like the theme song change should make such a difference, but it did to me. I miss the \"Perfect Area Complete.\" The new one was kind of annoying. If it ain't broke, why fix it?",

            "content": "Critic\u2019s Log - Earthdate: August 17, 2013. Review #55: Baka and Test: Summon The Beasts II\r\nIf there is an anime that I end up not liking while I\u2019m in the middle of it. It\u2019s not a chore for me to watch the rest of it. It\u2019s a test. A test to see if I can last long while I\u2019m watching an anime I don\u2019t like before I drop it. I just finished an anime that was quite a test. That anime is Baka and Test - Summon the Beasts II.\r\nYoshii Akihisa is now in his third year in Highschool, and his misadventures continue with hisbest friend Y\u016bji, his childhood friend Mizuki, and his other friends in Highschool. Akihisa, however, is enrolled in a rather unique highschool. In Fumizuki Academy, all of the students are given avatars with fighting abilities whose power reflects the student's academic success. With their avatars by their side, our characters explore deeper into what it means to be a friend and how they treat each other and why. While Shoko, the school's #1 student, endlessly tries to woo Y\u016bji. Minami and Mizuki try to capture the romantic attention of the oblivious Akihisa.\\n\\n\r\nTo be technical, this is a Silver Link production and the animation is okay in this show, but this show uses a lot of animation shortcuts, either it\u2019s recycled animation or cheap animation effects. This might have been in the first season of Baka and Test and I might have overlooked it at that time. Sue me. But the point is that I do have something to gripe when it comes to the animation. My big complaint with the animation is the over-usage of a \u201cpolka-dot\u201d effect. I remembered when I reviewed Ef: A Tale of Memories and there was a visual gimmick that was thrown in quite often in the show. Well, Shin Oonuma directed both seasons of Baka and Test and maybe these \u201cvisual gimmicks\u201d are part of his style I guess.\\n\\n\r\nDear Shin Oonuma,  \\n\\n\r\nI know you\u2019re trying to be unique, but you should not overuse certain visual gimmicks because it gets tiresome to watch after a while.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn\u2019t perfect and I didn\u2019t expect it to be, but it looks alright I guess.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs far as Music goes, Nijine composes the music for the second season of Baka and Test and the music is decent, but nothing too special. I really don\u2019t have much to say about it. The opening is ok, and the closing theme isn't special. That's all I can say about the music.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to voice acting, It\u2019s pretty much the same from Season 1, so I won\u2019t go into much detail about it. The Japanese cast is alright in this show, but I listened to bits and pieces of the English Dub of Season 2 and all I can say is that the dub could have been better. It may be extremely fitting to watch this Subbed because of the settings, but if you want to watch this Dubbed, be my guest. Just go with what you prefer.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, this was a slight disappointment. The characters did make the show funny at times in the first season, what is a slight disappointment is that they are not funny at all in this second season, and they also didn\u2019t develop as much.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest lowpoint for me is the plot. Katsuhiko Takayama is responsible for the composition in the writing department. He also was involved in Ef: A Tale of Memories and Ef: A Tale of Melodies which the story to both seasons of that show could have been better. But Season 2 of Baka and Test suffers from being too different than the first Season. It is also slow to begin with as well. I will give the show some credit that there are a couple episodes that were nice to see. But what made Baka and Test a decent viewing is that it was a comedy with a little Slice of Life in it. In this second season, There's more Slice of Life in it and rarely is it funny. When it tries to be funny. Certain gags are overdone and it just isn't funny after a while. Some of the jokes from Season 1 remain and this season was just hard to get a good laugh from. The show picks up a little halfway, but it is boring half the time. It also all leads down to an ending that is kinda stupid. If you liked Baka and Test, Feel free to give this second season a try. But I can tell you that it is quite a test to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBaka and Test - Summon The Beasts II is available from Funimation.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, Baka and Test Season 2 is not as funny as Season 1, but there are a couple of nice episodes that involve interesting backstories, but Season 2 suffers from lack of comedy, animation shortcuts, and a lack of character development that would have been needed (save for the ones that did get backstories). This should only be viewed for those that like Baka and Test or for those that are viewer completionists that have seen the first season of Baka and Test.\\n\\n\r\nI give Baka and Test - Summon The Beasts II a 4.9 out of 10. it is NOT REALLY GOOD!\\n\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this will be on the test.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nWhats interesting with the second season of Baka & Test is that it goes for the path of expanding the characters instead of expanding the story.\r\nThe story continues with F-class as they carry on their crusade to make sure they have the best equipment in their class while also doing completely stupid things along the way.\r\nNow the second sseason doesn't have a coherent story instead it has few episodes concentrating on a specific subject and then moves onto something else, but this doesn't affect the anime at all since the main reason the first season was good is because of the characters andinstead this season decides to concentrate on the characters and it was actually very fun and entertaining since we even get to know more about the origins of some characters like how Minami and her sister adapted Japan after moving from Germany and we even get to see why Shouko has an unstoppable crush on Yuuji.\\n\r\nIt even tries to tackle the love triangle between Himeji and Minami for Yoshii, the show does still try to add in the school element which mostly consists of school trips like going to a bathhouse or holding a Courage test for the classes to compete in so even though the second season concentrates more on the characters it still keeps the school element around.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely expanded upon in this season as we get to learn more about them and why they are in the position their in.\\n\r\nAt some point in the series we get to see the male characters in F-classes sheer determination at organising all of the classes to work together just to see the girls nude in the Bathhouse which they all get majorly disappointed by.\\n\r\nWe get to see why Yuuji and Shouko have their really awkward relationship mainly because Yuuji was the only person that interacted with Shouko because nobody else talked to her and when she was being bullied Yuuji came in to rescue her hence why she fell obsessively in love with him.\\n\r\nWe also get to see the relationship between Yoshii, Himeji and Minami as because of certain circumstances we really see the true feelings come out from these 3 well mostly Minami and Himeji, Yosheii continues to be the dense guy he usually is.\\n\r\nSome other characters from the first season get more screentime time too like Aiko she became a more prominent member of the group despite being from A-class she's actually a fun flirty person mainly around Kouta, we even get to see Miharu more because since Minami is getting closer to Yosheii Miharu tries to intervene more often.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle remains pretty much as good as the first season, but this season actually spend's less time at the school and instead goes to other locations like the beach and even a bathhouse, but that doesn't mean the school sections are blown down because the arena that was used for the Courage Test was actually very well done and it's definitely one of the better Courage Test's I've seen out of all the School anime's I've watched.\\n\\n\r\nThe Comedy is still continued to make me laugh and there were some pretty good moments like the male characters having to look like girls and seeing which one can win a beauty contest or the war between the male students and the teachers at the bathhouse so the boys could see the girls nude, but were really disappointed in the end, there was even a point where they changed the look of the Avatars and the results were pretty damn hilarious since they depicted one aspect of their owners personality which was pretty damn funny for some of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe Romance was given a bit more of a push this season as we got to see more development between the love triangle of Yosheii, Himeji and Minami which actually got very serious towards the end of the series and we even got to see Yuuji getting onto some common ground with Shouko as he has started thinking more about how she feels along with how he feels too hell there was even some flirting between Kouta and Aiko since both characters act pervy.\\n\\n\r\nThe one downside with this series is that there was a lack of battles with the Avatars this season it didn't really affect the overall score, but if you're coming to this season for more of these battles then you're going to be disappointed, there was probably about two of them, but they were really big and spanned for a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a great sequel and maybe there'll be a season 3 since the story doesn't feel quite over just yet and I feel a season 3 would be nice to at least see these characters graduate or something.",

            "content": "This review is rather sad to write, as many of you know I only just recently praised the first series for how original it was in writing, style and flavor. But, take off those glares and hear me out before you get angry.\r\n(MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD, PROCEED WITH CAUTION)\r\nI will start with the positives. What the second season of Baka to Test did is VERY good as far as story goes. We got some real development on the characters that was previously not there in the prior season. Most notably, Yuuji and Shouko and the reason why their bond is so close. Or, erm, why itis so one-sidedly close on the Shouko side of things.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, we see some adequate development with Akihisa and the obvious two girls that like him. If you watched the first season, you know who I am referring to. The basic \"good cop, bad cop\" girls, though when it comes to jealousy, they're on even ends of the spectrum.\\n\\n\r\nNow, sadly, comes the negatives. VERY sadly, I have lots of them and just for the sake of keeping the dignity of this anime intact, I will go over them briefly and categorize properly in case you want to skip to the next part:\\n\\n\r\n- GENERIC HAREM MOMENTS\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this involves Akihisa and the two girls. As I said in my other review of the prior season, I liked how there was very LITTLE of this kind of thing and how Akihisa was punished for obvious reasons such as calling Minami flat. This time, however, I feel they set it up very awkwardly and it was basically designed so that the girls would win all of the time. Fun if I look up this kind of anime, but disappointing that this particular anime transitioned into this.\\n\\n\r\n- DISAPPOINTING TACTICAL MOMENTS\\n\\n\r\nThis season did indeed have fun fights with lots of strategy thought up in them, but their outcomes didn't feel as fun as how they did it before. One of them in particular, the one involving peeping into the girls' bath, was quite comical and I find it funny how many episodes spanned from this scenario alone. However, it's peculiar that this was, perhaps, the only time the strategy elements were used so heavily. They kind of do it again near the ending, but this is after certain other things happen.\\n\\n\r\n- MORE DRAMATIC MOMENTS\\n\\n\r\nYes, I have basically categorized everything as \"moments\" for some reason, but anyway, there's more drama. My real beef with this is that this anime was never made to be a drama and is not even categorized as such, but some episodes got awfully dark. Most notably, the one involving Akihisa being \"too dumb\" at figuring out his feelings for the girls. Well it was humorous of them to poke fun at his idiocy in comedy moments, I feel the writing took a rather dark turn at making him feel horrible as the girls shunned him a lot because of it. I know it would also be out of character for him to be smart about the situation, but I just wish these situations didn't span for longer than an episode, as they did in this season.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to sum up that last sentiment, I am not necessarily angry at this anime for adding drama, but rather, at the way they did it. In the previous season, they had some drama in it, but it only ever spanned during a few scenes or a full episode at the very most and usually the next drama episode occurred a little ways away. So, to me, I found it peculiar that this season had drama that spanned for multiple episodes one time. I would've forgiven it if the topics they tackled weren't so brutal on Akihisa's side of things.\\n\\n\r\n(MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD, READ AT RISK)\\n\\n\r\nI think my overall favorite parts of the drama were the fact that Akihisa actually had some real relationship development with both of the girls. Most notably, for all Minami fans out there, she legitimately kissed him in one of the episodes (and it takes place after the credits, as do most comedy scenes in this anime, so be sure to not skip those) right in front of Mizuki. Their romance was pretty short-lived since it ended in the same episode (this was also the same episode that brought forth the dark drama I was talking about), but after this episode, it was pretty obvious he'd end up with Minami as opposed to Mizuki.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the fact that their character development basically showed that Akihisa went through the most effort to become friends with Minami, despite how hard it was for him to understand her and vice versa. Well Mizuki was way nicer to him, I honestly do not believe he will end up with her. If a third season is ever made, he will most definitely end up with Minami. I just feel all the cards are in the right place for that to happen.\\n\\n\r\nOh, one more thing I forgot to tackle was Miharu. As you may know, she was basically the comic relief character in the previous season. In fact, I'm astonished I forgot to cover both her and Kubo, the love rivals for Minami and Akihisa, respectively. Yes, you read that right. I am implying they are gay for those characters, with Miharu being far more direct to Minami than Kubo is to Akihisa. These two are probably my second favorite love rivals of any anime ever made just for how bizarre they are.\\n\\n\r\nBut, enough of that, let's get to the point. Miharu got awfully dark in this season, especially against Akihisa. She basically called him the scum of the earth and ridiculed him in every imaginable way in a certain episode. And, despite this anime still being mostly comedy, this was really the one that reminded me that they pushed some boundaries for the sake of character development. In fact, they pushed them far enough where I almost want to say this anime might as well be in the \"drama\" genre for how dark this episode was. It was part of the whole \"spanned drama\" I talked about earlier where it went beyond the episode that started it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this episode also secured me shipping Akihisa and Minami. Cause, again, they did already kiss once and, despite that relationship not going too far, I was pretty happy about it and there was no more denial that I wanted these two to be together. But, the reason why it secured these two for me was the response Akihisa gave to Miharu after she said he was not fit at all to date her. You have to watch it yourself as it is a beautiful scene to witness, even for a comedy.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, I had much more to say about this season than I did the last. I mainly wanted to tackle a lot of this since I had so much to get off my chest after I finished it up. I was also very happy that I finally finished it after so many years, as for the few that read my other review, you know that I said I started this anime many years ago. It was one of the first I ever watched, but I never finished it since, at the time, I saw it on Netflix and the second season, being as new as it was, did not have a dub yet and that is how I watched it. As such, Netflix naturally did not have it, either.\\n\\n\r\nSo, my recommendation, despite the negativity I gave here, is to watch this season anyway if you enjoyed the first. It's not as good, but it's still worthy of the name \"Baka to Test\" and will still make you laugh a lot. I did also enjoy how it involved more areas than just the school, so look forward to that.",

So this words came from Aki's mouth \"Tu ne voudrais pas devenir mon amie\" I was thinking what does this words mean. Then as soon Minami realizes the fact that this words aren't Japanese nor German but French and was surprised the Aki even thoughan idiot did this for her but yeah wrong language though LMAO .. \\n\r\nStill MORE MORE MORE better than season 1. \\n\\n\r\nP.S Hideyoshi besto",

            "content": "Actually this season is 50-50 Comedy-Romance and normally i should probably praise that and in general be really happy,right? WRONG! (Will mention on the 'thoughts' section bellow) \r\nIt still contains a lot of ideas but it uses them more efficiently than the last season. The jokes and humour are updated and innovative. . . but its still hit or miss...Not anyone's cup of tea!\r\nThe Story is still the same and as the premise suggests its getting deeper into the characters.\r\nCharacters are slightly better than last season, better explained and their actions and reactions more justified and orchestrated in a weird way.\r\nSounds are actually a lotbetter! The OP more fitting its theme and the ED were really delicate.Also there are OST for some moments and without a doubt fitting and making the show even better! \\n\r\nThe are style is still kinda disturbing and extra moe/cute but one should have gotten used to it if he wants to watch the 2nd season. Also its slightly better than the first season in some ways. More accurate better use in the comical scenes and more detailed and refined when needed.\\n\r\nIts also more entertaining since there are new jokes and easier to keep up with than the 1st season for some reason. Also it had less cringe moments and featured some realistic and fitting situations!\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Weaknesses and Personal Opinion~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nWell, let's start with the fact that there is tons of Fan service at the start...Not comedic one... tons of unnecessary service....There are still recycling a lot of jokes meaning , some are pretty boring and expected (that doesn't mean you won't laugh tho)...The insights in the Characters past is sudden and not so well triggered, which will leave you wondering \"why do i have to learn his/her past so sudden, If not to explain some bullshit that's gonna happened next....Ohh!..\"<.<\\n\r\nAlso there is romantic development. . . in the worst possible way ...By that i mean it happened but it doesn't have the impact or the outcomes it should...But the show will prove you it can get serious. . . So in other words, it tries to keep everyone satisfied but that results in poor performance and cheap excuses, which feels out of place and less pragmatic. Leading in regret and dissatisfaction in general because no logic explanation is given...In the end , there is the unfulfilled feeling and a bad taste in your mouth... Just f*ck it! Last but not least, the side love story was better than the Main one! (That happens way too much in anime and its a SIN!)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, its a lot better than the 1st season! Hilarious,with some development, but its still an example of how incompleteness and indecisiveness destroy a high potential show....\\n\r\nDue to the bad taste it leaves the viewer thing i would strongly advice watching only until ep 11..\\n\r\nI would recommended if you liked the comedy in the 1st part or wanted to see some sweet and stupid romance !\\n\r\nReasons to watch it(Supposedly you watched 1st season):\\n\r\n-The narrator is still pure gold!\\n\r\n-Less Hideyoshi oriented jokes(yea stop calling her funny),more racism and Perv Ninja!\\n\r\n-Actually some romance. . .not the satisfying one...but ehh, its still romance!",

I mean, from trying to pick up girls to a hideous Yuuji in a model competition, it was all a lot of fun and laughs to see. \r\nI can't say I wasn't alittle bit disappointed that they went back to school, as I was hoping that S2 would be about their funny antics for their summer holiday, but nonetheless manages to deliver a lot of laughs! The only thing I'm a bit upset about is the three part episodes, I've always thought of Baka to Test to be one of those anime that you don't take seriously at all, something to watch when you're a bit down or something, so seeing a mini-plot form gets a little tiring!\\n\\n\r\nOh yes, did I mention the AMAZING opening for S2!?

            "content": "Ah.....season 2 of baka and test, whether to call it a big disappointment or greatest work ever i'll leave to the viewers discretion\r\nWhere to begin? \r\nStory: 4/10 \r\nIt took me awhile to really guess if this season had a story or not, for 6 episodes they were mostly fillers with absolutely make-you-die-laughing comedy just as one should expect from this show...but the lack of class fights and duels was a big disappointment as they were really funny and interesting to watch in both the first season and in the OVA. the second season tries to implement  the supposed \"love triangle\" that is minami, aki,and mizuki but really makes the anime look bad, i can't really tell if it was just food for fodder(fodder being comedy in this case) or if they really wanted to explore a relationship...episode 7 has this major twist and is quickly fixed in episode 9, and then is reopened again in episode 13, i really have no clue what was the purpose of trying to implement a serious side to this anime, when it was immediantly turned into a comedy the next minute. You could hardly call the minami-aki-mizuki thing a love triangle at all, theres so little scenes that mizuki actually interacts with Aki in a way that both of them show in the slightest bit any emotion to the other, as both are too afraid to show it. the lack of in class fighting really deters the second season from having a unified goal as in the first season, which was to prove even \"bakas\" can be just as good as the smarties, but the main event in season 2 isnt even mentioned until the 6th episode, half way into the season, it just wasn't good at all they should have left it as a pure comedy this season, it would have worked out better...perhaps something like the anime Working!!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nthere's nothing bad about the art at all, but there's nothing amazing about it that stands out from other anime made around the same time as this one\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nthere was nothing bad about the sound, i particularly liked the sound track during strategys for the class wars\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI almost gave this area a 6, but after considering it A LOT i decided on a 7, more or less giving it a HUGE benefit-of-the-doubt. Characters are meant to change over time, i understand that, but i feel like during this season a lot of characters changed too much. Minami is the biggest example, episode 7 perfect example, shes usually the one to keep Aki in line usually by one of her sometimes uncontrollable habits to pin Aki down using wrestling moves but this episode her \"masculine\" character disappeared COMPLETELY for the remainder of the series she was a totally different character, she even gets pissed at Aki for being \"stupid\" for not recognizing her feelings even though she's the one that rushed in without thinking at all and did what she did (wont reveal spoilers, watch it yourself). I was a Minami fan, but this season really did a number on her character it was too much. The other reason why i didn't think the characters were great, was because of Mizuki's either really weak cute side, or attempting to have a strong masculine side, often when Aki does something that spins jealousy in the eyes of Minami and Mizuka, Mizuka goes into this horrifying death mode, that i think should have been explored more. \\n\r\nMore or less, i think Mizuki wasn't given a chance at all by the story writers, Minami has a considerable amount of moments more in this anime than Mizuki does, and Mizuki's story with how she met Aki was never shown unlike Minami who was given a whole episode on it. I think the love triangle would have been so much more enjoyable if mizuki's story was explored as much as Minami's was. The biggest reason of them all for this score, is the very wide open door that is left at the end, in which nothing is worked out even though normally the moment of comedy that this anime is known for was the last scene, i felt nothing from it...because i was too annoyed by what had happened only moments before.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of how much a disaster the story side of this anime was, it still was the most hilarious anime i've seen in a long time, the absense of anime parodies that was frequent in the first season is a downer, but Aki, being the baka he is, provides enough comedy to make you overlook it. It's definately something to check out, but do so looking for a comedy anime, if you're looking for an anime that has a good romance to it, and is hilarious, well...you'll only be half satisfied.\\n\r\nWhether a 3rd season, or even another OVA will be released to clear all this confusion up that the second season left or not, is something thats very unclear, even a year after this season aired.",

Unfortunately you have to wait another week. \r\nIf you want to have a laugh, then i highly recommend this anime. If want a good story plot, this anime might not be the best.\r\nThe overall visuals and sound fit together smoothly, making viewing very enjoyable, not to mention that it kind of takes you out of this world.\r\nSo please enjoy!",

The humor was better, the story-driven moments were well done and it was, overall, much better to watch than before.\r\nI personally don't like this style of humor. I really don't. Most of the time I simply don't find it funny, and sometimes I get some embarrassment. Still, I found myself laughing a lot in some episodes, and even pausing some of then to breath. It's considerably funnier than the first season.\r\nIt's natural to get attached to the characters after a secondseason. However, the personality of everyone seems too thin to me. We get some background story at a point, and those parts are really good, but that's it. If you hate to watch beta male characters, this isn't for you. And even so, the protagonist is one of the most likable characters there. \\n\\n\r\nI want to write a paragraph about the opening. It's just so well done. Visually speaking. The sync with the music is great too, but I kinda pay lot of attention to openings and it was a surprise to me that both the opening and the ending look top tier. That being said, I think it's personal, as some people might just don't like it, and others probably will just skip it after an episode or two.\\n\\n\r\nThis second season is a good watch if you watched the first season and have nothing else to do. It's definitively an improvement. Even if its some steps away from being good, it can be more enjoyable to watch than you think.",

            "content": "First, let me just say that sequels are always as in ALWAYS expected to be at least a little bit better from the previous one. In other words, it is only natural to have expectations from sequels particularly if the previous one is an amazing one. With that said, I strongly believe that the season one is way better. It\u2019s not even that funny at all. Most of the time, all they do is have the dog-cat fight among the boys and girls that Harem stories have which I really hate. From being one of the most hilarious series, it seems to me it justbecomes more of a Harem series. If last season there are absolutely no dull moments, this time there are too much dull moments that I end up skipping a lot of scenes or just forwarding it. Even the comical acts and lines are sometimes very far-fetched.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s even a development with the characters. Some stay the same which could be just fine but some becomes extremely irritating particularly the girls. They\u2019ve become a nuisance, annoying, and forceful especially if it comes to their love interest. Because of the girls\u2019 repeated outburst, the storyline becomes very predictable. Though, it is nice that some of the characters have their background and past revealed it still does not make them any more interesting or likeable. Yoshii, Hideyoshi and Kouta are the only ones very interesting for me.\\n\\n\r\nI believe the only thing that improves a lot is the animation. From the graphics to the amazing battles among summoned beasts; everything is elevated.\\n\\n\r\nI am extremely disappointed because I was genuinely anticipating the sequel. It is no longer the nice and hilarious series I\u2019ve seen before. If it\u2019s the other way around and this one would be season one, I wouldn\u2019t even consider watching the sequel because I won\u2019t be interested at all. Even the Matsuri Ovas was way better.\\n",

            "content": "The original Baka and Test was a funny, entertaining ride that I happily gave a 7 due to that fact. With the second season I didn\u2019t expect the original formula to really change, but what I did expect was some form of plot or progression or something of the like. Not that Summon the Beasts had a fantastic story or anything, it was kind of weak in that regard. But the second season just doesn\u2019t go anywhere or do much of anything. Now, I\u2019m not saying things don\u2019t happen, because things do happen. But the problem I have is that it mostly feels like filler.And when you have a whole thirteen episode season of a show and eighty percent of it feels like filler, you know you\u2019re doing something wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning of this season feels like an episode of the Powerpuff Girls or something along those lines with the show divided into two halves, telling two different stories. So I figured we were dealing with just a silly straight up comedy, the show understanding where its\u2019 strengths lie and exploiting them. The problem was, it wasn\u2019t that funny. Especially compared to the first season, we were getting pretty much the same jokes from before. After that we get a story arc about a summer camp and peeping and some generic trivial business to that extent. This arc did provide a bit of a story, but once again I found that the comedy wasn\u2019t really there. What I did like from this part was the romance (though accidental) that began to develop. The series was missing any form of romantic development in the first season, and it seemed to be moving along quite nicely at this point. After that we get two episodes of backstory. The first is about how Minami transferred to Japan from Germany and met Yoshii. This was a really good, heartfelt episode. It is a good first person narrative on a stranger in a strange place. It helps Minami come across as a good, three dimensional character as opposed to her counterpart (we\u2019ll get to that later). After that we see how Yuji and Shoko wound up together (or more precisely, how Yuji got stuck with Shoko). This episode seemed a lot more like filler. It went on, and on, and on. I could feel the heart, I could understand its purpose, but the internal dialogue Yuji goes through when watching Shoko get bullied is pretty unbearable and he comes across as a complete ass. I get the feeling I\u2019m supposed to like this guy and have sort-of feelings for Shoko. But that episode makes me feel like Shoko is really the more likeable character, despite her violence and craziness.\\n\\n\r\nThen there are about three episodes and *SPOILER ALERT* Minami and Yoshii appear to finally be getting somewhere! But nope, the writer doesn\u2019t want to piss off anybody so continues to leave Yoshii\u2019s romantic interest open. The continual cockteases of Yoshii liking either Minami or Mizuki more and wanting to be with her is annoying. And that\u2019s the problem with love triangles like this, most of the time the writer won\u2019t get the main guy together with either character because he/she doesn\u2019t want to enrage fans of the other character. For me, I want to see Yoshii get together with my favorite character, but that\u2019s where the series really finds it has problems. I mentioned that the romance doesn\u2019t go anywhere in my first season review. Well, the romance does get somewhere here, but it\u2019s quickly shot down before it goes anywhere and played off as Yoshii being an idiot.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this opens up another can of problems. The first season really made me feel like Yoshii and Mizuki were closer to dating than Minami and him. But, this season it makes it feel like Minami is the real romantic interest, focuses on her a lot more, and then turns around and makes Mizuki once again seem like the main love interest.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I\u2019ve got a variety of problems with Mizuki that I\u2019ll get to in a moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is the exact same quality as the first season. It\u2019s got that manga look and sometimes it can be resort to still images for a few seconds. It\u2019s not fantastic quality and none of the character designs really stand out in the crowd.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with sound you get a really childish opening that I guess fits the show but isn\u2019t that fantastic. The closing is another study in basic. There is a second closing that they use once for whatever reason. I never figured that one out.\\n\\n\r\nNow to the classic characters section where I complain about romances and bad characters. The romances won\u2019t go into my overall score because that\u2019s bias beyond belief but characters are always a good portion of the scoring.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m just going to start where I left off a few paragraphs ago. Why does Mizuki seem to be the main romantic interest? What am I supposed to see in her that makes me root for her and Yoshii to get together? Is it the study in contrasts, one being an idiot, the other smart? Is it the fact she\u2019s cute and girly and has big boobs? I mean, I don\u2019t understand wherein I\u2019m supposed to find her likeable. She can\u2019t cook, she\u2019s smart, and she\u2019s pretty much the polar opposite of Yoshii. So why does he go after her? Because they\u2019ve known each other since grade school? She seems more like a friend than a lover.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile Minami actually gets a lot more time as the focal point of the romance, yet is thrown aside later on. Despite the fact she is violent, she is totally likeable. I thought she was one of the best characters in the show, especially due to the fact we see her past and we see her outside of school talking about her feelings a lot more than Mizuki. She genuinely likes Yoshii, loves him even, and we can tell that really easily when we see that she is mad about the fact he keeps choosing Mizuki over her. Meanwhile Mizuki has no character definition and just gets jealous and bitches about his feelings about her and we never see a clear definition of her feelings or why she feels that way. The series never shows exactly how she met Yoshii and why she really likes him. She\u2019s completely two dimensional and basic and the series never does anything to show any other side of her than the \u201cI like Yoshii\u201d side. Minami on the other hand is shown as having a lot of troubles, as having problems with jealousy, of really trying to get together with him but failing.\\n\\n\r\nI just have a feeling that I\u2019m supposed to root for Yoshii and Mizuki because she\u2019s got big boobs and is cute and girly. But boobs do not a good romance make.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Yoshii as a character is annoying at points and likeable at points. He swings back and forth. He\u2019s so stupid and oblivious to everything but that\u2019s his character. But he\u2019s usually unbearably stupid. His stupidity is the reason romances go nowhere. Though I must say that a heartfelt moment he shares with another character about Minami does come across as the most human lines of the whole series. I felt he was so much more likeable and in his element when he admitted his liking Minami, but then it reverts back to the love triangle thing and ends in utter dissatisfaction for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve already talked about Shoko and Yuji. Shoko is cute, she\u2019s funny, and while she may come across as crazy I feel like Yuji is a total ass to her. Though the series does throw out some hints that Yuji does like her too, maybe even loves her.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters such as Kouta and Hideyoshi resume their positions as the exact same characters from the first season. Hideyoshi as the boy everyone thinks is a girl is so overplayed by the time the summer camp happens, it gets to be totally unfunny. Kouta as a pervert and nosebleeding everywhere gets old as well.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s just another fault with this second season is that there is very little character development aside from Yoshii and Minami. Otherwise, everyone is the same old, same old, and acts the same and has the same character gags we laughed at during the first season.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Baka to Test\u2019s second season is pretty much filler. It goes somewhere, then steps back to the start to keep fanboys/girls happy. The comedy of the first season is here, but is very rarely funny and the reuse of jokes becomes almost painful. Not that I didn\u2019t like parts of it, some of the characters I genuinely like and enjoy watching. But overall, I feel like the second season is pointless most of the time. Minami\u2019s character may be the only thing that saved this from being anything less than merely bad.",
