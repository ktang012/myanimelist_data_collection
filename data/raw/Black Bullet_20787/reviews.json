            "content": "Black Bullet is one of the many light novel adaptations that aired during Spring 2014. You might know the other ones as The Irregular at Magic High School, No Game No Life, and Chaika - The Coffin Princess. It started out okay, but got progressively weaker as it went on, before turning into an unentertaining show that turned out to be a rushed and half-baked adaptation. Shame, it had potential to be way better.\r\nIf you've read the synopsis on the show's page on this site, it'll tell you that it takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where humanity is practically on the brink of extinction,having been driven into a corner by powerful monsters. You might think that this concept sounds familiar; kind of like 2013's popular Attack on Titan. With a premise like that, it drew in a lot of viewers who, one might say, could have been looking for a sci-fi version of Attack on Titan or something. However, the thing about this show is that it seems to have entirely forgotten that it was a post-apocalyptic show. You see plenty of tons of healthy-looking people on the rather clean streets, the towns look clean and well-tended, and the economy seems to be in such good condition that they're able to afford things like prosthetic limbs made of tissue resembling human flesh and whatnot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is standard fare, all things considered. The style isn't anything special; it's generic and nothing about it really seems to stick out. Characters and objects look polished enough, and the actual animation is fairly crisp when there's good action going on, though it's not enough to make the actual fights that appealing or interesting to watch. In the end though, it gets the job done, but ultimately doesn't stick out at all. The designs were fairly neat though, I'll give it that. I liked the designs of the Gastrea, all two times they appeared or whatever.\\n\\n\r\nI'm quite fond of Shiro Sagisu's work. He did an outstanding job with the music for the Evangelion franchise, along with a great job at the soundtrack for the Berserk: Golden Age Arc films. However, this must be easily his weakest work. Background music is generic and forgettable, except for probably two or so songs that play during battles, which can give a good feel of intensity. The opening, \"black bullet,\" respectively named after the show and light novel, is fairly pleasant to listen to, but it isn't anything I'll remember in a month or so. Same goes for the main ending theme, \"Tokohana,\" though I do really like when it starts playing near the end of an episode. The voice acting isn't anything to write home for either. You have Yuki Kaji as the main character, Rentaro Satomi, but he isn't all that interesting to listen to. He always seems depressed, angry, tired, bored, or sounds like he's crying. So in short, he practically sounds the same as when he voiced Eren Yeager in Attack on Titan. I suppose I should give an honorable mention to Yui Horie (Minori Kushieda, Toradora!) for trying her best with what she got, and to Rikiya Koyama (Kiritsugu Emiya, Fate/Zero) for still having that charming, nonchalantly badass voice, even if his role was fairly limited.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are bland and unmemorable. Rentaro practically has no notable personality traits other than typical \"brave\" and \"determined\" that can be found in literally a hundred other characters who are far better written. He reminds me of Kirito from Sword Art Online in a way, in that not only does he have no notable personality, he has a harem for practically no reason, at least one girl in each harem being a little girl under 13. The main difference though is that while Kirito is overpowered, Rentaro seems underpowered in contrast. Despite being equipped with skills like knowledge of martial arts, a fairly high level of agility, exceptional marksmanship, and practically superhuman strength and speed due to his prosthetic limbs, he never seems to win, and even when he does, it's not even memorable or anything. Now, there's nothing wrong with making the main character an underdog, but a well-written underdog has to be a well-written character. The main reason why Rocky Balboa is a good underdog is because he's a genuine nice person. When he's not boxing, he's a really sweet guy, like around his lover Adrian and her brother Paulie, and he stands up for those he cares for. There's time and dedication given into giving the audience a good idea of what Rocky is like, which ultimately makes us want him to win against all odds against more experienced and stronger boxers like Apollo Creed and Ivan Drago. However, in Black Bullet, since Rentaro is a bland and forgettable character, it makes the audience not care whether he wins or loses, and thus, destroys all tension in a fight. Every time something happens to him, he begins to doubt all he knows, building the foundation of character development, but he never visibly develops, though given that the source material is still ongoing, not all is lost yet, since all these events that happen to him could potentially act as catalysts to a giant, grand development. But I suppose we'll only know if there's a second season. The other characters aren't all that special either. Enju is the token \"energetic loli,\" similar to how Tina is the token \"lethargic loli\" who's only active when the situation calls for it, kind of like Shiro from No Game No Life. There's also Kisara \"Big Boobs\" Tendo, the president of Civil Security that Rentaro works for, who happens to be a childhood friend of our main character, but ultimately, she lacks depth like the other character and hardly develops her own identity until the last five minutes or so. There are also more generic characters like the aloof old friend, the cocky guy, the girl with cat ears (which is supposed to be explained in plot but we never actually see any more of this), the hikkomori, etc. The character who steals the show is Kagetane Hiruko, who is the main villain of it all, or is supposed to be anyway. He's smooth, charismatic, nonchalant, mysterious, and reminds me of V from V for Vendetta in some ways. It's a shame he doesn't get a lot of screen-time either.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment levels seemed to fluctuate for me at first, before going down to consistently being a chore to watch. It has an inconsistent tone akin to that of Elfen Lied. By day, happy-go-lucky comedy featuring boob groping, other fanservice, and loli sweetness. By night, it becomes (or tries to be) macabre and dark, though it only comes off as unnecessarily edgy for the sake of being edgy. The humor might get a small chuckle or two out of you, but at the end of the day, boob groping and comical misunderstandings aren't anything to write home to in the humor department.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Black Bullet could have been a good show, but ultimately fails miserably. To say that it was rushed would be a big understatement indeed, what with not providing adequate world-building or characterization. I'm sure the light novels are way better, but since the adaptation is poor, it's not exactly doing a good job at advertising the source material to me, and thus, fails as such.",

            "content": "Although Black Bullet is tagged as being action, mystery, sci-fi, seinen, and probably post-apocalyptic, it should really be considered a loli-harem comedy first and foremost. The comedy is completely unintentional but it's what kept me watching week after week. Black Bullet is driven by manufactured drama and the characters are one dimensional cardboard cutouts with some dark backstories thrown in. Several important plot points are brought up and then never mentioned again, leaving the audience to wonder why we were even given this information in the first place.\r\nThe story follows high school student and \"Promoter\" Satomi Rentaro and his loli partner Enju, who uses herkept-in-check gastrea powers to kill full blown gastrea. Rentaro starts off being pretty mediocre as far as Promoters go, but he quickly rises through the ranks because of his inherent superiority and a sudden powerup.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story tries to be serious and mature, it fails miserably. We start off with the usual generic villain who wants to let the gastrea kill everyone in Tokyo because apparently anyone who can't defend defend themselves from giant monsters ought to die and it doesn't really get much better. There's an evil scientist named Ayn Rand, loli assassins, bad guys who have an irrational hatred of Rentaro, and a guy who built one of the varanium monoliths on the cheap so he could pocket the extra money. Sorry if I'm making this sound good because really, it's not. Even when we get a big gastrea battle at the end the real action takes place off screen. All we get to see is the aftermath.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the show is that it has absolutely no idea how to have any kind of emotional impact on the audience. Minor characters are introduced only to die an episode or two later. Rentaro cries because he cared about them, but the viewer hardly knew them at all. Little girls in particular are subjected to brutal violence because what's worse than killing off an ordinary character? Killing off a child! This happens multiple times throughout the show and it serves no purpose other than to be \"shocking\" and briefly make Rentaro pause and wonder why he protects Tokyo. There's a death toward the end that annoyed me because of how it happened so nonchalently. When someone dies it should feel like they made a meaningful sacrifice. This felt like the character had such little regard for their own life that it wasn't really a sacrifice at all. \\n\\n\r\nBlack Bullet has very little character growth. It may be that the show's rushed pacing gave Rentaro very little time for introspection, or that the story is basically one crisis after another. Either way, every character gets a dark backstory but that's pretty much it.  \\n\\n\r\nRentaro starts off as a mid-tier Promoter before he suddenly unlocks his potential and becomes ridiculously overpowered - except when he gets physically restrained by two guys right after a fight where he was demolishing concrete walls. He is always morally right and he demonstrates his superiority by triumphing over characters who hate him for very flimsy reasons. When a character unfairly persecuteshim, something conveniently happens that removes the obstacle and increases Rentaro's prestige. Everyone in a position of authority acts like a retard just so he can show how clever and perceptive he is.\\n\\n\r\nKisara is Rentaro's tsundere friend. Her family is basically the Rothschilds of Japan except instead of banking, they teach their children absurdly overpowered martial arts and weapon techniques. You'll know this because the characters announce the name of the attack before they use it. \\n\\n\r\nThe loli harem is there for comedy relief and pandering. The kind of \"humor\" here entails a gastrea-spider shoots sticky white web on Enju and constant flirting with Rentaro.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like B-movies then boy, have I got the show for you. It tries to be deep but the pacing is so frenetic that all the characters come across as being extremely shallow. There's even a scene where a guy gets cut by a sword but doesn't realize it until his head EXPLODES a minute later. Varanium may be black, but Black Bullet is comedy gold.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nHey there folks! Have you ever wanted to see an anime that has a loli fanservice scene, a comedic tsundere romance scene, and a scene that features the complete and brutal genocide of children all within 2 minutes of each other? No? Good, because anyone who WOULD want to see that wouldn't know the first thing about writing a coherent TV show. Unfortunately for Black Bullet, one of this season's most unfortunately overrated series, there is plenty of incoherence to be found. This horribly confused action seinen is jam packed with arguably the worst pacing issues I've ever seen, poor character development, andlolis. Soooo many lolis. Sure, the series has its moments, but the plentiful flaws outnumber the few positives that Black Bullet has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: In a near future, where mankind lives in fear of viral parasites called Gastrea, humans have been forced into a small territory and live in constant fear of death. Satomi Rentaro, a member of the \"Civil Security\" (an organization specializing in fighting against the Gastrea), is tasked with defending mankind from this monstrous threat. His partner, Enju, is a 10 year old girl with large amounts of power due to her partially Gastrea-infected DNA; she is one of the many \"cursed children\" who are used to fight the Gastrea as humanity struggles to survive.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Bullet's plot can easily be described as a mess for more then one reason. The first issue I will focus on is the MONUMENTALLY awful pacing, and trust me when I say it is monumental: Episodes 1-4 of Black Bullet are a shock to the system. I mean really, not a single person on planet Earth was prepared for the insanity that they witnessed over the course of those first 4 episodes. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the ENTIRE anime could have been just these four episodes, because that's how much content they truly \"covered\" in so little time. The pace of the show was faster then a coked-up cheetah with rockets strapped to its back, I mean it was truly something to behold. This all culminated in the absolute clusterfuck that was episode 4, in which 5 or 6 different climaxes all happened in the same episode. Ridiculous? Yes. But admittedly, it was so unfathomably stupid that it was actually kind of fun. However, starting at episode 5, that cheetah crashes into a brick wall and stops dead in its tracks. The pacing of the show from then on out is a snail's pace, leaving the audience to wonder what the hell happened to the absurdity that this show opened up with. With all the ridiculousness that went on in episode 4, the show had nowhere to go but down in terms of mindless entertainment; it doomed itself. Of course, I don't mean to suggest that the ludicris pacing was something that the show should have tried to keep, because it was STUPIDLY fast, but I am saying that this show threw everything it had at us in the first 1/4th and then simply had nothing left. This brings me to my underling point: How in the hell did this happen?! I am not exaggerating when I say that I have never seen a more mystifying anomaly in anime writing EVER! It is the least consistent and most mind-boggling betrayal of story-telling 101 I've ever had the displeasure of gazing upon. So congratulations Black Bullet, you win the \"Worst Pacing Ever\" award.\\n\\n\r\nThe second reason that Black Bullet's plot is a failure would be that fact there is no consistent tone what so ever. I will refer you back to my opening paragraph to give you a taste of how truly bad this problem is\u2026  This anime is trying to tell a mature and emotionally moving story, but then they decide to lace it with super-happy-fun-time with lolis, a clich\u00e9 comedic tsundere romance, and then even more super-happy-fun-time with lolis. As if that wasn't bad enough, they do so without allowing ANY time at all for a gradual shift in mood; devastating shit that should have a huge effect on the characters and comedic relief happen within seconds of each other. News Flash: That doesn't work, and any writer worth the paper he prints the script on could tell you that. Did I mention that this show has a lot of lolis?\\n\\n\r\nThat brings us to the characters, who are a bit hard to explain. Rentaro, the protagonist, receives no real character development at any point despite the fact that the plot could not have been more perfectly set up for him to receive some. For example, there was a scene in episode 10 that should have made him completely reevaluate himself, but he simply doesn't; we just get a 30 second scene of him thinking and then it's right back to the original plotline. Black Bullet instead tries to characterize Rentaro by making him a total badass, and while he definitely has some badass moments, he also has some moments that are the complete opposite of badass, so there is no consistency to his character at all. He is not a good protagonist. His love interest is a stereotypical tsundere; there is literally not a speck of originality to her, so I'll just move on. Rentaro's partners, the \"cursed children\", aka the lolis, are unbelievably aggravating to me. Let it be noted that I hate lolis, but I won't let that bias get in the way of this review. Enju, one of the lolis, is in love with Rentaro and makes contrived sex joke after contrived sex joke despite the fact that she is 10 years old. Some people find this funny; I don't. The rest of the lolis all have stereotypical personalities and no depth what so ever, so there isn't much to talk about there. The lolis are aggravating because they are the main source of the tone issues that the show suffers from, which I talked about earlier. They almost single handedly kill any chance this show had of being taken seriously, which it clearly is striving to do.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the fact that the characters are remarkably unspectacular, they also have very poor chemistry with one another. One of the cornerstones of the plot is that Rentaro and Enju are very close to each other, and you want to know how we are supposed to know they are so close? Because we got a 15 second flashback scene that showed us how close they were. ...I mean\u2026 Really? They can't be serious, can they? Well, they most certainly are. Not a single relationship in Black Bullet is believable or relatable by any stretch of the imagination, and that can be attributed to the awful pacing of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot of Black Bullet is awful and the characters leave a lot to be desired, it should be noted that the animation is good and the music is AMAZING. The show's OP and ED are both among the best of this season and the OST is very fitting for the show. The voice acting is also above average. Unfortunately, none of this is enough save the show from the slew of other problems that Black Bullet suffers from, and I do mean SUFFERS.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Black Bullet is an action seinen that completely lacks direction on all fronts; both in its plot and in its characters. It has some redeeming factors and can be good for some mindless fun at times, but  it comes across as an absolute disaster more often then not. Good music and animation save this anime from being unwatchable, but I certainly do not recommend it. There are many better seinen anime out there.",

            "content": "Black bullet is a anime that was adopted from a light novel. This series was being compare to attack on titan, or being called a copycat to attack on titan, but that can't be true since attack on titan isn't the first nor last to have these kind of story and settings. Coming into this series, it had a lot of hype from people who read the light novel or the manga. What most people didn't realize is that it would be adopted into 13 episodes which would mean the pacing would be rushed. So lets begin, I'll be reviewing this series in five category,story,art,sound,character and enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10: The story is about humans being forced to live in a small territory because of the attack of viral parasites named Gastrea. Now with this series just having 13 episodes, that means a lot of story progression would be lost and rushed. The thing that I find odd in this series is that The theme of the story is about humanity is on the verge of extinction, but I never get the impression that humanity is on the verge of extinction by huge bugs and that there is some sort of survival going on  here. Nobody cares about it. In fact, we don\u2019t even see the population having anything to say about that, since the plot centers on the protagonist. If they had shown a few bugs attacking people even that would be enough. Just to give us viewers that humanity really is under a threat. I don't know if this is the flaw of the story itself or just because the series was rushed and a lot of things were taken out from the light novel.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: Art is pretty good, and nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: The sound is pretty good, I downloaded a few ost to listen to, I like the ost. I also like the opening is anyone getting a attack on titan feel to that opening or is it just me?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10: The characters are pretty bland and two dimmensional. Each character has different personalities but what I find annoying is how easy the characters mood changes, like one moment everyone is sad then a minute later everyone is all happy, I personally think this series would've been way better if  lolis were not in it. also Enju is pretty annoying, when she calls out to Rentarou it makes me *facepalm* and just sometimes put me off and give me a different mood towards this series. Each characters also have a dark/sad past which can make it a little overwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: I have to say with all the flaw and paced of this series, I did have a lot of fun watching it, the actions were short, but pretty good with the   epic soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\noverall: This series would've been so much better if it was adopted into 24 episodes instead of 13 episodes. I'm not a light novel or manga reader but even I can tell the pacing was rushed. Light novel readers has also confirmed my speculation. Well what can I say about this series, if you like lolis and want a series with good action and great soundtrack, then you should give black bullet a shot. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Black Bullet is the latest and not so greatest over hyped action series to grace our screens. I'm sure many of you would have heard the saying \"Why didn't they ride the eagles into Mordor\", well Black Bullet is the epitome of that saying. \r\nThe story is very bad, it's full of clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9, the main character is yet another super special high school kid and the world revolves solely around his actions. He isn't just another gear in the machine of society, he is the one turning them, one Yuki Kaji shounen power up scream at a time. \r\nWhat makes some high schoolkid with a loli by his side and a handgun shoved down the back of his pants better than thousands of trained soldiers? Nothing, but the plot wills it and it even fire special bullets capable of killing the monsters of the show, not even the Army seems to have access to that ammunition in Black Bullet. They even build 300 metre tall monoliths made out of the same material as Rentaro's ammunition, but yet thousands of trained soldiers are incapable of fighting the Gastrea that a bunch of sword and handgun wielding teens ad lolis are easily able to defeat.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterisation is horrible and clich\u00e9, Tendo Kisara the main love interest (if you could call her that) jumps between being an emotional wreck, a jealous lover and a calm and collected psychopath. The main character, Satomi Rentaro, doesn't even have three ranges of emotion, he's either a bland self insert or an angry, sometimes bewildered, shounen protagonist and there is nothing in between the two.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nothing special, it was average at best and did nothing to try and  stand out in any way. The animation was decent enough, it stayed on model for most of the time and again didn't really stand out compared to any other action shounen. The action scenes themselves were pretty average, one shot firing gun, next shot exploding monsters and behind the monster as it gets sliced up, etcetera etcetera. The CG was below average, it looked plasticky and didn't fit into the overall visual look of the series. At least the CG wasn't as bad as KyoAni's dragon from the Chuunibyou movie, so they get points for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was nothing special, standard fast paced actiony stuff, but it failed to make the action scenes any more enthralling (Pro tip: they weren't). The sound effects were nothing special, the guns sounded like the regular anime pop guns and so did the swords. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I did not enjoy watching this series at all. All I could think about were the inconsistencies in the story, setting, characters and how many \"why didn't they ride the eagles into Mordor\" moments happening on my screen. If you want to watch an action shoot 'em up, there are a lot of other anime that are leagues better than Black Bullet ever hoped to be. At least the Yanagi Nagi end credits song was nice, unlike the rest of the series.",

            "content": "Black Bullet. I went into this series with a bit of skepticism: Will this series, which seems to focus on human morals and values within the context of a war between the humans and \"them\", in which case, the Gastrea, achieve their message, loud and clear, in its measly 13 episodes of length? Much like previously released anime like Elfen Lied, Higurashi no naku koro ni, and Psycho Pass, that are well known for their darker settings that serve to illustrate a concept of humanity put to the test, Black Bullet incorporates a similar dark setting, with the apocalypse of the human race at stake,and themes like segregation and the definition of justice, which, in theory, should bring out a creation that goes beyond just \"a tv series\", and becomes a work of literature.\\n\\n\r\nMy skepticism was well-founded, however, and as I continued to watch the show, it continued to grow, along with my distaste for the show's repeated mishaps.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nBlack Bullet's story, while darker than your usual action-oriented plot, eventually devolves into just another shounen-resembling story that believes that \"any plot twist will make watchers drop their jaws in awe and instantly believe that it's an interesting and well-executed plotline.\" Unfortunately, that fact isn't true, and whereas Black Bullet really tried to incorporate a complicated plot involving a little bit of politics, along with plenty of action and \"character building moments\", the sheer amount of predictable plot developments, along with contrived plot twists made the plot into something that didn't even really matter anymore - all that mattered in the end was watching the loli's fight the insects.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art was one of the only parts of the anime that I enjoyed, and that isn't an understatement. It was appealing to watch the action take place - though some fights were a lot shorter than they could have been, the animation during those fights was fluid and sharp, and I could see most of the particles and special effects that really make a science-fiction oriented action scene worth watching. Studio Orange did a pretty good job, and while sometimes, the backgrounds didn't look as sharp or clear as they could have been, the majority of the more important features were well done, and I didn't really have any trouble differentiating between who was who or what was going on.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe majority of the sound effects were fairly well handled - it never sounded too cluttered or too spread apart, and the opening and ending sequences were catchy. The opening really did remind me of Attack on Titan's first opening theme, and what with all the similarities between the two shows, I really can't say that it's just a coincidence, but I'll leave it at that...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nOne of the biggest issues this show had was the amount of fan-pandering it produced, solely off the characters that they chose utilize. Whereas a main character that can do anything and everything, taking bullet after bullet while pulling a Rambo to eventually take his enemies out is fun to watch, it doesn't really serve as a character - a living and breathing human being. In the case of Satomi Rentaro, it takes away his potential of being a main character people can relate to in order to empathically understand any overarching theme present in the series - which serves to make it harder to get it at all. In addition, the existence of superpowered loli half gastrea half human waifus 1. isn't explained and 2. isn't relevant to the plot except to provide the occasional joke or be the direct trigger for a sad emotional reaction when they die. The only interesting character was the masked man, only because his ideals are twisted, and not what you'd usually see in a series, making him unique amongst a cast of cardboard cutouts and tropes you can find anywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nThere were way too many cases of Pilot's Love Song, in which they would introduce characters, simply to have them die to invoke emotional response from the audience, as well as Guilty Crown and Mirai Nikki type plot twists, both which I dread. Overall, the series felt very contrived, and upon closer inspection, much of the plot that is in between the spaces of the giant overarching story didn't make much sense, and weren't exciting or fun to watch. They tried a little too hard catering fanservice to the audience, when the series would have been fine without it, and probably would have been less distracting as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nAll in all, I enjoyed this anime MUCH less than I expected to, considering it had all the pieces it needed to create a masterpiece that actually mattered and would influence what I thought about a certain value or moral, or would make me question \"what if I were in that situation, how would I react.\" In the end, it turned out to be a lackluster show that simply had too many flaws and distracted too much from the main message for me to give it a higher rating, or even to say that \"wow, I learned something from this show\" or \"wow, this show really showed me something that I've never wondered about before, maybe I should rethink it.\" Heck, the series didn't even let me enjoy my lolis, without having them die sporadically.",

            "content": "Black Bullet \u2013 an anime about lolis saving the world from the big bad monsters out to eat you alive. Or yet by a more literal way of saying it, they are actually young kids known as the Cursed Children with special abilities capable of fighting against Gastrea, the monsters that threatens humanity and its existence. Based off a light novel of the same name, shows like this has an incentive to go a variety of ways with this. The result? A mediocre bag of an adaptation clustered with mind bobbling antics.\r\nThe premise initially sounds interesting, taking place in a futuristic setting in the yearof 2031 (ten years after humanity were beaten by the Gastrea ). Humanity lives behind walls of monolithic material for survival. To fight off the Gastrea, we get the cursed children playing the roles of \u201cinitiator\u201d with a partner known as \u201cpromoter\u201d in a sort of mentor/student relationship for combat units. Black Bullet tells the story of a young promoter named Rentaro Satomi and his roles against the Gastrea. \\n\\n\r\nOpening the doors to the BB world requires takes some enduring to get through. By all means, the show has a serious premise but saturated with generics. For instance, the story begins quickly enough to illustrate the grim reality of their world. Even the main male protagonist, Rentaro had a tragic past when he lost his parents. As for the cursed children themselves, none of them have a true loving family with a normal mother and father. Here though, we get Enju, a ten year old assigned to Rentaro as an Initiator. Tossing age differences aside, there is hardly anything we can compare about the two in terms of similarities besides their tragic past. Yet, this isn\u2019t something we should entirely feel sympathetic about. After all, it is war and dangers are constant so losses shouldn\u2019t be something to be surprised about. The other point is that the current relationship between Rentaro and Enju can be described as lively and charming. While on missions, they are focused but at home seems to be relaxed more than ever, at least for Enju anyways. And this is where the show drops the ball on its grim atmosphere. For one thing, Enju never ceases to throw herself at Rentaro all the while making suggestive poses, innuendos, and trying to have a relationship with him. It\u2019s outright awkwardly executed and badly performed despite the initially promising premise. In retrospect, it spirals into a path of jokey nonsense like a flippant screwball.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s just the opening stages though as Black Bullet likes to base its story with other characters all focused into the war against Gasetra. Although not a cursed child, we get the typical childhood friend Kisara who has known Rentaro since he was a kid. This sets forward the basis of a love triangle. But like the way the show goes, it\u2019s hard take it seriously when her competition is a 10 year old. But besides that, Rentaro seems to actually show response to her advances. All while this is happening, Enju\u2019s own plans are left useless. It\u2019s like she really is cursed or something with little or no hope of a loving relationship with Rentaro. And if that would occur, it would be quite an uneasy relationship to deal with as Enju\u2019s lack of common sense becomes a source of compromising exhibitions. The endgame is to not expect any romance development in this show as it neglects this phase. It just wouldn\u2019t work with the show\u2019s circumstances and potential death flags. However, do expect the usual clich\u00e9s, uncanny jokes, and whirlwind of fan service.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all the mind bobbling gags going on, the show does have a solid style of delivering its grimmer side of its premise. The antagonists looks serious with their egos and intimidating personalities. The Gasetra rides off of fear and delivers this effectively with their menacing actions. For the government, it also seems their research and development is trying to do what it needs for the survival of humanity. On an even darker scale, there\u2019s prejudice against Cursed Children in a similar way that gives off Elfen Lied-esque nostalgia. Indeed, society ostracizes cursed children and treats them like experiments and trash. The flashbacks between Rentaro and Enju shows this clearly during their first encounter that shows how fearful humanity is towards the Cursed Children. The logic here is that the Cursed Children has some of its blood pumping in their veins while results in their unfortunate discrimination. At the same time, death is real and the show paints this reality with gruesome exits for some of its characters. The result of this often involves bloodshed, limbs being destroyed, and lives eradicated simply because they are no longer human. The Cursed Children themselves even have malevolent-like features such as their scarlet eyes. It creates a sense of fear but what people don\u2019t know is the true visage of some of its characters. Children, after all often lack common sense and people take advantage of them to implode their nature. Police brutality adapts this concept into play resulting in very ghastly consequences. The point is, the show does keep promise with what it sticks to \u2013 the dark story in a world with Gastrea and cursed lolis.\\n\\n\r\nWhile all the antagonists are cunningly designed that are convincing, their purpose and motivations lacks any sort of interest. We get dangerous promoters such as Kagetane that kills others as a way to steam up interest as a villain. But really, his character lacks any sort of insight of development. It\u2019s stereotypical even by his design such as his psychopathic gestures and shadowy mask. And because the Gastrea are literally mindless, don\u2019t expect any sort of characterization from any of them, not even from database standards besides for just what they are. As for other antagonists, they are clich\u00e9 including corrupt individuals and predictable outcomes just based on what they are from the surface. One dimensional and desperate is how the show tries to increase interests towards viewers but ultimately results in a cheesy set up molded like a lazy piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while the show deals with many complicated concepts, the characters follows a surprisingly pragmatic and idealistic approach. For instance Rentaro fights like it\u2019s he is doing it for the rights of humanity rather than what he thinks personally. Judgment is left stranded in a fog as characters follows a path of experimental ways of dealing with threats. Their primary motivation is survival and the result. That\u2019s what it really manners in the end. Long story short: the show suffers from development between characters as result of this approach. And even though certain characters does live, developments feels goofy, childish, and occasionally gives off the wrong message leading to compromising positions. Not to mention, Rentaro somehow stirs up multiple interests of the opposite sex throughout the show where it almost enters a harem-like concept. But really though, the how creates a multitude layer of bizarre balance when it comes to its execution. Sometimes, it follows its story strictly while other times goofs off with its badly executed comedy. The story itself also suffers from adaptation as certain arcs have way too many things happening all at once. While this is not entirely surprising as result of LN adaptations, some resolutions are far too abrupt that will leave questions into viewers\u2019 minds. It\u2019s just too damn rushed.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is standard on most parts although visually wise, most of it is impressive based on its setting. The OP and ED songs has a dreamlike atmosphere to its backgrounds while the sequences balances decent amount of imagery. There\u2019s certain parts of the show that can remind people of Attack on Titan despite the contrasting settings. But character designs wise, the Cursed Children can come as a mixed bag. They come as more of the package with adorableness and badass. Do take emphasis on their scarlet eyes though as the show takes a special interest to clearly identify them with their roles. On other hand, Gastera\u2019 mutation sequences are gruesome to the core with their gimmick. They take on various forms but all of them shows the same brutality. Otherwise, most of the other character designs are moderate enough whether it\u2019s Rentaro\u2019s well-trained figure or Kisara\u2019s spaghetti hair. The fan service is there though with it even being openly addressed on many occasions. You can thank the lack of common sense for that. Don\u2019t blame the Cursed Children. Blame common sense.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly though, the soundtrack is one of the more dynamic strengths of the show. As a technical feature, it is quite impressive during action sequences when it intensely draws out its delivery. Characters such as the Cursed Children also balances their voice tones to demonstrate their loneliness and sorrow. Even Enju, despite her cherry self, shows this side of her when she feels antagonized. And while dialogues feels stale and cheesy, the humor behind them is to the point without any sort of mystery. We also get emotional appeal with its musical scores. Beyond that, the OP and ED songs shows a melancholy that is spiritually gripping. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not mindless entertainment when taking Black Bullet\u2019s story for granted. But most times, this show borders on into a field of absentmindedness. It just feels like the show has this engaging premise but not entirely sure what to do with it. With its rushed story also brings a cast of cute girls with scarlet\u2019s eyes doing government\u2019s work. However, I do give some credit to the technical field especially when it comes to soundtrack. The experience of that is enticing with something to write home about. Yet ultimately when it comes down to it, this show is not too much different than junk food. When you eat it, you might just forget how it tastes like afterwards. \\n",

            "content": "Right! \r\nThis is my first review here so please spare me internet while I add to the huge ocean of random stuff!\r\nBlack Bullet was a show that I picked up after watching Guilty Crown and its fair to say if you liked that you'll like this. I hasten to add I would never claim Guilty Crown is good, but it is fun, and we all like to have fun do we not?\r\nSo was Black Bullet fun or a disaster? Lets see!\r\nStory-3\r\nMy impression of Black Bullets story was of a director trying too hard. Calling someone a Try-hard should not be taken as an insult however.The plot seemed to be trying to fit in every dramatic plot twist from every other show ever in a 13 episode series. Action! School Drama! Love triangles (or more like a hexagon or dodecagon if you're fussy)! Revenge! Apocalypse! Robots! Zombies! Politics! Persecution! Loli! Look how cute the Loli are!Loli!\\n\r\nThe story was in general quite a mess with supposedly dramatic events being thrown at the screen and never explained. My favorite being the tricycle from episode 4 which was never explained. However it did set up some impressively epic events which I enjoyed the scope of so its not a total loss.\\n\r\nIn short most of humanity is dead, and trapped within cities surrounded by giant monoliths, built to keep the mysterious monsters created by the Gastrea virus out of the city. The best weapon humanity has are the Cursed Children, children born from mothers infected by the Gastrea and born super strong and intelligent and guided by promoters, similarly talented adults. \\n\r\nIn shorter, sounds pretty cool.    \\n\\n\r\nArt-7\\n\r\nIt looked pretty good.\\n\r\nWait I need to write more?\\n\r\nOkay compared to most stuff coming out this year it compared fairly well. There were some very noticeable sudden drops in quality and the CGI for the Gastrea was awful.\\n\r\nThe colour palate was quite varied and the character design fairly solid with the lolis especially getting a lot of attention. And (I flinch as I say this) they were drawn adorably at times. I swear half their art budget went on making those work. \\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nActually somewhere where the show shone. The OP and ED were both pretty solid with the OP being maybe my favorite of the season. The animation for the OP however was pretty poor using mostly frames taken from the show and the first version being much better synched with the music. The ED was done significantly better in that regard. I did feel the OP borrowed slightly from AoT's but hey that was a good OP.\\n\r\nThe background music was also pretty good.I especially enjoyed the jazz theme that played with Tina Sprout and Enju's theme also.\\n\r\nI don't speak Japanese but the voice acting seemed good as well. They had a couple of my favorite VA's including Yui Horie (Hanekawa, Kouko and Minori) and Yuki Kaji (Eren from AoT and Shu from Guilty Crown). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters-3\\n\r\nCharacters really suffered in this show. most received essentially no development and there were a significant number a times where I was being shown an emotional scene and just thinking \"I don't care\". The bare levels of characterization that were set down were at times simply ignored and, even worse, sometimes brought back an instant later like nothing had happened. Again more time to actually show the journey the characters made would've been nice.   \\n\r\nAs I might have alluded to previously a biggest problem I had with the show was the Loli aspect. I object to the idea of Loli in general but that's fine. Why else do you watch anime except for something a bit different? Loli can be done well (see bakemonogatari) and it can be funny and adorable. However the sheer number of Loli characters all wanting to get boned by an 20 year old... nope. Not cool.\\n\r\nThe leads were not entirely terrible. The Lead Lead Rentaro (definitely a phrase) was actually very solid being a step beyond the typical harem -insert your name here- character and actually showed quite a degree of compassion and awareness of the girls around him. He was a typical badass with a bit of filling. Enju, Rentaro's partner, was also fairly solid at times balancing the frailty of a young child thrown into a brutal situation quite well with sudden ability to bounce back typical of a child. And unlike the rest she did at least have a reason to love the main character. But as mentioned before important events seem to just disappear in characters minds rather than scaring them for life. I'm evil I enjoy that stuff.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-8\\n\r\nDespite all I've said I really quite enjoyed this show. There was a fairly equal balance between \"This is awesome\" and \"This is stupid\" moments but the awesome was fairly awesome and the stupid was so stupid it was kinda fun. \\n\r\nHowever I would not recommend this unless you have pretty good stupidity filters. The change from solemn coolness to forced romance Loli loving can be very jarring. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-5\\n\r\nMal says it all. Mediocre.\\n\r\nIts not rubbish (well maybe it is) and its certainly not great. However it is fun and I would say if you have a rainy day and nothing else you particularly want to watch then this will fill a gap. Expect fun not a masterpiece. \\n\r\nAlso if you like Tetsuro Araki then this is definitely the show for you. The whole thing feels like a huge homage to his work.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Black Bullet is, as many people have said before, similar to Attack on Titan in a way. Though instead of titans you have these huge bug like creatures called Gastrea, and its set in the future in Japan rather than an older style civilization. However the biggest difference between the 2 shows is that Attack on Titan is actually very good, where as this is just...eh. \r\nStory (6)\r\nThe story as I mentioned before is, on paper, pretty similar to Attack on Titan. Humanity at the brink of extinction. Huge monsters that killed someone in the protagonist's family. A city inside of a barrier. But that'smainly where most of the blatant similarities stop. The main character, Rentaro is apparently half robot as well...also there's these lolis that are infected by the Gastrea or something and they like partner up with people like Rentaro and fight because now they have powers?...Also there's this villain that kinda fucks around inside the barrier and there's also other places other than Japan or something? \\n\\n\r\nI don't know, the plot of this show I feel jumps around waaay to much and there's just too much going on at once, not the mention the pacing is basically terrible. There's a climatic episode like halfway through the season and it just really feels out of place and weird. I feel like the story lacked a lot of focus. The Gastrea were interesting but you hardly ever even see them until later on. They come off as barely having to do with the plot. Where as, with Attack on Titan, you're always reminded of them, and they are shown quite often. Hell, even the name of the show has barely anything to do with it. Rentaro shot his gun with \"black bullets\" like once in the whole show and that was in the first episode. Same with the whole him being a robot, I even forgot about that later on. I feel like there was a lot of lack of focus and proper pacing here.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention, there's a lot of brutal deaths is this show, mainly of little girls which I find very disturbing. I guess its not automatically a bad thing but I feel like every death, especially of little girls just felt very sudden and uncalled for. A lot of them where just forgotten quickly after so it didn't even feel like that really mattered.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it got more interesting by the end, but even the last episode had some pacing issues if you ask me. \\n\\n\r\nArt (7)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. Not much to say here. Weird CGI that seems somewhat out of place but that's how most CGI is. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8)\\n\\n\r\nThe music and voice acting is over all pretty solid. The voice actor of Eren from Attack on Titan also voices Rentaro, and he does a pretty good job. The opening is very good as well as the ending, (though halfway through they changed the opening while keeping the song and the new opening wasn't quite as good). I'm also a fan of a lot of the background music as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6) \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fine I guess. My favorite would have to be the villain, though he's not shown that often after the first few episodes. Nobody else really stood out to me though. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6)\\n\\n\r\nI never really felt like watching this show most of the time and I just kind of forced myself to watch it when it came on just because I wanted to finish it. It had it's moments but over all its probably my least favorite show I watched this season. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (6)\\n\\n\r\nIt's alright and has it's moments, but there's really nothing that great here in terms of story in my opinion. If it really sounds like something you'd like, I'd say give it a shot, otherwise, I'd say just skip it.",

            "content": "Black Bullet is honestly in my opinion, one of the most overrated anime ever. Although it may not seem like the most popular anime, it's hype back in spring was pretty big, and I've seen reviews rating Black Bullet over an 8, which left me speechless. Black Bullet had a promising start sort of, but quickly it's plot just died away with no explanation of what's happening, my favorite character in the anime disappeared for half the show and the ending was plain rushed and made absolutely no sense. \r\nThe plot was \"eh\"; it was a mixture of Guilty Crown and Attack on Titans, whichseems amazing, but that was not the case. There are these monsters called Gastrea, that infect humans turning humans into monsters. Humanity is on the brink of extinction until they find Vibranium, the stuff dreams are made of\u2026 or nightmares when it comes to the Gastrea. Having found the Gastrea's kyptonite, humans have created walls/barriers and have created haven cities where they could live in peace. Outside these barriers were the cursed children, humans that were part Gastrea (monster). In this world of turmoil, Rentaro witnesses all the ugliness in it. Unfortunately for the human race the Gastrea have managed to break into the city somehow, and it's up to the main character Rentarou and his teammate Enju to save the day. And... that's it, the ending ends in a makes absolutely no sense cliffhanger and blah blah blah blah. The few characters and animation were the only bright spots in this anime. Enju and the other cursed children was a new interesting add, and the main protagonist was pretty badass which was nice, but then in the end he suddenly loses all his \"badassness\". Anyways overall the plot just gets worse and worse as it progresses, that's really all I have to say. The anime is kind of enjoyable hence the 5 \"average\" rating, but seriously I wouldn't recommend this to people looking for a \"good\" anime.",

            "content": "Action and Mystery. A common combination of genres, isn't it?\r\nBlack Bullet is an adaptation of its still ongoing Light Novel,  was announced last year, 2013. Then became a long-awaited series of 2014.\r\nAlthough, the main idea isn't too impressive or original if we want to put it like that, the plot has much more in store. To be precise, the story is rather fast-paced. It is basically some short stories put together into 13 episodes. And even though it's true that there was some sort of bridge between two 'short stories', it is very obvious that the staff just wanted too many elements in thesame place. Luckily, this doesn't spoil the whole atmosphere as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nThere were many truly good closing scenes which are suggestive and aditive to its genre. The thing is that many of these 'floating ideas' could as well have been used. But, they weren't. Most of them were left unexploted and to be straightforward, I'm pretty sure that using these ideas instead could have made a 20% better story.\\n\r\nWith these said, however, there is one thing that I especially liked about the plot. That is the discussion of rarely mentioned and taught issues like discrimination, human inhospitality and cruelty. This little addition just made the everything twice as dramatic as it would otherwise be.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Black Bullet was at times breath-taking but in other cases it was rather mehish. But, whichever is the case, the art, without a doubt, matches the story and contributes well to the mood of it. The best example for this would be the openings; as they indeed served as a good 'programme guide'. They showed what you should expect of the series and determined the attribute of the characters, too.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters sometimes tended to prove themselves amazingly unnecessary. To me some of them seemed to be introduced because the other person who, simply put, had exactly the same traits won't turn up again. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, everybody's lives revolve around the protagonist's. The main of all characters, Rentaro Satomi in this universe is a god. And this actually is true from the first to the last word. Not only is he incredibly strong but he's also drop-dead gorgeos, has his harem of little girls and has two teen girls with respectable size of chest love him. But he's lacking one thing; common sense. This is what, in fact, refers to all of the charcters. By this, I mean that when an unforeseen event occurs nobody seems to pose questions like 'why?', 'how?' or just the most obvios one 'what?!'.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is character development. As a matter of fact, there isn't any. Well, there is but it is so short-term. People go through very sad and tear jerking event, these scenes were done brilliant, to be honest, and they are emotionally shaken.. For an episode. Then in the next episode they are as happy as ever. Unfortunatelly, this is also applicable to peronalities and behaviour displayed towards other characters. Just change overnight.\\n\r\nThis is so exposed to the viewers that this just ruins the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe very best reason I would recommend this anime for is the soundtracks. They are unbelievably catchy and something that remains on your mind for like a week. They match the particular scenes they are in.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there are many components that resemble things from real-life, many just really go in the face of nature.\\n\r\nThere are tons of hilarious moments which are worth re-watched. It's rather sad to say; that is all that increases the value of re-watching.\\n\r\nI believe that many good words could be said about Black Bullet but liking (or not liking) it comes down to the viewers only. This is a type of series that you either hate or like sort. It is highly unlikely that it leaves you without any feelings about it.",

            "content": "Let's start with the opening. If you've seen Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin), you'll notice that the opening music, art (and world-concept in general) are kind of really similar. I won't say it's a copy, you decide that for yourself. The opening was in my opinion not really fitting, that's all. \r\nAnyway, to get to the story line. I gave it a 6/10, because the story wasn't boring or tiring, it just wasn't really original. I realize that, in some dose, the creators gave thought into it, but everything was rushed to the limit where the timing became ridiculous. To cut it short, toomuch content was packed into a small number of episodes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were... well, okay. (6/10) They were too specific though, with clear behavioral patterns and only slight character development. No one actually surprised me. In the end there's, I suppose, some sort of cliffhanger, which was shortly after ruined, because the main character had to say something irrelevant about it. Let's say that everything is too obvious, and that's why the characters are just \"okay\". \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to enjoyment... it was good. I can't say that I didn't enjoy it. It didn't amaze me, but it's one of those random anime which bring up some feelings, even though you don't really bind with the characters. It's too bad that everything is rushed. I suppose I would have enjoyed it more if it was a 24-episode anime with slowed down plot and more (also better) character development. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but if you like little cute girls with superpowers... watch it.",

            "content": "\"This is a thousand monkeys working at a thousand typewriters. Soon, they'll have finished the greatest novel known to man.\" A quote from The Simpsons has never been so accurate, except that the monkeys didn\u00b4t end up writing a novel, they ended up writing the script for an anime adaptation. Oh, you don\u00b4t believe me do you?\r\nWell, that\u00b4s what reviews are for, to convince people that the series you are reviewing is either good or bad.\r\nSo with no further ado, this is The Neko and I welcome you to my review of the show, Black Bullet.\r\nThe premise of the show is quite simple, is theusual \"humanity\u00b4s last stand\" kind of plot, but I\u00b4don\u00b4t really care for originality as long as the story is well done. Is it well done? Well, look at the number on the side of this review, does it seem like I think it\u00b4s well done? If the answer is yes then you need to check your eyesight, \u00b4cause if you can\u00b4t see the number then I\u00b4m really worried about you.\\n\r\nThe thing about Black Bullet\u00b4s plot is that it tries to be \"dark\" and \"serious\" but also tries several times to have comedy and fanservice with lolis, because someone thought that having a lot of lolis in a \"dark\" and \"serious\" show was a great idea, and it has been proven before that trying to mix these two opposites just like that, doesn\u00b4t work, I cannot take something seriously like that. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. This series also has, like I said before a little problem with the script, and by little I mean a BIG problem with the script. You see, when you actually listen to the kind of things the characters say, sometimes you might think \"Boy, that line was really stupid\", because sometimes the things they say doesn\u00b4t have any logic on then, like there\u00b4s is no way that the kind of things these characters say, would be said by an actual and sane person. For example, all you need for a villain in this series to spit up all his plans, is just a simple question from our main protagonist, Rentaro. I can\u00b4t really put the stupidity in the script into words, it\u00b4s something that you have to experiment to understand, but for doing that, you have to watch the show, which I do not recommend. But this is not all, oh no no no no no. The other thing that this series has is plot holes, yep, as if it weren\u00b4t enough with the shitty script. For example in the first episode we see everyone in some kind of refugee camp being attack by the Gastrea, the monsters that are attacking Tokio this time, the scene afterwards everyone is safe and happy behind the Varanium walls, the Gastrea\u00b4s elemental weakness, but we don\u00b4t know how did that happened, how did they pass from \"total destruction\" to discovering that Varanium is super effective against Gastreas and having the time to build the Varanium structures?. And this is just ONE plot hole, because you can pretty much take a random episode and find them by dozens. The show also likes to make use of Deus ex-Machinas, I counted four in total, if someone has counted more, let me know and you will win an imaginary hug. How cool is that? It also has a terrible pacing, too rushed at the begging, too slow by the end. So this series pretty much makes every mistake it can do. You could say that I should turn my brain of and enjoy the series, but is my belief that if a show wants me to take it seriously, and believe me this series is desperate to prove that I should, I should have my brain in the on-mode. Also from episode 8 and forward the show losses any sense of action, and has also this thing for increasing it\u00b4s problems from episode to episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was pretty much above average for me. I really like the colour palette that they used in this show, it makes it look nice, but the animation itself has some drops here and there, where the framerate really goes down, it is pretty noticeable. But the worst part, is that later on the series they start to use CGI to animate the Gastreas, and it looks so bad, It\u00b4s like I could get eye cancer just from looking at them, it\u00b4s awful. Some character designs are  kinda good, except for Rentaro who is just a normal guy with a suit, Kisara who is the chick that uses a school uniform 24/7, and some of the lolis because in this show lolis have to belong to some kid of archetype and they dress as such, for example the Samurai Stereotype Loli will dress with, you guessed it, samurai clothes. About the designs that I like, they belong to either a secondary character that we don\u00b4t see too often anyway, or to Kagetane Hiruko the \"main\" villain, who actually seems creepy but elegant, just like a villain should look. The backgrounds are nothing out of this world but they are ok, nothing really AMAZING, but ok.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack though, that\u00b4s the best part of the series, which is actually kinda sad if you think about it. It mostly uses the techno music that anime likes to use so much this days, but it\u00b4s pretty kickass when there\u00b4s a Gastrea on the scene, but when there\u00b4s is not any Gastrea or any threat of any kind to our protagonists and the series flips to it\u00b4s more light-hearted side it becomes pretty forgettable, but when is good, IS GOOOD. On the voice acting side of the things, voices ranged from character to character, for example, Rentaro\u00b4s voice is done by Yuki Kaji the same guy who did the voice for Eren Jaeger fron Attack on Ti... damn it I really wanted to finish the review without mentioning Attack on Titan, there goes my record. Anyway his voice acting is pretty solid, too bad that he doesn\u00b4t have any actual good lines to say. The voice from the main villain Hiruko Kagetane is also masterfully done by Rikiya Koyama who also did the voices for Takamura from Hajime no Ippo and Emiya from Fate/Zero, need I say more?\\n\r\nOn the other hand we also have a secondary character, Shouma, whose voice actor, Shinichiro Miki, didn\u00b4t do the best of the job for this character in particular.\\n\r\nThis show has only one OP and ED, the only noteworthy being the opening. It\u00b4s a fripSide theme, so if you are a fan of their style of music you will probably like this one, and no, I will not talk about the \"similar to AoT\" chorus at the beginning of the song. The thing about the OP though, is that someone had the bright idea to change the animation of the OP for a more spoilerific version, and not only it doesn\u00b4t look as good as the original, it spoils LOTS of stuff, not that is really important since this is a kinda predictable show anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said the soundtrack was actually the best part of the series, so that kind of gives you an idea of what I think of the characters, doesn\u00b4t it?\\n\r\nI will focus mainly in the main four, Rentaro, Kisara, Enju and the \"main\" villain Kagetane.\\n\r\nRentaro is pretty much your typical shounen protagonist, which wouldn\u00b4t be that much of a problem is this show wasn\u00b4t a SEINEN. What is a clich\u00e9 battle shonen protagonist doing in a Seinen? Fuck if I know. But he is pretty much a walking clich\u00e9, he yells the name of every attack he throws, and he has some longass names in his sleeves, he practices some kind of martial art, he is the \"good\" guy, he can do no wrong, that\u00b4s Rentaro, and the only sense of development that this series has for him, is having him suddenly become a Gary Stu from episode 4, and that will be all the development for the rest of the series, you won\u00b4t find anymore of that here, plus Rentaro can be pretty stupid, and as such he is annoying and unlikeable.\\n\r\nKisara is mainly the romantic subplot, because this show needed that too, and is not exactly the best romantic subplot . Kisara is a Tsundere, and the only development she gets is, hear this, becoming a yandere in the last episode \u00a1Yay!\\n\r\nApart from that, and because of the fact that this show has a Gary Stu, they don\u00b4t really focus on her, and she doesn\u00b4t have that much screentime either, plus she is useless most of the time, so she is only there for the romantic subplot, great.\\n\r\nEnju is the \"main\" loli of the series and she pretty much embodies the archetype of the pervert loli, and is also the other romantic subplot, but this time for the lolicons. The thing that bothers me most about Enju is that even when her friends die RIGHT in front of her, no matter how many people discriminate her for being a \"Cursed Children\", no matter what problems may faze her, she just cries some minutes and then by the next episode she is the same exact pervert loli that she has always been. Really doesn\u00b4t she have some kind of trauma from all of that? \u00a1She is a freaking 10 year old! She should have some kind of trauma, or at least be depressed for days after that.\\n\r\nAnd then we have Kagetane, the \"main\" villain. If you were sharp enough you probably notice how I always write the word \"main\" between quotes, this is because in the case of Enju, the show just focus on her at the beginning, and then focus more on Rentaro since he is the Stu, but in the case of Kagetane I call him \"main\" villain because he is actually absent for most of the series, he has great presence at the beginning, then he disappears in episode 4, and reappears in episode 11, except that when he reappears he is not the villain anymore, he becomes another supporting character, and the show, again, chooses to focus more on Rentaro, which is sad because Kagetane was the only decent character, the only one with the decent dialogues, and he was a pretty decent villain, but that couldn\u00b4t last, not in this series. Something decent here? You might as well go look for a hentai that doesn\u00b4t show any boobs, it would be easier than finding something decent whether it\u00b4s in the story or the characters. In the meantime when Kagetane is not around they replace him with what I like to call \"Discount Villains\", which are by the way the worst characters in this series, which is actually quite a feat.\\n\r\nThe secondary characters in this series serve only one real purpose, TO DIE. If a secondary character doesn\u00b4t die then he is around doing nothing, and they don\u00b4t have any screen time, and as such I can\u00b4t really get to like them. Many of the secondary characters are lolis actually, and this show often kills them just for shock value, because in terms of personality each and every one of them fits into one specific archetype, whether it is the Samurai Loli, the Nekomimi Loli, the Shy loli, the Imouto Loli, you name it.\\n\r\nSo this shows follows something called the Theory of Moe Loli Replacement\u00ae (I am not the owner of this theory, all the rights belong to it\u00b4s respectful owner), in regards of the secondary loli characters. The Theory states that every time a loli dies in the series, she gets replaced by another one even more Moe in the next episode. This shows that this series only kills characters for shock value and as such, every character death, as everything in this series, is poorly executed.\\n\\n\r\nReading all this things must have made you think that I didn\u00b4t enjoy this show at all, doesn\u00b4t it?\\n\r\nAs a matter of fact I did enjoy this show, but not for the reasons that it\u00b4s creators intended. The thing is that is show is in the category of \"so bad that it is actually good\", is just fun to see all the poor death executions, all the shitty dialogue, all the clich\u00e9 characters, pointing them out and then laugh, A LOT. But as a show that tries to entertain for it\u00b4s story and characters it fails, horribly.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Judgement:\\n\r\nBlack Bullet is a show that failed at everything it tried, becoming rather funny at how someone actually thought about making all of this. It\u00b4s story tries to be \"dark\" and \"serious\", but is just dumb and full of plot holes, Deus Ex-Machinas, comedy and even loli fanservice, \u00b4cause why the fuck not? So it cannot be taken seriously, it\u00b4s characters have no real development and, except for Kagetane, they were all either unlikeable or the show didn\u00b4t have any focus on them, and Kagetane, the only decent character, is absent for most of the series.\\n\r\nAnything that this series has that is actually decent, in regards of story and characters, just gets screwed sooner or later, a show that is only recommended for those looking for a show that\u00b4s in the \"so bad that it\u00b4s good\" level.\\n\\n\r\nThis has been The Neko and I hope you have a pleasant day.",

            "content": "Black bullet is probably one of the anime that got a lot of attention since it share a same atmosphere with Shingeki no Kyojin which is despair, humanity in the edge and dark themes. As the shingeki have finished airing, the emergence of black bullet is surely gives a lot of viewer have a great expectation on this anime. Some sites says this anime is a successor of shingeki. But does it really true? I would say not.\r\nBlack bullet is an anime that been package with thriller action and dark themes. The story is about when humanity was in the near extinct and living insmall territory because monsters or parasites called Gastrea. Gastrea is not only killed people but also infected people, the people who have been attacked by gastrea have a high probability become one of them and so, humanity must struggle with that monster.\\n\\n\r\nAs the summary tells, it sounded awesome. Beforehand, Black bullet itself is an adaptation from light novel which people usually tends to have a great expectation since light novel is usually have more details in telling the story. But it wasnt happen, the story has  plotholes and moreover feel rushed. 13 Episodes is doesnt enough to cover the story. As the story with thriller feeling, how the story progress is one of the key to make viewers feel the atmosphere. But in the end,  it felt like the story drags the viewers to follow their fast paced story without telling what happen on that scene in detail and leaves a big question.\\n\\n\r\nWell, the story is not always serious, they have some cute and funny things to lighten up this story. Well, its not weird since Shiden Kanzaki previous work is romance comedy. The jokes that happen is pretty funny but since the anime themes is struggling and despair, the joke feels like out of the place.  For your info, the MC aka Rentarou have a pair named Enju which is loli. Some lovey-dovey things that happen is a little bit annoying. Why do we need to see a lovey dovey when we know that we\u2019re struggling with monsters. There isnt any coherence when this anime talks about humanity in the edge but they put some lovey-dovey jokes.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the story, the art in this anime is quite \u201cnormal\u201d for some action anime. When there is a battle, the effect is quite good, not so sparkly and they keep it as not too excessive. The background is quite detailed for an action anime and one thing to notice is how the art is suitable with the themes with the anime, the coloring in this anime is quite dark and blur which makes the despair and fear feels intensively being felt.\\n\\n\r\nOther things to notice in this art is how the design of each characters.  Sometimes the characters design isnt consistent. When watching this, i cant help to notice that in every scenes they draw the characters so badly like how Kisara\u2019s boobs shape, its quite weird and really bothering. Its  something that doesn\u2019t bode too well for an action/fantasy series such as this. In the end, there isnt something to being prominent except how the coloring that really brings the feel of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist in this anime is Kentaro and Enju, they\u2019re always being considered as a couple though its just a claim from Enju not from the both sides. Kentaro as the main character in this anime is like the other main character which is have a justice feeling and would help anyone, He also has a kind heart, calm demeanor, and comes across as brother type as what he does to Enju. Enju, in the other hand is like young sister type, differ from Kentaro, Enju see Kentaro as her couple and do what she can to get an attention. Actually this is quite interesting too see the relationship between them throughout the series. They way how they interact with each others is quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nIf there are things that awesome from this anime, it was their sound. From, the opening song this anime have Fripside with their song \u201cBlack Bullet\u201d. This song is tremendous, the gospel in this song is really enchanting and gives me a goosebumps, its quite epic song and one of the best opening song in spring 2014. Aside from the opening song, the soundtrack is great too. Its no wonder since its been arranged by Sagisu Shirou who is responsible for Evangelion, Berserk, and Magi. This time, he also made it with his music in this anime.  Its increasing the intensity feeling and quite catchy. But sadly, sometimes this soundtrack song is overly used and repetitive. It makes the song losing its taste and being plain.\\n\\n\r\nBeside the soundtrack, the seiyuu also what makes this anime more better with their voice. We got Kaji Yuki known for his voice as Eren Jaeger and also Yui Horie who known as singer and seiyuu for Hanekawa Tsubasa in Monogatari series\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this anime is not what are people expected, if we\u2019re talking about quality its just so far from Shingeki which people tends to relate this anime and of course, not all people would dislike it, some people would find this anime is interesting. This anime is good in some way and people who likes tragedy, dark themes and loli, this anime would be a great show for you.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Black Bullet is amazing, an amazing failure of a series with decent potential at its start. \r\nBlack Bullet is an anime, an anime with great potential that ultimately transformed into shambles of disappointment. Many have been comparing Black Bullet to Attack on Titan but of course, Black Bullet is intrinsically different and distinct in its own right.\r\nThe story revolves around humanity and their suppression due to the dominance and superior existence of viral parasites named Gastrea.  As humanity is left with no alternatives but to be exiled into small territory and to coexist with terror and despair, the world should evidently be indeeda dark and tragic place to live in. To survive, the loli army, I mean the cursed children are prime and vital to combat the Gastrea and are humanity\u2019s ultimate weapon born from women who have been infected by the Gastrea.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are merely bland and tedious to be the main focus of the show. Satomi Rentarou is the archetype of an indomitable, well preserved and determined male character which has been utilised throughout anime history in countless of shows. Having the best plot-armor possible, he\u2019s pretty strong in combat too. Another character in the harem, I mean cast, Enju, the notable orange hair little loli girl is energetic to the max and does not know when to keep her mouth shut at times. Enju constantly mentions her wish to marry Rentarou, that being said, it is only normal for her to have a few rivals. One of them is Kisara Tendo, the president of the agency Satomi works for and also apparently is Satomi\u2019s childhood friend, a good use of the childhood friend clich\u00e9 to add a woman with a big chest to the crew. Another main character is Tina Sprout, another loli in the group of friends who fight against the Gastrea, with sniping skills of a God and the body of a 5 year old girl, she also takes a hinted liking to Satomi Rentarou. And for the rest of the loli cursed children army characters, let\u2019s just say, never mind. \\n\\n\r\nDespite each character containing different personalities and traits, one factor largely affects the seriousness of the show, and that is the constant implementation of forced humour. The show is just ineffective in setting its own atmosphere, coming into the series; a person looking at the synopsis would come into Black Bullet believing that the show is serious and dark heavily. Scenes can be tragic and upsetting at times, leaving the audience to feel and express sympathy to the characters; however these sentimental moments are easily hindered and obstructed a few seconds later with unnecessary comedy. Being on the brink of extinction, the vibrant and lively atmosphere the cast give off does not blend in well with the plot. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s like mixing sugar with salt. It just doesn't work well.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a one-cour show, the show evidently suffers from lack of character growth and development and is bound to leave out some scenes from the original source material. The pacing transcends too quickly after the first episode and near the final few episodes of the show, it is amazingly obvious how rushed and butchered Black Bullet has become. No justice served for the source material. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is vibrant and bright most of the time despite the supposed dark tone the plot gives off. Despite the contradiction, it is enjoying and nice to look at. However, honestly it makes the viewers hard to take the show seriously because of the liveliness when humanity is on the verge of extinction. The animation and visuals during action scenes do not make the show stand out amongst other shows with decent action scenes. The CGI utilised alongside the Gastrea are used awkwardly and are not pleasant to look at which I believe sometimes fits their design well as they are not meant to look aesthetically attractive and appealing being viral parasites.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the show is probably the single best aspect of the show. Having the OP sung by fripside and the ED songs sung by Yanagi Nagi, personally one of my favourite Japanese female singers, they added a new substance to the show and made it more enjoyable. Sadly, the background music being catchy is used too many times and not always at the most appropriate moment, losing its uniqueness, style and substance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you want a serious and tragic show with a dark atmosphere, I do not recommend touching Black Bullet. However, if you love little girls, sure, dive in. Or if you just have lots of time, sure, dive in. Besides some decently executed moments, don\u2019t go in with expectations as high as the Eifel Tower as you will only come out as the world\u2019s shortest skyscraper. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Stepping into the world of Black Bullet, I was only told of negative things and not to expect much from a \"Lolis save the world\" kind of show. Unfortunately enough, a lot of what I heard held true, but not everything and those little girls weren't apart of that problem.\r\nBlack Bullet essentially is an anime that tries hard to breach the conventional post-apocalyptic human-survival setting, but is unable to do so. The show gets stuck at a crosswalk confused if it wants to do something different or stick with the same formula. Perhaps Black Bullet's greatest vice is the pacing, which is abnormally quick. Evenfor those whom have not read the light novel(such as myself) can painfully see when the chain of events are simply moving too quick for us to follow and understand. Although, while it had several cons and rough edges, it did have a few positives as well. \\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nWe're pretty much given the standard 'humanity struggling for survival against a mysterious alien race'(The mysterious alien race here is the Gastrea), in Black Bullet, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if executed correctly, but BB does not deliver exceptionally well when it came down to execution. As any story, Black Bullet attempted taking a concept that is well-known, adding their own flair to it by making Humanity's last hope the little girls. Oddly enough, this is where a lot of the negative stigma has come from and I don't think those accusations are rightly justified. When uncovering the reasoning and digging deeper into the plot, it actually seems interesting on how and why the world's fate is in the hands of little girls. It tries to question morals and how society may see those whom are different than the rest, but it just doesn't dabble much into that when it should have. The real big problem though becomes the pacing of the show. The anime for the most part was terribly paced, it went through many events and climatic moments in a heartbeat, giving an unsettle feeling of, \"What? It's over already?\" and leaving several questions unanswered. Although the pacing slightly does get better towards the end, it becomes far too late for it to save the show and unfortunately, the characters are severely affected by this too. We'll pick at the characters more later though.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): \\n\r\nLooking beyond the mountain of problems with Black Bullet, it does have its positives and the art is one aspect of that. The scenery, characters and Gastrea are all well-done and can actually be impressive when it came down to the action. I also think that many people whom are more interested in the characters will be pleasantly surprised as each character does have their distinct look and they're all for the most part appealing. It seems more obvious than not that they paid far more attention to how Black Bullet looked than other important details. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nOnce again, it felt as though the studio focused on making sure the anime sounded good as well and it did. Whether it was making sure the Gastrea sounded as disgusting and beastly as possible, giving some 'beef' to the sound of guns, music to set the mood and so-forth it was all rather pleasing and well-done, but it just feels unfortunate that while Black Bullet sounds good and looks good it lacks in other departments. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\\n\r\nAs any anime, it's important to present a worthy cast to the viewer otherwise the plot would fall apart and the audience would lose interest. You could have the strangest and most terrible plot, but if you give a show great characters it would thrive. In the case of Black Bullet, which provides a wide array of characters in a meager 13 episodes, it's a lot of misses with a few done right fortunately enough. During the story segment of my review I talked about how the pacing affects the characters drastically and that's what their downfall is. Black Bullet is able to deliver to us plenty of characters that seem very interesting when we're introduced to, but because of how quickly events are moved none of these characters get a big chance to become something more. The main focus is always on our MCs, Rentaro and Enju, so for the majority of the time we'll be watching them. This wouldn't really be a problem if the anime was solely focused on them, but it's not. Black Bullet shows off plenty of unique characters which would seem to be worthy of our attention, but they just get thrown on the back burner once introduced. The anime tries hard to make the characters 'evolve' by hitting us with short back-stories and shocking/thrilling events, but they're over in a blink of an eye and get tossed to make room for the next characters' turn. A lot of these events and interactions between characters would have actually been quite good, but they required more time to expand, which evidently, they didn't have and ended in a mess for a lot of characters. Luckily, a few characters do manage to stay afloat in the mess and become more important in the show and interesting to us. Thanks to some of the characters' involvement and personalities it isn't all bad. Unfortunately, for a lot of the other characters, you just cannot get attached to them at all no matter how hard you try.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nLooking beyond the irrelevant characters and absurd pacing, Black Bullet was somewhat enjoyable. Black Bullet piggybacked on its, 'Looks good, feels good' attitude and did so by presenting smooth high-tension action, great music and sometimes pulling sucker punches on the audience with some messed-up events that judge our sense of morals and compares it to those of the show. The story wasn't completely terrible as I was able to follow and have a general understanding of what was going on and while I didn't like many characters there were a few whom I did appreciate. Although there are plenty positives, there are far more negatives which I nor many can ignore.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10): \\n\\n\r\nBlack Bullet is an anime that had plenty of potential, but didn't use much of it. At the start it had an interesting set-up, intriguing characters and the looks, but in the end all it had was its looks and that just doesn't cut it. If the pacing was slowed down and they expanded more on the characters, we could have seen something great, but we just didn't. A very small number of characters in the cast and the 'looks good, feels good' attitude was really Black Bullet's saving grace. It was entertaining, but non-memorable and it aches me to see an anime that could have been so much more, just be nothing more than another more-or-less mediocre show. While it's not terrible as many people have claimed it to be, it's not that great either. It's unfortunate to see while Rentaro, Enju and Co. are out saving the world, they couldn't save Black Bullet from being mediocre.",

            "content": "Hey there you filthy weeb! Do you like seeing naked little girls who are only about ten years old fawning and craving for sexual activity from a much older guy while also having said little girls being covered with slime coupled with an Attack on Titan clone narrative that is rushed beyond belief? Well, then you'll love the hell out of this train wreck of a series.\r\nThis anime is like your first sexual experience; it may seem great at first, much like the show's killer opening but much like the amine's fast pacing, it will be over in about ten seconds. Well, with that horribleanalogy out of the way let's talk about all the problems with this show, and oh boy, there sure is a LOT.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the basics: the narrative. The story of Black Bullet is essentially another god damn plot in which humans are pushed to the brink of extinction by some kind of calamity or monster; and in this case, we have spider-like creatures called the Gastrea. Aside from these creatures being a rip off of the monsters from the anime Blue Gender, a show from sixteen years ago,  the creatures hardly pose any threat whatsoever. They're not as creepy as the Titans from Attack on Titan nor as threatening as the Blue from Blue gender; they're forgetful and boring. Not only that, we're told by our main protagonist that the world is near destruction but everything seems to be as fine as an episode of My Little Pony. It's the same problem with the anime The Asterix war from last year. Both shows tell the audience that the characters are living in some kind of morally grey world that is nearing its destruction via an opening narration by the main character but never actually show what they're describing in the visuals. \\n\\n\r\nThe world of Black Bullet doesn't feel like humanity struggling to stay alive like the narrator would suggest; instead it feels like a day out with Yogi Bear since no one in the show sees these monsters as any kind of threat, even more so as we see the main character quickly running to buy eggs which are on sale after easily defeating one of these beasts. As a result, there is no lingering sense of tension or uneasiness, which was one of the few things Attack on Titan got right at the very least. Here it feels weak and pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is nothing to write home about and does a terrible job at immersing you into the world. Light novel guy (aka Rentarou - the main protagonist; I'm just going to be referring to every crappy light novel character as this now) is a guy who goes around stopping various incidents and attacks made by the Gastrea with his loli sidekick, Pedophile-chan, a girl who has the power of these creatures. There are many other little girls with these sort of powers which are referred to as the \"cursed children\" and are hated by all of society, frequently being beaten by the populace and shunned for who they are. This could have been an interesting theme if they had spent more time with it and got a component writer. But nope, it's awful. They use one of the cheapest tricks: shock factor, to try and make you feel bad for these girls in the tritest way possible. Not only are all of these girls about the age of ten and are made to appear as young as possible in order to pull at your heartstrings, but many of them also die in such terrible ways to manipulate you into feeling something. Some of them are killed in a bomb attack, another gauged out her own eyes; it's pathetic how hard they want you to sympathise with these girls without even trying to develop these characters in the slightest. Shock factor is the laziest way to try and make the audience feel for these little girls as it requires no actual effort; just make it as extreme as possible and the otakus will eat it up. \\n\\n\r\nThe narrative tries way too hard to be dark and edgy but this is immediately ruined as it believes that it's fine to be dark and serious one moment and then silly and full of fan service in the immediate next moment.  This whiplash is awful and it undercuts all of the dramatic moments of the show. When we end one scene with a little girl dying and we follow it up with a stupid joke featuring a naked loli in the next scene it breaks immersion and feels stupid. Do people have the attention span of a goldfish or something? Can we just stick with one tone and keep it consistent throughout? If you want to be dark and edgy then stick to just that, or at the very least, make the transitions between these two moods more natural otherwise it becomes a joke.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, light novel guy is as generic and boring as you could imagine when it comes to a main male protagonist of a light novel adaptation. Most of the female cast fall in love with him by the end, he has no personality to speak of, never develops in the slightest and stays as equally generic as everything else in this production. He is full of stupid ass pulls and is also the strongest character in the show, making him nothing more than a bland self-insert for all of the thirteen-year-olds watching this crap. They try and present his character as being full of fear and anxieties, with the underlying idea that he believes he is useless but not nearly enough time is invested in this theme and it comes across as forced drama instead. His loli sidekick, Pedophile-chan is not much better either. She too barely changes and instead remains a loli who wants to have sex with the main protagonist just to show her appreciation. She does have a tragic back-story which could have been developed into an interesting subplot concerning her anxieties and discrimination for who she is but it's resolved in only a few minutes so any interest derived from this character is quickly shunted to the side.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a villain who was a walking deus ex machina for a few episodes before being beaten by our god Light novel guy four times. FOUR FUCKING TIMES! The villain was pretty enjoyable the first time he was introduced, as he was more fun than anything but as the show went along, his motives became even more of a jumbled mess and his character arc went literally nowhere. There are other characters but they're so uninteresting and dull there is no point in even mentioning them since they hardly impact the story in the slightest. The only thing that develops in this show is light novel guy's loli collection. \\n\\n\r\nIf everything I've listed thus far wasn't bad enough, the pacing for this anime is by far the worst I have ever seen before. We run through this show at breakneck speed, never allowing the audience a moment to drink in all of the visual stimuli that are being thrown at us every five god damn seconds and there is hardly any downtime between any of the major events in the story to allow for some character development and growth. This problem is made worse as we reach the finale, and here the writer threw every single stupid idea he had into a blender and just hoped for the best. Characters are randomly introduced, new power-ups are pulled out of thin air, characters die abruptly everywhere. It's a mess! The final scene in which Boobs Mcjiggy (light novel guy's boss, or whatever) killed a man in cold blood came out of goddamn nowhere and felt like such a cheap way to end the story on an edgy cliff-hanger that it was laughably pathetic. \\n\\n\r\n On top of all this bullshit, we have some of the worst cases of badly implemented exposition I have ever seen. No one in this horse vomit speaks like a normal person, explaining every single little detail to the audience as if we're idiots and we can't figure out anything for ourselves. It's boring to sit through and an insult to our intelligence levels.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and fight choreography was okay and it does a decent job but it's nothing special in the slightest and is definitely nothing substantial enough to raise the bar of this animation production. While I would say the animation is average at best, they had to mess it up by the usage of CG, and this is some of the worst cases of CG integration intermixed with traditional 2D animation I've seen. The Gastrea look god damn awful and make me want to gouge out my eyes with a kitchen utensil. The opening song is pretty kick ass and gets you excited for the proceeding content only to be met with the crushing realisation that you're watching the pile of trash known as Black Bullet...\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this show was atrocious. There was no effort, no talent, no passion; nothing. It's an empty husk with no ideas and no originality. The characters were boring, the plot made no logical sense half the time, it tries way too hard to be edgy, it's full of dull shock factor and you should stay far away from it. There is not a single thing I can say about this show which leads to the positive side of the spectrum, it's that bad, so, therefore, more than qualifies for a rank '1'. Again, stay away from this one. Unless you're one of those sick twat who get a kick out of watching terrible light novel adaptations...like me.",

            "content": "Hey guys, this is my first time doing this so it may not be a top-notch anime review, nevertheless, I will try my best. Please note that this is purely my opinion on the series, you can agree with me or disagree with me, I'm fine either ways.\r\nBlack Bullet sets in an apocalyptic type of environment starting in the year 2021. The human race is being overwhelmed by the widespread of a deadly virus called the \"Gastrea\". Two protagonists: a Civil Security \"Promoter\" - Rentaro Satomi and his \"Initiator\" - Enju Aihara sets off to protect Japan from the evil that lies within the epidemic.\r\nStory- 3/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be blunt, I got to say I enjoyed the first 3 episodes of the anime but after that I had my bewildered face on the entire time for the remaining episodes. Not knowing where the series was going, I persist to keep on watching it, hoping for the plot to get better, however, it just did NOT happen. \\n\\n\r\nThere are various plot holes that are yet to be filled and quite a few of things are left unexplained (e.g the origin of Gastrea, vague explanation of the surrounding environment as a whole). \\n\\n\r\nWhat irks me the most is that the population itself doesn't give me the vibe and the fear of being endangered. Everyone seems to have no problem dealing with their daily life issues even with Gastreas' presence. In addition to this problem, multiple melodramas are shown in the series but they aren't necessary since they are there to stall for time, it merely demonstrates that the story is very unorganized and the scenes were done half-assed. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good. Though I would prefer more movements for the characters that are standing far away in the background instead of a still- image. Overall, not choppy but at the same time not extremely flawless as well. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that I liked about Black Bullet is the art, the color palettes were used wisely and the shading is neat but I would like to see this definition applied to the characters as well.  \\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Black Bullet OSTs and have personally downloaded some of them. Sound effects were also properly utilized and seiyuus did well when they were casting their characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the major problems that I find with the characters in Black Bullet is that most of them are not memorable and have little to zero character development. The chemistry is too low and I have trouble connecting with most of the characters in the series. Thus, do not share the same emotional responses \\n\\n\r\nOne character that stands out to me is the self proclaimed antagonist Kagetane Hiruko. His random appearances and the way how he presents himself made me like him. Unfortunately, he was defeated by Rentaro in Episode 3 and did not made an appearance until episode 10, which is sad because this character could make things a lot more interesting. Other characters are not really worth mentioning since most of them take minor roles and do not appear later on making them forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nBlack Bullet did a poor job of introducing new characters. It seems like they are being thrown in to the story for the heck of it. I get no information and I always have this puzzled look on every single new characters that somehow slips through the cracks and play a role in the series. Put Kisara's older brother as an example, he appeared in episode 13, came out of nowhere and apparently is the one that is responsible for not investing enough money to purchase stronger \"Varanium\" into the Monolith - a magical barrier that is supposed to protect Tokya Area from the Gastreas. Why wasn't I informed about this? Where did the information come from? What is his history as one of the protectors of Tokya Area? The series did not notify its audiences and most of the new characters appear unexpectedly. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict - (Enjoyment: 5/10, Overall 4/10)\\n\\n\r\nYou know... Black Bullet could have been a MUCH BETTER anime series only if it enables us to know more about the characters and did not constantly rushes its scenes. I just couldn't get myself to enjoy the series as much as I expected to. Using merely 13 episodes to accomplish this just would not cut it. I think the producers of this series need to step back, take a breather and have a thorough think-through to how to better plan the events of Black Bullet, it doesn't matter if it takes more than 13 episodes as long as if things were explained better then I will be more than happy to give it a higher rating.",

            "content": "Black Bullet is one of the many light novel adaptations that aired during Spring 2014. You might know the other ones as The Irregular at Magic High School, No Game No Life, and Chaika - The Coffin Princess. It started out okay, but got progressively weaker as it went on, before turning into an unentertaining show that turned out to be a rushed and half-baked adaptation. Shame, it had potential to be way better.\r\nIf you've read the synopsis on the show's page on this site, it'll tell you that it takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where humanity is practically on the brink of extinction,having been driven into a corner by powerful monsters. You might think that this concept sounds familiar; kind of like 2013's popular Attack on Titan. With a premise like that, it drew in a lot of viewers who, one might say, could have been looking for a sci-fi version of Attack on Titan or something. However, the thing about this show is that it seems to have entirely forgotten that it was a post-apocalyptic show. You see plenty of tons of healthy-looking people on the rather clean streets, the towns look clean and well-tended, and the economy seems to be in such good condition that they're able to afford things like prosthetic limbs made of tissue resembling human flesh and whatnot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is standard fare, all things considered. The style isn't anything special; it's generic and nothing about it really seems to stick out. Characters and objects look polished enough, and the actual animation is fairly crisp when there's good action going on, though it's not enough to make the actual fights that appealing or interesting to watch. In the end though, it gets the job done, but ultimately doesn't stick out at all. The designs were fairly neat though, I'll give it that. I liked the designs of the Gastrea, all two times they appeared or whatever.\\n\\n\r\nI'm quite fond of Shiro Sagisu's work. He did an outstanding job with the music for the Evangelion franchise, along with a great job at the soundtrack for the Berserk: Golden Age Arc films. However, this must be easily his weakest work. Background music is generic and forgettable, except for probably two or so songs that play during battles, which can give a good feel of intensity. The opening, \"black bullet,\" respectively named after the show and light novel, is fairly pleasant to listen to, but it isn't anything I'll remember in a month or so. Same goes for the main ending theme, \"Tokohana,\" though I do really like when it starts playing near the end of an episode. The voice acting isn't anything to write home for either. You have Yuki Kaji as the main character, Rentaro Satomi, but he isn't all that interesting to listen to. He always seems depressed, angry, tired, bored, or sounds like he's crying. So in short, he practically sounds the same as when he voiced Eren Yeager in Attack on Titan. I suppose I should give an honorable mention to Yui Horie (Minori Kushieda, Toradora!) for trying her best with what she got, and to Rikiya Koyama (Kiritsugu Emiya, Fate/Zero) for still having that charming, nonchalantly badass voice, even if his role was fairly limited.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are bland and unmemorable. Rentaro practically has no notable personality traits other than typical \"brave\" and \"determined\" that can be found in literally a hundred other characters who are far better written. He reminds me of Kirito from Sword Art Online in a way, in that not only does he have no notable personality, he has a harem for practically no reason, at least one girl in each harem being a little girl under 13. The main difference though is that while Kirito is overpowered, Rentaro seems underpowered in contrast. Despite being equipped with skills like knowledge of martial arts, a fairly high level of agility, exceptional marksmanship, and practically superhuman strength and speed due to his prosthetic limbs, he never seems to win, and even when he does, it's not even memorable or anything. Now, there's nothing wrong with making the main character an underdog, but a well-written underdog has to be a well-written character. The main reason why Rocky Balboa is a good underdog is because he's a genuine nice person. When he's not boxing, he's a really sweet guy, like around his lover Adrian and her brother Paulie, and he stands up for those he cares for. There's time and dedication given into giving the audience a good idea of what Rocky is like, which ultimately makes us want him to win against all odds against more experienced and stronger boxers like Apollo Creed and Ivan Drago. However, in Black Bullet, since Rentaro is a bland and forgettable character, it makes the audience not care whether he wins or loses, and thus, destroys all tension in a fight. Every time something happens to him, he begins to doubt all he knows, building the foundation of character development, but he never visibly develops, though given that the source material is still ongoing, not all is lost yet, since all these events that happen to him could potentially act as catalysts to a giant, grand development. But I suppose we'll only know if there's a second season. The other characters aren't all that special either. Enju is the token \"energetic loli,\" similar to how Tina is the token \"lethargic loli\" who's only active when the situation calls for it, kind of like Shiro from No Game No Life. There's also Kisara \"Big Boobs\" Tendo, the president of Civil Security that Rentaro works for, who happens to be a childhood friend of our main character, but ultimately, she lacks depth like the other character and hardly develops her own identity until the last five minutes or so. There are also more generic characters like the aloof old friend, the cocky guy, the girl with cat ears (which is supposed to be explained in plot but we never actually see any more of this), the hikkomori, etc. The character who steals the show is Kagetane Hiruko, who is the main villain of it all, or is supposed to be anyway. He's smooth, charismatic, nonchalant, mysterious, and reminds me of V from V for Vendetta in some ways. It's a shame he doesn't get a lot of screen-time either.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment levels seemed to fluctuate for me at first, before going down to consistently being a chore to watch. It has an inconsistent tone akin to that of Elfen Lied. By day, happy-go-lucky comedy featuring boob groping, other fanservice, and loli sweetness. By night, it becomes (or tries to be) macabre and dark, though it only comes off as unnecessarily edgy for the sake of being edgy. The humor might get a small chuckle or two out of you, but at the end of the day, boob groping and comical misunderstandings aren't anything to write home to in the humor department.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Black Bullet could have been a good show, but ultimately fails miserably. To say that it was rushed would be a big understatement indeed, what with not providing adequate world-building or characterization. I'm sure the light novels are way better, but since the adaptation is poor, it's not exactly doing a good job at advertising the source material to me, and thus, fails as such.",

            "content": "Although Black Bullet is tagged as being action, mystery, sci-fi, seinen, and probably post-apocalyptic, it should really be considered a loli-harem comedy first and foremost. The comedy is completely unintentional but it's what kept me watching week after week. Black Bullet is driven by manufactured drama and the characters are one dimensional cardboard cutouts with some dark backstories thrown in. Several important plot points are brought up and then never mentioned again, leaving the audience to wonder why we were even given this information in the first place.\r\nThe story follows high school student and \"Promoter\" Satomi Rentaro and his loli partner Enju, who uses herkept-in-check gastrea powers to kill full blown gastrea. Rentaro starts off being pretty mediocre as far as Promoters go, but he quickly rises through the ranks because of his inherent superiority and a sudden powerup.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story tries to be serious and mature, it fails miserably. We start off with the usual generic villain who wants to let the gastrea kill everyone in Tokyo because apparently anyone who can't defend defend themselves from giant monsters ought to die and it doesn't really get much better. There's an evil scientist named Ayn Rand, loli assassins, bad guys who have an irrational hatred of Rentaro, and a guy who built one of the varanium monoliths on the cheap so he could pocket the extra money. Sorry if I'm making this sound good because really, it's not. Even when we get a big gastrea battle at the end the real action takes place off screen. All we get to see is the aftermath.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the show is that it has absolutely no idea how to have any kind of emotional impact on the audience. Minor characters are introduced only to die an episode or two later. Rentaro cries because he cared about them, but the viewer hardly knew them at all. Little girls in particular are subjected to brutal violence because what's worse than killing off an ordinary character? Killing off a child! This happens multiple times throughout the show and it serves no purpose other than to be \"shocking\" and briefly make Rentaro pause and wonder why he protects Tokyo. There's a death toward the end that annoyed me because of how it happened so nonchalently. When someone dies it should feel like they made a meaningful sacrifice. This felt like the character had such little regard for their own life that it wasn't really a sacrifice at all. \\n\\n\r\nBlack Bullet has very little character growth. It may be that the show's rushed pacing gave Rentaro very little time for introspection, or that the story is basically one crisis after another. Either way, every character gets a dark backstory but that's pretty much it.  \\n\\n\r\nRentaro starts off as a mid-tier Promoter before he suddenly unlocks his potential and becomes ridiculously overpowered - except when he gets physically restrained by two guys right after a fight where he was demolishing concrete walls. He is always morally right and he demonstrates his superiority by triumphing over characters who hate him for very flimsy reasons. When a character unfairly persecuteshim, something conveniently happens that removes the obstacle and increases Rentaro's prestige. Everyone in a position of authority acts like a retard just so he can show how clever and perceptive he is.\\n\\n\r\nKisara is Rentaro's tsundere friend. Her family is basically the Rothschilds of Japan except instead of banking, they teach their children absurdly overpowered martial arts and weapon techniques. You'll know this because the characters announce the name of the attack before they use it. \\n\\n\r\nThe loli harem is there for comedy relief and pandering. The kind of \"humor\" here entails a gastrea-spider shoots sticky white web on Enju and constant flirting with Rentaro.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like B-movies then boy, have I got the show for you. It tries to be deep but the pacing is so frenetic that all the characters come across as being extremely shallow. There's even a scene where a guy gets cut by a sword but doesn't realize it until his head EXPLODES a minute later. Varanium may be black, but Black Bullet is comedy gold.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nHey there folks! Have you ever wanted to see an anime that has a loli fanservice scene, a comedic tsundere romance scene, and a scene that features the complete and brutal genocide of children all within 2 minutes of each other? No? Good, because anyone who WOULD want to see that wouldn't know the first thing about writing a coherent TV show. Unfortunately for Black Bullet, one of this season's most unfortunately overrated series, there is plenty of incoherence to be found. This horribly confused action seinen is jam packed with arguably the worst pacing issues I've ever seen, poor character development, andlolis. Soooo many lolis. Sure, the series has its moments, but the plentiful flaws outnumber the few positives that Black Bullet has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: In a near future, where mankind lives in fear of viral parasites called Gastrea, humans have been forced into a small territory and live in constant fear of death. Satomi Rentaro, a member of the \"Civil Security\" (an organization specializing in fighting against the Gastrea), is tasked with defending mankind from this monstrous threat. His partner, Enju, is a 10 year old girl with large amounts of power due to her partially Gastrea-infected DNA; she is one of the many \"cursed children\" who are used to fight the Gastrea as humanity struggles to survive.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Bullet's plot can easily be described as a mess for more then one reason. The first issue I will focus on is the MONUMENTALLY awful pacing, and trust me when I say it is monumental: Episodes 1-4 of Black Bullet are a shock to the system. I mean really, not a single person on planet Earth was prepared for the insanity that they witnessed over the course of those first 4 episodes. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the ENTIRE anime could have been just these four episodes, because that's how much content they truly \"covered\" in so little time. The pace of the show was faster then a coked-up cheetah with rockets strapped to its back, I mean it was truly something to behold. This all culminated in the absolute clusterfuck that was episode 4, in which 5 or 6 different climaxes all happened in the same episode. Ridiculous? Yes. But admittedly, it was so unfathomably stupid that it was actually kind of fun. However, starting at episode 5, that cheetah crashes into a brick wall and stops dead in its tracks. The pacing of the show from then on out is a snail's pace, leaving the audience to wonder what the hell happened to the absurdity that this show opened up with. With all the ridiculousness that went on in episode 4, the show had nowhere to go but down in terms of mindless entertainment; it doomed itself. Of course, I don't mean to suggest that the ludicris pacing was something that the show should have tried to keep, because it was STUPIDLY fast, but I am saying that this show threw everything it had at us in the first 1/4th and then simply had nothing left. This brings me to my underling point: How in the hell did this happen?! I am not exaggerating when I say that I have never seen a more mystifying anomaly in anime writing EVER! It is the least consistent and most mind-boggling betrayal of story-telling 101 I've ever had the displeasure of gazing upon. So congratulations Black Bullet, you win the \"Worst Pacing Ever\" award.\\n\\n\r\nThe second reason that Black Bullet's plot is a failure would be that fact there is no consistent tone what so ever. I will refer you back to my opening paragraph to give you a taste of how truly bad this problem is\u2026  This anime is trying to tell a mature and emotionally moving story, but then they decide to lace it with super-happy-fun-time with lolis, a clich\u00e9 comedic tsundere romance, and then even more super-happy-fun-time with lolis. As if that wasn't bad enough, they do so without allowing ANY time at all for a gradual shift in mood; devastating shit that should have a huge effect on the characters and comedic relief happen within seconds of each other. News Flash: That doesn't work, and any writer worth the paper he prints the script on could tell you that. Did I mention that this show has a lot of lolis?\\n\\n\r\nThat brings us to the characters, who are a bit hard to explain. Rentaro, the protagonist, receives no real character development at any point despite the fact that the plot could not have been more perfectly set up for him to receive some. For example, there was a scene in episode 10 that should have made him completely reevaluate himself, but he simply doesn't; we just get a 30 second scene of him thinking and then it's right back to the original plotline. Black Bullet instead tries to characterize Rentaro by making him a total badass, and while he definitely has some badass moments, he also has some moments that are the complete opposite of badass, so there is no consistency to his character at all. He is not a good protagonist. His love interest is a stereotypical tsundere; there is literally not a speck of originality to her, so I'll just move on. Rentaro's partners, the \"cursed children\", aka the lolis, are unbelievably aggravating to me. Let it be noted that I hate lolis, but I won't let that bias get in the way of this review. Enju, one of the lolis, is in love with Rentaro and makes contrived sex joke after contrived sex joke despite the fact that she is 10 years old. Some people find this funny; I don't. The rest of the lolis all have stereotypical personalities and no depth what so ever, so there isn't much to talk about there. The lolis are aggravating because they are the main source of the tone issues that the show suffers from, which I talked about earlier. They almost single handedly kill any chance this show had of being taken seriously, which it clearly is striving to do.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the fact that the characters are remarkably unspectacular, they also have very poor chemistry with one another. One of the cornerstones of the plot is that Rentaro and Enju are very close to each other, and you want to know how we are supposed to know they are so close? Because we got a 15 second flashback scene that showed us how close they were. ...I mean\u2026 Really? They can't be serious, can they? Well, they most certainly are. Not a single relationship in Black Bullet is believable or relatable by any stretch of the imagination, and that can be attributed to the awful pacing of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot of Black Bullet is awful and the characters leave a lot to be desired, it should be noted that the animation is good and the music is AMAZING. The show's OP and ED are both among the best of this season and the OST is very fitting for the show. The voice acting is also above average. Unfortunately, none of this is enough save the show from the slew of other problems that Black Bullet suffers from, and I do mean SUFFERS.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Black Bullet is an action seinen that completely lacks direction on all fronts; both in its plot and in its characters. It has some redeeming factors and can be good for some mindless fun at times, but  it comes across as an absolute disaster more often then not. Good music and animation save this anime from being unwatchable, but I certainly do not recommend it. There are many better seinen anime out there.",

            "content": "Black bullet is a anime that was adopted from a light novel. This series was being compare to attack on titan, or being called a copycat to attack on titan, but that can't be true since attack on titan isn't the first nor last to have these kind of story and settings. Coming into this series, it had a lot of hype from people who read the light novel or the manga. What most people didn't realize is that it would be adopted into 13 episodes which would mean the pacing would be rushed. So lets begin, I'll be reviewing this series in five category,story,art,sound,character and enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10: The story is about humans being forced to live in a small territory because of the attack of viral parasites named Gastrea. Now with this series just having 13 episodes, that means a lot of story progression would be lost and rushed. The thing that I find odd in this series is that The theme of the story is about humanity is on the verge of extinction, but I never get the impression that humanity is on the verge of extinction by huge bugs and that there is some sort of survival going on  here. Nobody cares about it. In fact, we don\u2019t even see the population having anything to say about that, since the plot centers on the protagonist. If they had shown a few bugs attacking people even that would be enough. Just to give us viewers that humanity really is under a threat. I don't know if this is the flaw of the story itself or just because the series was rushed and a lot of things were taken out from the light novel.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: Art is pretty good, and nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: The sound is pretty good, I downloaded a few ost to listen to, I like the ost. I also like the opening is anyone getting a attack on titan feel to that opening or is it just me?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10: The characters are pretty bland and two dimmensional. Each character has different personalities but what I find annoying is how easy the characters mood changes, like one moment everyone is sad then a minute later everyone is all happy, I personally think this series would've been way better if  lolis were not in it. also Enju is pretty annoying, when she calls out to Rentarou it makes me *facepalm* and just sometimes put me off and give me a different mood towards this series. Each characters also have a dark/sad past which can make it a little overwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: I have to say with all the flaw and paced of this series, I did have a lot of fun watching it, the actions were short, but pretty good with the   epic soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\noverall: This series would've been so much better if it was adopted into 24 episodes instead of 13 episodes. I'm not a light novel or manga reader but even I can tell the pacing was rushed. Light novel readers has also confirmed my speculation. Well what can I say about this series, if you like lolis and want a series with good action and great soundtrack, then you should give black bullet a shot. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Black Bullet is the latest and not so greatest over hyped action series to grace our screens. I'm sure many of you would have heard the saying \"Why didn't they ride the eagles into Mordor\", well Black Bullet is the epitome of that saying. \r\nThe story is very bad, it's full of clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9, the main character is yet another super special high school kid and the world revolves solely around his actions. He isn't just another gear in the machine of society, he is the one turning them, one Yuki Kaji shounen power up scream at a time. \r\nWhat makes some high schoolkid with a loli by his side and a handgun shoved down the back of his pants better than thousands of trained soldiers? Nothing, but the plot wills it and it even fire special bullets capable of killing the monsters of the show, not even the Army seems to have access to that ammunition in Black Bullet. They even build 300 metre tall monoliths made out of the same material as Rentaro's ammunition, but yet thousands of trained soldiers are incapable of fighting the Gastrea that a bunch of sword and handgun wielding teens ad lolis are easily able to defeat.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterisation is horrible and clich\u00e9, Tendo Kisara the main love interest (if you could call her that) jumps between being an emotional wreck, a jealous lover and a calm and collected psychopath. The main character, Satomi Rentaro, doesn't even have three ranges of emotion, he's either a bland self insert or an angry, sometimes bewildered, shounen protagonist and there is nothing in between the two.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nothing special, it was average at best and did nothing to try and  stand out in any way. The animation was decent enough, it stayed on model for most of the time and again didn't really stand out compared to any other action shounen. The action scenes themselves were pretty average, one shot firing gun, next shot exploding monsters and behind the monster as it gets sliced up, etcetera etcetera. The CG was below average, it looked plasticky and didn't fit into the overall visual look of the series. At least the CG wasn't as bad as KyoAni's dragon from the Chuunibyou movie, so they get points for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was nothing special, standard fast paced actiony stuff, but it failed to make the action scenes any more enthralling (Pro tip: they weren't). The sound effects were nothing special, the guns sounded like the regular anime pop guns and so did the swords. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I did not enjoy watching this series at all. All I could think about were the inconsistencies in the story, setting, characters and how many \"why didn't they ride the eagles into Mordor\" moments happening on my screen. If you want to watch an action shoot 'em up, there are a lot of other anime that are leagues better than Black Bullet ever hoped to be. At least the Yanagi Nagi end credits song was nice, unlike the rest of the series.",

            "content": "Black Bullet. I went into this series with a bit of skepticism: Will this series, which seems to focus on human morals and values within the context of a war between the humans and \"them\", in which case, the Gastrea, achieve their message, loud and clear, in its measly 13 episodes of length? Much like previously released anime like Elfen Lied, Higurashi no naku koro ni, and Psycho Pass, that are well known for their darker settings that serve to illustrate a concept of humanity put to the test, Black Bullet incorporates a similar dark setting, with the apocalypse of the human race at stake,and themes like segregation and the definition of justice, which, in theory, should bring out a creation that goes beyond just \"a tv series\", and becomes a work of literature.\\n\\n\r\nMy skepticism was well-founded, however, and as I continued to watch the show, it continued to grow, along with my distaste for the show's repeated mishaps.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nBlack Bullet's story, while darker than your usual action-oriented plot, eventually devolves into just another shounen-resembling story that believes that \"any plot twist will make watchers drop their jaws in awe and instantly believe that it's an interesting and well-executed plotline.\" Unfortunately, that fact isn't true, and whereas Black Bullet really tried to incorporate a complicated plot involving a little bit of politics, along with plenty of action and \"character building moments\", the sheer amount of predictable plot developments, along with contrived plot twists made the plot into something that didn't even really matter anymore - all that mattered in the end was watching the loli's fight the insects.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art was one of the only parts of the anime that I enjoyed, and that isn't an understatement. It was appealing to watch the action take place - though some fights were a lot shorter than they could have been, the animation during those fights was fluid and sharp, and I could see most of the particles and special effects that really make a science-fiction oriented action scene worth watching. Studio Orange did a pretty good job, and while sometimes, the backgrounds didn't look as sharp or clear as they could have been, the majority of the more important features were well done, and I didn't really have any trouble differentiating between who was who or what was going on.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe majority of the sound effects were fairly well handled - it never sounded too cluttered or too spread apart, and the opening and ending sequences were catchy. The opening really did remind me of Attack on Titan's first opening theme, and what with all the similarities between the two shows, I really can't say that it's just a coincidence, but I'll leave it at that...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nOne of the biggest issues this show had was the amount of fan-pandering it produced, solely off the characters that they chose utilize. Whereas a main character that can do anything and everything, taking bullet after bullet while pulling a Rambo to eventually take his enemies out is fun to watch, it doesn't really serve as a character - a living and breathing human being. In the case of Satomi Rentaro, it takes away his potential of being a main character people can relate to in order to empathically understand any overarching theme present in the series - which serves to make it harder to get it at all. In addition, the existence of superpowered loli half gastrea half human waifus 1. isn't explained and 2. isn't relevant to the plot except to provide the occasional joke or be the direct trigger for a sad emotional reaction when they die. The only interesting character was the masked man, only because his ideals are twisted, and not what you'd usually see in a series, making him unique amongst a cast of cardboard cutouts and tropes you can find anywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nThere were way too many cases of Pilot's Love Song, in which they would introduce characters, simply to have them die to invoke emotional response from the audience, as well as Guilty Crown and Mirai Nikki type plot twists, both which I dread. Overall, the series felt very contrived, and upon closer inspection, much of the plot that is in between the spaces of the giant overarching story didn't make much sense, and weren't exciting or fun to watch. They tried a little too hard catering fanservice to the audience, when the series would have been fine without it, and probably would have been less distracting as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nAll in all, I enjoyed this anime MUCH less than I expected to, considering it had all the pieces it needed to create a masterpiece that actually mattered and would influence what I thought about a certain value or moral, or would make me question \"what if I were in that situation, how would I react.\" In the end, it turned out to be a lackluster show that simply had too many flaws and distracted too much from the main message for me to give it a higher rating, or even to say that \"wow, I learned something from this show\" or \"wow, this show really showed me something that I've never wondered about before, maybe I should rethink it.\" Heck, the series didn't even let me enjoy my lolis, without having them die sporadically.",

            "content": "Black Bullet \u2013 an anime about lolis saving the world from the big bad monsters out to eat you alive. Or yet by a more literal way of saying it, they are actually young kids known as the Cursed Children with special abilities capable of fighting against Gastrea, the monsters that threatens humanity and its existence. Based off a light novel of the same name, shows like this has an incentive to go a variety of ways with this. The result? A mediocre bag of an adaptation clustered with mind bobbling antics.\r\nThe premise initially sounds interesting, taking place in a futuristic setting in the yearof 2031 (ten years after humanity were beaten by the Gastrea ). Humanity lives behind walls of monolithic material for survival. To fight off the Gastrea, we get the cursed children playing the roles of \u201cinitiator\u201d with a partner known as \u201cpromoter\u201d in a sort of mentor/student relationship for combat units. Black Bullet tells the story of a young promoter named Rentaro Satomi and his roles against the Gastrea. \\n\\n\r\nOpening the doors to the BB world requires takes some enduring to get through. By all means, the show has a serious premise but saturated with generics. For instance, the story begins quickly enough to illustrate the grim reality of their world. Even the main male protagonist, Rentaro had a tragic past when he lost his parents. As for the cursed children themselves, none of them have a true loving family with a normal mother and father. Here though, we get Enju, a ten year old assigned to Rentaro as an Initiator. Tossing age differences aside, there is hardly anything we can compare about the two in terms of similarities besides their tragic past. Yet, this isn\u2019t something we should entirely feel sympathetic about. After all, it is war and dangers are constant so losses shouldn\u2019t be something to be surprised about. The other point is that the current relationship between Rentaro and Enju can be described as lively and charming. While on missions, they are focused but at home seems to be relaxed more than ever, at least for Enju anyways. And this is where the show drops the ball on its grim atmosphere. For one thing, Enju never ceases to throw herself at Rentaro all the while making suggestive poses, innuendos, and trying to have a relationship with him. It\u2019s outright awkwardly executed and badly performed despite the initially promising premise. In retrospect, it spirals into a path of jokey nonsense like a flippant screwball.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s just the opening stages though as Black Bullet likes to base its story with other characters all focused into the war against Gasetra. Although not a cursed child, we get the typical childhood friend Kisara who has known Rentaro since he was a kid. This sets forward the basis of a love triangle. But like the way the show goes, it\u2019s hard take it seriously when her competition is a 10 year old. But besides that, Rentaro seems to actually show response to her advances. All while this is happening, Enju\u2019s own plans are left useless. It\u2019s like she really is cursed or something with little or no hope of a loving relationship with Rentaro. And if that would occur, it would be quite an uneasy relationship to deal with as Enju\u2019s lack of common sense becomes a source of compromising exhibitions. The endgame is to not expect any romance development in this show as it neglects this phase. It just wouldn\u2019t work with the show\u2019s circumstances and potential death flags. However, do expect the usual clich\u00e9s, uncanny jokes, and whirlwind of fan service.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all the mind bobbling gags going on, the show does have a solid style of delivering its grimmer side of its premise. The antagonists looks serious with their egos and intimidating personalities. The Gasetra rides off of fear and delivers this effectively with their menacing actions. For the government, it also seems their research and development is trying to do what it needs for the survival of humanity. On an even darker scale, there\u2019s prejudice against Cursed Children in a similar way that gives off Elfen Lied-esque nostalgia. Indeed, society ostracizes cursed children and treats them like experiments and trash. The flashbacks between Rentaro and Enju shows this clearly during their first encounter that shows how fearful humanity is towards the Cursed Children. The logic here is that the Cursed Children has some of its blood pumping in their veins while results in their unfortunate discrimination. At the same time, death is real and the show paints this reality with gruesome exits for some of its characters. The result of this often involves bloodshed, limbs being destroyed, and lives eradicated simply because they are no longer human. The Cursed Children themselves even have malevolent-like features such as their scarlet eyes. It creates a sense of fear but what people don\u2019t know is the true visage of some of its characters. Children, after all often lack common sense and people take advantage of them to implode their nature. Police brutality adapts this concept into play resulting in very ghastly consequences. The point is, the show does keep promise with what it sticks to \u2013 the dark story in a world with Gastrea and cursed lolis.\\n\\n\r\nWhile all the antagonists are cunningly designed that are convincing, their purpose and motivations lacks any sort of interest. We get dangerous promoters such as Kagetane that kills others as a way to steam up interest as a villain. But really, his character lacks any sort of insight of development. It\u2019s stereotypical even by his design such as his psychopathic gestures and shadowy mask. And because the Gastrea are literally mindless, don\u2019t expect any sort of characterization from any of them, not even from database standards besides for just what they are. As for other antagonists, they are clich\u00e9 including corrupt individuals and predictable outcomes just based on what they are from the surface. One dimensional and desperate is how the show tries to increase interests towards viewers but ultimately results in a cheesy set up molded like a lazy piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while the show deals with many complicated concepts, the characters follows a surprisingly pragmatic and idealistic approach. For instance Rentaro fights like it\u2019s he is doing it for the rights of humanity rather than what he thinks personally. Judgment is left stranded in a fog as characters follows a path of experimental ways of dealing with threats. Their primary motivation is survival and the result. That\u2019s what it really manners in the end. Long story short: the show suffers from development between characters as result of this approach. And even though certain characters does live, developments feels goofy, childish, and occasionally gives off the wrong message leading to compromising positions. Not to mention, Rentaro somehow stirs up multiple interests of the opposite sex throughout the show where it almost enters a harem-like concept. But really though, the how creates a multitude layer of bizarre balance when it comes to its execution. Sometimes, it follows its story strictly while other times goofs off with its badly executed comedy. The story itself also suffers from adaptation as certain arcs have way too many things happening all at once. While this is not entirely surprising as result of LN adaptations, some resolutions are far too abrupt that will leave questions into viewers\u2019 minds. It\u2019s just too damn rushed.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is standard on most parts although visually wise, most of it is impressive based on its setting. The OP and ED songs has a dreamlike atmosphere to its backgrounds while the sequences balances decent amount of imagery. There\u2019s certain parts of the show that can remind people of Attack on Titan despite the contrasting settings. But character designs wise, the Cursed Children can come as a mixed bag. They come as more of the package with adorableness and badass. Do take emphasis on their scarlet eyes though as the show takes a special interest to clearly identify them with their roles. On other hand, Gastera\u2019 mutation sequences are gruesome to the core with their gimmick. They take on various forms but all of them shows the same brutality. Otherwise, most of the other character designs are moderate enough whether it\u2019s Rentaro\u2019s well-trained figure or Kisara\u2019s spaghetti hair. The fan service is there though with it even being openly addressed on many occasions. You can thank the lack of common sense for that. Don\u2019t blame the Cursed Children. Blame common sense.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly though, the soundtrack is one of the more dynamic strengths of the show. As a technical feature, it is quite impressive during action sequences when it intensely draws out its delivery. Characters such as the Cursed Children also balances their voice tones to demonstrate their loneliness and sorrow. Even Enju, despite her cherry self, shows this side of her when she feels antagonized. And while dialogues feels stale and cheesy, the humor behind them is to the point without any sort of mystery. We also get emotional appeal with its musical scores. Beyond that, the OP and ED songs shows a melancholy that is spiritually gripping. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not mindless entertainment when taking Black Bullet\u2019s story for granted. But most times, this show borders on into a field of absentmindedness. It just feels like the show has this engaging premise but not entirely sure what to do with it. With its rushed story also brings a cast of cute girls with scarlet\u2019s eyes doing government\u2019s work. However, I do give some credit to the technical field especially when it comes to soundtrack. The experience of that is enticing with something to write home about. Yet ultimately when it comes down to it, this show is not too much different than junk food. When you eat it, you might just forget how it tastes like afterwards. \\n",

            "content": "Right! \r\nThis is my first review here so please spare me internet while I add to the huge ocean of random stuff!\r\nBlack Bullet was a show that I picked up after watching Guilty Crown and its fair to say if you liked that you'll like this. I hasten to add I would never claim Guilty Crown is good, but it is fun, and we all like to have fun do we not?\r\nSo was Black Bullet fun or a disaster? Lets see!\r\nStory-3\r\nMy impression of Black Bullets story was of a director trying too hard. Calling someone a Try-hard should not be taken as an insult however.The plot seemed to be trying to fit in every dramatic plot twist from every other show ever in a 13 episode series. Action! School Drama! Love triangles (or more like a hexagon or dodecagon if you're fussy)! Revenge! Apocalypse! Robots! Zombies! Politics! Persecution! Loli! Look how cute the Loli are!Loli!\\n\r\nThe story was in general quite a mess with supposedly dramatic events being thrown at the screen and never explained. My favorite being the tricycle from episode 4 which was never explained. However it did set up some impressively epic events which I enjoyed the scope of so its not a total loss.\\n\r\nIn short most of humanity is dead, and trapped within cities surrounded by giant monoliths, built to keep the mysterious monsters created by the Gastrea virus out of the city. The best weapon humanity has are the Cursed Children, children born from mothers infected by the Gastrea and born super strong and intelligent and guided by promoters, similarly talented adults. \\n\r\nIn shorter, sounds pretty cool.    \\n\\n\r\nArt-7\\n\r\nIt looked pretty good.\\n\r\nWait I need to write more?\\n\r\nOkay compared to most stuff coming out this year it compared fairly well. There were some very noticeable sudden drops in quality and the CGI for the Gastrea was awful.\\n\r\nThe colour palate was quite varied and the character design fairly solid with the lolis especially getting a lot of attention. And (I flinch as I say this) they were drawn adorably at times. I swear half their art budget went on making those work. \\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nActually somewhere where the show shone. The OP and ED were both pretty solid with the OP being maybe my favorite of the season. The animation for the OP however was pretty poor using mostly frames taken from the show and the first version being much better synched with the music. The ED was done significantly better in that regard. I did feel the OP borrowed slightly from AoT's but hey that was a good OP.\\n\r\nThe background music was also pretty good.I especially enjoyed the jazz theme that played with Tina Sprout and Enju's theme also.\\n\r\nI don't speak Japanese but the voice acting seemed good as well. They had a couple of my favorite VA's including Yui Horie (Hanekawa, Kouko and Minori) and Yuki Kaji (Eren from AoT and Shu from Guilty Crown). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters-3\\n\r\nCharacters really suffered in this show. most received essentially no development and there were a significant number a times where I was being shown an emotional scene and just thinking \"I don't care\". The bare levels of characterization that were set down were at times simply ignored and, even worse, sometimes brought back an instant later like nothing had happened. Again more time to actually show the journey the characters made would've been nice.   \\n\r\nAs I might have alluded to previously a biggest problem I had with the show was the Loli aspect. I object to the idea of Loli in general but that's fine. Why else do you watch anime except for something a bit different? Loli can be done well (see bakemonogatari) and it can be funny and adorable. However the sheer number of Loli characters all wanting to get boned by an 20 year old... nope. Not cool.\\n\r\nThe leads were not entirely terrible. The Lead Lead Rentaro (definitely a phrase) was actually very solid being a step beyond the typical harem -insert your name here- character and actually showed quite a degree of compassion and awareness of the girls around him. He was a typical badass with a bit of filling. Enju, Rentaro's partner, was also fairly solid at times balancing the frailty of a young child thrown into a brutal situation quite well with sudden ability to bounce back typical of a child. And unlike the rest she did at least have a reason to love the main character. But as mentioned before important events seem to just disappear in characters minds rather than scaring them for life. I'm evil I enjoy that stuff.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-8\\n\r\nDespite all I've said I really quite enjoyed this show. There was a fairly equal balance between \"This is awesome\" and \"This is stupid\" moments but the awesome was fairly awesome and the stupid was so stupid it was kinda fun. \\n\r\nHowever I would not recommend this unless you have pretty good stupidity filters. The change from solemn coolness to forced romance Loli loving can be very jarring. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-5\\n\r\nMal says it all. Mediocre.\\n\r\nIts not rubbish (well maybe it is) and its certainly not great. However it is fun and I would say if you have a rainy day and nothing else you particularly want to watch then this will fill a gap. Expect fun not a masterpiece. \\n\r\nAlso if you like Tetsuro Araki then this is definitely the show for you. The whole thing feels like a huge homage to his work.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Black Bullet is, as many people have said before, similar to Attack on Titan in a way. Though instead of titans you have these huge bug like creatures called Gastrea, and its set in the future in Japan rather than an older style civilization. However the biggest difference between the 2 shows is that Attack on Titan is actually very good, where as this is just...eh. \r\nStory (6)\r\nThe story as I mentioned before is, on paper, pretty similar to Attack on Titan. Humanity at the brink of extinction. Huge monsters that killed someone in the protagonist's family. A city inside of a barrier. But that'smainly where most of the blatant similarities stop. The main character, Rentaro is apparently half robot as well...also there's these lolis that are infected by the Gastrea or something and they like partner up with people like Rentaro and fight because now they have powers?...Also there's this villain that kinda fucks around inside the barrier and there's also other places other than Japan or something? \\n\\n\r\nI don't know, the plot of this show I feel jumps around waaay to much and there's just too much going on at once, not the mention the pacing is basically terrible. There's a climatic episode like halfway through the season and it just really feels out of place and weird. I feel like the story lacked a lot of focus. The Gastrea were interesting but you hardly ever even see them until later on. They come off as barely having to do with the plot. Where as, with Attack on Titan, you're always reminded of them, and they are shown quite often. Hell, even the name of the show has barely anything to do with it. Rentaro shot his gun with \"black bullets\" like once in the whole show and that was in the first episode. Same with the whole him being a robot, I even forgot about that later on. I feel like there was a lot of lack of focus and proper pacing here.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention, there's a lot of brutal deaths is this show, mainly of little girls which I find very disturbing. I guess its not automatically a bad thing but I feel like every death, especially of little girls just felt very sudden and uncalled for. A lot of them where just forgotten quickly after so it didn't even feel like that really mattered.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it got more interesting by the end, but even the last episode had some pacing issues if you ask me. \\n\\n\r\nArt (7)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. Not much to say here. Weird CGI that seems somewhat out of place but that's how most CGI is. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8)\\n\\n\r\nThe music and voice acting is over all pretty solid. The voice actor of Eren from Attack on Titan also voices Rentaro, and he does a pretty good job. The opening is very good as well as the ending, (though halfway through they changed the opening while keeping the song and the new opening wasn't quite as good). I'm also a fan of a lot of the background music as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6) \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fine I guess. My favorite would have to be the villain, though he's not shown that often after the first few episodes. Nobody else really stood out to me though. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6)\\n\\n\r\nI never really felt like watching this show most of the time and I just kind of forced myself to watch it when it came on just because I wanted to finish it. It had it's moments but over all its probably my least favorite show I watched this season. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (6)\\n\\n\r\nIt's alright and has it's moments, but there's really nothing that great here in terms of story in my opinion. If it really sounds like something you'd like, I'd say give it a shot, otherwise, I'd say just skip it.",

            "content": "Black Bullet is honestly in my opinion, one of the most overrated anime ever. Although it may not seem like the most popular anime, it's hype back in spring was pretty big, and I've seen reviews rating Black Bullet over an 8, which left me speechless. Black Bullet had a promising start sort of, but quickly it's plot just died away with no explanation of what's happening, my favorite character in the anime disappeared for half the show and the ending was plain rushed and made absolutely no sense. \r\nThe plot was \"eh\"; it was a mixture of Guilty Crown and Attack on Titans, whichseems amazing, but that was not the case. There are these monsters called Gastrea, that infect humans turning humans into monsters. Humanity is on the brink of extinction until they find Vibranium, the stuff dreams are made of\u2026 or nightmares when it comes to the Gastrea. Having found the Gastrea's kyptonite, humans have created walls/barriers and have created haven cities where they could live in peace. Outside these barriers were the cursed children, humans that were part Gastrea (monster). In this world of turmoil, Rentaro witnesses all the ugliness in it. Unfortunately for the human race the Gastrea have managed to break into the city somehow, and it's up to the main character Rentarou and his teammate Enju to save the day. And... that's it, the ending ends in a makes absolutely no sense cliffhanger and blah blah blah blah. The few characters and animation were the only bright spots in this anime. Enju and the other cursed children was a new interesting add, and the main protagonist was pretty badass which was nice, but then in the end he suddenly loses all his \"badassness\". Anyways overall the plot just gets worse and worse as it progresses, that's really all I have to say. The anime is kind of enjoyable hence the 5 \"average\" rating, but seriously I wouldn't recommend this to people looking for a \"good\" anime.",

            "content": "Action and Mystery. A common combination of genres, isn't it?\r\nBlack Bullet is an adaptation of its still ongoing Light Novel,  was announced last year, 2013. Then became a long-awaited series of 2014.\r\nAlthough, the main idea isn't too impressive or original if we want to put it like that, the plot has much more in store. To be precise, the story is rather fast-paced. It is basically some short stories put together into 13 episodes. And even though it's true that there was some sort of bridge between two 'short stories', it is very obvious that the staff just wanted too many elements in thesame place. Luckily, this doesn't spoil the whole atmosphere as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nThere were many truly good closing scenes which are suggestive and aditive to its genre. The thing is that many of these 'floating ideas' could as well have been used. But, they weren't. Most of them were left unexploted and to be straightforward, I'm pretty sure that using these ideas instead could have made a 20% better story.\\n\r\nWith these said, however, there is one thing that I especially liked about the plot. That is the discussion of rarely mentioned and taught issues like discrimination, human inhospitality and cruelty. This little addition just made the everything twice as dramatic as it would otherwise be.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Black Bullet was at times breath-taking but in other cases it was rather mehish. But, whichever is the case, the art, without a doubt, matches the story and contributes well to the mood of it. The best example for this would be the openings; as they indeed served as a good 'programme guide'. They showed what you should expect of the series and determined the attribute of the characters, too.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters sometimes tended to prove themselves amazingly unnecessary. To me some of them seemed to be introduced because the other person who, simply put, had exactly the same traits won't turn up again. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, everybody's lives revolve around the protagonist's. The main of all characters, Rentaro Satomi in this universe is a god. And this actually is true from the first to the last word. Not only is he incredibly strong but he's also drop-dead gorgeos, has his harem of little girls and has two teen girls with respectable size of chest love him. But he's lacking one thing; common sense. This is what, in fact, refers to all of the charcters. By this, I mean that when an unforeseen event occurs nobody seems to pose questions like 'why?', 'how?' or just the most obvios one 'what?!'.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is character development. As a matter of fact, there isn't any. Well, there is but it is so short-term. People go through very sad and tear jerking event, these scenes were done brilliant, to be honest, and they are emotionally shaken.. For an episode. Then in the next episode they are as happy as ever. Unfortunatelly, this is also applicable to peronalities and behaviour displayed towards other characters. Just change overnight.\\n\r\nThis is so exposed to the viewers that this just ruins the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe very best reason I would recommend this anime for is the soundtracks. They are unbelievably catchy and something that remains on your mind for like a week. They match the particular scenes they are in.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there are many components that resemble things from real-life, many just really go in the face of nature.\\n\r\nThere are tons of hilarious moments which are worth re-watched. It's rather sad to say; that is all that increases the value of re-watching.\\n\r\nI believe that many good words could be said about Black Bullet but liking (or not liking) it comes down to the viewers only. This is a type of series that you either hate or like sort. It is highly unlikely that it leaves you without any feelings about it.",

If you've seen Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin), you'll notice that the opening music, art (and world-concept in general) are kind of really similar. I won't say it's a copy, you decide that for yourself. The opening was in my opinion not really fitting, that's all. \r\nAnyway, to get to the story line. I gave it a 6/10, because the story wasn't boring or tiring, it just wasn't really original. I realize that, in some dose, the creators gave thought into it, but everything was rushed to the limit where the timing became ridiculous. To cut it short, toomuch content was packed into a small number of episodes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were... well, okay. (6/10) They were too specific though, with clear behavioral patterns and only slight character development. No one actually surprised me. In the end there's, I suppose, some sort of cliffhanger, which was shortly after ruined, because the main character had to say something irrelevant about it. Let's say that everything is too obvious, and that's why the characters are just \"okay\". \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to enjoyment... it was good. I can't say that I didn't enjoy it. It didn't amaze me, but it's one of those random anime which bring up some feelings, even though you don't really bind with the characters. It's too bad that everything is rushed. I suppose I would have enjoyed it more if it was a 24-episode anime with slowed down plot and more (also better) character development. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but if you like little cute girls with superpowers... watch it.",

Is it well done? Well, look at the number on the side of this review, does it seem like I think it\u00b4s well done? If the answer is yes then you need to check your eyesight, \u00b4cause if you can\u00b4t see the number then I\u00b4m really worried about you.\\n\r\nThe thing about Black Bullet\u00b4s plot is that it tries to be \"dark\" and \"serious\" but also tries several times to have comedy and fanservice with lolis, because someone thought that having a lot of lolis in a \"dark\" and \"serious\" show was a great idea, and it has been proven before that trying to mix these two opposites just like that, doesn\u00b4t work, I cannot take something seriously like that. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. This series also has, like I said before a little problem with the script, and by little I mean a BIG problem with the script. You see, when you actually listen to the kind of things the characters say, sometimes you might think \"Boy, that line was really stupid\", because sometimes the things they say doesn\u00b4t have any logic on then, like there\u00b4s is no way that the kind of things these characters say, would be said by an actual and sane person. For example, all you need for a villain in this series to spit up all his plans, is just a simple question from our main protagonist, Rentaro. I can\u00b4t really put the stupidity in the script into words, it\u00b4s something that you have to experiment to understand, but for doing that, you have to watch the show, which I do not recommend. But this is not all, oh no no no no no. The other thing that this series has is plot holes, yep, as if it weren\u00b4t enough with the shitty script. For example in the first episode we see everyone in some kind of refugee camp being attack by the Gastrea, the monsters that are attacking Tokio this time, the scene afterwards everyone is safe and happy behind the Varanium walls, the Gastrea\u00b4s elemental weakness, but we don\u00b4t know how did that happened, how did they pass from \"total destruction\" to discovering that Varanium is super effective against Gastreas and having the time to build the Varanium structures?. And this is just ONE plot hole, because you can pretty much take a random episode and find them by dozens. The show also likes to make use of Deus ex-Machinas, I counted four in total, if someone has counted more, let me know and you will win an imaginary hug. How cool is that? It also has a terrible pacing, too rushed at the begging, too slow by the end. So this series pretty much makes every mistake it can do. You could say that I should turn my brain of and enjoy the series, but is my belief that if a show wants me to take it seriously, and believe me this series is desperate to prove that I should, I should have my brain in the on-mode. Also from episode 8 and forward the show losses any sense of action, and has also this thing for increasing it\u00b4s problems from episode to episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was pretty much above average for me. I really like the colour palette that they used in this show, it makes it look nice, but the animation itself has some drops here and there, where the framerate really goes down, it is pretty noticeable. But the worst part, is that later on the series they start to use CGI to animate the Gastreas, and it looks so bad, It\u00b4s like I could get eye cancer just from looking at them, it\u00b4s awful. Some character designs are  kinda good, except for Rentaro who is just a normal guy with a suit, Kisara who is the chick that uses a school uniform 24/7, and some of the lolis because in this show lolis have to belong to some kid of archetype and they dress as such, for example the Samurai Stereotype Loli will dress with, you guessed it, samurai clothes. About the designs that I like, they belong to either a secondary character that we don\u00b4t see too often anyway, or to Kagetane Hiruko the \"main\" villain, who actually seems creepy but elegant, just like a villain should look. The backgrounds are nothing out of this world but they are ok, nothing really AMAZING, but ok.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack though, that\u00b4s the best part of the series, which is actually kinda sad if you think about it. It mostly uses the techno music that anime likes to use so much this days, but it\u00b4s pretty kickass when there\u00b4s a Gastrea on the scene, but when there\u00b4s is not any Gastrea or any threat of any kind to our protagonists and the series flips to it\u00b4s more light-hearted side it becomes pretty forgettable, but when is good, IS GOOOD. On the voice acting side of the things, voices ranged from character to character, for example, Rentaro\u00b4s voice is done by Yuki Kaji the same guy who did the voice for Eren Jaeger fron Attack on Ti... damn it I really wanted to finish the review without mentioning Attack on Titan, there goes my record. Anyway his voice acting is pretty solid, too bad that he doesn\u00b4t have any actual good lines to say. The voice from the main villain Hiruko Kagetane is also masterfully done by Rikiya Koyama who also did the voices for Takamura from Hajime no Ippo and Emiya from Fate/Zero, need I say more?\\n\r\nOn the other hand we also have a secondary character, Shouma, whose voice actor, Shinichiro Miki, didn\u00b4t do the best of the job for this character in particular.\\n\r\nThis show has only one OP and ED, the only noteworthy being the opening. It\u00b4s a fripSide theme, so if you are a fan of their style of music you will probably like this one, and no, I will not talk about the \"similar to AoT\" chorus at the beginning of the song. The thing about the OP though, is that someone had the bright idea to change the animation of the OP for a more spoilerific version, and not only it doesn\u00b4t look as good as the original, it spoils LOTS of stuff, not that is really important since this is a kinda predictable show anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said the soundtrack was actually the best part of the series, so that kind of gives you an idea of what I think of the characters, doesn\u00b4t it?\\n\r\nI will focus mainly in the main four, Rentaro, Kisara, Enju and the \"main\" villain Kagetane.\\n\r\nRentaro is pretty much your typical shounen protagonist, which wouldn\u00b4t be that much of a problem is this show wasn\u00b4t a SEINEN. What is a clich\u00e9 battle shonen protagonist doing in a Seinen? Fuck if I know. But he is pretty much a walking clich\u00e9, he yells the name of every attack he throws, and he has some longass names in his sleeves, he practices some kind of martial art, he is the \"good\" guy, he can do no wrong, that\u00b4s Rentaro, and the only sense of development that this series has for him, is having him suddenly become a Gary Stu from episode 4, and that will be all the development for the rest of the series, you won\u00b4t find anymore of that here, plus Rentaro can be pretty stupid, and as such he is annoying and unlikeable.\\n\r\nKisara is mainly the romantic subplot, because this show needed that too, and is not exactly the best romantic subplot . Kisara is a Tsundere, and the only development she gets is, hear this, becoming a yandere in the last episode \u00a1Yay!\\n\r\nApart from that, and because of the fact that this show has a Gary Stu, they don\u00b4t really focus on her, and she doesn\u00b4t have that much screentime either, plus she is useless most of the time, so she is only there for the romantic subplot, great.\\n\r\nEnju is the \"main\" loli of the series and she pretty much embodies the archetype of the pervert loli, and is also the other romantic subplot, but this time for the lolicons. The thing that bothers me most about Enju is that even when her friends die RIGHT in front of her, no matter how many people discriminate her for being a \"Cursed Children\", no matter what problems may faze her, she just cries some minutes and then by the next episode she is the same exact pervert loli that she has always been. Really doesn\u00b4t she have some kind of trauma from all of that? \u00a1She is a freaking 10 year old! She should have some kind of trauma, or at least be depressed for days after that.\\n\r\nAnd then we have Kagetane, the \"main\" villain. If you were sharp enough you probably notice how I always write the word \"main\" between quotes, this is because in the case of Enju, the show just focus on her at the beginning, and then focus more on Rentaro since he is the Stu, but in the case of Kagetane I call him \"main\" villain because he is actually absent for most of the series, he has great presence at the beginning, then he disappears in episode 4, and reappears in episode 11, except that when he reappears he is not the villain anymore, he becomes another supporting character, and the show, again, chooses to focus more on Rentaro, which is sad because Kagetane was the only decent character, the only one with the decent dialogues, and he was a pretty decent villain, but that couldn\u00b4t last, not in this series. Something decent here? You might as well go look for a hentai that doesn\u00b4t show any boobs, it would be easier than finding something decent whether it\u00b4s in the story or the characters. In the meantime when Kagetane is not around they replace him with what I like to call \"Discount Villains\", which are by the way the worst characters in this series, which is actually quite a feat.\\n\r\nThe secondary characters in this series serve only one real purpose, TO DIE. If a secondary character doesn\u00b4t die then he is around doing nothing, and they don\u00b4t have any screen time, and as such I can\u00b4t really get to like them. Many of the secondary characters are lolis actually, and this show often kills them just for shock value, because in terms of personality each and every one of them fits into one specific archetype, whether it is the Samurai Loli, the Nekomimi Loli, the Shy loli, the Imouto Loli, you name it.\\n\r\nSo this shows follows something called the Theory of Moe Loli Replacement\u00ae (I am not the owner of this theory, all the rights belong to it\u00b4s respectful owner), in regards of the secondary loli characters. The Theory states that every time a loli dies in the series, she gets replaced by another one even more Moe in the next episode. This shows that this series only kills characters for shock value and as such, every character death, as everything in this series, is poorly executed.\\n\\n\r\nReading all this things must have made you think that I didn\u00b4t enjoy this show at all, doesn\u00b4t it?\\n\r\nAs a matter of fact I did enjoy this show, but not for the reasons that it\u00b4s creators intended. The thing is that is show is in the category of \"so bad that it is actually good\", is just fun to see all the poor death executions, all the shitty dialogue, all the clich\u00e9 characters, pointing them out and then laugh, A LOT. But as a show that tries to entertain for it\u00b4s story and characters it fails, horribly.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Judgement:\\n\r\nBlack Bullet is a show that failed at everything it tried, becoming rather funny at how someone actually thought about making all of this. It\u00b4s story tries to be \"dark\" and \"serious\", but is just dumb and full of plot holes, Deus Ex-Machinas, comedy and even loli fanservice, \u00b4cause why the fuck not? So it cannot be taken seriously, it\u00b4s characters have no real development and, except for Kagetane, they were all either unlikeable or the show didn\u00b4t have any focus on them, and Kagetane, the only decent character, is absent for most of the series.\\n\r\nAnything that this series has that is actually decent, in regards of story and characters, just gets screwed sooner or later, a show that is only recommended for those looking for a show that\u00b4s in the \"so bad that it\u00b4s good\" level.\\n\\n\r\nThis has been The Neko and I hope you have a pleasant day.",

            "content": "Black bullet is probably one of the anime that got a lot of attention since it share a same atmosphere with Shingeki no Kyojin which is despair, humanity in the edge and dark themes. As the shingeki have finished airing, the emergence of black bullet is surely gives a lot of viewer have a great expectation on this anime. Some sites says this anime is a successor of shingeki. But does it really true? I would say not.\r\nBlack bullet is an anime that been package with thriller action and dark themes. The story is about when humanity was in the near extinct and living insmall territory because monsters or parasites called Gastrea. Gastrea is not only killed people but also infected people, the people who have been attacked by gastrea have a high probability become one of them and so, humanity must struggle with that monster.\\n\\n\r\nAs the summary tells, it sounded awesome. Beforehand, Black bullet itself is an adaptation from light novel which people usually tends to have a great expectation since light novel is usually have more details in telling the story. But it wasnt happen, the story has  plotholes and moreover feel rushed. 13 Episodes is doesnt enough to cover the story. As the story with thriller feeling, how the story progress is one of the key to make viewers feel the atmosphere. But in the end,  it felt like the story drags the viewers to follow their fast paced story without telling what happen on that scene in detail and leaves a big question.\\n\\n\r\nWell, the story is not always serious, they have some cute and funny things to lighten up this story. Well, its not weird since Shiden Kanzaki previous work is romance comedy. The jokes that happen is pretty funny but since the anime themes is struggling and despair, the joke feels like out of the place.  For your info, the MC aka Rentarou have a pair named Enju which is loli. Some lovey-dovey things that happen is a little bit annoying. Why do we need to see a lovey dovey when we know that we\u2019re struggling with monsters. There isnt any coherence when this anime talks about humanity in the edge but they put some lovey-dovey jokes.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the story, the art in this anime is quite \u201cnormal\u201d for some action anime. When there is a battle, the effect is quite good, not so sparkly and they keep it as not too excessive. The background is quite detailed for an action anime and one thing to notice is how the art is suitable with the themes with the anime, the coloring in this anime is quite dark and blur which makes the despair and fear feels intensively being felt.\\n\\n\r\nOther things to notice in this art is how the design of each characters.  Sometimes the characters design isnt consistent. When watching this, i cant help to notice that in every scenes they draw the characters so badly like how Kisara\u2019s boobs shape, its quite weird and really bothering. Its  something that doesn\u2019t bode too well for an action/fantasy series such as this. In the end, there isnt something to being prominent except how the coloring that really brings the feel of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist in this anime is Kentaro and Enju, they\u2019re always being considered as a couple though its just a claim from Enju not from the both sides. Kentaro as the main character in this anime is like the other main character which is have a justice feeling and would help anyone, He also has a kind heart, calm demeanor, and comes across as brother type as what he does to Enju. Enju, in the other hand is like young sister type, differ from Kentaro, Enju see Kentaro as her couple and do what she can to get an attention. Actually this is quite interesting too see the relationship between them throughout the series. They way how they interact with each others is quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nIf there are things that awesome from this anime, it was their sound. From, the opening song this anime have Fripside with their song \u201cBlack Bullet\u201d. This song is tremendous, the gospel in this song is really enchanting and gives me a goosebumps, its quite epic song and one of the best opening song in spring 2014. Aside from the opening song, the soundtrack is great too. Its no wonder since its been arranged by Sagisu Shirou who is responsible for Evangelion, Berserk, and Magi. This time, he also made it with his music in this anime.  Its increasing the intensity feeling and quite catchy. But sadly, sometimes this soundtrack song is overly used and repetitive. It makes the song losing its taste and being plain.\\n\\n\r\nBeside the soundtrack, the seiyuu also what makes this anime more better with their voice. We got Kaji Yuki known for his voice as Eren Jaeger and also Yui Horie who known as singer and seiyuu for Hanekawa Tsubasa in Monogatari series\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this anime is not what are people expected, if we\u2019re talking about quality its just so far from Shingeki which people tends to relate this anime and of course, not all people would dislike it, some people would find this anime is interesting. This anime is good in some way and people who likes tragedy, dark themes and loli, this anime would be a great show for you.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Black Bullet is amazing, an amazing failure of a series with decent potential at its start. \r\nBlack Bullet is an anime, an anime with great potential that ultimately transformed into shambles of disappointment. Many have been comparing Black Bullet to Attack on Titan but of course, Black Bullet is intrinsically different and distinct in its own right.\r\nThe story revolves around humanity and their suppression due to the dominance and superior existence of viral parasites named Gastrea.  As humanity is left with no alternatives but to be exiled into small territory and to coexist with terror and despair, the world should evidently be indeeda dark and tragic place to live in. To survive, the loli army, I mean the cursed children are prime and vital to combat the Gastrea and are humanity\u2019s ultimate weapon born from women who have been infected by the Gastrea.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are merely bland and tedious to be the main focus of the show. Satomi Rentarou is the archetype of an indomitable, well preserved and determined male character which has been utilised throughout anime history in countless of shows. Having the best plot-armor possible, he\u2019s pretty strong in combat too. Another character in the harem, I mean cast, Enju, the notable orange hair little loli girl is energetic to the max and does not know when to keep her mouth shut at times. Enju constantly mentions her wish to marry Rentarou, that being said, it is only normal for her to have a few rivals. One of them is Kisara Tendo, the president of the agency Satomi works for and also apparently is Satomi\u2019s childhood friend, a good use of the childhood friend clich\u00e9 to add a woman with a big chest to the crew. Another main character is Tina Sprout, another loli in the group of friends who fight against the Gastrea, with sniping skills of a God and the body of a 5 year old girl, she also takes a hinted liking to Satomi Rentarou. And for the rest of the loli cursed children army characters, let\u2019s just say, never mind. \\n\\n\r\nDespite each character containing different personalities and traits, one factor largely affects the seriousness of the show, and that is the constant implementation of forced humour. The show is just ineffective in setting its own atmosphere, coming into the series; a person looking at the synopsis would come into Black Bullet believing that the show is serious and dark heavily. Scenes can be tragic and upsetting at times, leaving the audience to feel and express sympathy to the characters; however these sentimental moments are easily hindered and obstructed a few seconds later with unnecessary comedy. Being on the brink of extinction, the vibrant and lively atmosphere the cast give off does not blend in well with the plot. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s like mixing sugar with salt. It just doesn't work well.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a one-cour show, the show evidently suffers from lack of character growth and development and is bound to leave out some scenes from the original source material. The pacing transcends too quickly after the first episode and near the final few episodes of the show, it is amazingly obvious how rushed and butchered Black Bullet has become. No justice served for the source material. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is vibrant and bright most of the time despite the supposed dark tone the plot gives off. Despite the contradiction, it is enjoying and nice to look at. However, honestly it makes the viewers hard to take the show seriously because of the liveliness when humanity is on the verge of extinction. The animation and visuals during action scenes do not make the show stand out amongst other shows with decent action scenes. The CGI utilised alongside the Gastrea are used awkwardly and are not pleasant to look at which I believe sometimes fits their design well as they are not meant to look aesthetically attractive and appealing being viral parasites.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the show is probably the single best aspect of the show. Having the OP sung by fripside and the ED songs sung by Yanagi Nagi, personally one of my favourite Japanese female singers, they added a new substance to the show and made it more enjoyable. Sadly, the background music being catchy is used too many times and not always at the most appropriate moment, losing its uniqueness, style and substance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you want a serious and tragic show with a dark atmosphere, I do not recommend touching Black Bullet. However, if you love little girls, sure, dive in. Or if you just have lots of time, sure, dive in. Besides some decently executed moments, don\u2019t go in with expectations as high as the Eifel Tower as you will only come out as the world\u2019s shortest skyscraper. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Stepping into the world of Black Bullet, I was only told of negative things and not to expect much from a \"Lolis save the world\" kind of show. Unfortunately enough, a lot of what I heard held true, but not everything and those little girls weren't apart of that problem.\r\nBlack Bullet essentially is an anime that tries hard to breach the conventional post-apocalyptic human-survival setting, but is unable to do so. The show gets stuck at a crosswalk confused if it wants to do something different or stick with the same formula. Perhaps Black Bullet's greatest vice is the pacing, which is abnormally quick. Evenfor those whom have not read the light novel(such as myself) can painfully see when the chain of events are simply moving too quick for us to follow and understand. Although, while it had several cons and rough edges, it did have a few positives as well. \\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nWe're pretty much given the standard 'humanity struggling for survival against a mysterious alien race'(The mysterious alien race here is the Gastrea), in Black Bullet, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if executed correctly, but BB does not deliver exceptionally well when it came down to execution. As any story, Black Bullet attempted taking a concept that is well-known, adding their own flair to it by making Humanity's last hope the little girls. Oddly enough, this is where a lot of the negative stigma has come from and I don't think those accusations are rightly justified. When uncovering the reasoning and digging deeper into the plot, it actually seems interesting on how and why the world's fate is in the hands of little girls. It tries to question morals and how society may see those whom are different than the rest, but it just doesn't dabble much into that when it should have. The real big problem though becomes the pacing of the show. The anime for the most part was terribly paced, it went through many events and climatic moments in a heartbeat, giving an unsettle feeling of, \"What? It's over already?\" and leaving several questions unanswered. Although the pacing slightly does get better towards the end, it becomes far too late for it to save the show and unfortunately, the characters are severely affected by this too. We'll pick at the characters more later though.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): \\n\r\nLooking beyond the mountain of problems with Black Bullet, it does have its positives and the art is one aspect of that. The scenery, characters and Gastrea are all well-done and can actually be impressive when it came down to the action. I also think that many people whom are more interested in the characters will be pleasantly surprised as each character does have their distinct look and they're all for the most part appealing. It seems more obvious than not that they paid far more attention to how Black Bullet looked than other important details. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nOnce again, it felt as though the studio focused on making sure the anime sounded good as well and it did. Whether it was making sure the Gastrea sounded as disgusting and beastly as possible, giving some 'beef' to the sound of guns, music to set the mood and so-forth it was all rather pleasing and well-done, but it just feels unfortunate that while Black Bullet sounds good and looks good it lacks in other departments. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\\n\r\nAs any anime, it's important to present a worthy cast to the viewer otherwise the plot would fall apart and the audience would lose interest. You could have the strangest and most terrible plot, but if you give a show great characters it would thrive. In the case of Black Bullet, which provides a wide array of characters in a meager 13 episodes, it's a lot of misses with a few done right fortunately enough. During the story segment of my review I talked about how the pacing affects the characters drastically and that's what their downfall is. Black Bullet is able to deliver to us plenty of characters that seem very interesting when we're introduced to, but because of how quickly events are moved none of these characters get a big chance to become something more. The main focus is always on our MCs, Rentaro and Enju, so for the majority of the time we'll be watching them. This wouldn't really be a problem if the anime was solely focused on them, but it's not. Black Bullet shows off plenty of unique characters which would seem to be worthy of our attention, but they just get thrown on the back burner once introduced. The anime tries hard to make the characters 'evolve' by hitting us with short back-stories and shocking/thrilling events, but they're over in a blink of an eye and get tossed to make room for the next characters' turn. A lot of these events and interactions between characters would have actually been quite good, but they required more time to expand, which evidently, they didn't have and ended in a mess for a lot of characters. Luckily, a few characters do manage to stay afloat in the mess and become more important in the show and interesting to us. Thanks to some of the characters' involvement and personalities it isn't all bad. Unfortunately, for a lot of the other characters, you just cannot get attached to them at all no matter how hard you try.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nLooking beyond the irrelevant characters and absurd pacing, Black Bullet was somewhat enjoyable. Black Bullet piggybacked on its, 'Looks good, feels good' attitude and did so by presenting smooth high-tension action, great music and sometimes pulling sucker punches on the audience with some messed-up events that judge our sense of morals and compares it to those of the show. The story wasn't completely terrible as I was able to follow and have a general understanding of what was going on and while I didn't like many characters there were a few whom I did appreciate. Although there are plenty positives, there are far more negatives which I nor many can ignore.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10): \\n\\n\r\nBlack Bullet is an anime that had plenty of potential, but didn't use much of it. At the start it had an interesting set-up, intriguing characters and the looks, but in the end all it had was its looks and that just doesn't cut it. If the pacing was slowed down and they expanded more on the characters, we could have seen something great, but we just didn't. A very small number of characters in the cast and the 'looks good, feels good' attitude was really Black Bullet's saving grace. It was entertaining, but non-memorable and it aches me to see an anime that could have been so much more, just be nothing more than another more-or-less mediocre show. While it's not terrible as many people have claimed it to be, it's not that great either. It's unfortunate to see while Rentaro, Enju and Co. are out saving the world, they couldn't save Black Bullet from being mediocre.",

            "content": "Hey there you filthy weeb! Do you like seeing naked little girls who are only about ten years old fawning and craving for sexual activity from a much older guy while also having said little girls being covered with slime coupled with an Attack on Titan clone narrative that is rushed beyond belief? Well, then you'll love the hell out of this train wreck of a series.\r\nThis anime is like your first sexual experience; it may seem great at first, much like the show's killer opening but much like the amine's fast pacing, it will be over in about ten seconds. Well, with that horribleanalogy out of the way let's talk about all the problems with this show, and oh boy, there sure is a LOT.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the basics: the narrative. The story of Black Bullet is essentially another god damn plot in which humans are pushed to the brink of extinction by some kind of calamity or monster; and in this case, we have spider-like creatures called the Gastrea. Aside from these creatures being a rip off of the monsters from the anime Blue Gender, a show from sixteen years ago,  the creatures hardly pose any threat whatsoever. They're not as creepy as the Titans from Attack on Titan nor as threatening as the Blue from Blue gender; they're forgetful and boring. Not only that, we're told by our main protagonist that the world is near destruction but everything seems to be as fine as an episode of My Little Pony. It's the same problem with the anime The Asterix war from last year. Both shows tell the audience that the characters are living in some kind of morally grey world that is nearing its destruction via an opening narration by the main character but never actually show what they're describing in the visuals. \\n\\n\r\nThe world of Black Bullet doesn't feel like humanity struggling to stay alive like the narrator would suggest; instead it feels like a day out with Yogi Bear since no one in the show sees these monsters as any kind of threat, even more so as we see the main character quickly running to buy eggs which are on sale after easily defeating one of these beasts. As a result, there is no lingering sense of tension or uneasiness, which was one of the few things Attack on Titan got right at the very least. Here it feels weak and pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is nothing to write home about and does a terrible job at immersing you into the world. Light novel guy (aka Rentarou - the main protagonist; I'm just going to be referring to every crappy light novel character as this now) is a guy who goes around stopping various incidents and attacks made by the Gastrea with his loli sidekick, Pedophile-chan, a girl who has the power of these creatures. There are many other little girls with these sort of powers which are referred to as the \"cursed children\" and are hated by all of society, frequently being beaten by the populace and shunned for who they are. This could have been an interesting theme if they had spent more time with it and got a component writer. But nope, it's awful. They use one of the cheapest tricks: shock factor, to try and make you feel bad for these girls in the tritest way possible. Not only are all of these girls about the age of ten and are made to appear as young as possible in order to pull at your heartstrings, but many of them also die in such terrible ways to manipulate you into feeling something. Some of them are killed in a bomb attack, another gauged out her own eyes; it's pathetic how hard they want you to sympathise with these girls without even trying to develop these characters in the slightest. Shock factor is the laziest way to try and make the audience feel for these little girls as it requires no actual effort; just make it as extreme as possible and the otakus will eat it up. \\n\\n\r\nThe narrative tries way too hard to be dark and edgy but this is immediately ruined as it believes that it's fine to be dark and serious one moment and then silly and full of fan service in the immediate next moment.  This whiplash is awful and it undercuts all of the dramatic moments of the show. When we end one scene with a little girl dying and we follow it up with a stupid joke featuring a naked loli in the next scene it breaks immersion and feels stupid. Do people have the attention span of a goldfish or something? Can we just stick with one tone and keep it consistent throughout? If you want to be dark and edgy then stick to just that, or at the very least, make the transitions between these two moods more natural otherwise it becomes a joke.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, light novel guy is as generic and boring as you could imagine when it comes to a main male protagonist of a light novel adaptation. Most of the female cast fall in love with him by the end, he has no personality to speak of, never develops in the slightest and stays as equally generic as everything else in this production. He is full of stupid ass pulls and is also the strongest character in the show, making him nothing more than a bland self-insert for all of the thirteen-year-olds watching this crap. They try and present his character as being full of fear and anxieties, with the underlying idea that he believes he is useless but not nearly enough time is invested in this theme and it comes across as forced drama instead. His loli sidekick, Pedophile-chan is not much better either. She too barely changes and instead remains a loli who wants to have sex with the main protagonist just to show her appreciation. She does have a tragic back-story which could have been developed into an interesting subplot concerning her anxieties and discrimination for who she is but it's resolved in only a few minutes so any interest derived from this character is quickly shunted to the side.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a villain who was a walking deus ex machina for a few episodes before being beaten by our god Light novel guy four times. FOUR FUCKING TIMES! The villain was pretty enjoyable the first time he was introduced, as he was more fun than anything but as the show went along, his motives became even more of a jumbled mess and his character arc went literally nowhere. There are other characters but they're so uninteresting and dull there is no point in even mentioning them since they hardly impact the story in the slightest. The only thing that develops in this show is light novel guy's loli collection. \\n\\n\r\nIf everything I've listed thus far wasn't bad enough, the pacing for this anime is by far the worst I have ever seen before. We run through this show at breakneck speed, never allowing the audience a moment to drink in all of the visual stimuli that are being thrown at us every five god damn seconds and there is hardly any downtime between any of the major events in the story to allow for some character development and growth. This problem is made worse as we reach the finale, and here the writer threw every single stupid idea he had into a blender and just hoped for the best. Characters are randomly introduced, new power-ups are pulled out of thin air, characters die abruptly everywhere. It's a mess! The final scene in which Boobs Mcjiggy (light novel guy's boss, or whatever) killed a man in cold blood came out of goddamn nowhere and felt like such a cheap way to end the story on an edgy cliff-hanger that it was laughably pathetic. \\n\\n\r\n On top of all this bullshit, we have some of the worst cases of badly implemented exposition I have ever seen. No one in this horse vomit speaks like a normal person, explaining every single little detail to the audience as if we're idiots and we can't figure out anything for ourselves. It's boring to sit through and an insult to our intelligence levels.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and fight choreography was okay and it does a decent job but it's nothing special in the slightest and is definitely nothing substantial enough to raise the bar of this animation production. While I would say the animation is average at best, they had to mess it up by the usage of CG, and this is some of the worst cases of CG integration intermixed with traditional 2D animation I've seen. The Gastrea look god damn awful and make me want to gouge out my eyes with a kitchen utensil. The opening song is pretty kick ass and gets you excited for the proceeding content only to be met with the crushing realisation that you're watching the pile of trash known as Black Bullet...\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this show was atrocious. There was no effort, no talent, no passion; nothing. It's an empty husk with no ideas and no originality. The characters were boring, the plot made no logical sense half the time, it tries way too hard to be edgy, it's full of dull shock factor and you should stay far away from it. There is not a single thing I can say about this show which leads to the positive side of the spectrum, it's that bad, so, therefore, more than qualifies for a rank '1'. Again, stay away from this one. Unless you're one of those sick twat who get a kick out of watching terrible light novel adaptations...like me.",

            "content": "Hey guys, this is my first time doing this so it may not be a top-notch anime review, nevertheless, I will try my best. Please note that this is purely my opinion on the series, you can agree with me or disagree with me, I'm fine either ways.\r\nBlack Bullet sets in an apocalyptic type of environment starting in the year 2021. The human race is being overwhelmed by the widespread of a deadly virus called the \"Gastrea\". Two protagonists: a Civil Security \"Promoter\" - Rentaro Satomi and his \"Initiator\" - Enju Aihara sets off to protect Japan from the evil that lies within the epidemic.\r\nStory- 3/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be blunt, I got to say I enjoyed the first 3 episodes of the anime but after that I had my bewildered face on the entire time for the remaining episodes. Not knowing where the series was going, I persist to keep on watching it, hoping for the plot to get better, however, it just did NOT happen. \\n\\n\r\nThere are various plot holes that are yet to be filled and quite a few of things are left unexplained (e.g the origin of Gastrea, vague explanation of the surrounding environment as a whole). \\n\\n\r\nWhat irks me the most is that the population itself doesn't give me the vibe and the fear of being endangered. Everyone seems to have no problem dealing with their daily life issues even with Gastreas' presence. In addition to this problem, multiple melodramas are shown in the series but they aren't necessary since they are there to stall for time, it merely demonstrates that the story is very unorganized and the scenes were done half-assed. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good. Though I would prefer more movements for the characters that are standing far away in the background instead of a still- image. Overall, not choppy but at the same time not extremely flawless as well. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that I liked about Black Bullet is the art, the color palettes were used wisely and the shading is neat but I would like to see this definition applied to the characters as well.  \\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Black Bullet OSTs and have personally downloaded some of them. Sound effects were also properly utilized and seiyuus did well when they were casting their characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the major problems that I find with the characters in Black Bullet is that most of them are not memorable and have little to zero character development. The chemistry is too low and I have trouble connecting with most of the characters in the series. Thus, do not share the same emotional responses \\n\\n\r\nOne character that stands out to me is the self proclaimed antagonist Kagetane Hiruko. His random appearances and the way how he presents himself made me like him. Unfortunately, he was defeated by Rentaro in Episode 3 and did not made an appearance until episode 10, which is sad because this character could make things a lot more interesting. Other characters are not really worth mentioning since most of them take minor roles and do not appear later on making them forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nBlack Bullet did a poor job of introducing new characters. It seems like they are being thrown in to the story for the heck of it. I get no information and I always have this puzzled look on every single new characters that somehow slips through the cracks and play a role in the series. Put Kisara's older brother as an example, he appeared in episode 13, came out of nowhere and apparently is the one that is responsible for not investing enough money to purchase stronger \"Varanium\" into the Monolith - a magical barrier that is supposed to protect Tokya Area from the Gastreas. Why wasn't I informed about this? Where did the information come from? What is his history as one of the protectors of Tokya Area? The series did not notify its audiences and most of the new characters appear unexpectedly. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict - (Enjoyment: 5/10, Overall 4/10)\\n\\n\r\nYou know... Black Bullet could have been a MUCH BETTER anime series only if it enables us to know more about the characters and did not constantly rushes its scenes. I just couldn't get myself to enjoy the series as much as I expected to. Using merely 13 episodes to accomplish this just would not cut it. I think the producers of this series need to step back, take a breather and have a thorough think-through to how to better plan the events of Black Bullet, it doesn't matter if it takes more than 13 episodes as long as if things were explained better then I will be more than happy to give it a higher rating.",

But humanity has a secret weapon, an amazing weapon that will help humanity triumph against the evil Gastrea( which sounds like a stomach illness lol), and that only weapon they have is ........ lolis, yes lolis with some kind of power I didn't even care enough to get. So lets get down to business.\r\nStory: oh my.... yes ..ammm the story is as I already said about those alienthings attacking mankind for some reason, and there you have mankind fighting them. The best \"weapon\" humanity has is some lolis. This story had a little potential to be a good action show, but the most we got was the main character building his loli harem and flirting with other girls too. The story does not focus on the important things, most things are just \"shock factor\" scenes that made me cringe, the pacing was off, most things made no sense and you stop caring about the show about 10 min in the first episode(maybe even less).The lolis were oppressed or some shit cause they had this power and they were different and even if they were humanity's only hope humans still hated them? cause they could something .... ehhhh who cared for this anyway. \\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound : good soundtrack and good opening. The animation was quite good but nothing special. The opening was done by fripSide and it had the start of the song sound similar to the Attack On Titan opening(figures). But yeah it was a nice song nothing to complain about in this section.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Alpha male, his female friend who likes him (who would have thought) and a bunch of lolis.... yes........ The characters are just copied out of a textbook, nothing original to them, no one was likable except for maybe the first villain who was ofc. human. Near the end the main character starts to acting out of character for the sake of being \"badass\" but it makes him look like an annoying asshole and even those who might have liked him (not disliked him) started hating him. The lolis were quite explosive characters  tho ;) . Characters die and you couldn't care less, that shows how good the characters were. \\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : Bored to death, I wish I never watched this piece of crap. This show would have been the worst of the season if it was not for Brynhildr in the Darkness, (lucky aren't you)\\n\r\n0/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A pice of poo, not worth watching, a waste of time. \\n\r\n2/10",

I already read the first chapters of the manga, so I immediately noticed that the animation style and story telling in the anime was easier to follow as in the manga, where it was really exhausting to read through all that stuff.\r\nOur MC was a strong character without any great flaws, yet.\r\nThen Enju joined the scene with her overly obsessed wayof talk that was perfect for misunderstandings - a stereotype.\\n\r\nUntil this point, my impression was at leas 8/10, the villian was also great.\\n\\n\r\nAs I watched the episode every week. More and more stupid shounen/harem stereotypes started to show up. \\n\r\nThe strong MC turned into some personalityless lumb of flesh. - Basically, a loser without special treats (social skills or similar) that gets all vagina shaped individuals  to fall in love with him (I am looking at you here, Kirito) cause of pure kindness - yep.\\n\r\nThis stereotype of a MC is often used to let the majority of the otaku fanbase identify themselves with the MC.\\n\r\nAs I do not want to identify myself with any character, or at least not in that extent, I enjoy MCs with more personality, an actual 'person' that I can try to understand and get to know about.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Bullet has nice art and great music, but the charactes are lacking and just enough to be mediocre.\\n\r\nThe story is also just a generic shounen story with a 'kind' MC.\\n\r\n5/10 - Mediocre, enough for evening entertainment.",

            "content": "BLACK BULLET REVIEW:\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nWeirdly, in this future we have these parasites called Gastrea and the mankind is on full-scale war on them but because a loli in the cover had to be necessary, the Gastrea carry some virus that if infected on a little girl or a pregnant woman, the child will have external human attributes with there eyes able to glow red when they use such power. So we start of with a another generic main with a Lolicon as he's assistant for solving crimes and jazz. Soon he was chosen to be in Uber tiers and now we start of with an action orientedstory badly unfolding itself.\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nImmediately, I can't take a show seriously once I see flipping lolicons being uber bad asses killing insane monsters and trying to make it look all gritty and dramatic and jazz, sure, slap my majestic face if You said that \u201cIts because of the virus that infected their genes!\u201d But do I remember an Anime when the Lolita topic has ever been taken in a mature and serious manner? Like an NHK with Lolicons? EXCACTLY.\\n\\n\r\nThe story does feel predictable because action, edginess, future dystopia and lolis doing most of the dirty work because the instant You notice the protagonist and he's loli waifu with the whole \u201cDestopian and monsters\u201d thing, I am reminded of how Eren Yeager is so well plot armoured, and because the show tried to portray itself as a dark and edgy show, it collapses in delivering that type of content since one scene shows how this Loli so lonely and other scenes showing the two having a sexual bath together! \\n\\n\r\nThis shows the anime that it glorifies Lolita as a context to be fantasised yet trying to squeeze in those dark and predictable moments to make everyone sad.\\n\\n\r\nOK, ignoring the Loli aspect, the \u201cNon-Loli\u201d of the show are just lame. I can't remember a single persona change from those people right at the end of the series except for a few kewl power ups. The protagonist is absolutely generic as generic can get Eren Yeager style, the potential Waifus look more like sex objects than actual characters because \u201cArchetpyes\u201d sell and I stopped taking the show seriously when I saw the cover art in Crunchy Roll. The rest of the cast are the same thing like the tomboy, the quiet one, the feisty one, the stoner one and of course the c*nty one.\\n\\n\r\nThe lolis can also fit in the same space with the rest of the absolutely generic cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe only purpose for what may be a redeeming, would be the whole \u201cLoli-Action\u201d aspect if You're ever that curious to see how little girls fight to the death and to see some brain-dead action material, but, it is contradictory to how I review a show as a \u201cWhole\u201d by giving it a higher score through certain highlights, and we all know how bad Train Wrecks can be at times....\\n\\n\r\nI quote Aristotle: \u201cThe whole is bigger than the sum of its parts\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nGastrea might as well be a weaker version of the Titans from AoT, but of course, for such monsters to be effective the audience must be more sucked into the situations of the characters, interactions, complexity, emotions etc. Though because the show flopped on that department because of reasons I don't need to re-explain, also, the Gastrea are meant to be an excused backdrop to make via characters be what they are, though this can be used for other creative stuff like symbolism, tension, deaths etc. This it show does not take a better advantage of it. Consequently it does have resemblance on what it could actually do, however it doesn\u2019t help but to make all of that tension, drama, plot etc. to feel corny rather than genuine since You don't even care if any of these people were being tentacled!\\n\\n\r\nThe story overall having this whole mystery is aspect feels more stupid than anything else like how they never explain this weaker Loli to be one of the most b*tches ever, and yes it does have its \u201cGood Moments\u201d of basic fundamentals on how to make a dystopia look dystopia, like how everyone has the courstousy to take apocalyptic situations seriously but because the protagonist is so much like an Eren Yeager clone with a horridly directed side cast and the ability to survive certain death situations with BS reason, or how he's the only guy who uses two loli's in battle, or how You can predict that Enju will most unlikly die in a year or two at the second season because of plot armour.\\n\\n\r\nThe villain sucks, he's like this really cheesy guy who You never see he's identity and apparently smiling behind the mask or just trying to have unique vocal chords being full of SO much mystery and jazz is just stupid because there is no dimensionality within that!\\n\\n\r\nThe mysteriy aspect is mediocrity at finest but if I try to weigh in everything else, it overall feels as if the writers forgotten all of that potential foreshadowing in later episodes and just throw in a bunch of arse pulls that is supposed to make us think, but I'm not bothered cuz the show is so bad!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is just \u201cDum\u201d sure, You can make a nice kick for Yourself to see a beta version of Loli-Death simulator You must cry at face value 2050, with a Kirito surrounded by little girls readying themselves to be he's whore, but it constantly contradicts itself from what\u2019s fantasy and edginess...\\n\\n\r\nAnimated by Orange being there first full time production instead of working in the shady background assisting the other companies,  though CGI used at the end feels very cheap budgeted, but it overall keeps itself consistent and retains its quality. Though it is not something crazy like an Ufotable production, it is suffice to say that the backgrounds look well detailed, a larger portion of character designs don't feel completely cheap and the fight scenes involving lolis or someone using a metallic fist to kill some monsters can look great at times. The lighting also feels nice, though it doesn\u2019t use a more creative colour scheme, it still feels crisp and clean. The Gastrea design is completely forgettable and it doesn't put emphasis on any level of scare factor at all.\\n\\n\r\nAnime doesn't do a huge deal of dubstep, but when its there its really damn good. The OP feels like generic J-Pop but its action themed so I suppose it will get you kind of hyped for future episodes, and the dubstep-like OST fits really well with the mood of the series for when it get serious, wanna see an epic battle? Are You crying from the dying lolis? Do You want bland comedic fun? It fits all that but the dubstep orchestral mix were always the selling point for me. Consequently it does feel rather repetitive repeating that same tune over and over again can feel rather boring, overall its good, but I'm not a person who would tolerate repetitive tunes.\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nJust get a kick with Loli-Death simulator if You really want brain-dead action, since the show is most memorable for lolis fighting to the death. Its not epic, its not deep, its not dark but overall has pretentious writing on its throat like so many other train wrecks. I watch this show, and forget it. And everyone forgets it.\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n3/10 \u2013 Utterly forgetful character cast. I didn\u2019t hated them, their just boring!\\n\r\n4/10 \u2013 Tries to be cute yet edgy at the same time, so the show fails with an identity crisis, though it does manage to get there at the latter, the story is still stupid.\\n\r\n6.5/10 \u2013 Above average production I must say, and character\\n\r\n designs are most valued on the Lolicons and to see how cool it is for them to death battle each other.\\n\r\n6./10 \u2013 OST has a bunch of techno music with orchestra and jazz, does the job in an above average manner. Consequently, such tunes feel quite repetitive...\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nPERSONAL SCORE:\\n\r\nI want to be fed by action scenes not edginess so I can't run around with emotions bro.\\n\\n",

The great action scenes and the many cute characters are bogged down by forced emotional scenes, unbalanced progression from happy to sad moments, a predictable story, uninteresting characters, tired cliches, cheesy dialogue and poor story pacing. The action and the cute girls are worth the watch but don't expect the story to blow you away and be prepared to groan a lot from cheesy moments. It is visually impressive but not enough to save it from being terrible!",

Black Bullet has a lot of tragedy and an idea that could lead to a very good long term plot. \r\n Despite being only 13 episodes, the plot that we were presented with was still very well done and you are clearly presented with the problems that the characters attempt to fix. Overcoming obstacles and witnessing and experiencing pain, there is defined character development. However, I believe that certain events occurred too quickly leaving the audience littletime to experience the emotional turmoil. The death of certain characters happened to quickly and when the main character mourned for her friends, it consisted of only about 1, perhaps 1 1/2 of an episode.\\n\r\n While the plot was good, it was overall to rushed and I feel that the creators cut out scenes of character development to fit this into just 13 episodes.\\n\r\n However, despite my critique of the plot, I believe that the art style was fantastic. Sound effects and voice acting too were also great.",

            "content": "Since the day i have watched shingeki no kyojin, i started to become a slighty attached to animes with some apocalyptic themes, where humans are faced with something that would end their existence, and in the same time, we could see the despair and the feeling of less hope in their eyes. This Spring's year have launched a lot of good animes as No game no life, DBZ Kai 2014, Fairy tail 2014 and others animes aswell. Most of them have catch my attention like NGNL and this interesting anime called Black Bullet. After reading the sinopse, i had some high expectations, even if theidea is not so original, somehow, catches me because have a different setting and also a different enviroment and atmosphere. I Won't say that the series is a disappointment, unlikely, is a very good series, the problem is...the adaptation. Lets not waste time and start to the point uh?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10 \\n\r\nLet's go to the part that makes me a little disappointed and yet amazed, the story. The story focus near the future where humans are being exterminated by a parasital virus called Gastrea, while they live this hystorical terror moment, they are obligated to live in small territories living with the despair, horror and fear of the monsters. For at least increases a little the hope in the heart of the humanity, is created the \"civil security\", members of organization that fights against gastreas. The story starts with Satomi Rentaro, one member of the civil security aside his partner Enju Aihara, where they both have to take dangerous missions involving gastreas for fight for survive and save the humanity from the destruction. The story may be not so original yet...is extremelly amazing duo the events that happens on it principally with the cursed childrens(childrens like Enju that born with some gastrea blood for fight equal to equal with them) that constantly suffer racism and prejudice and more other factors in the anime, increasing the dark atmosphere and gripping events. I'm pretty sure you will ask \"LoneNinja123, if the story is that much amazing and good, why you give it a 6?\" - is simple, the adaptation. Black Bullet have a mediocre adaptation, by watching it, you can easy see that the animators skipped a lot of important things that caused some less impact in some scenes of the anime. Is very rushed and left a lot..and i mean A LOT of things unexplained. Duo this fact, a other problem appears, the anime itself have different arcs at 4 and 4 episodes. Duo the bad adaptation, it feels like in the first 4 episodes you are watching a arc, then in the others 4 episodes(4-8) you are watching a other arc, that don't have any ligation with the first one. Is very weird, i believe that because of the bad adapation and a lot of skipped inforation, every arc don't have a ligation one by one. I'm pretty sure if they adapt the anime just like the novel and manga, somehow would be something that would link every arc to make sense of why the events are going like that. Thats why i rate 6 in the story and also why i'm disappointed, the bad adaptation makes some parts very confused and they could have done better than it, explained everything but they end making this  and left many things without explanation and also confused to understand.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI really liked the art of Black bullet for most simple it is. It doesn't have full of details but yet the colors and designs are pretty good, i really enjoyed Hiruko, Satomi and Enju's designs, also i really loved every effects in the fights scenes on the anime. They did a very good job, but for a anime where humans are facing the fear and despair for being destroyed, more details in the facial expression would be pretty good aswell, incluing the eyes that could be better, they come out too simple.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nOne of the best things in the anime are the soundtracks. I really like OP and i really loved the ED(i prefer the ED more) also every track and OSTs fits the scene that the anime want to show. Its simple beautiful the beats on the fight themes, the orchestra, guitarl and piano themes are very well done. It helped a lot build the gripping dark atmosphere of the anime and also are memorable for many people that will hear. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThis part will be mixed between positive and negative. I loved Most of Black bullet characters as Satomi, Enju, Tina, Hiruko, Kisara and etc. They all have different personalities: calm, insane, cute, violent, determinated and etc. For most stereotypical they be, they have something that differ from the characters of other animes, thats is how they react depending of a event they are in. It express a lot of reality, and somehow you can feel how they are feeling in a determinated scene, where most of the times you beg for them and other times you feel very sorry for what happens, it's really good. Now that we have heard the positive side, lets go to the negative, i really wanted to rate 9 in the characters, but i have already told you guys the problem of Black bullet having a bad adaptation, and duo the a lot of missing informations, most of the characters don't have a very well constructed backgroud story, in other words, in a scene where you could be sad for them....you will be like...for example...neutral. The lack of information creates some characters that could have been memorable somehow...but ends being left without causing any impact, of course there are exceptions but cmon, this really disappoints. All characters should have their respective attention, so we could have enjoyed them more. Other problem is...how i can put...the characters fast change of mood during some scenes....from sad...goes to determinated...happy to angry, etc. Is very unreal in this part but they are stil enjoyable somehow.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed Black Bullet very much but duo the lack of information and a great amount of a unexplained things, the anime come out with some confusing things, decreasing the excitement but yet, is still a very good anime to watch and you will personally enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nBlack Bullet had eveything for become a very good anime, with amazing sounds; characters and stories. but for a mediocre adaptation, it turned to be something inferior than what could have become, a memorable anime. Is still good to watch and enjoy. The Novel is still ongoing, so i hope if they make a second season, make a better adaptation than what the season one be, with a lot more of suprises and twists.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Great Atmosphere\\n\r\n+Great Character Variety\\n\r\n+Beautiful Memorable Soundtracks and OSTs\\n\r\n+Gorgeous Animation and Stunning Visuals/Effects.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Its very rushed. Lack of Information and Many unexplained things that affected in many areas of the anime.",

Its a interesting show, and I can see that there are people that really like this show for its action and fast pacing of the show itself\r\nBut there is a reason I stopped watching this anime after episode 6. That's mostly because this is not my kind of anime. That lies in the way the characters are presented\r\nOr, in better words, how the characters lack any good presentation. The main characters don't have anything that makes them special or sets them apart from other anime's. \r\nbut that isn't a big problem. There are more anime's that don't havevery fleshed out characters. But the difference is that those stories focus on something different like the story or the animation. Black Bullet sort of tries to focus on a good story, and the fighting that is presented in the show. The problem is that the story isn't that good and that the fight scenes aren't that good.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason the story isn't so good, is because of the contradictions with the story itself. I cannot spoil anything, but in episode one, the main character cannot beat the villain, and in another episode he can beat him, without any more training or becoming better in his fighting. \\n\\n\r\nBut I already said, if you are the type of person that likes action in anime, and doesn't really care for the characters or story, then this is a anime for you. After all, the fight scenes are looking really great.\\n\\n\r\nBut for people who watch anime for the characters and the story, I cannot recommend this anime.",

The series follows Rentar\u014d Satomi and Enju Aihara as they fight against a virus that is causing the end of humanity. First off the opening is awesome its done by FripSide (same people that did the opening for Rail Gun \"Only My Railgun). It's an action packed anime with a story line that progresses intermittently but not in a bad way. I think its going to be enjoyable to all audiances. There are epic battles, ecchi, heart warming moments it has it all!Every main character has characteristics that make them lovable in their own way. I would love to go into more but the space is so limited. If your looking for an anime that could go anywhere and will leave you wanting more this is one of them for sure. I have not had a chance to get much of the light novel in because I can't get even the raws :-(. But as soon as I can i will work my butt off to let you all know how it turns out! :-D",

            "content": "There are certain types of shows that I like to call \u201cones you know are bad but couldn't help but like anyway\u201d. Basically what this means is that despite a series having some sort of massive flaw, depending on how you look at it you might (or might not) still be able to ignore that side for the most part and just have a good time watching it anyway. \r\nAnd at least in my opinion, Black Bullet is one of those shows.\r\nLet's start with the bad part then. As you'll find out by reading the comments for this anime essentially anywhere, what this show doesn'tseem to understand is a little something called pacing. Like so many other series before it, Black Bullet is an anime that quite simply should have had a 2-cour airing instead of 1, without extending the amount of content it covers from the original light novels. The story moves on with an absolutely blistering speed, making every episode feel like it was actually two or three episodes compressed together into one. This results in the seemingly simplistic plot becoming somewhat incomprehensible at times, simply because the anime doesn't spare the time to take a breather and explain just what the hell is currently going on or why.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise itself isn't that bad though, it's a classical setup of a post-apocalyptic world where the last remnants of humanity are trying to survive and eventually push back the invaders called Gastraea; a species of ginormous parasitic bugs that can look like anything spanning from insects to dinosaurs. Mindless, but it works, it's just that the plot moves along too fast for its own good most of the time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell then, with all that out of the way, let's move on to the slightly less negative aspects shall we?\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast of this show doesn't really have too much depth behind it, which again is an indirect consequence of the absurd pacing the anime has. However fear not, because as it happens, Black Bullet's choice of character tropes is aimed at an audience which doesn't care about such plebian details. I am of course talking about badass supernatural lolis with guns and swords!\\n\\n\r\nThis is a total make or break factor varying from viewer to viewer I should say. If you are part of the loli hate train then I would say that this fact combined with the pacing should be enough for me to say that this anime is probably not for you. However if you're as much of a lolicon as I am, then it will instead be part of what saves the show, as the anime has countless of them and they deliver pretty much what you'd want them too. Especially the lead heroine Enju is incredibly moe and adorable, and just livens up the anime whenever she gets screen time. Love her character design.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOther than that there really isn't too much to say about Black Bullet. It is a bit dark albeit nothing massive, and the plot kind of stumbles upon itself, however at the same time it also resulted in the anime constantly switching from exciting scenes to exciting scenes, as the hyperactive pacing at least assured that there was always something happening in the story. Ironically this might have actually increased the enjoyment value for me in a way, as it became an extremely marathonable show due to its constant action, however looking at the big picture then obviously the overarching story is suffering from it.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final shoutout I also have to mention that out of all the anime I've seen this season (note, I have not seen all of them mind you), Black Bullet has by far and wide the best OP *and* ED songs at the same time, especially the opening reminded me a lot of the first OP from Shingeki no Kyojin. Of course that\u2019s hardly enough to carry the show on its own, but it deserves an honorable mention at least.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal rundown:\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 4/10: However I think this could have been like 7 or 8 had it been properly adapted\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 3/10: If you're not a lolicon, 8/10: If you are a lolicon\\n\r\nArt \u2013 6/10: Didn't even feel the need to comment on this, but it was pretty average/standard\\n\r\nSound \u2013 10/10: Best of the season\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 9/10: Despite its flaws, I had a ton of fun watching this show. This number would probably be lowered quite drastically if you, again, don't like lolis, or try to take the plot too seriously, as doing so would only make you focus on its shortcomings. You're better off just turning your brain off a bit and tagging along for the ride, because if you do so then it's actually a pretty fun ride.",

So, the remaining humans have built a wall to protect themselves from being eaten. Sounds familiar, right? That's why so many comparisons are made to another anime, \u2018Attack on Titan\u2019 which in turn hurts this show. I know fans of this show are frustrated with all the comparisons but you can\u2019t deny what\u2019s in front of you. The writers and studio could have turned this into a Futuristic Sci-Fi version of \u2018AoT\u2019, somethingwe haven\u2019t particularly seen but rather settled for a cheap knock off of a popular anime. I\u2019ve compiled a short list of the comparisons between \u2018AoT\u2019 and \u2018Black Bullet\u2019 at the bottom if you don\u2019t believe me. The writing here is poor which hurts the story, leaving it with many plot holes. For instance, you don\u2019t buy the post-apocalyptic world setting since it\u2019s only mentioned in words and not shown to us. The people and city are hailed in good conditions, food is readily available alongside mechanical upgrades, health check-ups, etc. They mention a war at the beginning which is barely touched upon, the New Human creation group motives are unclear, the monster origins aren\u2019t mentioned either. And while the 1st half of the anime has a somewhat decent story, complete with lots of comedy and fan service; the other half is just downright sour! It totally throws you off balance with its sudden shift, unloading lots of information and just kills your mood and the shows momentum by eradicating most of its comedy and replacing it with dramatic seriousness. \\n\\n\r\nSo, these monsters can only be killed by special bullets and in comes the MC, Rentarou who\u2019s a combat officer resolved to kill these monsters and exacting his revenge based on what he went through in his past. Whether you want to blame it on an incomplete story or poor writing but the characters are bland and generic. Ren is a generic good guy who\u2019s pretty weak since he loses more than he actually wins. I think the show wants to play him as an underdog despite his superhuman strength and experience in martial arts but it never works cause he\u2019s very forgettable so you don\u2019t care much about what happens to him! Enju, a cursed child is another MC who\u2019s under Rentarou\u2019s care. Cursed children are depicted as monsters in society for their ability to inherit and display powers. Enju gets little growth of her own, residing as only a love struck loli. There are some good human moments throughout the show but they are poorly handled so you forget about them quickly. Like in the beginning, Enju hates her kind and distrusts Rentarou but in a span of 1 year, she completely does a 180 and we never get to see it! Very essential character change was omitted which could have easily been accomplished in 1 backstory filled episode. Kisara happens to be another love interest, or so we thought, with crazy katana skills whose biggest contribution to this anime are her fan service moments with Ecchi jokes and scenarios. She does get her own identity towards the end which happens at the cost of a potential romance but unfortunately, it\u2019s too late to care. Like why the hell will I take her seriously now when all she\u2019s done until the end is fawn all over the MC and deliver only fan service to us! The main villain is the most interesting character, both mysterious and sinister, yet his reasons for villainy is ridiculous and he came across as a weak impersonation of V from the movie \u2018V for Vendetta\u2019! \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art work from the character looks to their facial expressions are fine, though they do stand out during battles. During a character\u2019s special move, you should feel all the hype which the art style delivers but unfortunately there\u2019s no excitement in any of them. This applies especially to the MC who has the annoying habit of crying out long ass names for his Kung Fu moves every time during a fight which is very anticlimactic and stupid! The monsters looked pretty neat with the lights emitting from them but then the CGI completely ruins all the hard work! The OP is surprisingly catchy, though not special enough to remember after a while. And the rest of the OST is pretty much a dud! The voice acting for the subs were better here than the dubs, I particularly liked Yuki Kaji\u2019s work on Rentarou. Yuki managed to come across as a genuine high school kid which I appreciated. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the story was very rushed, I feel this anime would have benefited from 24 episodes run time. Now either the show didn\u2019t respect its audience or they really had no idea what theme to pick, in my opinion balance is the name of the game and often the problem of this anime. I wouldn\u2019t mind a remake if it\u2019s done properly! But stop with the plot holes and copying off \u2018AoT\u2019. Rather make it your own story without rushing integral character arcs and set a concrete tone for the show. It can still be enjoyed as a popcorn flick anime where you shut off your mind and enjoy what\u2019s in front of you.\\n\\n\\n\r\n!!!!! CONTAINS SPOILERS !!!!!\\n\r\nThese comparison points were collected from the Internet:\\n\r\n1. The world building is such where gigantic monsters live and eat humans for pleasure/hunger.\\n\r\n2. Both the Mc loses their mother by the said monster so they are hell bent on revenge.\\n\r\n3. Huge walls were created to block out the monsters, making the humans safe for a while.\\n\r\n4. But then this 1 huge monster manages to break the wall and other monsters enter the city and starts eating the humans.\\n\r\n5. Both the MC\u2019s go through their own body modification to help them fight better hence becoming one of the top fighters of their group.\\n\r\n6. Both MC\u2019s fight alongside a girl who has no parents but was saved by the MC at some point in the past so now she has undying affection for the MC.\\n\r\n7. Both shows feature a hot albeit weird scientist who are very interested in the monsters and the MC.\\n\r\n8. Both MC\u2019s come up with a reason to go across the wall and fight the monsters.\\n\\n\r\nSo here you have it! The comparisons are too many to ignore and really sucks out the fun from \u2018Black Bullet\u2019 especially if you have watched \u2018AoT\u2019 and loved it!",

            "content": "Author: Kanzaki Shiden (\u795e\u5d0e\u7d2b\u7535)\r\nBook: Black Bullet (\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8)\r\nGenres: Action / Mystery / Sci-Fi\r\n[PLOT]\r\nSet in a dystopian, virus-ridden near future, Black Bullet depicts humanity\u2019s struggle against the parasitic Gastrea, creatures terrorizing the human race and spreading the highly-contagious Gastrea virus. \r\nTo counter the threat of Gastrea, colossal monoliths made of Varanium have been erected around the remains of civilisation to prevent the approach of Gastrea. However, despite the monoliths, there are rare instances when Gastrea are able to surpass the barriers and invade the towns within.\r\nEnter the Civil Security Corporation, the organisation formed for the control and regulation of Gastrea attacks.  The Corporation forms teams consistingof one Promoter and one Initiator, who are sent to subjugate the invading Gastrea. The Promoter is responsible for battle strategy, whereas the Initiator, a Cursed Child, is in charge of combat. A Cursed Child refers a young female, infected with the Gastrea virus, which possesses heightened or even superhuman abilities, ranging from close combat to marksmanship.\\n\\n\r\nStarring the calm and level-headed Promoter Satomi Rentarou and his Initiator, the bubbly and agile ten-year old Aihara Enju, Black Bullet revolves around the pair whose job is to counter the threat of Gastrea.\\n\\n\r\n[REVIEW]\\n\r\nOn the surface, Black Bullet is essentially a series targeted towards shounen to seinen, given that its content depends heavily on cute, young girls fighting monstrous creatures also known as Gastrea. As with many other series targeted towards said audience, light-hearted comedy ensues in spite of the story\u2019s evidently dark and post-war setting; the characters do benefit from the occasional change of pace, from fast-paced combat to a more relaxed and casual daily school life setting. Inevitably, this seems to be where majority of Black Bullet\u2019s relief from fighting takes place, with moments of comedy and fan-service condensed so as to satisfy the young male demographic. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, Black Bullet does still do what it says on the box. Action and combat scenes are depicted cleanly and consistently, offering high-adrenaline fighting sequences to give the viewer a sense of being on the battlefield itself. For the most part, fights take place between the series\u2019 protagonists and various enemies aiming to conquer the post-apocalyptic Earth, and not solely Gastrea. This helps to ensure Black Bullet does not turn stale as quickly and gives the reader something to look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, some might feel that Black Bullet does regrettably struggle to set itself apart from other titles in a widely-explored, albeit repetitive, genre such as action. Fans of the genre can tell you that \u201ca world where the human race is devastated by a new superior species\u201d, be it aliens or parasites such as Gastrea, is a commonly used backbone of many action novels (see Attack on Titan, Guilty Crown, Noragami etc). Predictably then, Black Bullet does therefore rely heavily on its \u201cyoung girls fighting our battles for us\u201d theme to distinguish itself from an array of other dystopian combat series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nAs stated above, Black Bullet does seem rather reminiscent of other apocalyptic action series. It does thankfully stand out due to its use of adorable lolis though. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nClean and crisp art, with fight scenes being quite well-paced and exciting. Animation quality is also very consistent and is generally eye-candy. Especially if you're someone who likes adorable lolis, which is like, everyone. :shot:\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nVoice acting and music are well done and consistent, although the music does get a little repetitive at times. Plus Hidaka Rina is your female lead. Instant win. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nNot as much character development as compared to the light novel, which could have been expected, honestly. You still get a sense of each character being an individual and not just a copy off some other shounen manga though. And pretty much everyone but Rentarou is very likeable. Not that having another protagonist who always wins is a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nVery enjoyment, er, enjoyable. Black Bullet fulfils its job as an action series while boasting fantastic art and great voice acting. Plus lolis. Did I mention lolis? \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nAll in all, while I feel that Black Bullet might not be the most unique output of the \u201caction\u201d genre, it does hold its own niche as a child-combat anime/ novel. It does also deliver on the action as promised. Comedic relief used here and there during downtime from fighting prevents the story from crumbling into a dark, overly-negative mess, which is greatly appreciated due the fact that Black Bullet is, after all, a series targetted towards seinen, and to an extent shounen. Black Bullet's tried-and-tested story allows it to be a very enjoyable series. And while I may have spoken highly of the sereis' loli aspect earlier, I do feel that Black Bullet is the kind of series which can be enjoyed even if lolis aren't your thing.",

            "content": "*Note: If this review is tldr, then at least jump to the end and read my advice on how to approach this anime. Thanks for your patience. \r\nTwo words sum up Black Bullet very well: Paradise Lost\r\nI began watching this series out of curiosity, since it had finished airing last week. The first episode blew me away in terms of art, sound, and story. I was deeply interested in the Black Bullet's world, and I wanted to find out more. I prematurely gave this anime a 9/10 rating after the first four episodes, but that rating slowly decreased into a 6/10. At the end ofthe series I was left with an opinion on what the show was and what it could have been. \\n\\n\r\nBlack Bullet is a prime example of how a potentially great series can be ruined with sub-par pacing. It was imprudent to abridge such an enormous universe and story into a mere 13 episode show. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of the anime is quite intriguing, and you will see many other viewers refer to Attack on Titan or other dystopian anime series for Black Bullet\u2019s dark world of humans\u2019 fight against alien parasite. The premise of the story is certainly strong, but it is dragged down to terrible rating due to the quick pacing of the series. The first four episodes is a very interesting arc, and has a mini climatic moment in itself. Quickly after this, the series slowly deteriorates and diverges from its main selling point: badass action and emotional feels. \\n\r\nThe story is very complex and deserves a bit more than what most critiques are willing to give. The internal conflict of the city and the cursed, the fight against an alien race, and the personal struggles of the characters are very intriguing and interesting. Yet the main problem results from inadequate screen time spent on those important conflicts and emotional triggers, and this restricts the series from becoming more than average. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound of the show are very sharp and sleek. They really make the show shine and sparkle despite the many inherent flaws. The character designs are very well done, and the music (original soundtrack, not the OP and ED) sets the mood for both the serious and happy moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, while inherently interesting and strong, suffer from a lack of screen time and important development. The anime focuses strongly on a handful of characters, while ignoring the other very important side characters who play a pivotal role in the story. Many times, you are overwhelmed with random characters that explain the political aspect of the series, and you\u2019re left scratching your head on who that character even is. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the series. I don\u2019t believe it was a waste of my time in anyway, and I\u2019m sure that the light novels are really interesting (I have not read any of them prior to this review). If only this anime took its time and expanded the episodes from 13 to 26, then many of the problems could have been fixed. I\u2019m sad to see it end on such a sour note, and I hope a second season can perhaps make amends. \\n\\n\\n\r\n*Personal advice to those who do not want to watch the entire series due to overall negative reviews: Watch the first four episodes of the series, and leave it at that. This series is similar to the TV show Dexter \u2013 it becomes progressively worse, but the beginning is really amazing. First four episodes = 9/10 rating. \\n",

            "content": "This is my first review and english isn\u2019t my first language but bare with me\r\nStory(8/10): \r\nThe story takes place in the future where a strange viral parasite has driven the human race almost at the edge of extinction. It creates monstrous bug like creatures known as Gastrea  and is also responsible for giving superhuman powers to some of the female population (young girls) who are despised by others and are called the \"cursed children\". The story centers around  Rentarou and his partner Enju (cursed child) who fight to push back the Gastrea threat.\r\nArt(10/10):\r\nThe art was wonderful, action was fast and pretty. Character designswere everything one would hope for.\\n\\n\r\nSound(9/10):\\n\r\nThe opening and outro music were both something you would freely listen to in your free time. The ost which recently came out is the perfect music when the action starts. As for voice acting it was as expected - good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(10/10):\\n\r\nBlack bullets true strength lies with it\u2019s characters! One wouldn\u2019t expect a 13 ep anime to have such dept and character development right? Wrong! \\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters Rentarou and Enju partnership is well developed with the short time  given it doesn\u2019t feel rushed at all like most manga promotional animes, what to me is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story continues Rentarou and Enju\u2019s bond deepens and they rally up a few friend along the way. Even most side characters have their little story and reasons for fighting.\\n\\n\r\nThe main villain is mysteries masked badass who is strong and a bit out of it but looks cool and is a good match for the two mains.\\n\\n\r\nIn the character development view point it feels like every second of the anime goes as it should nothing is slow or rushed it just feels natural.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(10/10):\\n\r\nThe story itself isn\u2019t unique or astonishing BUT it\u2019s the well developed characters what makes it one of the best animes i have watched. It also doesn\u2019t hurt to have awesome art and glorious music along the way as you see the story unfold.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite animes since it got all i search in anime: a good story, good characters, some action and expecially feelings (and no, i am not talking about the usual \"i love you\").\r\nIf it is so good why 8? Because i love the mix of these elements but in truth they are just good, no more and no less: it's like when you try something good to eat but not exceptional, you'll remember only \"it was good\" without remember every single detail. But let me explain better.\r\nStory - It's not really an original one but more like an original mix ofmany things: a duo team, contagious virus and a discriminated superpowered race (surprise! they are loli). The story has \"small arcs\" and a very fast pace, often too fast (almost nothing of their past) and many scenes are \"condensed\" in few minutes (that's probably because it's an adapation and 13 episode were not enough) but it's easy to understand with small \"surprises\" occasionally. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - I don't like loli, really i don't, but you can't possibly don't like good natured people fighting to protect even people who despise them. So, returning to the topic, even if i really don't like loli and these little girls don't have a \"deep personality\" (except Tina) i think they are more then fine; i want to remember to many of you that are thinking \"they are just bland\" that they are kids, so don't expect \"death note\"-like reasoning from them ! About MC (main character) i think it's a bit classic but he faces some interesting \"moral choices\" making him somewhat interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAction - This is the \"weak point\" for me. There is a lot of action but is often rushed and for most of the show not really \"spectacular\": fights here are usually done with bullet, blades and punches; nothing flashy.\\n\\n\r\nFeelings - Here the best point. I don't really think it's an \"harem\" because unless you are really a pedo you can't really want to marry a little girl so in this anime we are talking about the \"true meaning of love\". Hey what? Are you serious? I am. I am not kidding. Love is care about others, even enemies: sometimes you got hurt for your misplaced trust and sometimes your love make people better, letting them love other people and the circle continues. \\n\\n\r\nSo if:\\n\r\n-you are good guy (i don't think you can understand many things here if you are a selfish one)\\n\r\n-you like action\\n\r\n-you like the seinen\\n\\n\r\nyou should watch it!\\n\\n",

            "content": "There's a lot of elements that go into creating a truly spectacular anime, at least from a critical standpoint. An interesting story, excellent writing, fluid pacing, an appealing art style, a good soundtrack, and character development just to name a few. This, as you can imagine, is really difficult to do; that's why there's not that many \"great\" anime titles out there. But even if a show isn't \"great\" by critical standards, that doesn't mean it can't be incredibly fun and satisfying to watch. Black Bullet is one of these shows - I'll be the first to admit that the writing isn't the best. Manyof the plot points are hopelessly contrived and at times while watching you'll just kind of throw your hands up in the air while mouthing, \"Really?\"\\n\\n\r\nBut\u2026 that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the hell out of this series. Which I did. I laughed and I cried (the feels - oh did I cry), cheered, yelled, frowned and ultimately smiled. In that way I feel like Black Bullet is on the same level of (if not slightly higher than) shows like Strike the Blood, Tokyo Ravens and Guilty Crown: if you enjoyed those you'll probably enjoy this one. Black Bullet has a lot of things going for it - the music is amazing and the art is beautiful, especially the character designs.\\n\\n\r\nJust a word of warning though - you WILL shed some tears during the course of this series. Black Bullet is a decidedly dark show and the darkness is dealt with in a very real way. This isn't your typical loli fighting anime. Everyone will enjoy watching this anime",

I'm not big on loli or any other such type of thing, but this series was actually really enjoyable almost the entire way through, but I'll go further into details with that later on.\r\nAnimation: 7\r\nThe art direction and the overall animation for the series is very well done. It's fluid and the action sequences are fast-paced and get you pumped. However in comparison to other titles that have aired around the time this did it falls short.\r\nMusic: 6\r\nThis section would have been higher if not for one reason. Instead of paying attention to themusic during the sequences the art and animation took far more attention from me as did the events in the storyline. The music I did manage to hear though fit the situations quite nicely. Because of it not feeling all that important in comparison to the story and art it only gets a six though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nAll the characters in the main cast were pretty enjoyable to be honest. The antagonists save for one specific character were just... frustrating. They got my blood boiling, soooo... well done! The one I enjoyed though was that guy who seemed to always find a way into the main character's head and mess with him which made him all the more likeable as an antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nOh boy... This would have been a lot higher of a score if not for the season ended... The storyline up until episode thirteen was enjoyable. It didn't seem to have any plot holes and a lot of the time I was freaking out over Rentaro's actions and loving the series. However the story decides to try and pull a plot twist that while not feeling forced, felt like it lacked any form of logic the series had up until that point and making one character seem completely different from how she was the entire series only to leave us with a terrible cliffhanger and no season two in sight. The ending alone lowered the score for the story which could have easily been a seven or an eight possibly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nIt was fine, but without a season two this series just seems to lack anything truly worthwhile. It's a fun ride, but don't watch this if you like conclusive endings. If a season two gets made then I'd definitely recommend watching it. However if you can't stand the type of cliffhanger ending I have previously mentioned then this is definitely not for you...\\n\r\nless",

            "content": "I dont know how to start this review, so it might be the best to put a little disclaimer: Black Bullet is an anime, that requires your attention. It is an anime that you have to watch concentrated, else it will throw you of and you probably will tend not to like.\r\nReasoning for that is the fast pacing, everything happens in a fast manner that it may throw you of if you werent watching carefully. Go in with an open mind at it will pay of.\r\nBlack Bullet may be an overdone scenario, but it is yet more unique than you might think it to be.At the beginning you are greeted wiith a rather horrible scenario. Humanity in colonies, the sky is red and clouded while their surroundings are partly burning. They think they might be save but a giant monster crashes through the sky, inflicting panic and many death before it finally came to death as the scene stops on our main protagonist, Rentaro.\\n\r\nIt is unfortunately only later explained what actually was happening to them. Humanity was attacked by a terrible menace, an alien virus called ,,Gastrea''. The virus was sent in by monsters with animal-like behaviour and the most terryfing part is the one hit -certain death, penalty. The reason for the eradication is that we had no anti-bodies to fight the virus - once bitten or just a tiny bit entering our body and the virus would assimilate aggressively. When it has 50 % of the cells under control, the virus will destroy the human shell of a host and thus a new gastrea is born.\\n\\n\r\nNext in the plot we see Rentaro in New Tokyo or better the Tokyo District - as those who survived have hidden together in the rest what was left of their cities, these are protected by huge walls made of varanium - a metall that Gastrea despise and thus avoid. \\n\\n\r\nRentaro had found the signs of an infection in the city, but is yet greeted by a misterious masked man - calling upon that he would bring destruction to the world. Rentaro was unfortunately defeated as his partner Enju arrives but likely they found the infested citizen. Here comes the tricky part then, which makes me kind of angry and confused everytime i come over it. Humanitys' last Hope are the cursed children. You hear that the gastrea virus was passed down over the mouth into pregnant women and instead of taking over the body it deeply hardened in the cells of the child. Those childs gain red eyes and superhuman abilitys to destroy the other gastrea.\\n\r\nThe fucked up thing i had with that is that those children are treated like trash. They live in slums and only the least citizen treat them like actual humans - except the promoter and even those have some a**holes in them. You get a really hard example, where a young girl had blinded herself by bleaching her eyes, just to be excepted by the other humans. What you deal with is no light anime, but one that deals with heavy questions like:\\n\\n\r\n- How can you survive?\\n\r\n- How do you treat your friends?\\n\r\n- What ideals will you stand for?\\n\r\n- Can you accept one of them, or can you stand being one of them?\\n\\n\r\nAs you see, the story can be really astonishing and confusing- if you want to watch it then you have to keep on. The art is quite fascinating, the gastrea are well made and terrifying to see, though i may have wished for some drawn versions instead of CGI ones here and there. Sound instead is very spot on, you will feel pumped and sometimes also scared. The op , sung by fripside is very fitting to the anime universe. It shows a dedication to a well thought out plot and invites you to let you immerse yourself.\\n\r\nUnfortunately due to the fast paced plot, much of the information had to be squished in a thus much other characters have been left as cameos and are not even nearly explained, which is disappointing. Though it having a lot of flaws, i had great fun with it and kept on watching. \\n\\n\r\nGiven the respective points, i have calculated the score based on story- sound , art and characters and my personal enjoyment which is why im am issuing the series a 7.6 which rounds up to 8. \\n\\n\r\nIt is unfortunately opinionated, you can not definetly say ,,Watch it, you definetly are gonna like it.''\\n\r\nI personally advice you to at least give it a try.",

Overall I do really enjoy the story that it gives. From just the first ep. it really draw me into watching it was just like BOOM BOOM THISAND THAT, if you know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\r\nany anime with good quilaty art i give it an easy 10\\n\\n\r\nSound 9\\n\r\nI love the opening, but some music sounds really dark o_o. Voice actress seems to fit every character too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10\\n\r\nI love how every Character is quite different from another. The cursed child are all different from another too. What I always love to see is character development and where the story would take them. All the character has a good bond with each other. I found myself really feeling bad for the cursed child for what they went through and I pretty much just LOVE THEM. I did wish we get to learn a lot more about the characters, we only get to learn a certain amount about them. Like i would totally love to learn more about their past.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\r\nI can't wait for the next ep is what i always thought when watching or finishing the newest ep. I really enjoied watching it\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9 \\n\r\nAs someone who just really enjoys watching anime I would really rank this as 10 out of 10, but what i did really dislike was the pace of the story, it goes way too fast. If you like fast pace anime and gets right on to the point Black Bullet is really good at doing that. It keeps the anime going and making it interesting.",

Despite its idea to follow the safe route in storyline which left it comparable to a lot of other anime, it still allows you to enjoy the show with each character unique traits and designs. \r\nThe anime is filled with side characters and villains which give the show a lot of fight scenes where each fighting style is different, this provides a good interest point.

            "content": "Black Bullet... \r\nBefore I ever watched it, I thoroughly read through a lot of reviews, nearly all who proclaimed it to be an overall mediocre show. This drastically lowered my expectations and I almost never watched it, but i just couldn't get passed the idea of the whole promoter/initiator partners concept. So I gave it a shot. Looking back now I actually wonder if I saw the same show as everyone else. Not to say anyone's opinion was wrong, I was just so impressed with Black Bullet that I didn't see the drastic negatives many others did.\r\nThe story takes place about 16 years or soin the future, in a world where humanity has been exiled into small safe territories by evil creatures called the Gastrea. The story focuses on Rentaro, a young civil officer who's job it is to fight and kill gastrea that manage to make their way into the Tokyo Area. His partner is a young girl named Enju, who is known as a \"Cursed Child\", which is a child born of a woman who was injected/impregnated with the venom of a gastrea. A new powerful Gastrea threat appears and both Rentaro and Enju, along with many others, must work together to prevent human extinction. \\n\\n\r\nJust to get it out of the way, \\n\r\nAnimation quality: I thought it was great. so yeah. the dark colors emphasized the dark intense atmosphere of the anime. \\n\r\nMusic: good (mostly in terms of its intense OP and beautiful ED)\\n\\n\r\nThe plot as a whole, although some could argue it bears a resemblance to Attack on Titan, is actually very unique and interesting. I don't think this story can't be categorized as simply as \"humans vs Gastrea\" because one major conflict throughout the show is the relationship between normal people and the Cursed Children. Now even though along side human partners it's the cursed children who are risking their lives to kill gastrea, they aren't accepted by society because they have gastrea blood in them. The general public treat them cruelly, and don't allow them to be a part of normal society. This bodes the question for the viewer \"who really are our main protagonists fighting for? Is this even worth it?\"  it provides emotional and mental conflict for both the characters and us viewers, and that makes the story that much better. Although the anime is very serious and... sad, it has it's light air of relief comedy in the relationship between Rentaro and Enju and other cursed children, who all want to marry him, which is adorable (because it's not meant to be taken seriously by the viewer, if you do, then you're watching the show wrong... it's not a loli harem). It's very enjoyable.\\n\r\nOne unfortunate negative thing to point out is the plot did feel a little rushed, which I wish wasn't the case. I think some things could have been more properly elaborated on and explained. What would have made this show better to me is if it had been say 22-24 episodes spanning this exact same plot line. Then the pacing at times wouldn't have felt so rushed and information you need to know wouldn't have felt sort of thrown in your face at times. Do I think that messed up the anime as a whole? nah. It just prevented us from being able to further appreciate the story. \\n\\n\r\nAs a whole I genuinely thoroughly enjoyed this anime specifically due to it's interesting and heartbreaking action packed plot and it's plethora of unique and like-able characters (even the main antagonist is awesome.)\\n\\n\r\nEven if it was too short to have 100% accurately adapted itself from it's light novel, I still believe Black Bullet is worth a watch. It's highly entertaining, emotionally gripping, and full of good quality action. However if you read the LN and are an absolute stickler for adaptation accuracy, then steer clear because you'll just end up all upset.\\n",

            "content": "Now this is only my opinion on how the anime was and everyone has different opinions but I least like people to give the show a chance.\r\nStory- 9\r\nWell the story or synapse is already said in the page but I will try to give a summary in my own words. Basically is about these two partners Enju and Rentarou who are part of \"Civil Service\". the \"Civil Service\" are partners who are called when there is a Gastrea. Why do they focus on these specific partners? Well lets just say Rentarou is not your ordinary HS student. There is also the problem with theCursed Children (which if you watch the anime you will find out what I mean). The story has many different mini stories within it (like with Tina, Midori, etc). The twist at the end is definitely something to look forward to as well. The story also consist of very dramatic sad scenes as well as action packed scenes and the usual comedy in between. the only flaw was that the story may have been a little rushed at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 9\\n\r\nPersonally, I liked the art. However, it sometimes really depends on which type of animation you like. But they were really adorable at times. A character that's really known for cuteness is Tina Sprout.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the ending and the opening was nice as well. The OST when fighting was amazing really suited the mood. The sad scenes I wouldn't say the OST was the best of all time but it was nice and it did go with the mood. The OST was well suited for the scenes chosen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-7\\n\r\nThere were many different type of characters. Rentarou the badass, Enju always going after Rentarou, Tina the cute type, Hiruko and her \"Papa\" the crazy type, and many more. Each character was different from the other and it was enjoyable to see new characters with different personas each time. Never got tire of meeting them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10 \\n\r\nThe anime was very enjoyable it had action as well as many surprises and sometimes comedy. It totally left a mark on me especially the ending. But the story you cold say was sometimes predictable but other time had your mind saying \"What the heck did that really just happened\". Each time the episode came out each week it always left me wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nI loved the anime, it left me wondering about of lot of things in the end but it also left such a strong impression on me that I can remember clearly remember what happens in the anime and many more minor details. \\n",

            "content": "Oh, another monster of the week show ... oh, sorry, Loli of the week. My bad. \r\nThe very first true sentence in the show goes \"If you don't want to die Rintarou, survive.\" Now, here already, I knew this was going to be one hell of a ride. \r\nBlack Bullet bears a whole lot resemblance to \"Shingeki no Kyojin\", a whole lot more popular counterpart. First and foremost, the main characters are practically identical, both having suffered a terrible tragedy of losing parents, and having one female sidekick by their side, all the time. The reason why this doesn't work as well in Black Bulletis because we literally get 5 seconds montage of how they met, and ... well, that's about it. Secondly, their relationship might be disturbing. Remember - Enju is ten years old and she oftentimes says incredibly obvious sexual remarks as well as constantly hit on our main character. But let's stick to the story for now. \\n\\n\r\nYou have the main plot in the synopsis, so I'll dwell a bit deeper. The story is composed of short arcs, each having a new enemy our main duo (trio, quadro ---?) must face. One thing you must know about the story is that it's EXTREMELY predictable. It quite literally goes by textbook when it comes to \"twists\" and the story itself. There's this one episode early on where our main character witnesses injustice in his world, where Cursed Children (little girls who embody the wide-spread virus but contain it under 50% ...) are thrown aside as thrash, despite their importance in securing peace within contained area. Then after that there's short, unnecessary scene after which comes the meeting of our Bad Guy 1 and our MC, where the Bad Guy 1 asks him: \"Did you ever witness things you would change in this world?\" (paraphrasing). And this isn't just one time. This keeps on happening over and over and over again until eventually you literally know what's going to happen next. And not next episode, next scene. Also, the story as odd shifts in the tone. It's as if the creators weren't quite sure whether they'd go \"true dark\" or \"true light\" so they kind of met it in the middle and ... well, it didn't work out well. These shifts feel weird, unnatural, even forced (which they are). The story itself is far from being spectacular: you've probably seen it in dozens of other anime. Main guy and his sidekick are world's only hope of salvation. Even though the \"power-ups\", or rather ranking increases, our MC gets are completely unjustified seeing as he's exactly the same as he was in the first episode. Oh well, I guess everyone else suddenly just got weaker. \\n\\n\r\nTwo redeeming parts of this show though are Art and Sound. Art is quite crisp and can be extremely detailed from time to time (CGI is unappreciated though) and I especially liked the ED's first 10-15 seconds. First OP is quite good while the second one is just far too generic to care. The soundtrack can be badass in the badass moments but it's oftentimes too generic for you to even notice. Voice actors wage from the most annoying pieces of voice on Earth to okayish. Props to the production team. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are ... all over the place. Our main character, Satomi Rentarou, is probably the most generic loud-mouth of shounen genre. He's like every other. He's the embodiment of them all. You'll often hear lines such as: \"I WILL SAVE THE WORLD BY MYSELF!\" (caps lock intended) or \"ENJU IS AS MUCH OF A HUMAN AS YOU AND I ARE! WE ARE ALL HUMANS!\" or \"STOP SCREWING WITH ME!\" or \"DON'T WORRY, I'LL PROTECT YOU.\"\\n\r\nYeah, our MC yells a lot. And I mean A LOT. So, if you're into that, good for you but I, personally, find it extremely annoying that every second line character spits out is a scream of sorts. \\n\r\nOur other MC, Enju, is ten year old girl with constant thoughts about male-female relationships, weird ideas about how to interact with far older dude and, quite frankly, disturbing remarks about sex. For heaven's sake, she's TEN YEARS OLD. I'd understand if you made her look ten, but she looks ten and IS ten. She's your classic hyperactive loli who's in service of the main dude because he cooks well (no, I swear. According to flashbacks, that's the reason). Then we have a lot of other characters (majority of which appeared only in the like last 4 episodes or so). We have Tina, blonde, erm ... clumsy? loli who's lost in all sense of that word. Then we have Kisara, our MC's love interest. And of course all the cockblockers (gotta have those). \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, even though cast seems varied and huge and interesting ... it's too generic. There's no unique spin to the characters, and while you may like some of them due to their quirkiness or humor, they won't stick to you so much that you'd cry if they die. (I crid evri tajm)\\n\\n\r\nBlack Bullet is a mixed bag. In one hand, you've got pretty decent visuals, fights and animation overall, and the other hand you've got ... well ... mess. It's like \"Guilty Crown\" but with far less production value. A lot of characters are annoying, for other you don't really care. and even if you find one or two that are likable, chances are they'll die or be destroyed. \\n\\n\r\nSo my final verdict: Flashy flashy, BUT NO MUSTASHY! Only watch if bored.",

            "content": "I want to love this anime so much. It has a lot of potential but I feel it could had been handled better. Despite that I really enjoyed it. \r\nSTORY: People have compared this with Attack on Titan and its not hard to see why. Civilization has closed itself off from an outside threat which threatens to consume every person. That's the overall plot, each individual arc was interesting. My one problem is that it feels like it could had been so much more. I never read the LN so I don't know exactly how much story there was available to adapt from. Just byextending it to a 24 episode season could had helped so much. To gradually see the relationships and bonds grow would had made all the struggles and difficult choices each character had to make have more of an impact. It is still very enjoyable, I simply found myself thinking \"I would had liked to have seen how they first met\" often\\n\\n\r\nART: Art style plays a major role for me. For the most part I really liked it in this series. The characters look great, fights are carried out well enough. I also like the imaginative enemies they come up with. Its nothing spectacular, but very few are. I'm normally not a fan of cg animation, but it was rarely used and well done when it was. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: This is where to me, the anime excelled at. The main protagonist is interesting, entertaining. His loli partner is cute and funny plus also quite the fighter. Every character plays a role. Towards they end they seemed to throw a couple characters into the mix. Not much of a backstory for them. That isnt really a bad thing since you'll mostly be caring about the main characters anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: I enjoyed it a lot, though the end did feel a bit rushed. The small twist a certain character had in the end felt really forced and out of nowhere. Don't go in expecting a deep and detailed story. Just watch it for what it is, a interesting, funny when it can be, heartbreaking when it has to story. If you haven't read the LN definitely watch it. If you have read the ln.....maybe just stick with the story you have in your mind",

I went into Black Bullet with no prior expectations (since I had no idea of it's origins - manga/light novel etc.) and while I wasn't disappointed, I wasn't really addicted to it either. I rated it an 8/10 but in actuality it wouldprobably be closer to a 7.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10):\\n\r\nThe story, in my opinion, was quite intriguing. The anime is set in a time where the humans have just been invaded by Gaustrea and is set showing the aftermath of the war. The story revolves around a civil officer named Rentaro and his partner Enju and their experiences as they live out their daily lives as survivors of the war.\\n\\n\r\nThe background on the Gaustrea is that only objects (swords, bullets etc) made out of Vanadium can do any decent amount of damage to them. The only other 'weapon' humans can utilize are 'cursed' children who are born with Gaustrea-type powers (like insane strength).\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\nI quite enjoyed the art-style in this anime, it was easy on the eyes to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\r\nThe voice acting throughout the anime was rather average, there were only a few characters who really had their personalities emphasized through the voice acting were the masked man (Hiruko Kagetane) and Tina Sprout. The music used helped enhance the experience but there were no outstanding sound-tracks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\r\nWhile non of the main characters really struck me as 'interesting', some of the side ones had quite the impression. Most notably, the masked man caught my attention and had an mysterious personality. Also, some of the 'cursed' children you could sympathize with as they portrayed their emotions pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):\\n\r\nLike I said already in my conclusion, the story was cool but the execution wasn't as great. I felt as if I should've enjoyed it more then I had done.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10):\\n\r\nNeither unenjoyable nor 'The Void' worthy (see my explanation on my profile about how I rate my anime if you don't know what 'The Void' is), an equilibrium found somewhere between the 2.",

            "content": "This fall anime season was just full of bad manga/LN adaptions and unfortunately Black Bullet was a causality of that force too. Well I'm not here to talk about the other crappy adaptions but here to talk about Black Bullet the anime so here we go.\r\nStory: Here we have the story of Satomi Rentarou a young promoter in a civil security agency headed by his childhood friend. A world over run by monsters called gastreas who threaten the world as they know it and want to just kill all the humans cause otherwise there wouldn't be a story. Also we have a bunch of badass lolis with super powers that help out our young hero and the other promoters that you sometimes see. Don't forget though that everyone but the civil security people despise the lolis because fuck them I don't care that they are constantly saving our world but they have some gastrea blood in them thats slowly melting them away so they are bad guys too so fuck them. \\n\r\nThe story all though very rushed in the anime is good but often gets held back and never really gets as dark as it does in the manga and LN possibly because the budget was low so only had 13 episodes which defiently wasn't enough for this story to shine and also is constantly over shadowed by the said lolis and all the other women that flock towards Satomi. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in the anime is to say the least is very bright and colorful and really displays the choas and depravity of humanties last stand and is also very moe-y. HAHA but in all seriousness it seems like the artists for this anime didn't even look at the art from the LN or manga and just decided to go with what they saw would make all the cute girls and lolis look good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I can say that the OP and ED were good but the sounds of the guns and everything else seemed like they just copied and pasted the same sounds and were like yes no one will notice how low this budget was and that we spent it all on the OP and ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I'm only going to talk about Satomi Rentarou here because he seems to be the only character that the staff really cared about in this anime and the only one who got in character put into them. So we have Satomi Rentarou who at the very beginning of this story as any typical shonen protag would have it had his parent killed by the gastrea and then shouts out that hes going to kill them all (not really was just poking fun because of same VA as SnK's Eren) then he sets of to become a promoter for this company that his childhood friend and sweet heart set up and teams up with very own loli who he tries not to touch throughout the series. He learns that the world isn't all that great as it used to be and that everyone seems to be an asshole and wants to kill his loli sidekick and all her friends and that the world his is protecting might not even be worth protecting and all that typical shonen stuff that protags seem to go through. All that said I find him to be interesting to say the least but just typical and but better than all the other characters in this anime. \\n\r\nAlso to say it here he and everyone else gets better development in the LN and manga so go read them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I got some enjoyment out of watching this slaying of a favorite series of mine just cause I kind of forced myself not to hate it in case one day by the grace of the anime lords they decide to re boot it and do it correctly I would say that I stuck by it and enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I know it seems like I bashed it throughout this review but in all honesty I feel like as a fan of this series I was betrayed that the animators and staff just threw this half assed work at me and were like enjoy it and cut out a bunch of interesting characters and cut out major fight scenes and just expected everyone to roll with it. I'm giving it an 8 only because I feel like even though it was a pretty bad adaption it wasn't the worst and certainly wasn't terrible but could have been 20 times better if done correctly. \\n\\n\r\nIn saying the least I would say watch this but don't expect anything ground breaking and if you read the LN and or manga then be prepared to be disapointed.\\n\\n\r\nPeace out and enjoy all the anime there is to watch.",

            "content": "Story: The first time I saw this anime was during an anime club meeting in high school. Anime club was supposed to be more than watching stuff, but because the original leaders graduated, things went downhill from there, but I don't have any regrets watching Black Bullet. I was obsessing over it for months afterwards because I forgot the title of it until I saw it on Crunchyroll (Heaven bless you). It may be true that the dystopian society obsessed with killing mysterious monsters who can turn human beings into monsters isn't so original, but if my friends know anything else about me, it's thatI love anything dystopian (Except the Hunger Games, and they call it art?). Normally, the monster thing would creep me out, but the whole concept glued my eyes to the TV screen. Despite being grossed out sometimes, the whole concept gets a full score from me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's clear that Black Bullet has more of a male audience focus because of how techy and dark the anime can get. In fact, everything in atmosphere is just gigantic and bold. The characters may not have as bold of features, but you can tell at every moment exactly how each character is feeling just by looking at them. Plus, just how mechanical Rentaro's metal limbs are just amazes me and makes me remember how cool anime is. Plus, the fact people can tell who the Cursed Children are by their red eyes just reminds you that this is a sci-fi dystopian story. It does get bloody, and you can just know when it's going to happen, too, because the art actually foreshadows everything. But still, I'm in love with it, and I'm a female. I know girls who are obsessed with the show and want a season two of it already. This section gets a full voting score.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This is the first anime that I've watched in which I love both opening and ending theme songs. The opening is catchy, but it's catchy to the point where it doesn't get so annoying compared to the Ouran opening theme. As the opening explains what goes on in the series, the ending just reminds you that the story is all about Enju in all honesty because the whole war with the monsters vs the humans affects her the most. Putting Enju clips at the end just makes people's hearts sink into their stomaches. I know my heart did that. Overall, this portion also deserves a 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There are four characters in the series who stand out to me most of all, two of them being the main characters of the show. When the monsters first attacked Rentaro's country, he was fatally injured and his mentor's doctoral skills saved his life. For those fifteen years, he was only focused on killing those who killed his family. His partner, Enju, is an orphaned Cursed Child and Rentaro was her only friend (and for some strange reason, not really lover. The crush thing? What the fuck is that? I mean I know little girls have crushes on older guys as a more fan base thing, but Enju wants to marry Rentaro and have his children, which is fucking scary to me). After learning of Enju's backstory, you tend to feel very sorry for her since she didn't do anything wrong. Cursed Children in Rentaro's society are the equivalent to the blacks before and during the civil rights movement, the majority just want them gone. Kisara was so badass. She knows what she wants, and no one is going to stand in her way, not even when Rentaro is so appealing. Ever since I saw those two together, I wanted them to get together. Then, realizing that this is a dystopia we are talking about, I found it very unlikely. The end proved me right (You will have to find that out for yourselves because I'm not telling you want happens). The end of the season just made me hate her, and with good reason, too. Though Tina Sprout is not considered a main character, I just felt guilty and hatred for her all at the same time. When I first met her, I thought she just wanted to destroy Rentaro and Kisara all together. No. The more she hung out with Rentaro and Enju, the more she wanted to do good in society, the more she wanted to keep Rentaro and Enju safe. Inside, Tina has a good heart. That's why I love her so much. Just because I don't like some characters, doesn't mean that this portion gets a lower score. To be fair, I drew a 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I didn't want to stop watching this show when it was close to midnight. The gut-wrenching events and epic battle scenes just have you glued onto your computer screen. Do I want a second season? Yes, and I hope they make it because I want to see more of Rentaro so bad. Great characters, epic story, and brilliant effects just give this whole thing another perfect 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime didn't get a perfect 10, but after doing the math, I had to round it up, so overall, it did by default. This is based off of my opinion. If you don't like it by the end of the day, fine. However, if you're tired of watching shojo or robots fighting each other, Black Bullet is a must see. You will get just as addicted as I did.",

            "content": "Imagine a friend telling you of some mythical anime that is like a combination of Claymore, Darker than Black, Tokyo Ghoul, Attack on Titan, and Elfen Lied with a loli multiplier. You would probably respond with something along the lines of, \"Butter my buns and twist my nipples, I must be asleep because I've had this wet dream before!\" ...That is what I originally thought when I picked this anime up. Let there be an emphasis put on \"originally\".\r\nI really, really wanted to love this anime, hell I still do, but that just isn't going to happen. See you forgot that your friend telling youabout Black Bullet is a huge dick and he might have forgot to mention to you that this anime also possesses all of SAO's worst qualities. The pacing is awful, the story predictable, the power-ups stupefying, the dialogue mind-bendingly atrocious, and the characters shallow. You will be surprised to see that even after that rant I still award Black Bullet a somewhat respectable 7/10, to be honest I am surprised as well. I think that was just the last remnants of me that want to like the anime. With this farce of an intro, I believe it's time that I break down the individual areas.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nThere isn't much to be said here. I will admit that the first arc is actually quite good and up to its conclusion I had high hopes for this anime. Then the rest of the anime happened. I almost feel like the staff poured themselves into that first arc and then just didn't have anything left to try and make the rest of the story as well. The pacing gets really wonky in the last half. Sometimes things happen/ people die and I'm pretty sure that the moment is supposed to have some profound emotional impact, but since we just met the characters it barely even registers as a bump in the road. I also feel like \"story\" is an adequate place for me to bitch about the dialogue. Whomever wrote the script needs to be drawn and quartered for cruel and unusual treatment because that dialogue was butchered. If you are watching an anime and are able to guess the next line with greater than 25% accuracy than something is wrong. It was just a wholly uninspired and dull work.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 9/10 and 8/10 \\n\r\nThe art was really pretty and the soundtrack never bothered me. I also liked the OP a bit. The action scenes were executed pretty well also. Both of these categories get thumbs up from me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nOh let me introduce you to our star-studded cast! We have Cookie Cutter Protagonist\"-chan, \"Tsundere Loli\"-chan, \"Drinking-that-Lean-Dere Loli\"-chan, \"Mysterious Mask\"-chan, and last but certainly not least \"Oppai with a Dark Past\"-chan. These are literally the only characters you will see enough to even remotely care about and all of them have the most static, boring characteristics-- well with the exception of one and we only learn about that twist near the end from \"Shy Furry Loli\"-chan at the end of her thirty seconds of screen time. Which raises another issue of how characters were never allowed much if any screen time if they weren't a main. That would have been ok if it wasn't for the fact that the creators clearly wanted us to care about these transient characters' demises. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nEhhhhhh, I guess at the end of the day I did enjoy this anime. At the very least I wanted to enjoy this anime. When it began I thought this anime might be like a 9, but that was most assuredly not meant to be. I tried to dive into this anime, but it ended up just being a shallow stream. No amount of action and lolis was going to be able to turn around my opinion of this anime... Or can it ?? I change my mind! 15/10 best anime evar cause all meh lolis! Bullet Black for President of the universe.",

            "content": "Don't watch this if you're looking for something with a well written story or some semblance of logic behind the plot or because the synopsis sounds like its going to be a survival apocalypse anime and instead you get a cookie cutter anime that tries to do everything and fails at everything. Do watch this if you enjoy wish fulfillment where everything just kind of lands in your lap; women swoon for you, you power up without even working 1 second literally for it and no explanation is really given. \r\nSome admin told me to watch more of this before writing a review and killedwhatever I had written. The reason why that review was dumped was because I had only watched one episode. Yep thats right. It only takes 1 episode to see how flimsy of a cash in light novel conversion anime this is. What was worse is that the more I watched, the worse it became plot/character/story wise. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is bad. It jumps around more than Game of Throne does and that jumps around chapter by chapter. The story isn't even about the humanity or apocalypse, its about some really egotistical cliche villain who is only there for a few episodes. And about the \"plight of the lolis\" who are considered second class citizens for unexplained reasons other than they have the blood of the virus which enables them to fight back against what almost erased humanity. It isn't worth going into the numerous plot holes that these two themes have in this anime. The anime just jumps between the two and adds some crappy twist or intrigue to try and keep it fresh. Just too many logical fallacies, plot holes, and poorly explained plots arcs.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are bad and can be described as a whole as \"one size fits all\". MC is a great example of how a large segment of anime watchers love wish fulfillment and enjoy pretending they can be this character who literally has girls falling in love with him with almost zero interaction, as well as suddenly getting super powerful without even trying to train for it (sword art online anyone?). At least Naruto and Luffy do something before getting new moves (MC literally doesn't do anything and becomes ultra powerful). The MC is so into fulfilling every different aspect of the ideal character that he even won't lay a hand on a guy who clearly was trying to destroy the lolis around him because he was saved. And at the same time he rolls around yelling at people trying to convince them loli's are people too. On the female side the first episode introduced 3 women: loli with flatchest, same aged girl with big boobs, mature woman with big boobs to cover all the major bases of the male population. This wouldn't be an issue if they had a bigger role besides a few lines a episode if the are lucky. Later on more and more girls are introduced to fill in any missed gaps and in the end they're just there to appeal to the male crowd as they all fall in love with the MC (unexplained).\\n\\n\r\nWhats good? Art is done well enough. Also if you really like lots of lolis that's good too. If you're looking for deep interactions with lolis on a frequent basis, there are better animes for those kinds of fetishes though. Also if you like harems, it gets more harem like later on. Maybe the light novels are better but I seriously doubt it.",

Rentaro (main) is by no means attracted to underage girls, he thinks of them as little sisters more than anything. I just wanted to say that because if you are anything like me, any anime that is a lolicon you just prefer to stay away from so I just wanted to clear that up.\r\nBlack Bullet has great characters, plot developement, animation, and it isn't sugarcoated or happy go lucky, all around this anime hasimpressed me more and more with each preceding episode. If you are that one person that goes around looking for a badass anime with badass characters look no further. I can't wait for the next episode to come out and I hope there will be more seasons.",

            "content": "A disease which mutates humans and turn them into various sized Godzilla's.  That's the summary of what a Gastrea is. On the other hand there are cute little girls with red eyes called the lost children. They are the almost human counterpart of what a gastrea is. the lost children have Gastrea's genes in them which supply them with superhuman powers. Together with civil officer they fight the ghastly Gastrea. All's good and well right? well not exactly. Black bullet is riddled with sadness, depicting the true nature of human beings discrimination to corruption. I believe that black bullet captures all of thisin this series\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 9/10\\n\r\nIt is divided into 3 main arcs. The masked man(self titled because i dont remember the name),Tina sprout arc and the war arc.Black bullet shows us a solid story structure which shows both sad and hilarious scenes where it is needed. However the story does have some holes in it which makes you go \"what the hell is happening here!?\" and the constant jokes of marriage of a 7 year old girl with a highschool boy can become more than annoying sometimes.Yet despite all the holes and lame jokes black bullet will keep you at the edge of you seat wondering what will happen next.\\n\\n\r\nART & CHARACTER 7/10\\n\r\nEven though black bullet dosent have awe-inspiringly good art scenes, it does have amazing battle scenes. The characters are a bit cliche'd but what the hell. Of course there has got to be an oppai girl, loli girl(s), silver haired ojou-sama and the rich girl and guess what? BINGO, you guessed it. They are all in love with him. The character designs aren't note-worthy but it isnt complete shit as well.Furthermore  There is less to no character development as well(except for a 1 or 2 people).\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\r\nThe music and soundtracks actually blend better than I ever imagined. Music while a fight is going on is nice and it kinda relates to the battle. I personally loved the opening theme.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nIn a nutshell Black Bullet provides decent animations jumbled up with impressive characters. A strong,awesome protagonist and a magnificent antagonist provides a flurry of awesome battles and surprises.The nice music combined with the incredible battle scenes only make it better. So all in all , i would recommend this to anyone that likes cool battles and seeing sad, heartbreaking themes.(yeah that's right I'm looking at you Akame Ga Kill\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL RATING 8/10",

Instead of giving itself a chance to engage into a nice plot twist in which it had the chance several times it still sticks to follow a pale and uninteresting storyline where the main character and the authority are the good guys and lots and lots of lolis , how many missed potentials did Black Bullet miss?? a lot , unlike Attack on Titan which has always grabbed ourinterest with its unorthodox and unpredictable way in writing its story. even though it used long build-ups to do so , While in Black Bullet the storyline gets crammed to fit into 13 episodes and cramming the chapters made it unenjoyable.\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThe Art is pretty good, The Visuals are pretty nice ,I would be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy the Art pretty much the best thing in this series is its art but it had some inconsistencies in its animation as there were a lot of frame skipping methods in the series which made the animation look stiff at some points.\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nThe Voice acting isn't bad , It's not that top notch either , The real problem is in the OST, they use about 3 or 4 pieces of music repetitively and they are not that good anyway which does only further makes the enjoyment less, the opening is good though and is nice to listen to.\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nThe Characters are just too standard and predictable , They are not unique and uninteresting at most times, the excessive amount of lolis also bothered me a lot. Most characters were 2 dimensional which made it uninteresting to watch, Especially that I am not a fan of moe and all, the only really interesting character in the series would be this guy \\n\r\nhttp://itadakimasuanime.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/black-bullet-03.png\\n\r\nand at some episode he just seems to lose all his hype at a later episode which is not a good sign.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nThere are some parts that I enjoyed and some that I haven't, The biggest downfall of the series to me is that how it creates interesting possible story lines then it just breaks them and move along the standard clich\u00e9 , the dialogues are cheesy and the character development falls short because of how fast the events are going, I hope they fix these problems in their second season though.\\n\r\nOverall (6 + 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 )/5 = 6.6\\n\r\nCeiling that gives us a 7\\n\r\nso its 7/10 (Good)\\n",

            "content": "When I first started examining anime for the season, I completely passed this over. Every time I looked, I saw mediocre ratings. After reading what pretty much everyone else has to say about this thing, I wasn\u2019t expecting much. I\u2019m glad I gave it a chance. \r\nMost shows of roughly this type spend half their first episode spouting expository dialogue (and probably a good portion of the rest as well). Black Bullet lets you pick things up on your own. It contains far less exposition than most anime, and what it uses is well-placed and unobtrusive. If your mood isn\u2019t favoring a brainy show, butyou\u2019d rather do without the spoon-feeding, you\u2019ve probably found the right anime. \\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t think of any point where Rentarou really annoys me as a protagonist. On the contrary, he seems like someone who is genuinely trying to become a better person, even while learning to deal with the cruel realities of his world. In many ways, this show is about his growth as a person. \\n\\n\r\nIf you ask me to point to the show\u2019s greatest flaw, I\u2019d go right for the harem aspect. It holds the greatest potential for destroying suspension of disbelief. I certainly wouldn\u2019t classify this show as harem genre, but for some reason EVERYONE in this show is enamored of its largely unassuming protagonist. I don\u2019t mean to turn anyone off. Black Bullet shares little with harem anime besides Rentarou\u2019s strangely magnetic effect. Even villains like him. \\n",

            "content": "This show is one of the few this season that did not reach my expectations. When it was first announced, I was stoked. The PV made me even more excited when I saw the artwork. \r\nI read some of the manga, but as I realized it was nowhere near as far as the LN was, I stopped and figured I might as well just watch the anime instead. \r\nMany people see this anime as overrated, which is understandable. I see it that way too. It was hyped up as it came out, and it certainly doesn't deserve the hyped it received. The same could besaid about series like Attack on Titan, which I also find to be overrated. So why the high score? I suppose I'll tell you. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThe story is similar to Attack on Titan, which is why it's compared to it all the time. Basically, the human race is cornered by an extremely powerful mutant species, and they're trying their hardest to struggle for survival. \\n\r\nThe plot here is a bit different, though. The creatures, known as Gastrea, are like zombies in terms of being created by an infected directly implanted into the body. Except, these things are nothing like zombies. Whatsoever. Which is good and bad in it's own way. (I'm sick of zombies, though, there aren't many good zombie anime out there.)\\n\r\nAnyway, the plot is straight forward with a couple of sidetracks here and there. Usually these sidetracks are to introduce more characters, such as Tina. This can be a good and a bad thing whichever way you see it. I don't really mind, so it didn't really effect the score. Though the Gastrea aren't actually dealt with until near the end. \\n\r\nThe pacing is fast. Extremely fast. To the point where it may be way too fast for you. The pacing bothered me, but at the same time, I understood that it was necessary, since the plot for Black Bullet is huge and hard to compress into 13 episodes. \\n\r\nOther than the pacing and sidetracking, the story wasn't very original. There are several series with similar story lines, but I suppose the way it's dealt with in this show can be considered \"unique\". \\n\r\nWhen it comes to the ending, though, I was satisfied. I won't say anymore because... it may hint some kind of spoiler. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art style of this show is fantastic. It's fresh, new, and the animation is flawless. Definitely fits the 2014 quality bill. The way the city is portrayed is also perfection, in my eyes. It has a sort of dark sci-fi atmosphere to it. Which is great, because I love those kinds of things. \\n\r\nCharacter designs ranged, from simple and bland to... interesting. I liked some of the children's outfits, such as Enju. Characters like Kisara and Rentarou had plain outfits. So on and so forth. Either way, the art is outstanding. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\r\nThere isn't really anything stand-out in this section. The soundtrack was good but not worth mentioning. Though, I liked the atmosphere is helped create. The opening is catchy and fits the show well, but the ending... the ending song is amazing. I never skipped the ending song, I could not get enough of it. Beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8 \\n\r\nAgain, nothing really worth mentioning except for the portrayal of the character's feelings and conflicts. \\n\r\nFor this, my biggest example is Rentarou. \\n\r\nAfter a bit of time, Rentarou actually begins to question why exactly is he even bothering to protect humanity. He's noticed how horrible we can be, especially in the treatment of the cursed children. He doesn't like or accept the way we treat each other, and begins to hesitate. There's also his feelings near the end of the show. \\n\r\nHe begins to notice that, after the amount of murders and deaths he has witnessed and/or caused, he's starting to become used to people dying. It's uncomfortable for him, and it would be for anyone, to realize that you basically don't care anymore if someone were to die either because or not because of you. This aspect really only appears in the last episode, but the show did a fantastic job growing those feelings up until that point. \\n\r\nThe relationship between Rentarou and Enju is also something else worth mentioning. Rentarou does his best to give Enju a good life, despite the times their living in. He pulls her away from gory scenes that may effect her mind or lies to her to make her feel better about situation, as any parent would. After a while, there's a shift. Really in the end though. Rentarou then turns to Enju, after realizing his feelings for people deaths are weakening, for comfort. An example of this is a scene where he begins to cry, lays his head unto Enju's lap and tells her \"Please stay by my side, forever...\" \\n\r\nIt was touching, and it was a relief to see the main character not shy away from getting close to someone like her. If you consider it romantic or not, it's your call. I don't know what to call it yet. \\n\r\nOne thing I disliked though was in the end. A certain character has a sudden shift in feelings, apparently turning \"evil\". But why? I don't understand the sudden change in emotions. Just before, they were acting fine. Now they're evil? Please help me understand! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 \\n\r\nOverall, this is a good series. Actually, I'll give it the status of \"just above good\" as in, it's not quite at the level of great, but it's a little in between. \\n\r\nThe action scenes are VERY fluid, I may add, the there's many unpredictable twists and turns that lead to the deaths of certain characters. Trust me, it's not just random, merciless deaths like in Attack on Titan either. I promise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series receives an 8/10. \\n\r\nIf you're looking for a sci-fi survival action series with outstanding animation and good action, look no further. It's fast-paced, but it's definitely entertaining in it's own, unique way. \\n\r\n(Plus there's a lot of emotional scenes that actually had me tearing up, and at one point I found myself crying like a baby, and I wasn't really sure why it had effected me so strongly.)",

            "content": "Black Bullet... First off, the review I\u2019m about to write doesn\u2019t contain any spoiler. So it\u2019s safe to read even if you haven\u2019t watched the show yet.  A lot of you might think Black Bullet is just another Harem story, well, you sir, are correct. And a bit off, too. Why? \u2018Cause Black Bullet\u2019s a lot darker than your average shounen-action-series out there.\r\nStory: 9\r\nGastrea. Gastreas are freakishly-oversized-insects. They inject their viruses on humans to turn them into one of them. Faced with the threat of being annihilated by these abominations, Civil Securities are made to combat Gastreas. Satomi Rentaro is an initiator and isa member of Tendo Civil Security. Along with his Promoter, Aihara Enju our main Loli, one of the many \u201ccursed child\u201d (I don\u2019t need to explain this, you\u2019ll be introduced to them early in the show). Together, they are tasked with completing missions given by the higher-ups. That\u2019s basically the gist of the show. Further explanations will result to spoilers, and you don\u2019t want that, right?\\n\r\n You might think it\u2019s quite high, no? But 9 is a reasonable score for Black Bullet\u2019s plot, and plot twists, lots of it!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nLike I\u2019ve been saying with my past reviews, \u201cWe rarely, most likely, not see any art that\u2019ll disappoint us these days.\u201d Primarily, because of the technology today. It is not a bad thing at all. Most of the shows today are crappy, to tell ya the truth. And guess what their redeeming point is? It\u2019s the effin\u2019 art. A shitty-show with great art will still attract lots of viewers. After all, most of us \u201cJudge the book by its cover\u201d. Well enough with my shitty-ass lecture. Black Bullet deserves a nine in art on every aspect. It has great details on everything. Enough said.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nLoli(s)!? Loli(s)!? Loli(s)!? LOLITAS EVERYWHERE!!! Yep, 80% of Black Bullet\u2019s world is composed with lolitas. Jk. Although, there are \u201ca LOT\u201d lolitas in the show, which makes me happy! Don\u2019t get me wrong! I am not a lolicon! I swear on me mum (guilty).\\n\r\nJokes aside, Black Bullet\u2019s a harem show. So Rentaro will be flocked on by girls (mostly, little ones). Every character in the show compliments Rentaro\u2019s personality, which is a great thing. Each one of them are drawn perfectly, to supporting casts, to the main characters. No character has been short of personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI absolutely enjoyed Black Bullet, no sarcasm intended. Or maybe I just enjoyed it because I\u2019ve watched it after watching Neon Genesis Evangelion, I wonder? I enjoyed watching the show. Although, it\u2019s a bit short, it was able to portray where its plot headed to. No episode disappointed me, everything was placed well. The \u201ccalm before the storm\u201d episodes were quite heart-warming.  Black Bullet\u2019s story telling impacted a lot on me. I mean, it can make you smile at one episode and it\u2019ll make you feel devastated at the very next one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThe fact that Black Bullet is not your typical shounen show which consists only of clich\u00e9-one-liners is damn great. Although, a lot might say the show's a bit grim. Reality's fairly grim, too, no? Black Bullet exceeded my expectations. With the way the plot has turned to, with all the plot twists. It fairly deserves a 9! Overall, Black Bullet is a great show. The balance of heart-warming episodes to action-packed scenes are totally great.\\n\\n\r\nOk, I break my promise right here. I\u2019m about to write where I think the plot is heading to. *WARNING* *DO NOT READ IF YOU DON\u2019T WANT TO GET SPOILED*\\n\\n\r\nWith all the deaths and plot twist that happened in this season, a season two is inevitable, I guess?\\n\r\nBlack Bullet\u2019s brimming with potential. Yes, I just love protagonists turning into antagonists! With Tendo Kisara\u2019s dark side awakening, I can imagine something big is happening! I just hope Kadokawa won\u2019t make us wait any longer!\\n",

Black Bullet has a good story line, the fight against the monsters, etc., though it's not very much used. \r\nThe graphics are very good, and really help to show this anime's atmosphere. The sound...Well, also fit the atmosphere, but isn't really that good. \r\nThe characters, though higly stereotyped, are my favourite part of Black Bullet. \r\nFirst, the main character, Satomi Rentaro, is a classic anime hero, who believes in his friends and who will do everything too win, who will even sacrifice himself, etc. But I still likehim pretty much, cause he's strong and doesn't just sit and watch his Initiator do the job. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnju, his friend and Initiator, is always excited and full of energy, and it is one thing I like the most, because it changes of the sad and pessimistic personnality of many other characters such as Rentaro or Kisara.\\n\\n\r\nTina Sprout, who is at the beginning presented as an ennemy, and then join Rentaro, is my favourite character in Black Bullet. First of all, she's a sniper. She has an excellent eyesight, and tends to live at night. In fact, she's a Cursed Child from an Owl Gastrea. Also, she's - well, strong, obviously - but also very cute, in the way that she doesn't know much of the life and is pretty serious, which makes a good contrast with the over-excited Enju. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion : Black Bullet is a good action anime, but it also makes think a lot about great questions, such as racism or segregation, and having a reason to live, etc.",

It starts with an interesting AoT-like apocalypse setting with sci-fi elements, and enjoys good soundtrack and decent production, but turns out to be a mediocre shounen loli-harem-doing-cute-things fan-servicing show that has zero plot progression and expands the range of world too far that not many foreshadowings are actually revealed within the anime.\r\nThe story starts with our beloved Kaji Yuki VA character that acts cool and cold-blooded. He works a loli partner, who is actually a demi-monster and risks her life in fighting those monsters. So as I was guessing the anime were gonna show the brutality of demi-monsters struggling intheir personalities and not to become a complete monster, the anime introduced more and more high school girls and a female doctor who works in this anime solely to help prepare the materials that the author needed to progress the story.  And then more lolis are introduced, who becomes our beloved MC's harem, and then boom! They fight the final boss and wins.\\n\r\nWhat an unpredictable ride.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\r\nThe way the story progressed contains no sense at all. Why did that mask guy acts like he was the MC's enemy at first and then suddenly fights that big monster with MC? Why was Seitenshi always caring about MC and allows MC all the rights he wants? Why did Tendou Kisara change her personality? We got ZERO explanation to all those. Instead, we got more screentime for lolis and lolis and explosion scene.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe slice-of-life scenes are done pretty well, not just showing slideshows but has moving characters with detailed emotions. The fight scenes are mediocre though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThis soundtrack is memorable: https://youtu.be/m9JCveBR-TI\\n\r\nOthers are just fine.\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nI have been expecting deep characterization to Satomi Rentarou since episode 1, as he acts so sad like he has a sad past. But no, they decide to put more 2D lolis into this anime. We got an energetic loli, a silent loli, a smiling loli, and so on.\\n\r\nAnd it is like a joke that Satomi claimed that he likes Tendou, as he seldom shows liking in anyone, including Tendou. Which is annoying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nNot really enjoying, but since the art is fine, I still completed this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: F\\n\r\nThis anime fails to grab the setting and explores it well. Instead, it just becomes a mediocre loli-killing show that fulfils some's interest.",

            "content": "The amount of casual pedophilia in this series is high enough that it makes me think maybe we should just set Japan on fire. If you can somehow overlook that disgusting fact and make it through the first few episodes, the poor writing becomes terribly apparent. Generously speaking, the exposition is clunky. The majority of information about the world of Black Bullet is conveyed through two characters standing around and telling each other information they both already know for the sake of the audience. It's transparent and lazy writing. Further, events and developments happen without any obvious pre-planning or intention. Characters are saved from situationsand the story progresses through deus ex machina and convenient plot devices, rather than being propelled naturally by the choices characters make or the nature of the world. The characters themselves are unidimensional at their best and annoying the rest of the time. This series deserves my quitting it, however, I'm neurotic about needing closure (and it's quite short), so I will probably finish it so I can be certain that my criticisms are valid. If you're reading this review and have yet to begin the series, pass it on. There are many other series that take the same essential concepts (e.g., human weapons, humans at war with monsters, humans trapped inside walls to protect them from said monsters) and deliver upon them in more cohesive and intelligent ways. Spare yourself from the nauseating contemplation of how a series got away with sexualizing a bunch of ten-year-old girls and what that says about its fanbase.\\n\\n",

The story essentially centers around humanity vs Gastrea, a kind of virus which causes beasts to mutate - the longer the mutation is allowed to occur unchecked, the stronger the beast will be.\r\nDespite being only 13 episodes, the series definitely tries to give plenty of feels, especially in the latter half. There are also some OK battle-scenes, although they tend to be short. This is definitely \"seinen\" grade - younger viewers might not enjoy some of the more mature themes explored. Someother reviewers pointed out that there is a \"loli\" aspect. While there's a nod in that general direction, this also ties in with the story, although as far as I know, there's no explanation why that particular class of person [spoilers redacted] cannot be male.\\n\\n\r\nIs this anime worth watching? I believe so. Black bullet is not a top 10 series by any means, but very enjoyable nonetheless, and at 13 episodes, why not?",

It met my expectation for a generic shounen show. good, but not excellent.\r\nStory: 6\r\nStory is the worst part of this anime, not the plot of the anime, the setup was fine and interesting, but the problem with it is the length of the anime. Black Bullet is only 12 episodes long, so there isn't enough time to fit the whole plot and character development. The anime felt very rushed, little to no character development. If it was 24 episodes, this anime would'vebeen great. And the whole brink of extinction part, the streets and people in the anime feels very safe, doesn't feel like humans that are in the verge of extinction at all.\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nArt is outstanding and very beautiful. fighting scenes are animated very well. Art is very consistent throughout the series.\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nOpening song is done by FripSide (who also did Railgun). ED is also good but the theme song is somewhat forgettable.\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nOur hero Satomi Rentaro here is not overpowered like other main characters, he is pretty balanced. There is character development but not much because of what I already said, 12 episodes is not enough. And the loli force are very cute and likeable. Kisara was a little bit annoying though.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this show and I would recommend it to anyone who would like shounen and anime with a LOT of lolis :)\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nBlack Bullet is a good anime, starts out very well but ends wrong.

Among the survivors is a boy named Rentaro Satomi\u00a0(\u91cc\u898b \u84ee\u592a\u90ce). 10 years later Rentaro is working for the anti gastrea force known as civil security. Rentaro works for the Tendo civil Security which is owned by Kisara Tendou\u00a0(\u5929\u7ae5 \u6728\u66f4). Another member of the Tendo security is 10 year old Enju Aihara\u00a0(\u85cd\u539f \u5ef6\u73e0), partner of Rentaro. The gastrea have a weakness against a metal called Varanium, which civil security agents make their weapons out of.\r\nBelieve itor not, about half the cast are little girls and it's not even a lolicon. These little girls, though cute, they are deadly beings known as \"Cursed Children\" because they have the gastrea virus in their little bodies causing them to have red eyes and super powers. Each civil security agent has their own cursed child partner which they are dubbed as Initiators while the human partner is known as the Promoter.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Black Bullet are pretty good, though half are little girls. The lore is pretty cool but lacks an explanation about the gastrea and how the varanium monoliths surrounding the Tokyo area actually work. Each cursed child has a different ability that they use to fight the gastrea. There arent a whole lot of fighting scenes and they're not that long but it's still entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is really good and the soundtrack is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThere are 13 episodes so it doesn't take long to finish. I'm not sure if Black Bullet will get a second season or not, but I wouldn't mind if it does since it's a pretty cool anime. If you can get past the fact that the majority of characters are little girls in a somewhat dark anime then definitely give this one a shot.\\n\\n\r\nThis concludes my review so if you have any questons, just ask. In the meantime, I'll be forging my own varanium weapon to combat the gastrea.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall: 9",

It is not known why Gastrea Virus only allows for the Cursed Children to be born only as females, but it sure helps the entire harem genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Black Bullet is divided into 3 distinct plot arcs, namely the Hiruko Kagetane arc, the Tina Sprout arc and the final Aldebaran arc. I will go through the merits and flaws of each arc chronologically.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first arc, our two inseparable protagonists, Satomi and Enju start off in the middle of a mission to locate and eliminate a Gastrea running rampant in the streets of Tokyo. The promoter-initiator team fail to catch it, but instead faces off with an infected human who turns into a Gastrea himself, and destroys him before he causes more havoc. Immediately we are given a grim reminder of how gory and bloody this anime can be, and of how much resemblance it bears to classic \"zombie\"-type shows where humans are at risk of turning into monsters themselves. (+1 for excitement)\\n\\n\r\nImmediately afterward, the two are summoned by Seitenshi to a meeting of civil officers, where one of them, Hiruko Kagetane, starts killing off many of the civil officers there without proper reason and threatens to obtain a dangerous package, said to be able to summon a level 4 Gastrea, located within the Gastrea that was running rampant. At this point, explanation about the different classes and levels of Gastrea make them seem very similar to the Kaijus as depicted in Pacific Rim, where the higher level they are, the large and more powerful they become. As Satomi races to get the package ahead of Kagetane, he encounters them and gets defeated but somehow survives to have another go at them again. This time, he and Enju managed to beat them and retrieve the package that Seitenshi needed.\\n\\n\r\nThe contents of the package, as it turns out, happens to be a little bicycle rather than something dangerous that Satomi thought it would be, but after confronting Seitenshi about this, he isn't given any answers and for the rest of this anime, nothing further is said about the first Kanto war, or about the origins of the Gastrea in the first place, so that's a real bummer. The anime completely avoids any explanation on the entire point of the first arc, so it really suffers from plot depth entirely.\\n\\n\r\nIn the second arc, Seitenshi hires Satomi as a personal bodyguard, and in so doing introduces a very unnecessary, stupid and annoying \"rivalry\" between Satomi and Yasuwaki, who has a complex for Seitenshi-sama (though honestly, who wouldn't when she has that innocent kind of face?). This particular plot point sparks off an entire host of stupid \"revenge\" things that Yasuwaki does which end up as failed plot twists. We learn soon that Seitenshi is an assassination target by a girl called Tina Sprout, who so happens bumps into Satomi in the day, and has to face-off with him at night while he is guarding Seitenshi.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Ayn Rand, Tina's boss, finds out Satomi's identity, he orders Tina Sprout to kill Kisara, Satomi's boss. At this point Tina doesn't know that Satomi is the bodyguard and she conveniently drops her phone after someone bumps into her so that she never gets the information that Satomi was actually her target. Kisara nearly dies in Tina's hands, but it was honestly Tina's fault that she failed to kill Kisara faster. Anyway, Satomi is there to save her and finally faces off against Tina in a battle where Satomi triumphs.\\n\\n\r\nYasuwaki then randomly appears and shoots Tina, and then immediately gets demoted by Seitenshi, who has somehow known that Tina was being controlled by Ayn Rand, and then promotes Satomi to be Yasuwaki's senior-in-rank. Again, at the end of the arc, we get no explanation about Ayn Rand and his connection to Sogen, the alleged perpetrator of the whole episode, and we also get no explanation as to why Tina wasn't charged with anything and how come she can suddenly join the Tendo Civil Security agency. This arc was honestly quite the mess.\\n\\n\r\nThe last and final arc was basically a huge war between the Gastrea and the civil officers, sparked by the collapse of Monolith 32 due to a varanium-corrosive liquid that a level 4 Gastrea, Aldebaran was emitting. It starts off with Satomi looking around for people to join his team, and managed to get Katagiri Tamaki, his older brother and Shouma Nagisawa, and old friend, to do so.\\n\\n\r\nWhile preparations are being made to defend against the frontal Gastrea assault, there is a side-story arc about Satomi and Kisara teaching a group of Cursed Children kids and getting all familiar with them before they are brutally bombed by unknown people who are not mentioned in the anime, and increasing the drama and tension between normal people and cursed children, and advancing the plot in no particular way. This segment was completely useless because the children were only after they died, so the melodrama felt completely forced and lame.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, back to the war, the civil officers are down to 50% of the strength after they unexpectedly encounter the Pleiades, known as the Spear of Light that killed many of their forces in the first battle. Satomi then, under orders, sets off the kill the Pleiades once and for all so that they would have an upper hand in the subsequent fight. Satomi ends up encountering Kagetane, whom he thought he killed off in the first arc, who saved his life from a bunch of Gastrea wolves. The two end up cooperating to kill of Pleiades and they rush back to the remaining civil officers to regroup for a final stand against the remaining Gastrea.\\n\\n\r\nAfter some absolutely mindless dictatorship act by Satomi, who claims that it's better for the civil officers to fear their leader than to fear the Gastrea, they come up with a plan, together with Miori, a weapons specialist, to insert an EP Bomb capable of destroying the supposedly-immortal Aldebaran from the inside. As the plan goes underway, Satomi managed to get the bomb in, but for reasons unknown and for plot convenience, the bomb's timer malfunctions and Shouma ends up having to use his shockwave punch to detonate it, killing both Aldebaran and Shouma in a massive giant explosion.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, they are announced as victors of the 3rd Gastrea War. Kisara ends up killing Kazumitsu, her brother, who endangered everyone's lives by making Monolith 32 out of cheaper material. However, nothing conclusive is said about the entire discrimination against Cursed Children conflict and the perpetrators who bombed innocent schoolchildren were never found. Also, Kisara ends up being engulfed by some inner evil and leaves Satomi, putting an end to a relationship that the audience honestly wanted to have succeeded.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the story was pretty much cliched and non-original. While there was some attempt at creating a deeper plot, by chunking elements of discrimination, revenge and corruption into it, none of these themes were thoroughly examined enough to give it credit. Also, none of the plot twists made any sense, as those that were surprising were incoherent and those that had potential were never explained. There was at least a main overarching conflict as in the war against Gastrea, but this conflict was never resolved (+1). As for coherence, I have a lot of plot holes to mention.\\n\\n\r\nIn Episode 2, the old man in the business suit tells all the civil security officers intend to decline the job to leave, despite him not informing them anything about the details of the job. He then goes on to say that the moment they are informed, they cannot decline. So basically nobody is allowed to make informed decisions? In the end, the job of retrieving the package turned out to be \"first-come-first-serve\" so none of what that man said held any water.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, in episode 2, when Hiruko Kagetane is officially introduced, he takes out a clean present that is later revealed to have contained a decapitated head. The anime then cuts into a horrifying \"reveal\" of a bloodied present to give the audience a scare. But this is all a farce because if there really was a bloody head inside, how the heck did Kagetane keep the present so clean all this while? Also, if Kagetane killed that man earlier, shouldn't all the blood in the head have dried up by now? None of this makes sense, the dramatic reveal was really forced.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 3, there is a lot of talk about the Initiators being discriminated against even though they protect humanity. But if the Cursed Children are the only way to defeat Gastrea, then why are so many of them still left to live alone in the outskirts? Is the majority of humanity ignorant of this fact? Because that's not possible with so many civil servants around. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, why aren't these children being sent to government training facilities and made to hone their skills to fight against Gastrea? Why is it that so many of these children are left abandoned, left to die, and only a few are becoming Initiators? That's just a huge wastage of talent right there.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, when Satomi is defeated by Kagetane, he gets shot in the chest, then stabbed and sawed repeatedly by two swords, then shot again in the chest and falls off a cliff into a river. It's hard to believe at this point, that he could still possibly survive. Even if the blood loss doesn't kill him, he would drown. Also, he manages to recover without any major organ damage within one day and three hours. I don't know about you, but this guy must be Wolverine or something.\\n\\n\r\nIn Episode 6, highly skilled assassin Tina finds that the best way to identify her target is to simply ask the target herself and get vocal confirmation, instead of visual confirmation. This basically gives Kisara time to react and prevented Tina from succeeding her mission with one hit. Not very professional, if you ask me. If Tina's boss has given her all the required information to track down Kisara, there's no reason he wasn't able to give her an image to allow her to confirm her target.\\n\\n\r\nIn Episode 7, Yasuwaki goes to ambush Satomi and shoots Tina, then says that he wanted to see Satomi's desperate reaction to it. But how would Yasuwaki know anything about Satomi's relationship with Tina? In fact, how would Yasuwaki even know that Tina was still alive when she was barely even moving in Satomi's arms? Also, how the heck were the two others guards able to pin down Satomi by just holding each of his arms? Satomi is way stronger than that and would have easily escaped their grapple and stopped Yasuwaki.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the episode, Tina joins Kisara's agency but nothing is said of her interrogation or sentence. Does this mean Tina was acquitted? How and why? Perhaps because she was a minor?\\n\r\nI guess that means it's perfectly fine to assassinate people as long as you're a minor then. Also, even though the anime does mention that Ayn Rand would come to target her soon, this is never followed-up on in the anime, so it fails right there.\\n\\n\r\nIn Episode 10, the anime makes a futile attempt at introducing the names of the schoolchildren after they've all died. Unfortunately, they should have done this earlier and since all of the children were pretty much the same, they could all have just been one entity and it wouldn't have mattered. The entire emotional scene is a complete farce that doesn't do anything for the plot anyway. Who bombed the place? How did this person know that place amidst all the rubble even exists? None of this was explained in the anime, just left hanging for audiences to get confused.\\n\\n\r\nIn Episode 11, Tina says that her Shenfield scanners can only scan surroundings but cannot send images to her. This makes no sense because if she can control them remotely, and if Shenfield has a scanning ability, there's no reason why it can't send the wavelength information back to her. Also, how does she know that the mercury-shooting Gastrea was large if she didn't get any image from Shenfield? This is just a convenient way to introduce a new enemy while keeping it mysterious.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, if Tina noticed this dangerous Gastrea during the battle, why only bring it up so long AFTER the first battle ended? Did she not think that such information would be incredibly useful in making tactical decisions during the battle?\\n\\n\r\nIn Episode 12, we are so many years into the future but Miori is using stage lighting to locate the enemy? What ever happened to infrared radar, satellite tracking or even sonar? And if the Aldebaran is so huge anyway, isn't it pretty obvious where it's location is? It can be seen from like miles away, and that amount of destruction it leaves in it's wake is completely noticeable!\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, at the end of the episode, Yasuwaki decides that throwing away the batteries and potentially letting the whole of Tokyo Area and himself get destroyed is okay as long as he gets his revenge on Rentaro. Do I look like I have the time to put up with any more of this annoying and stupid character's nonsense? Seriously?\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, we have episode 13 which has like the most plot holes of the entire anime, attributing it to the incredibly horrible resolution.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the Tokyo citizens light up flying lanterns to represent their wishes, which inadvertently helps Satomi and the others to identify the enemy's position. If they needed those huge spotlights to spot the Aldebaran in the first place, there's no way those lanterns flying so high up in the sky would give enough light to light up the place anyway. The hot air would carry them too high up in the sky for their light to reach the ground below, even if there were millions of those lanterns.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, for the lanterns to give enough light throughout the entire battle, the citizens would have to be continually lighting up lanterns repeatedly throughout the battle, otherwise the lanterns would burn out within 15 minutes. But we clearly see the citizens doing nothing but watching after lighting up the first set of lanterns.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, at the most critical point of the anime, they throw another expected senseless twist.\\n\r\nThe EP bomb has an \"error\" for no apparent reason other than plot convenience so that Satomi and Shouma can dramatically decide to sacrifice themselves in an attempt to destroy Aldabaran.\\n\\n\r\nThird, Satomi punches Enju in the stomach to knock her out so that he can sacrifice himself, but this is the first time I've heard of the idea of someone getting knocked out by a blow to the stomach. In fact, Enju is more likely to have suffered severe organ damage before any loss of consciousness would have occured.\\n\\n\r\nFourth, Kisara has always been saying that Gastrea killed her parents, how did she suddenly know that Kazumitsu was to blame for her parents' death, just because of his involvement with Monolith 32? There seems to be a rather huge logic jump here. Even if her parents' death was suspicious, there was no reason to suspect her brother immediately.\\n\\n\r\nFifth, Kisara claims that the second strike of her secret sword style moves \"faster than sound\".\\n\r\nUnfortunately, when Kisara did that move, no sound was heard from the shockwaves that should have been created by the blade moving so quickly through the air.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the sudden reveal that Kisara had already killed Kazumitsu made no sense whatsoever. Even if her slash was so quick that it was unnoticeable, it cannot explain why it took so long for Kazumitsu's head to split apart. Kazumitsu easily sat there talking with Kisara for 3 minutes before he \"exploded\" into blood and gore. This sudden twist was rather unnecessary and incredibly forced.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether that's a total of 17 plot holes (for a 13-episode anime, that's pretty high, more than 1 plot fail per episode), and because of the incredibly high number, I'm afraid I have to go with zero points for coherence and logical sense of this plot, because there basically just isn't any. The plot does more to confuse us than to amaze us and spits at us when it wants to make twists. This is honestly the first time I've given a score for the plot for any anime so low.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe general artistic theme of the anime is pretty good, I thoroughly enjoyed the drawing and aesthetic of all the characters. They were pretty varied and creatively drawn. Even Seitenshi-sama who had quite the mono-colour scheme fit well with her \"fixed\" mindset and personality. The fighting scenes were pretty well animated, and was exciting when it was done well. Unfortunately, there were many instances where this anime got lazy with those scenes and made them end in mere seconds.\\n\\n\r\nOpening sequence: 2/2\\n\r\nEnding sequence: 0/2\\n\r\nAnimation: 2/3\\n\r\nAesthetics: 3/3\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Theme: 2/2 - Absolutely fantastic, I always kept this running through every episode because it was so upbeat and exciting\\n\r\nED Theme: 1/2 - Quite an okay theme, but nothing too amazing\\n\r\nBackground Music: 3/4 - Most of it was actually really good, like during the action and fast-paced scenes, the music really kept the suspense up. But for the emotional scenes, they kept repeating the same not-very-melancholic tune over and over again that it really detracted from those scenes.\\n\r\nNo additional themes: 0/2\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Satomi Rentaro, a civil officer who is basically a fighter of justice (and oh I've heard this title far too often already). He has exceptional Tendo skills and his martial art fighting style is simple, yet powerful and effective. (+1 for great fighting skills) Unfortunately nothing much else stands out for him. His character is rather cliched, just the same hero trying to protect the people around him and is willing to risk his life in doing so. At one point, his character seems to change and he becomes a ruthless dictator to rally the troops together, but this is completely reversed when we know he is just putting on an act. He's your stereotypical male lead with little more than face value.\\n\\n\r\nThe other character that I was quite interested in at the beginning was Kisara. She clearly had a very dark past, even setting up her civil security agency out of \"revenge\" against the Gastrea. Although we don't see much character development apart from \"having feelings for Satomi\", she eventually goes crazy out of her desire for revenge that she murders her own brother and sells her soul to evil. This is pretty rare for animes out there, to have a main character becoming \"corrupt\" and never really resolving by the end of the anime, so I'll at least give a point for that. (+1 for unique growth). She also has pretty badass sword skills but they were so rarely shown in the anime, it's hard to love her for that. She is pretty moe though, and does get into a lot of awkward and funny interactions with Satomi, so I guess that's a plus (+1 for cuteness).\\n\\n\r\nEnju Aihara, Satomi's partner, first strikes as a very lovable, cute character. She's playful, has an obsession for Rentaro, and is probably the most developed and grown character out of all the initiators out there. She starts off naive, ignorant of the real world, but once she is exposed to seeing the discrimination against Cursed Children, leading to death and destruction, we start to see a slight improvement in maturity, where she learns, through talks with Satomi, to decide for herself what she is fighting for (+1 for growth). Unfortunately, she doesn't get much action time and ultimately just sits back and does nothing for the plot while Satomi does all the plot-driving work.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the antagonist, or former antagonsit, Hiruko Kagetane, who starts off being portrayed as a bloodthirsty crazy killer who kills without reason, into having some actual reasons for him doing so (aka \"ushering a new age\"). But he has this weird interest in Satomi that convinces him not to kill Satomi off immediately, and even ends up teaming up with him and protecting him from bullets toward the end of the anime. We don't know much else about him, except that he's a rather complex and interesting character. (+1 for interest)\\n\\n\r\nThe last character that is worth mentioning is Tina Sprout, who converted from being an assassin who targets Seitenshi, to a fellow Initiator, and Kisara's partner. She starts off completely brainwashed, feeling purposeless if she doesn't listen to orders and kill people, and eventually managed to find hope in Satomi, whom she also falls for. Unfortunately, after that point she also lost all sense of being a character whatsoever. In fact, it's not just Tina, but all the other Cursed Children as well who all suddenly begin to converge into a single entity - this collective archetype of people who \"fall in love with Satomi\" and think of nothing but marrying him. All of a sudden, the character development falls off when it could have taken flight, so this was honestly very unfortunate.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast does have a host of interesting characters. People like Sumire, Shouma and Kayou Senji, all look like they have been through a lot, and I would really have loved to hear their backstories, but we know basically none of it. We know a bit of their background, but nothing substantial enough to have a say on their character. Every other character is a complete waste of time and even less is known about them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, this anime was quite the disappointment for me, but I wasn't expecting much from it either. There were some parts that I got really bored, and there were also some parts where I was quite interested to watch on.\\n\\n\r\nOn the humour side, the anime has performed okay. There were many funny parts between Satomi and Kisara and their supposed love line, and this happens throughout the anime. Enju's and Tina's reactions to Satomi are also funny at first, until it becomes a bit too repetitive until they weren't funny anymore. But there were also funny parts involving Sumire who constantly teased Satomi about his crush for Kisara. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of excitement, I would say that the anime has done rather well. From the beginning it kicked off with great action that got more and more interesting as the story progressed from just fighting Gastrea to dealing with an assassination threat and finally to an all out war. I can't give full points for it though because the action and excitement during the final arc was very underwhelming, and I honestly expected to see much more \"war\" scenes than just the few that occurred. (+2)\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of emotion, the anime really and completely failed there. There are some valid attempts during the parts where Satomi and Enju are emotionally torn about what they are fighting for. But in especially the part where Satomi mourns for the dead schoolchildren, the emotion really felt so forced because we didn't even know their names before they died, and while the voice acting was realistic, the character development was not. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nPacing-wise, the anime definitely managed to grip the audience from the beginning, but it kind of faltered towards the middle and failed to sustain this interest throughout. There were many slow-paced scenes where I honestly felt bored with all the talking and there were scenes which I felt I could simply totally skip because they bore no significance to the plot or characters. Also, the resolution wasn't very satisfactory because the threat of Gastrea was still out there and there were many loose ends about the truth of Gastrea, the future of Kagetane, Kisara, and many things unexplained. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime receives 1 bonus point for having no filler episodes. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.875/10\\n\\n\r\nBlack Bullet is probably an anime you want to watch only if you have some time to kill and really no other shows to watch, or you just want to watch something without becoming too overly attached to it. It suffers from a great many plot holes and lousy plot developments, coupled with poor resolution and plot explanations. It also basically suffers from sub-par characters with little backstory and development to work with. The best part of this anime was the action music, no doubt about it.",

            "content": "Black bullet is probably one the most Over hyped anime this season.Its one of those anime that has a Very good setting but failed to redeem itself because of the Bad or Rushed pacing.\r\nI'm not gonna lie,Black bullet has a lot of potential to be one of the big boys of its genre but sadly given a limit of 13 episodes so its pretty understandable for its Rushed pacing.But..still it could have been way better.\r\nStory 7/10: To summarize it up easily,The story is about the humans at the edge of extinction because it was overrun by Viral parasites called Gastrea.They used some form of metalcalled Varanium which the Gastrea is weak to for your information.To construct a huge black varanium monolith to fend off Gastreas from entering their city.That's the main plot and its definitely an interesting one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: The art is good and not the best this season but its still pretty good.I personally think the art has settled itself in my heart and Its a good fit for the story's lightly dark story.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: This is where Black bullet excels.Its very well done The opening and Ending are absolutely fantastic that I would watch it over and over again just to hear and see its eye candy animation.The OST at the course of the anime is Super good and Well placed as the story progresses there's never a moment where the OST failed to place itself accordingly with each given situations.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10: Enter Rentaro.The Protagonist you're generic hero with the heart of justice even at the moments of chaos.There's a lot of characters that will be introduced as you watch the anime,Each with their own personality that the audience each will have their own favorites and hated characters.Enju is the Initiator of Rentaro and tries too hard to be likeable and its annoying at times but not at the point that you will hate her along the way.This is highly paced that you don't care about the characters dying because they introduce and kill them off.At that point you just go Meh.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10:  6 is Too much even for this anime but I personally Enjoyed it mainly because its not one of those Generic animes we get every season.The action scenes are pretty fast that you will yell \"THAT'S IT!?\"(Fast paced) and Important supposedly tear jerking deaths seems like its coming out of nowhere because its (Fast paced) it may seem like pointless killing at first glance but When you try to understand it.It makes sense that those deaths are important potential development for the characters in the anime but because everything is (Fast faced) you just don't care.Even the characters seems like they don't give a S- at all.One minute everyone is sad and depressed then the next minute they put on their happy face then the next minute they're serious.(Fast paced) this is my face at the end of this anime :l .\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10: I'm a generous guy and it should have been 5 at best and I'm gonna rant again that Rushed pacing is unforgivable.This is an anime adaptation of a Light novel that goes by the same name and I'm now completely 99% sure its better than its anime counterpart.The LN has probably better pacing and Emotions would make sense in each situations.(Someone confirmed it for me and the LN is actually better WHO KNEW? I do.)\\n\r\nIts in the line of recommendable and not recommendable animes.I would recommend it to those lovely people who likes animes that try for something new and not your  basic generic anime.\\n\r\nThe Final episodes is emitting Sequel bait so hard for another Season and I say give it a chance.I'm not that hype but I would still watch its mainly because They constructed the story in Season one and I'm hoping they fix their pacing in the next season.\\n\r\nThis is also my First review :))\\n",

            "content": "Black Bullet was a short (for how much it engaged me) enthralling affair. In terms of story it was told in a very different way than usual. It concentrates on certain small interactions which, when seen holistically, are quite well put while using plot twists and big reveals (though a bit predictable) as anchors to show its progression. Seen in how the story is about Humans vs creatures called Gastrea, and yet most of the anime centers on the human aspect and their interactions more. This will not of course go well with everyone as it sometimes seems a bit disjointed and rushed, as thoughthey are skipping some potentially epic points, though I can forgive this as Black bullet proves that the journey truly is better than the destination at times.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of Art and sound I would say they did not bore me because i know nothing about appreciating such, i usually just watch for story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the characters I found that they were all well written and they machined well together, a little too well?, that's for you to decide. Each character has some trait that makes them interesting and seem to all have so much potential to entertain.Those characters who are highlighted have interesting stories such as Aihara Enju, whose growth and journey throughout the anime was so diverse and compelling that she felt like my own little sister, the only issue I had was that the time frame given to explore them is very limited and leaves one thirsting for more, and that is a good thing at least in as much as one wants more of something they  like, though it is frustrating for obvious reasons. Hopefully there is a second season coming.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Black Bullet gave me many moments that left me amazed and left the impression of a solid entertaining anime, though looking at the bigger picture it may seem lacking. The good thing is that it is so strong in those small moments (which are numerous) that the bigger picture does not seem all that bad. It made me feel like it was making a promise or like it was a very beautiful dew drop about to fall of a very beautiful tree without actually seeing the fall. I can't see the whole tree or the other drops and yet it was satisfying to see.",

            "content": "If you are tired of droll romances and overly action-packed adventures with happy kids screaming about friendship, you might take a liking in Black Bullet. Why? Let me tell you.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nBlack Bullet tells us story about humanity being driven into a corner by insects - Gastrea. It's a dark and sad story, especially as it progresess further. Writers are trying to show us how terrifying and painful could such a situation be.. and they do it quite good. We can see a lot of scenes showing pain caused by loss of close people, dark remnants of characters' pasts that are stabbing in the least expectedmoments and furious fights driven by desire of revenge. Overally, story is well-written and full of emotions, but quite predictable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSurroundings are nice to look at.  Characters are full of life, their expressions are great, showing emotions which authors were trying to plant in us. Fights, even if often short, are very dynamic. Nice job!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nOST is good in general. Openning reminds of Shingeki no Kyojin, but still feels orginal enough to say it's all right. Ending is really faboulous, it will probably make your ears happy. Above average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nNothing intresting here. It's dissapointing how blank charcters are. They are not trying to \"think out of the box\", neither they have any uncommon personalities. After hearing all that complaining, but no conclusions in form of deeds... it leaves a sour feeling. I feel disappointed about that part.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI really loved sad scenes, they were delivering me lots of emotions and felt really well-made. Fights were thrilling and often resulting in serious damage to participants or surroundings, so I could feel weight of events that were taking place. And of course I was waiting to hear the ending theme every week, it was great!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to everyone who is ready for some sadness and fighting for survival. A little above decent, Black Bullet will entertain you for few good hours.",

But I still have several unexplained questions about them. Why aren't any of them older than 10? What leads these Cursed Children to only be girls? Why do a good number of them lust over Rentaro? What the fuck were the writers thinking?!\r\nI feel people have mistreated this show. I wouldn't consider it bad by any means, certainly not deserving of a 1/10. I also, however, can't say that this is a great show.\r\nWhile I personally liked it, I can still tell it is heavily flawed. Lack ofcharacter depth, repeated plot scenarios (really, just two different conflicts being repeated with slight variations), and more, results in Black Bullet's noticeable imperfection.\\n\r\nDoes that mean it's bad? No, it's still amusing enough to keep you watching. This show, while certainly not as bad as people make it out to be, is nothing new. (I feel like this kind of show's already been done, but better) It's a relatively normal, post-apocalyptic action anime. Nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-bonus points for an unexpected ending, quite an amusing last 10 minutes",

            "content": "When this first came out, it was actually a show I glanced over. Then I came back to watch it lately.\r\nGoing over each criteria one by one --\r\nStory: This show has a fairly simple premise. It's similar to Muv Luv, God Eater and Attack on Titans in that it's humans fighting for the survival of humanity against some end-of-the-world science fiction or fantasy threat. Replace the Beta of Muv Luv, or the Aragami of God Eaters or the Titans in Attack on Titans with Gastrea and you have Black Bullet. It's not post apocalyptic per se, however. This show also tries to explore the conceptof racism a bit, albeit only partially successful in its attempt.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Almost all memorable characters in this show has backgrounds that explain their stance or decision to do Heel-Face Turns.  The most important characters also have some degree of development, but unfortunately it's not anything too major. Kisara's development towards the end however was not so enjoyable. It also feels as if there was more that could have been done for this story's characters but due to the 13 episode time limit, it comes to an abrupt halt as the anime ends.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Excellent art and use of colors. Definitely appears polished in animation style and remains modern looking even in 2017. Beautiful backgrounds as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Excellent OP theme by fripSide. Most of the time, I skip the opening theme but for this show I actually go out of my way to watch it every episode. The background OST, while not memorable, also does its job. ED song by Nagi Yanagi is excellent as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While no show is going to be a masterpiece for everyone, I for one thoroughly enjoyed this. The few points this could have improved on would have been to show a few others who appreciate the abilities and efforts of the \"Cursed Children\". It would have improved the realism of the writers' attempt to portray the racism against them.\\n\\n\r\nWho's this show for:\\n\r\n-action lovers (it's not just an action flick though)\\n\r\n-people who like modern anime artstyles\\n\r\n-sci-fi fans.\\n\r\n-loli lovers. Rampant amounts of them in this show. Just be warned that Break the Cutie is a rampant trope here as well.\\n\r\n-people who like serious things happening with serious consequences\\n\\n\r\nWho's this not for:\\n\r\n-people who want a light-hearted series\\n\r\n-people who want realism or down-to-earth characters/dislike OP characters\\n\r\n-people who want deeper characterization than what 13 episodes are able to offer\\n\r\n-people who want a plot conclusive series",

            "content": "A total and utter mess. A very intriguing one at that, but still a mess.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nFor humanity to best an enemy that threatens its very existence, they must first find unity. The gastrea virus, turning humans themselves to monsters that are at best difficult to beat, at worst practically immortal, is definitely such an enemy. As such, the main character who tries to defeat the gastrea finds himself first struggling to defeat the discrimination of the general public and the plain self interest of those in high places, before he even has a chance to fight the real enemy.\r\nThis idea has been tackled by quitea number of series to different amounts of success. It is an intriguing premise that offers many possibilties, yet requires one to be very careful to not to let the different threads of the story get tangled. Sadly, in this case they did get tangled, terribly so. While the story really does quite a decent job of justifying the main character's struggle, it only seems to manage to do so through making the antagonists of the story vary from the plain stupid to those that are actually just batshit insane. While there is no disputing that that message isn't entirely unjustified either, it fails to utterly to deal with the roots of these problems as the justification for the atrocities that are committed never go beyond plain revenge. While making the viewer question humanity's right to existence was not in itself bad, the original intention behind it all remains painfully unclear. The actual explanation as to where the hate and discrimination originates was never expressed in a clear way - if the intention was to say that it was completely unjustified, it still fails to have compelling rationale for happening.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the more successful aspects of the story is the portrayal of the real(?) enemy, the gastrea. Despite remaining more of a backdrop for a good part of the series, as is often the case in this kind of plot, the threat is felt in a very real way on multiple occasions. The gastrea never become completely insignificant and are even capable of concerted attacks on occasion, proving that ignoring them is not an actual option. This is perhaps the only plot point of the story that keeps progressing fairly consistently, while everything else is all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are something that at first appear to be the strong point of the series, with much potential for growth, especially in the case of the main character. None of them are especially innovative, but they seem to be set to become more interesting with this. This doesn't happen. The main character seems to possess an uncanny resistance to character growth, ignoring every single chance he ever has to reform his ideas into something more consistent. The lolis, despite being potentially very good portrayals of children, end up being mainly utilized for the annoying fanservice bullshit. The few characters that experience any development do so with overnight 180s on their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most jarring things about the entire series is its utterly abysmal pacing. The important story developments are very rushed, while the downtime between the big stuff takes up a huge amount of the show. While I'm not one to dismiss the importance of exposition under any circumstance, it's even more baffling that the series fails to deliver an even nearly acceptable amount in those large segments that seem should be dedicated to it. At a closer look, these bits are actually all about developing the character relationships. Which seems to be something that the show does well, all up until you realize there has been zero actual progress, aside a couple of abrupt jumps, on this too. All in all, these huge amount of time spent trying to immerse the viewer in the characters left me to be completely unaffected when these characters were brutally murdered.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThrough all the other inconsistencies, one thing that the series manages to achieve is a consistent style. However, judging from the fact that I can't think of a single good thing to say about that, I have to conclude that this was achieved through simply sticking to mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI have no complaints, aside that I will never learn to understand Japanese ideas behind designing alien looking monsters. I have a hard time taking the gastrea seriously based on what is probably supposed to be a very intimidating appearance. Aside that, the art is good. Not outstanding in any manner, but really pleasing enough to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nClearly the best part of the anime. I believe the only reason the anime managed to invoke any sort of feelings in me was because of the excellent voice acting reinforcing the personalities of the character to a huge degree. The music also was spot on most of the time, bringing the tension that was otherwise lacking in the rushed fight scenes. Also, the opening song was really the highlight of each episode of this anime, to be completely honest.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt manages to retain the resemblance of a quality anime for much of it, just barely, despite the constant inconsistencies (I actually think that's the right choice of words, dreadful as it is) and the terrible pacing with zero exposition. It's actually quite good fun whenever the nonsense isn't too jarring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a terrible anime, and I dare say it had huge potential to be absolutely great. In general it keeps good production quality and doesn't go completely of the rails in any aspect. However, for someone who puts as much weight on story as I do, it's a painfully mediocre anime. It feels like the team really has what it takes to make a great anime, but perhaps the director was simply unqualified for the task.",

If you really think it that way you have a problem with the analysis function of your brain.\r\nI will keep it short. Plot in this show is not unique. However it is OK to use it. Story in this anime is terrible. There is no real storyline so this ends up with confusing characters and actions. With a really good storyline that lasts 13 or even maybe 25 eps this could've been really really good.\r\nThe strongest point of this show is the awesome moments you get to see a lot.With the help of the beautiful OSTs those moments capture viewers heart. There were moments which made me cry in tears as well as scenes with badass action. Those moments alone are enough to make this show enjoyable which in my opinion is the most important thing for a work of fiction. Also in a few occasion it made me think deeply.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a well wasted plot with a lot of great moments and ridicuolous stroyline. With a good storyline and a good MC who is not way too hesitant (this is a common problem with most anime tho), this show could've been great.",

            "content": "This anime does indeed fit the Action, Mystery, Sci-Fi and Seinen genres I think it needs to be added to some sort of comedy and loli tags. There are some funny moments as well as sad ones in this anime but the loli moments are in pretty much every episode. Not to give too much away but the amount of cursed children throwing themselves at Satomi and wanting to marry him is a bit too much to not be a loli anime. I would also say it is very anti-climatic. There is always a build up towards Satomi's battle yet it seems to be overwithin a very short period of time and whatever he is fighting goes down in one hit. \\n\r\nI have spoken rather negatively of Black Bullet but that is just me being critical, after all I am writing a review, but overall this is a highly enjoyable anime. The comedy moments are frequent enough and you always get a new reason to support the hero's. I dare say it is the best anime ever but I feel it is quite good and holds it's own",

            "content": "Story - 6/10\r\nThe premise of Black Bullet is interesting enough. Humanity is driven to the brink of destruction by a species of powerful monsters named 'Gastrea'. You'd be forgiven for initially comparing this show to Attack on Titan, as many viewers did upon starting the series. Though the similarities end there.\r\nThe story follows Rentaro Satomi and his partner, Enju, who is one of the many cursed children living in Tokyo. With the appearance of the Gastrea, a certain population were infected by a virus, and gave birth to children with superhuman abilities. One of the more interesting aspects of Black Bullet was the injustice andprejudiced these children are forced to face. While the plot is overall quite weak, the social commentary was quite effective. In terms of the plot, that's really the only positive thing I have to say about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is astronomically terrible. The first four episodes went by so quickly that the audience is barely given a chance to try and grasp what's going on. They could have honestly written an entire series based on the events of those episodes. Half-way through the anime I felt as though it should have already ended. In episode 4 there were literally about 5-6 climaxes happening all at the same time.  Absurd doesn't begin to describe the pacing of the show. Even for a 13 episode anime, they could have given us a chance to rest. Constant action and drama doesn't make a good anime, there needs to be a cool down in between.  The only time when there isn't any action or drama is when they throw in pointless fanservice or cliche jokes that we've heard a thousand times. There's very little room for actual character development. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I had with this anime is that there are so many plot points which were completely forgotten and thrown aside. It's simply bad writing when you introduce all these separate plots, then drop them as if they hadn't even happened to begin with. The tricycle at the end of episode 4 was completely pointless and was never mentioned again. It gives me the impression that the writer started to introduce all these different scenarios then realised he had no idea where he was going to take any of them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 5/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part the characters are bland and uninteresting. Our main protagonist is a rather brave and determined character, which is always nice to see given the amount of useless protagonists that are out there. However, he lacks any defining qualities. It's difficult to even work out what his motivation for fighting is. And while Rentaro may come across as a strong character, there are plenty of times when he is utterly powerless. There are plenty of times when Rentaro witnesses the mistreatment and abuse of the cursed children, yet never appears to step up or punish those responsible, despite the fact that he is more than capable of doing so. It gives us the impression that he is either apathetic or so significant that he has almost no impact on the world around him. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't really anything notable about Enju besides from her obsession with Rentaro. Her past is mentioned briefly but never explored. She has no unique traits whatsoever and I get the impression that the author just wanted to throw an energetic loli in there for good measure. There's only a small handful of characters that we remotely care about. Among those would be Kisara, Rentaro's childhood friend, and Tina, another loli that Rentaro picks up along his journey.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part Kisara lacks any kind of depth whatsoever and there's really nothing to set her apart from everyone else. She barely has an active role in the anime up until the end, when her character takes a rather sudden twist. There's nothing wrong with surprising the audience, but when you have absolutely no character development at all, then suddenly decide to pull a massive twist, it appears disjointed and jarring.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a handful of other characters that had quite a bit of potential. Kagetane, the initial villain of the series, was rather an interesting and smooth character. Yet he only appears a couple of times despite being such a popular character. The rest of the characters that accompany Rentaro are given almost no screentime at all, to the point where we barely even care. Several characters important to the main character end up dying throughout the series, but their deaths are handled so nonchalantly that there's no emotional impact whatsoever. There were about two emotional scenes that the anime did pretty well, but for the most part I had no reason to care about any of the characters deaths.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was ok for the most part. Nothing remarkble however. The CGI for the Gastrea was pretty painful to look at, and the animation itself wasn't as fluid as it could have been. There were some scenes that were animated quite well but the series was occasionally prone to sudden drops in quality\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was extremely generic and forgettable. There isn't a single BGM track that I can recall. The opening theme was pretty well done, but it's not something I'll remember in a couple of months time.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED theme, Tokohana, was pretty good however. I didn't skip the ED once throughout the series and I enjoyed listening to it. In all honesty the ED theme was one of my favourite things about the entire show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Black Bullet was a weak show with a pretty forgettable plot.There were one or two scenes which were handled well, but I find it difficult to relate to any of the characters. The pacing was a major flaw, and it was just bizarre how quickly the first four episodes flew past. Maybe it's just a poor adaption and there was nothing wrong with the light novel, but this anime his succeeded in putting me off the entire series forever.",

            "content": "Expectations are a real bitch sometimes, especially when something below your conceived notions throws all that pent-up eagerness you have out of the window. So when watching any show, I try my best to remove any expectations I have to spare myself the disappointment while being open-minded to enjoy the good points any show has.\r\nUnfortunately, I didn't do that with Black Bullet.\r\nIt has nothing to do with external hype. It's just with the way Black Bullet is structured. I enjoyed it nonetheless but... it could have been so much more. It had so much potential and promise too. Oh well... on with the criteria:\r\nSTORY -6\\n\\n\r\nMy rating for story is a combination of both premise and pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise was actually really good. Take the crisis of Attack on Titan, the epidemic likeness of Guilty Crown, the monsters of Alienators (if you've heard of it), and the partnering system and expertise of L\u00e9on: The Professional (for the \"every badass needs a loli\" reference) just to give you an idea. The main threat to humanity has a weakness that's coincidentally abundant in Tokyo (Varanium) and the global organization set up to defeat said threat has a ranking system for the combatants. \\n\\n\r\nAfter that, everything just falls apart when it comes to pacing. \\n\\n\r\nThere are two issues I have with Black Bullet's pacing: length and presentation. \\n\\n\r\nWith such an ambitious and monumental premise, 13 episodes IS NOT ENOUGH. Character development, world development, important plot points, and buildup impact are all sacrificed just to get the show over with. With very little time to get plot points across, not only did events seem too contrived and convenient but it also leaves the viewer in the dark with what's going on. What's worse is that the show sometimes assumes the audience knows what's happening and continues tossing vital plot points which aid in confusion rather than understanding. I did manage to connect the dots eventually. But with a premise this huge, I'd want sufficient details presented in an organized manner for me to soak up everything else the show offers me.\\n\\n\r\nNext, is presentation, which made the big mistake of making me expect something more out of this show. Black Bullet has three arcs. The first episode showed the titan of a premise this show had. And by the end of it, we get a villain I don't care about and a crisis that doesn't seem urgent enough to be called pre-apocalyptic. Skip to the second, we already have a problem and a rising action. And by the third and fourth, the show already reaches a climax and everything seems to reset after each arc. Balance is restored for another problem to screw everyone up and the hero to save the day (with a lot of casualties). Rinse and repeat. Black Bullet keeps showing glimpses of the plot potential it had and reminds you every time that there are 13 episodes. It presented the power-play of politics, the paranoia and oppression of the feared and misunderstood, the economic relations between nations during global crises, the inhumanity of mechanized warfare, and the struggle between vengeance and justice. It could've expounded more on these issues. It's like window-shopping. You see all of these things you want to buy but you never get to enjoy them. What I got was a half-baked mess with action and tragedy to fill in the gaps.  \\n\\n\r\nThere's also the show's bipolar nature from the get-go. As much as I enjoyed happy-fun-times between the characters, it felt unnatural with the show's premise. On one hand, it amplifies the shows darkest moments like Higurashi or Madoka Magica. On the other, it interrupts the show. Black Bullet shuttles back-and-forth between being dark and tragic, to being cute and unassuming. Who could resist with the amount of lolis in this show? Add that to the length and it dampens the urgency and pain the show could've delivered. All that gore, dismemberment, and dead bodies lost its meaning. Also, didn't help that most deaths occurred off-screen. *Sighs*\\n\\n\r\nAnd no, adding an unexpected plot twist will not redeem the damage already done.\\n\\n\r\nART - 8\\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame too because the art is really fit for a dark action series. Though the Gastrea (the monsters in this series) were slightly skimped, the weapons, action sequences and explosions (happy now, Michael Bay?) were well animated, especially DAT RAILGUN. Generous amounts of gore and Gastrea innards are spilled for our viewing pleasure, but like I said earlier, I hate off-screen events. It's like a cop-out for both the animators and writers. The character designs are of standard fare, and pretty cute if I do say so myself. No pedo.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 7\\n\\n\r\nAs long as the OP and ED match the show's spirit, I don't skip it. But if it's really good, I download it. And luckily Black Bullet passes the mark with its choir-infused catchy J-pop opening, and orchestrated rock ED, with the brunt of the relatively high score coming from its background music: from glitchy tactical tunes, to a quirky piano and flute duo for light scenes, to rolling melancholic piano pieces with minimal choir and woodwinds, to a combination of orchestra and choir against the action set pieces. It doesn't stand out as much as other shows, but it fits well enough to gain my attention. \\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus did their job with special mentions to those who brought out the softspoken nature of Tina, the eccentricity of Muroto, the twisted ways of Kagetane and his daughter, the naivety of Enju, the burden of Rentarou, and the fragility of Kisara.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 4\\n\\n\r\nWith this length coupled with a slightly large cast, I'm not surprised that I didn't feel attached to any of them. Though I felt their situational agony largely contributed by the seiyuus and music, their development felt empty, neglected, and sometimes forced. Though the Gastrea are the main baddies, the human villains felt like they weren't even there; with one of them never participating again after one arc and another being so lame and awkward, I was surprised the entire cast let him live for 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 6\\n\\n\r\nI still enjoyed it. It just means adjusting the way I view the show. My insightful mindset devolved into being a sponge for moe, action, and drama. Goes to show how important execution is over substance. Instead of enjoying what I see on-screen, I was more entertained by the possibilities of what could make this show better. As good as it could be, nothing can change what's already there. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Black Bullet receives a fair 6 for poor presentation of an otherwise colossal idea. In the end, it's just rushed. It's not the story's fault. The presentation, on the other hand, can go in a Heaven's Ladder Railgun Launcher and get blasted off to the next Stage 5 Gastrea along with an Ekpyrotic Bomb filled with my expectations.",

I've read reviews which describe how mediocre the characters are and how cliche the plot and set-up is. True enough, you have the overpowered MC that every main girl has a crush on and he is thrown into situations wherein he's forced into being a hero (Kirito anyone?). However I'll argue that despite all this, the show is still pretty entertaining and delivers interesting content from time to time thatcan keep you curious about what will happen next. I admit that the first few episodes could have been done better and the fight scenes as well, but the latter parts were good (in my opinion at least). The problem is that the show was trying to be everything at once (cute, serious, funny, gory, etc.) so I couldn't figure out where they were going with it at first. Still, as I've said the show delivered some interesting content towards the end (no particulars to avoid spoilers). There are the usual questions like who to fight for?, what does it take to destroy the monsters? (do you become a monster yourself in the process) and who the real enemy is? (not quite as good as Shingeki, but it's still there). I also liked how the fear and despair of the people and the characters are depicted and how it twists their perceptions on what is right. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can say that the show is still enjoyable despite its faults. I'm looking forward to season 2 and I hope the show improves on its current faults and weaknesses.",

            "content": "I hate bugs. And I think a lot of you share my hatred. Now imagine a world where you have bugs that are three, four or even five times bigger than you. Would you dare to fight them? Well in the world of this anime, you have no choice but to fight. Today's anime review a on MAL 7,51 rated show called BLACK BULLET.\r\nPlot and Storyline\r\nI would probably freak out in a world like this. In the near future a viral parasites named Gastrea broke out and defeated the mankind. Gatreas are basically bug-like monsters that kill people. But the biggest problem about them isthat they can turn people into monsters when they infect them with the virus. Still, the virus can effect the people in another way. Imagine what happens when a pregnant woman is infected. Well, her child, and always a girl, turns into a \"cursed child\", being just a human but with special powers. The government uses those children to fight Gastrea together with Civil officers and always in pairs. One of the pairs are also the protagonist of our story. Enju and Rentarou became partners a year ago and have been close to each other since that day. Their strength was about to be proven after they were assigned to their   most important and dangerous mission. The prevention of destruction of their hometown, Tokyo.\\n\r\nThe, let's say, main story was nicely done. A smooth development, no stupid adds and no plot holes. It was very interesting to watch and it definitely made me more and more curious with each episode. Still, I have one reproach. There is a side story in this anime which appeared somewhere in the middle and in the end. That \"side story\" was actually just an enormous plot hole. To be honest I didn't even understand what it was all about. It seemed so important but was bumped into half of an episode. The story could have lived even without it and I found it more confusing rather than interesting.\\n\r\nI felt like the story kinda carried a transparent layer of something we face everyday. It shows how society usually deals with the part of population that sticks out for a certain reason. Even though they might help and contribute to the society, people often abandon them because they are scared of changes. Even though the Gastrea-girls can help and even save society, there are still persons who hate and discriminate them. \\n\r\nAn interesting and catchy story that can help you to overcome boredom anytime a day.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are not that special, or rather not special at all. I mean it is a 13 episoded anime, and as expected it is too short for some awesome character developments. Still I liked one of the mains just because she was  awesomely cute and that's it. This time the two mains:\\n\r\nAIHARA ENJU is one of the cutest anime characters I've ever seen. She is always so optimistic and caring, yet determine and persistent. Enju is a strong ten-year-old and I am sure that she would have grow into a great character later on. Her main goal in the series, how I thought, was just a place she could belonged to. \\n\r\nSATOMI RENTAROU is a...normal character. There is nothing much to talk about him. He is nice and caring and very strong because of his \"metal\"(or whatever that material is) arm and leg. He is also very brave and self-sacrificing. The moment I liked him the most is when he realized that he might have become a cold-blooded killer and became scared of that thought. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nImpressive. That's the word that describes the animation of this anime show. The monsters are nicely designed, not too much, not boring but special. The animation shone the most in the action scenes and I found it very enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nThis is an action, Sci-Fi anime that is perfect for a lazy Sunday. Thirteen episodes are really enough to tell this kind of story. Funny moments made it even more amusing and the step-by-step developing story and a couple of little plot-twists fit in perfectly with the main plot. It is not one of the best anime I have watched so far but it is kinda cute and interesting so give it a try. I would rate it as a 7,67 soo...good enough. \\n\\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl",

            "content": "Anime these days seem to always follow some kind of trend whether it being the garbage know as Moe or boring mush known as slice of life, I'm looking at you K-On and Lucky Star and even fewer anime take these wagons of bands and make a somewhat enjoyable show. Im here to talk about such a show Braku Bulletu. While not being the shiniest of gems among the shit pile this show is an example of what to do if you're taking inspiration on something popular.\r\nStory- Now see if this sounds familiar. Its been 10 years since a brutal attack of the Gastrea aunknown race of bug? Robot? Parasite? creatures. These attack have left most of humanity to perish and the subsequent survivors discover the creatures weakness Varanium a mineral which somehow stops the Gastrea\u2019s healing factor. They use this mineral to build weapons, cyborg soldiers and walls that prevent the Gastreas from entering. What follows is a tale of a Rentar\u014d Satomi a civil officer and his loli sex slave Enju Aihara as they fight the Gastrea\u2019s, other civil officers and a guy with a cool mask. You notice anything? sounds like the plot of Attack on Titans, but thats not necessarily a bad thing since they seem to change the story enough to make it somewhat fresh.\\n\r\nCharacters- the characters of the show do their part and the main lead is a likable protagonist that you can easily root for, but if I have to say any particular character really stood out it would be Kagetane Hiruko and his daughter Kohina Hiruko whom I think should win some kind of award for the most sinister villain. Their banter about who to kill is always enjoyable and they seem to take of the spotlight whenever they are in a scene.\\n\r\nArt and Sound- The art and sound of the show are pretty good especially in fight scenes. The punches and kicks really feel like they have weight making them more enjoyable to watch, but I do have to mention the Gastrea\u2019s themselves. They are 3D which kinda messes up the aesthetic of the show was trying to go for, but that shouldn't really hinder your enjoyment much. The music especially the intro stand out and has come to be one of my favorites. It kinda gives off an Attack on Titans vibe like the rest of the show.\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I really enjoyed this show each episode seemed different and you really get attached to some of these characters making it all the more painful seeing parts of the loli harem die off.\\n\r\nOverall- Black Bullet is a good example of what to do if you are trying to take inspiration on another show. While there are some loose end and some character development that's lacking that I wish they would resolve in a second season, the show was overall enjoyable and should be on anyones list if they enjoyed Attack on Titans. I have to give it a score of 7.8/10.\\n",

            "content": "[WARNING: SPOILERS AND LONG REVIEW AHEAD.  FOR TL;DR SKIP TO \u201cOVERALL\u201d SECTION.]\r\nWatching Black Bullet is the equivalent of that kid who is always enthusiastic in school.  He may not be the smartest, but he tries so hard and you just want to give that little guy an A for effort.  Unfortunately, in the real world grades aren\u2019t given for effort but for quality, and that is where Black Bullet fails: it tried to do too much with a plot that ultimately wasn\u2019t going to be anything more than mediocre.\r\nSTORY- 6/10\r\nOh look, a post-apocalyptic thriller!  Humans are trapped inside a certain areaand there are monsters on the outside that want to try to get in and eat all of us!  I wonder where I\u2019ve heard that before\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe main criticism that I have with this anime is that it was rushed.  Extremely rushed, in fact, and it is a damn shame because the story showed a lot of promise as being one of the few light novels that aren\u2019t harems/pretentious otaku-pandering/both.  It\u2019s my personal belief that if this show had gotten 26 episodes, it could have been legitimately well-received.\\n\\n\r\nOur story takes place in the 2030s, when a parasitic virus is turning people into monsters called Gastrea.  Humanity has taken refuge in what used to be Tokyo (seriously, did you expect anywhere else?), behind monoliths constructed of an alloy named Varanium that is the Gastreas\u2019 only weakness.  Well, almost.\\n\\n\r\nThe other way to fight Gastrea is to turn them against each other, and that\u2019s where Cursed Children come in.  They are formed when the Gastrea Virus infects a pregnant woman, and the child is always born a girl, with a human appearance but the powers of a Gastrea.  In response to this, the governments of what\u2019s left of the world formed a civil security system where a Cursed Child, or Initiator, is paired with a human, or Contractor, and they are outsourced to private agencies.  Since they make up the majority of humanity\u2019s defense against the Gastrea, obviously Contractors hold a lot of power in government and society.  However, the Cursed Children aren\u2019t exactly treated the same way.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where our main character, Rentaro Satomi, comes in, as a low-level Contractor working with his partner, Enju Aihara, employed by the Tendo Agency for his classmate and longtime friend, Kisara Tendo.  Of course, many more interesting, and some not-so-interesting, characters will be met along the way.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve heard so many people toss lolicon accusations at this show, but really, it\u2019s not that much loli-pandering.  Sure, Enju does have a crush on Rentaro, but he\u2019s not interested.  However, I can see why people might think this and it might turn them off.\\n\\n\r\nI actually thought the story, while a little clich\u00e9d, is okay.  However, the problem here is rushing, rushing, RUSHING.  This anime tries to pack as much content as it can in 13 episodes, which leads to it moving too fast to really have much of an impact on the viewers.  That, and a huge \u201cLOLWAT\u201d moment at the end of episode 7 that really left me scratching my head and soured the anime to me.  Thankfully, the anime does pull out a fairly decent conclusion, but overall, the story is middling.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS- 4/10\\n\\n\r\nNow there\u2019s only going to be so much character development you can get in 13 episodes, but some of the characters manage to be very unlikeable in the time they\u2019re given.  Also, some characters that the audience is supposed to care about don\u2019t get enough screen time to be worth caring about.\\n\\n\r\nRentaro Satomi- Our main protagonist.  The main problem I have with him is that it can\u2019t seem like he knows which hero type he wants to be.  He seems set up to be an anti-hero, but he regularly plays ping-pong with the hero scale, going from traditional hero all the way down to full-on designated hero in a couple instances and sometimes it really gets hard to root for him when he, for instance, threatens to kill a group of civilians for harassing a Cursed Child.  Dick move, people, I agree, but under no circumstances is it justified to end their lives.  He has a decent backstory, but it\u2019s not visited enough.  Overall, not a very heroic character though he does have his good points.\\n\\n\r\nEnju Aihara- The Initiator our protagonist is paired with, a nine-year old girl with rabbit characteristics.  She gets a lot of flak for a) being a loli and b) crushing on Rentaro.  I agree that her crush was unnecessary, but I do find her cute, and unlike her partner, she didn\u2019t make me want to punch her in the face like Rentaro did sometimes.  Also, once you find out about her backstory, you\u2019ll have a whole lot more sympathy for her.\\n\\n\r\nKisara Tendo- The owner of the Tendo Civil Security agency and Rentaro\u2019s childhood friend.  Her grandfather saved Rentaro as a little boy when he was about to be killed by a Gastrea.  Her family owns a kenjutsu dojo, and she is incredibly proficient with swords and hand-to-hand combat.  However, most of her family were killed a few years ago, and she has sworn revenge on the killers.  She\u2019s one of my favorite characters, mainly because she has some compelling backstory and I love women who can fight- she even gets to call Rentaro out on his dickery at the end of the series.  The problem I have with her is that she\u2019s pretty much a non-factor to the plot for the first half, and even in the second half she takes a backseat.  She\u2019s there for all of the story, but she\u2019s not much more than there.  There might be hope for her yet as the final episode dropped a major tease with her possibly pulling a heel turn, but with the way this anime was received, I can\u2019t see it getting another season, which is sad because she needs more love.\\n\\n\r\nKagetane Hiruko- The not-villain of the story, he was one of the things that the show got right.  He\u2019s the kind of awesome villain in the mold of Dio Brando: smooth, suave, and charismatic even when he\u2019s exploding police heads.  Did I mention he can fight as well?  Also, he\u2019s got a much closer connection to Rentaro than anyone thinks, and their relationship, from enemies to uneasy allies, gets the most attention than any other interactions in the series save for Rentaro/Enju shenanigans.  Character development done excellently, he was my favorite character of Black Bullet.\\n\\n\r\nSeitenshi-sama- The leader of the Tokyo Area Settlement, she is an idealist who would like for humans and Cursed Children to get along.  I liked the political themes her introduction in the story brought into it; unfortunately, apart from her pacifism there\u2019s not much else to her.  Pretty flat character.\\n\\n\r\nTina Sprout- Okay, the first thing I have to say is that I don\u2019t understand why Enju gets bashed and Tina gets praised despite them basically being the same character!  Is it because she\u2019s \u2018Murican?  If so, that\u2019s a big double standard, anime fans.  Pausing from my rant to explain her, she is a high-ranked Initiator who is sent to Japan to assassinate Seitenshi, who has just sent her new personal bodyguard Rentaro out to capture her.  I don\u2019t like her very much because she gets defeated in the most shonen-y way ever: after ten minutes of beating Rentaro into a bloody pulp, a flashbang grenade goes off at exactly the right time and he knocks her out with two moves.  That\u2019s it, game over.  What followed next induced my head to meet the wall.  She gets no punishment, despite trying to kill the leader of government not once, but twice!  Huh?  If I sent my little sister to kill the president, it doesn\u2019t matter that she is both cute and following orders, she\u2019d still face life in prison!  How is this any different?  It seems like a cheap attempt to turn Tina good without worrying about the damage she\u2019s caused, or maybe it\u2019s due to the unsettling theory that civil security agents can do whatever the hell they please and no one can do anything about it.  Either way, afterwards she ends up partnering with Kisara and becomes Enju 2.0.  Weak.\\n\\n\r\nTakuto Yasuwaki-\\n\r\n\u201cWelcome to the Poorly-Written Villain hotline, how may we help you?\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cWell, um, I wasn\u2019t really given any motivation for hating the hero.\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need motivation!  You need to to try to kill that little girl!  The viewers are sure to hate you after that!\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cBut that little girl just tried to kill our nation\u2019s leader, who I\u2019m sworn to protect.  Wouldn\u2019t that make it justified?\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cThen what we\u2019ll do is make you look and act like Nobuyuki Sugou.  That means the viewers will know you\u2019re EEEEEEEEEVIL!\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cI thought fans hated that show for all the wrong reasons.\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cScrew logic, I\u2019m the director.\u201d\\n\r\n\u2018Nuff said.\\n\\n\r\nMiori Shiba- What is her point?  She only shows up a couple times, and the extent of her characterization is \u201cwants Rentaro\u2019s D\u201d.  Seriously, how does she even contribute anything meaningful to the story? \\n\\n\r\nShoma Nagisawa and Midori Fuse- I\u2019m sorry.  I know I\u2019m supposed to care about Midori\u2019s suicide and Shoma\u2019s heroic sacrifice, but no amount of emotion is going to make me give two shits about characters who\u2019ve barely had one episode of screentime.  Also, catgirl, because apparently catgirl!\\n\\n\r\nART- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is the one good thing about this anime.  The characters all have distinct designs, the animation moves fluidly, and I didn\u2019t notice all that many off model frames or designs.  Overall, good work by Kinema Citrus, the studio that did Barakamon.  It\u2019s a shame that the story couldn\u2019t match the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC- 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is composed by Shiro Sagisu, the man who did the music for Evangelion.  Unfortunately, this is probably his weakest entry to date, as all the music is utterly forgettable.  It\u2019s not the worst thing he\u2019s composed (looking at you, song that plays when Ichigo powers up) but it\u2019s far from the best and it doesn\u2019t aid the story in any way.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL- 6/10\\n\\n\r\nApparently this show is pretty polarizing, because people either like it or think it\u2019s the worst thing to hit TV since Sword Art Online.  However, I just think it\u2019s mediocre.  While the art is great and the music all right, some elements of the show can alienate the viewers and it\u2019s just too rushed to invoke the kind of emotion it\u2019s supposed to in the readers.  The characters are the weakest point, with some hard to cheer for and others unimportant due to general irrelevancy to the story or lack of screen time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Black Bullet is an okay show but not a great one.  If you are interested in the franchise, I suggest you check out the light novels first as they are about to be translated into English in order to see if you like the story in the first place, and you should probably stream it on CR as I don\u2019t feel this anime is worth paying $50-80 for.\\n",

            "content": "To start, Black Bullet is NOT a loli-harem. Contrary to a lot of other reviews, this series didn't have a single sexual scene, and there was only one truly suggestive joke throughout the whole thing, in which the main character was absolutely horrified at the idea. There is nothing wrong with having a lot of younger characters, and I actually thought it was exciting and new. They acted like real little girls; they had adorable personalities, childish ambitions (like wanting to grow up to marry a person they admire and look up to), and reacted they way most children truly would if put into someof the situations they did. \\n\\n\r\nIt was not, in any way, a harem. Harem anime have girls throwing themselves at the main character, constantly trying to seduce him, and usually lots of panty shots and boob jokes. This anime had absolutely none of that, these characters wanted nothing sexual at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character truly loved some of the younger characters, but in a purely family oriented \"older-brother\" way.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nOkay now that that's out of the way, on to the story. I thought it was great. It might be a little cliche, but they made it work. I think one of the biggest problems in Sci-Fi shows like this one is that nothing is ever very \"scientific\", or based on any evidence from the story's universe. But in this show, most everything about the virus was really well explained, or at least had some sort of theory behind it. And if it wasn't, it was something the characters (or the society itself) was investigating. Personally, I think that's what makes shows like this. I love the theories and thought put into each scenario.\\n\\n\r\nThey did a great job of not being too repetitive and having the exact same problem re-occur again and again, but also kept a balance from things being too ironic. I dislike when one thing is solved, but then another completely random problem just so happens to start up immediately afterward, and then again, ect. ect. It was decently paced, for an anime with a ton of potential packed into just 13 episodes. Keeping that time frame in mind, it was a pretty unpredictable show. Even though it was moving pretty quickly, you still couldn't really tell who would die next or whether their plan would actually work.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as always, I appreciate an anime that's not afraid to actually kill characters, rather than have them narrowly escape death time and time again.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/9\\n\r\nThe art in this show wasn't anything flashy, but I greatly appreciate a nice, simple style. The art they used fit nicely with the used CG for all the Gastrea, as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good. Like the art, it's not anything to rave about, but the fight scenes definitely looked pretty cool, and the characters had great body language. Especially Enju, she looked like such a child when she ran around or got upset, and it really helped build her character.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nA lot of people say the OP sounds a lot like the OP from Attack on Titan, and having not watched that anime I can't really argue in any direction. But I will say I really liked the music used throughout the entire series, and the OP will definitely be going into my iTunes.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was great. I felt like the voices really suited the characters. None of them had annoying voices, which is a problem you tend to run into a lot in anime. However, I think the best part about it was that you could really hear the emotions in the voices. Some of the tear jerking scenes really hit you hard, they did such a good job making the voices sound so realistic to the situations. Especially Enju's screams/crying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nAlong with their voices, these characters were so great! They really fit into the story, and their designs were super nice. All the little girls were so cute, and even the ones that were just in the backgrounds had really unique designs. You could tell thought was put into even the random background characters, and I thought that was pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Bullet also didn't follow the typical personality tropes. The characters had pretty distinct personalities that didn't fall under \"cookie-cutter\" categories.\\n\\n\r\nAs rare as it is, almost all of the characters in this show, including the villains actually, were pretty likable. I love love Enju. She was so cute, and unlike a lot of shows with younger characters, she truly acted her age. Rentarou was great as well. It is so refreshing to watch an anime where the main male character isn't a whiny baby that yells a lot when he accidentally touches boobs (all. the. time.) and can't keep his emotions together in a battle. Rentarou was a strong, kind, and determined male protagonist, and I loved him.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was really the only weak point in the characters. But I can't really blame them, it's hard to smoothly transition a character in only 13 episodes. Honestly, if they had tried much harder it probably would have come off really forced. Here's to hoping for a second season so we can really see those characters changing!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this show. It kept you wanting to know what happened next. I don't know what else to say here honestly...  I definitely would recommend it!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

            "content": "I read the synopsis on Black Bullet and I found it really interesting. Plus when there are Lolis, its a must watch for me xD. Lets get this out of the way first, I did enjoy this anime, but I felt like there were a lot of things missing. \r\nFirst of all, the first two episodes set up the story quite well, then after the third I felt like the story was over. The antagonist was introduced and the story was set into place then everything was solved and over with. The rest of the anime was a whole other arc of the story. Imaginethe first three episodes as season 1 then 4-13 is Season 2. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole anime seemed rushed. Probably Black Bullet was planned for 24 episodes or even two seasons but then the budget got slashed so they had to rewrite the story to fit all of the ideas. It is not a bad anime by any stretch. It just feels rushed and certain events that would normally take an episode, takes 3 minutes or even less in some cases. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this anime a 7/10, I did enjoy Black Bullet but because it was rushed some of the plot elements were not explained quite well or things became SUPER convenient in order to advance the story.",

            "content": "I feel like Black Bullet needed more time. That's the most crucial thing about some shows that are bordering between decent and good. Sometimes, there's just more time necessary to finally flesh out all the characters and plot.\r\nBlack Bullet is fairly fast paced. Thirteen episodes, the plot develops acceptably reasonably, there's not too many deus ex machina moments that make you go \"Which hole did that plot-device come from?\" Although there are many moments that I feel like should have been completely taken out or required more explanation. Take for example, the ending of episode four. I was thinking about that for a good coupleof hours, yet I got no closure on what happens, because it's never brought up again.\\n\r\nAnyways, I rate on enjoyment. On the wonderful rainbow scale of enjoyment, I gave Black Bullet an 8. Quick synopsis.\\n\r\nStory: Fair (6)\\n\r\nPost-apocalyptic, sci-fi. Humanity is on the brink of extinction, all that keeps them alive are gigantic monoliths of Varanium, which repel the Gastrea. Gastrea are (typically insectoid) monsters that can infect humans but mostly just butcher them into horrifying piles of blood, corpse, or just eat them. The combination of zombies, insects, parasites, vampires, and something that regenerates extremely fast.\\n\r\nArt: Very Good (8)\\n\r\nI don't know, I'm not critical about art. It was nice, I recognize the characters. Very gory, too.\\n\r\nSound: Good (7)\\n\r\nEpic battle themes, epic opening, melancholy ending. Fits the show.\\n\r\nCharacter: Good (7)\\n\r\nGot your typical characters, makes for a full house. Tsundere, yandere, plenty of lolis, and a kickass protagonist. Personally I do not think of any of them as basic or generic, because I do deem them to have unique flairs, if not an insane amount.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Very good (8)\\n\r\nShort series, about 3-4 days if you're casual watcher. Enjoyable at the least, unless you're a technical detail nazi who checks for everything and hates everything.\\n\r\nOverall: Good (7)\\n\r\nFix a bit of plot holes (Smashes holes into immortal snail mutants, crushes walls, jumps across roofs, cant break through the grip of two generic thugs) and plot twists that have nothing to do (episode four I'm looking at you) with the plot. More episodes are needed, the story is underdeveloped and a lot of scenes from the ending are completely unseen in the actual story.",

            "content": "I'm gonna keep this short and to the point. I have mixed feelings about the show, especially due to the final episode. Throughout the show, I thoroughly enjoy the story and characters, but there are flaws.\r\nThe story doesn't seem to have a continuing conflict or arc, but many small arcs that last for a few episodes at a time and don't connect very well. A lot of the character's own stories are either untold or not expanded upon enough I found and that didn't help with the immersion, but it can tend to be overlooked at times. \r\nThe last episodes leave a lot to bedesired and are a bit forced. The rapid change in the standpoints of good and bad in characters is too much for the time they're introduced. Many characters seemingly appear and disappear throughout, and the deaths of some characters don't make you feel all that bad about their loss because of this. \\n\\n\r\nMy final vice is a bit odd but not misplaced (SOMEWHAT OF A SPOILER, BUT NOT REALLY)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that Rentaro breaks down in the final moments of the last episode because he feels desensitized to the deaths of his comrades feels misplaced and forced to the extreme. Very little explanation and reasoning behind this and the fact that Enju tells him they'll be \"together forever\" makes the scene feel so out of place that I was uncomfortable with it. That being said, I may have misread the scene or have missed some contributing factor that makes it more understandable (Please feel free to correct me via a message if this is the case).\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, while I enjoyed the majority of it, the pace of the show, misplacement of factors and underdevelopment of characters and plot points put this show at a 6 for me. Please watch it and put in your own viewpoints on it as everyone has different opinions on such things, and the comments of one reviewer have no effect on the overall greatness or shortcomings of any work, be it a show, book, play or others.",

The pace became significantly slow than when it started out and going to ward the end, the pace only went up back by a little. The character buildup and trying to make me feel sad for what's going on wasn't executed well. I had heard there were some tearjerker scenes but I didn't feel sad not even once. Not even close to crying. \r\nI did enjoy it to an extent thatI could say it was good, but nothing more. Usually when an anime is very good to me, I end up binge watching all the way through. For this anime I couldn't I had to to take break periods during the mid section of it where it became ridiculously slow, and tried to be \"meaningful\". The action and art was nice though, and I liked the ending theme.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it came to the characters, I could have seen a lot of potential from that masked guy. Every time he was in an episode, it got me interested for sure. I guess that's the way the story was written, to have that large section of slowness.

The makers have tried really hard to finish it as quick as they can and that can obviously be seen through the dullness in the characters and how really there aren't any tear jerking scenes AT all in a genre such as this. But mainly what I am trying to say is as far asthis anime goes in its 13 episodes, it failed because they could HAVE done much better and much more. It mainly felt like 'oh, this person died, what do we do now, whatever, get over it, fight seen and back to trying to be emotional all in one episode'. My final verdict is a 5 at my sincere disappointment in how they screwed up one of the best stories that could have been made.",

It worked well with the darkness of the show. Rentarou as a character I really enjoyed. Though the younger girls were somewhat typical for this type ofanime. I enjoyed the character development with Kisara though. One of the things I liked most is that there wasn't an overpowering amount of fanservice. I feel like if there was more I wouldn't have like the show as much. I like the show more then other people probably would have but the fight scenes were great to me, and I loved the main characters and the story behind the girls.

            "content": "Black Bullet, an anime aired in Spring 2014, is an adaptation from a light novel. At first glance, it looked to me quite promising, or at least worth watching. \r\nStory 6/10: A classic scenario, humanity against aliens, is forced to fight and defend itself. Walls are erected around their territory in order to protect them from Gastreas, the name given to these aliens. This scenario basically reminds somehow of the popular Shingeki No Kyojin. However, the survival aspect of this apocalyptic show is not really present.\r\nArt 8/10 - Sound 7/10: The art is great. I am quite picky when it comes to the art ofan anime, and I cannot watch anything without good graphics, decent animation, and good soundtracks, even if the story is exceptionnal. This show met my requirements art-wise, even if the opening will (also?) reminds you of the one from Shingeki No Kyojin. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10: There is different type of characters in this show. There is the loli girl category, who are also the last hope of humanity, since they can display extraterrestrial strength. There is the protagonist, Satomi Rentarou. Quite a stereotype, pretty blend, and pretty similar to Kirito from Sword Art Online. He is also quite the strong type of guy, even if he does not look that invincible. And then, the characters who should have been more on screen maybe, the bad guys. Especially Hiruko Kagetane actually, a mysterious character, who is unfortunately still left in his secrets by the end of the show. \\n\r\nI cannot say that these characters is a great team, and that is definitely not the strong point of this anime, but they do their job, which should be enough if you are only looking for some entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10: Now, I hqve said several times that this show reminds of SnK. BUT this show is not SnK. Loli scenes are here to prove it. Good thing? Well, this actually depends on you. But one thing is certain, the fights are really enjoyable. Great variety of fights, everything is used, being snipers, bombs, cameras, as well as the battleground itself. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, was that show a good show to watch? Well, by the end of the show, we are a bit left wanting for more, 13 episodes feel too short. In 24, characters could have developed a better personality, and the show could have started rolling for real. Despite all these flaws, I enjoyed this show a lot, and I didn't feel like I wasted my time. So this show is probably not a state of the art, but if you are looking for a show without any pretention, then Black Bullet will provide you a good entertainment.\\n",

            "content": "This is Going to be my very first review on MAL so expect this review to have possible wrong grammars but bare with me. Anime Review No.1\r\nThe Anime Black Bullet is an adaptation of the the source material with the same name. I never read the Light Novel before I rather choose to see the adaptation first before reading because I knew once I read the Light Novel I will badly judge the adaptation. What I see in as anime viewer the plot is decent and interesting since I am fan in apocalyptic themed series. The art style is good and average. The characters arewell balanced in Male and Female characters no harem is building up but certainly the loli characters the \"Cursed Children\" which all girls are not appealing since I not a lolicon to begin with but I like children but not in a lv of a lolicon. The Sound not very worth remembering it will just took 2-3 days before I can forget the song both the OP and ED. Enjoyment well I did get the small fraction of the hype but still I deemed it so boring and I multi task just to tolerate the scene which I see boring and irrelevant. Overall I give a 4 which is my standard good. This is anime is not best recommended cause it is not too memorable and to be sure it is not worth watching for non-anime fans.   \\n",

            "content": "Quite awesome! Though not super mind-blowing in terms of action and plot, it is certainly worth watching. What I like most about this one is two particular qualities. First, I like the relationship between the characters. You have the two member fighting team of the protagonist, a 17ish year old boy who has seen some pain but is headstrong and his sidekick, a superhuman 10 year old who is perky and quirky and loves teasing the main character about them getting married someday. They keep each other grounded very well, the boy being the stern older brother who needs cheering up and the girl whoneeds a leash for her superhuman power and someone to look after her. Second, I love the tragedy of the show. It's a tear-jerker for certain and so far only a few anime have drawn me to tears, Clannad Afterstory and Angel Beats included. As the show progresses you see loss, struggle, and despair among some very likable characters. This show, however, falls short in terms of action and plot that stands out like Attack on Titan and Cowboy Bebop. This show is great for a good case of the feels though, which is why I recommend it.",

            "content": "NOTE: I wrote this review right after I finished the series, but am just now posting it for reasons that don't matter. \r\nNow that everything's ended, It's time for Spoon to take the mic. \r\nThis week in my one-part series, I'll be reviewing Brack Burret, also known by its english title, Loli Bullet. \r\nYou know, out of all the garbage I watched this season, this one was the best. I'm gonna break this down into catagories, but I'm just gonna kinda make em up as I go.\r\nStory:\r\nHonestly this one's been done about a thousand times. The premise is that a bunch of bug aliens(?) named\"Gastrea\" (which sounds like a name for an intestinal disease) killed like everyone on earth except for areas surrounded by these fifty-billion-story monoliths made out of some material called Veranium that came out of nowhere when the gastrea attacked that just happens to be their weakness. How did they manage to build like fifty of these giant monoliths before they were all killed? Iunno. No really, they're taller than any skyscraper by a long shot. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nMaybe I should just become the main character of an anime, because LITERALLY 99% OF THE FEMALES IN THE SHOW WANT HIS DICK FOR NO. REASON. I mean it's insinuated that some of them have a backstory together, but it's never explained. After 10 episodes of girls hitting on him, and lolis wanting to marry him because ____, they finally show some progress between main guy and one of the two characters that like him that are actually his age, they pull some nisekoi tier bullshit and then everyone was mad, and it's never addressed again. The saving grace of the characters tho has gonna be Joker (he has an actual name, but it's long so I didn't care to remember). He's pretty cool, but his story is just as fleshed out as the rest of the cast.. so not at all.\\n\\n\r\nRandom: \\n\r\nNothing seems to have any relevance in this show. They add new information and hint to future conflicts but nothing ever comes of them. OH AND DID I MENTION THAT HIS RIGHT ARM AND LEFT LEG ARE ROBOTIC? THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR BUT I CAN'T QUITE PUT MY FINGER ON IT. HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI skipped the opening every time because it was annoying. The soundtrack was unnoticeable. The sound FX were actually pretty good a lot of the time, but freaking horrible at others.\\n\\n\r\nRandom Cont: \\n\r\nThis show is actually pretty good at giving a great sense of immersion and real emotion. The way the society operates is actually kinda realistic for the scenario. Sometimes the show would just get really freaking real really freaking fast tho.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals:\\n\r\nThe animation quality was actually really good. I liked the art, and the character designs were usually a good balance between attractive and realistic... most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Impression:\\n\r\nBlack Bullet tried really hard to be different, but it feels like they didn't really know how to do that, so they leaned back on the crutch of big tits and little girls to try to keep people interested.\\n\r\nIt was okay, I give it a 5/10",

            "content": "The problem with Black Bullet is that they don't know how to develope a plot, seriously, they present several topics along the 13 episodes but they can't just stay with one and develope it, they have to present it and move to the next one.\r\n(Spoilers ahead)\r\nFirst example that comes to mind is the issue with the cursed children, they are presented as hated children by the society because the curse etc, they put a lot of enfasis in this but it really doesn't go anywhere, it doesn't affect MC decisions or Enju decisions, i mean then why so much develope? in fact, i think theyrush to close this in the last EP making the kids appear now somehow \"\"praying\"\" along with the people that hunted and killed them for our heroes to win, i mean what the fuck?\\n\\n\r\nSecond, Kagetane Hiruko, the guy with the mask, um..what was the point of this character? it is presented as the major antagonist and then it dissapears to come back in the last episodes and he doesn't make any different at all in the show, it's almost like a joke to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe same with the doctor, Muroto Sumire, it is presented as something really important, someone who might have a really important role in the next episodes, but it really never happens, her role is the same role as the guy with the mask, just create mistery, the past relation she had with MC it is never really explained but we know something happend, that's it.\\n\\n\r\nExactly the same can be said about Kikunojo Tendo and Seitenshi-sama, it is explained who they are and MC develops some realtion with Seitenshi-sama but that's it, it doesn't go anywhere, she loses relevance in the next episodes and it's forgotten even though she is an important person in this world.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the anime tries to make us cry each time a Loli dies but hey we just meet her in this episode you should at least wait a couple to kill her, besides MC goes extremely emotional about this'? It really doesn't have any sense, furthermore MC starts to understand how cruel was society to the cursed children but he doesn't do anything about it, you could think that he goes side to side with the mask guy to destroy Tokyo or something but no, he just doesn't do anything at all, neither save them or  anything.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to close this masterpiece we have Kisara Tendo that it is never developed, just presented as a support character that is in love with MC but at the end somehow turns evil by killing a guy who was responsable for the death of her parents, she turns really evil out of nowhere, literally out of nowhere. \\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nDespite all of this im giving it a 5/10 because somehow i managed to enjoy it, was it because of the cute lolis? Was it so bad that it was average? Who knows really but anyway i had to point the terrible flaws this anime has.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Events happened that didn't seem to fit the flow, random new injections occurred all the time leaving the viewer to question what they should be paying attention to. \r\nArt 7/10- The characters looked fine, however, they didn't have the most detail. Colors were used wisely to fit the mood the creators were trying to get at. But the Gastrea looked really weird and failed to impress to me.\r\nSound 8/10- The soundtrack was done very well.\r\nCharacter 4/10- The characterswere all very predictable and 2 dimensional. But if they weren't following a predictable pattern they were acting in ways that made no sense. Lots of Lolis who wanted MC detracting from me caring about anything else they said. New characters were introduced and given screen time only to play a minimal inconsequential role with no follow up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10- The fight sequences were pretty cool, short but well done. The art and soundtrack were well done. But the story was choppy and left me wondering if anything covered in a certain episode was even important. Characters were poorly done and left me with no emotional attachment to any of them. And the ending was all over the place. It went from predictable, to what Hell is happening?\\n\\n\r\nOverall- If you like Loli harem this is the anime for you.",

            "content": "Check out the video review here: https://youtu.be/wf_Mk6N6Iq4\r\nIn 2011 Japanese Author, Shiden Kanzaki wrote a manga that to me is one of the best stories to date. Do you know which one I'm refering to? Come on.. you know. Ok, I'll give you a hint, kick ass little girls. I'm Talking about Black Bullet. This series is one that remains on my \"re-watch\" list, constantly, and no.. not because of the kick ass little girls, or the Hot katana wielding chick Kisara. But because of the endless emotional rollorcoaster and lessons that the story relays, and i would be lying out right if i said idid not shed a tear at all while watching this series. \\n\r\n_________________\\n\r\nThe year is 2021 and mankind is facing a war against an awful epidemic called gastrea that has the power to mutate it's victoms on contact. Our Main protagonist Rentaro Satomi and his adorable twin-tailed side kick Enju Aihara are part of a Special Security team that specializes in extinguishing the gastrea. Enju is Known as a cursed child, The cursed children, are children who were effected by the epidemic at birth, but not to the point of mutation. They also are able to fight off gastrea due to the genes from the epidemic allowing them special abilities, some are teamed up with officers as partners or as the series has it, Initiators. \\n\\n\r\nHowever the rest of society shuns them and blames them for their losses, even goes as far as trying to kill one of them off out of fear, even though these children are the key to saving humanity. Which is sad, because the lost children are human,  and are just trying to be accepted as people, and co-exist. I won't go any further into it than that, but I do believe this series teaches us the importance of not being prejudice, and not to judge or forsake others just because they are a little different. It also teaches us the importance of being human, and to not let ourselves grow accustom to the losses of others.\\n\\n\r\nA truly beautiful, yet emotional story. I give it a solid 10 marking. It's got some really good action, and fantastic writing.\\n",

Yet, the action was pretty awesome!!!\r\nArt Rating 9: The art of course is standard I guess you can sya but I enjoyed their design. Red eyes are common with everything that goes bad, but it was cool.\r\nSound Rating 10: BOOM BOOM! SLICE CRASH! THUD!... That's all I'm going to say. \r\nCharacterRating 9: I personally, enjoyed them and wished there was more depth about their personalities and background stories.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment Rating 10: I couldn't but to watch episode after episode, and I'm more of a reader than anything else. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I say 9.5, I really liked it ;D! \\n",

            "content": "Black Bullet was an interesting watch, I will have to say that yes at times it has seemed to have forgotten that it was a post-apocalyptic anime, however, I will note that it is logical (in the anime world that is) to have the Monolith protect the Tokyo area from the Gastera. The animation meets my expectations in the anime and the character designs were really good, really nothing to complain about and nearly something to write home about. As per the story, it honestly was enjoyable enough to actually lure me in and continually watch it for a period of 4 days and Iwould say that it is an enjoyable story, although I guess it can be a bit over the place particularly when focusing a lot on the Lady (who I can't remember the name of so I'll just call her lady from now on) seems to forget about the other things going on like the Gastera, in which 2,000 of them are swarming outside the Tokyo Area  and yet the only thing for a span of several episodes that happens is meetings on passing a bill to protect the cursed children and Satomi is responsible for protecting the Lady. Ok, and now it's time for me to ramble about the ending, let's not forget that no one cares about the crumbling Monolith until its too late to build a replacement, WHAT? I mean that seems pretty illogical to me, If this was to occur in the real world there would be several Monoliths encompassing the same area so of one does go down than the area will still be covered. Additionally, even if there was only one, they should have started constructing a replacement when they knew it was going to expire! And then whoops! It expired and crumbled early! I mean this is not that bad of an anime, but I really feel that this ending could be a bit more logical on how Monolith 32 was handled, It's like they needed (well I mean they kind of had to due to how they were setting it up) to make a \u201chumanity is on the brink\u201d action scene before they wrapped up the anime\u2026 I mean cmon, this could have been done much, much, MUCH better, and it had the potential too. As for sound, some of the background music was amazing enough to make me look for it on YouTube. This doesn't happen often but my personal favourite soundtrack from this anime is called \u201cRains of Sorrow\u201d with honourable mentions to \u201cTokyo Kickin' Back\u201d. Overall this is one of the better animes that I have watched I will have to say that it is one that I would recommend. But seriously that Monolith situation? Pfft, not letting that one slide.",

The Gastrea have wiped out much of the human population putting those who remain threatened with extinction. The story follows Satomi Rentarou and he's initiator Enju Aihara who are civil officers with the task of defending the remnants of Tokyo from the Gastrea threat. \r\nThe first section seemed to be the best for the series. The characters were fresh and interesting but towards the end of the series many character became completely inconsistent with their beliefs and values. Character mood changed drastically between episodes and withinepisodes which only caused confusion about what the writers were trying to accomplish for the series.   \\n\\n\r\nNot to mention that during the series many plot devices and dialogs were put in never to be iterated upon ever again. This created a very hap-hazardous story line where there's actually too much trying to be done to keep a deep and meaningful storyline going. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest the only reason I got interested in the show was because of the Characters Enju and Tina. I  was hoping that they could have had more screen time but I understand that the series only had a short 13 episode season. Had it gotten 24 episodes I'm sure I would have far less to complain about. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up Black Bullet had a nice beginning but failed to deliver on the final episodes. The characters all tried to become much more than the story could handle with caused many inconsistencies to occur.The story had far too many loose ends to make it a satisfying series.",

Surely, the dark theme fits me so much ,so i have a high hope for this anime. I watched this anime in a marathon style, but i was very dissapointed...\r\nStory- 5\r\nThe story about gastreas itself is not that original but unique in its own ways. When we are biten/ infected by them we will become one of those monster that endanger humanity. But the problem lies in thestory itself. If humanity, is really endangered by those species and living in fear, WTF is the people and the military is all the same.\\n\r\nFirst of all the people, will you still wander around at street when late night if those monster can appear out of nowhere? Think about it, the people still act like \"there's nothing wrong with gastreas lying around, we are havin' fun\"\\n\r\nSecond, The military is so goddamn poor, why did they have so few ppl that are willing to fight gastreas? Or why dont the government force them to fight them if the army isnt sufficient enough.\\n\\n\r\n\"The Joker\" should be a really interesting character but in this anime , AGAIN even one of the most interesting character got blown off in its plot, he left things unexplained until the end of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 8\\n\r\nI wont lie on this, the soundtrack is great, i even downloaded the opening and the ost is... well its not that good but its pretty fair imo\\n\\n\r\nAnimation- 6\\n\r\nFor a shounen battle anime that have a dark theme, the art is bad imo because the background not moving, the building whatsoever is pretty bad\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -4 \\n\r\nGoddamnit i even forget the mc name is the first impression when i write this review. The MC is really forgettable. One of the main character Kisara san become so dark at the end. Loli being useless at the last battle etc, its damned frustating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 7\\n\r\nDespite all of that i still enjoy the anime. This is the kind of anime you should not get your hopes so high, because it surely will dissapoint you, and 1 more suggestion: Turn your brain off while watching this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall -6\\n\r\n+Good OP and ED\\n\r\n+Unique writing\\n\r\n+Easy to understand\\n\\n\r\n-Bad Characters writing\\n\r\n-Shit ending\\n\r\n-Really forgetable, both the anime or the characters",

At times it feels like there should be more buildup before the climatic finish occurs. It ends up being alright though because the show gets right back in the swing of things after every climax. Long story short, there is not a lot of down time in the anime. It moves at a fast pace throughout the season.\r\nYou might enjoy this if: You are a fan of Attack on Titan. Is has a similar feel to it in thathumanity is nearly extinct and they must do whatever it takes to survive.\\n\\n\r\nYou might not like it if: You want a story arc that remains consistent throughout an entire season. The stories bounce around a lot.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the Viewer: Just when you think you have figured out where the story is going and what genre this anime is, the anime will switch it up on you. Trust me, it does this several times throughout the show.",

A mediocre story line can be compensated for by good characters and execution. However, Black Bullet has got none of that right, AT ALL.\r\nWhat is really horrible about the story, is how they force it to be some sort of a desperate and cruel drama. I wouldn't be surprised if they suddenly showed a scene where they just throw hundred of babies in a mincer.I don't know what they were expecting but I literally laughed at how ridiculous it was when they just killed off the entire mutant classroom.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"main essence\" of the plot (mutants and such) are just stupid as hell. They just made a blatant dumb excuse to include a cast of loli killers into the series. Imagine a plot, where girls can become powerful killing machine, only if they're 15 years old, have big tits because it depends on their milk content. Just think how dumb that sounds, that's the same thing as Black Bullet.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about character, it's just so awful and so goddamn plain. The protagonist is plain and bland, he's your typical anime \"that alright looking dude that appears to be plain at first but he really has this awesome power that gets EVEN MORE powerful at the end! also fights hard for his friends\".  That's all he is.\\n\\n\r\nHis partner is just equally bland, the only \"special\" thing about her is her speech.\\n\\n\r\nMusic wasn't really fit for the anime, I feel.\\n\\n\r\nArt is ok, your typical 2013-ish art style. I liked the loli designs, they're alright.\\n\\n\r\nIn over all, I didn't really enjoy it, I just watched it for the cute lolis and just for the sake of ending it.\\n\\n\r\nSo tl;dr story was typical, really bland and kept pushing out dumb shit to make it look like a drama anime, characters were really fucking lame, plot was made with a dumb excuse to have killer lolis.",

They provide enough of a backstory that you aren't lost, which allows you to more easily relate to the characters and be a part of the struggle. In terms of complexity the story is lacking because there is a clear distinction between who is fighting for good and who is evil. This doesn't take away from the story though because there is enough of a gray area so that there is an internal struggle for the viewer.\r\nThe artis what I would consider more than adequate, although not outstanding. I feel that there really isn't anything to complain about because it doesn't get in the way of the viewer's enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nMood is tragic and serious, but there is more than a sprinkle of comedic relief present as well. For that reason I could understand why some may say that the comedy is out of place when the plot is based on a dystopia.

            "content": "Anime, like all mediums in entertainment, is full of disposable content that usually don\u2019t withstand the test of time and they fail to make any kind of impact outside their target audience (in the case of anime, that would be japan). However, when they do crossover, they all share a common theme of proving time and time again that cartoons can be intricate, intense, mature, thought provoking for adults, and, overall, deeply reflective. Last Spring Season, there were three shows that all had crossover potential and delivered (Gargantia On The Verderous Planet, Flowers Of Evil, and Attack On Titan, which is currently a huge hiton Adult Swim). Black Bullet is another one of those shows that show crossover potential within it\u2019s great animation and engaging premise.\\n\\n\r\nIn the year, 2021, Mankind has been decimated by a virus called Gastrea. This virus, when infecting humans, causes them to turn into giant beasts of many different species that feed on flesh of human beings. In order for the remainder of the human race to stay safe from these mutated creatures, they must live in a wall made of varanium monoliths, a metal used to combat the Gastrea beasts. Soon children that were born with the virus, yet are able to control it and have superpowers, were discovered. (For some reason, these cursed children can only be female and seem to peak at the age of 10\u2026more on that later..) Within the ten years after the virus hit, a team called Civil Securities have been formed to fight against the Gastrea with the Initiator (the cursed child) and the Promoter (who leads the cursed child). Now it\u2019s up to our main protagonist, Rentaro Satomi, and his Initiator, Enju Aihara, to be put on a mission to prevent the destruction of Tokyo.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that the description above was explained in the last three minutes of the first episode shows that this show is hell bent on covering a lot of detail as fast as possible. The problem is that it ever seems to slow down. If the viewer falls behind, eventually that viewer will fall completely out of the loop. Thus, the experience gets frustrating. Those that do succeed in catching up are so focused on paying attention to all the details that they\u2019ll end up not feeling as impacted by the moments that are meant to be impacting. An example of this happens in episode four, when a character, who played a key role in the first arc, dies. Not only was there nothing building up to it (she was discovered severely injured and had her life ended coup de grace) but the plot had to move along quickly, so there was no time to dwell on that tragedy. In fact, the following episodes almost indicated that she never existed. Every episode is like that. For the most part, no time is left to reflect on the characters due to the absurdly fast pace the story is moving and the large amounts of boring info-dump scenes in between every fight scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the story, however are the themes of the show. As mentioned before, children that have these Gastrea powers are known as \u201ccursed children\u201d. While some of them work as Initiators to defend humanity from the Gastrea, others are ostracized from society due to the fear that they might go berserk and kill people with their tremendous power. So the girls usually keep their identity hidden or they have no place to go (even parents would abandon them).\\n\\n\r\nThe girls that are Initiators have their own problems. Some of them, like Enju, are treated like normal children when they\u2019re not fighting giant monsters. However, some Promoters (the adults that works with the Initiators) treat their Initiators as tools, completely denying their humanity. Rentaro, who is the Promoter that looks after Enju, believes that all these girls aren\u2019t evil by nature and should all be cared for instead of being used or neglected based on their genetic traits. Sadly, he can\u2019t create that perfect world alone. He even goes out of his way to make small school for the cursed children, at one point, only for it to result in tragic consequences. This is the sole human element of Black Bullet that was bound to resonate with the viewer. No child, no matter what they were born with or into, should have their human rights denied.\\n\\n\r\nThat theme should\u2019ve been what could bring the show over the hump from being an average show to a good show. However, the writers managed to mess even that part up. It wasn\u2019t just the rushed and clumsy pacing that caused the emotional involvement of the viewer to be nonexistent. It was the portrayal of the cursed children. It seems like the original author of the source material (Black Bullet was adapted from a light novel) was so insecure about his writing that he felt as if the only way for the reader to feel engaged was to appeal to otaku and lolicons. What was so wrong about having little boys as cursed children as well? That wouldn\u2019t have changed the focus at all. In fact, it probably would have made it an even bigger focus. Here\u2019s the thing: that may not have been the focus at all. This is where the writing shows its biggest weaknesses.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with Enju, she seems like a spunky, playful girl that\u2019s poised and confident when it matters. While that can make her a very cool character, this ten year old girl also talks about wanting to fully consummate a relationship with Rentaro. She\u2019ll flirt with him by saying naughty things to him, seduce him by trying to sleep with him or get him to take a bath with her, etc. She seems very much aware of what she\u2019s saying while also being petite, playful, and wearing twin-tails. That just reeks of lolicon bait. A lot of girls are portrayed differently but with the same idea in mind. At the final arc of the show, four Promoters and their Initiators form a team for the final battle. That team of Initiators consists of Enju, Yuzuki (the token tsundere), Midori (a shy neko loli), and Tina Sprout (an initially lethargic girl with very little awareness that the collar of her PJs always slips off and exposes her shoulder). There are other girls in the show that are usually portrayed in similar fashion. If they don\u2019t have personalities catering to an otaku\u2019s specific tastes, they at least have an uninspired loli/moe based design and personality. If this was just your run-of-the-mill lolicon/otakucentric romantic comedy that wasn\u2019t meant to be taken seriously, it could just be treated as stupid fun at best. However this show takes itself seriously and wants the audience to feel empathy for these girls. However, these aren\u2019t realistically written characters. They\u2019re fetishy, otakucentric stereotypes designed to cater to a specific audience for the most part. Therefor, it makes it a fantasy. Therefor, all logic gets tossed out the window. Therefor, those that are disgusted by it won\u2019t give a damn about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a question I would ask to all the lolicons that did like the show. How can you care about the welfare of these prepubescent girls if you\u2019re also having sexual fantasies about them? You can\u2019t possibly do both. How can this show be sensitive about all the abuse and neglect these girls go through if they\u2019re also throwing in lolita jokes and portraying them as lolicon bait. The show can\u2019t do both. It\u2019s the way these girls are depicted that severely undermine the story to the point that even the most serious of moments feel hollow.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the other characters are written aren\u2019t any better. Rentaro always means well, striving for justice and doing the right thing. Other than his intense emotion and zeal, that\u2019s all there is to his character. Maybe that\u2019s why so many girls, young and old, like him so much\u2026 What seemed interesting was his witnessing his parents dying in the first scene of episode one. It would\u2019ve been nice to know more about his back-story to help flesh out his character. The same can be said about everyone else. Kisara is essentially Rentaro\u2019s boss and childhood friend. She certainly plays the \u201cchildhood friend\u201d anime character very well too. She has big boobs, she\u2019s badass, and she has a secret crush on Rentaro (because of course she would, silly readers). Other characters seem to come off as either creepy low-lives or stereotypes that don\u2019t seem to mean much in the grand scheme of things. Therefore, they\u2019re not worth talking about. There is one consistent villain that did seem very interesting. The villain, Kagetane, was also a Promoter with his own daughter, Kohina, as his Initiator. However, he has his own ideas about saving the world and that is too destroy and rebuild. He disappeared for several episodes and then reappeared near the end. Even he didn\u2019t get much explained about him and there seemed to be so much more to explain about his character and his daughter. Everything about this Black Bullet screams \u201cwasted potential\u201d so far.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is uninspired, with the exception of how some of the Gastrea monsters are designed. More imagination on how these monsters look, which are basically mutated forms of different animals, seemed to have been utilized more. Character designs themselves seem to look the same as every other anime but that\u2019s probably the point. It\u2019s trying to be safe and appeal to otaku, after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, on the other hand, is superb. There was a lot of passion being put into the rendering the action scenes especially and if there is any reason to watch the show, it\u2019s the fun factor regarding said scenes. It\u2019s not always consistent, however. The frame rate does tend to slow down significantly when characters are talking each others ear off to transparently explain the plot to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe music also made the show entertaining to watch with electronica techno beats with chamber choirs to build up the intensity of the fight scenes. The opening theme (by FripSide) and the ending theme (by Yanagi Nagi) were all animated and performed with a lot passion, despite being made for a show with passionless content.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was effective as well, with only one stand-out. Despite the shallow character that Rentaro was, Yuki Kaji (best known as Eren Yeager from Attack On Titan) did well to emote his voice and bring out the most of his character. He had every opportunity to sound like the standard anime hero but he did everything he could to bring out the intense emotion that made Rentaro seemingly interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be harsh to call this show a beautifully disturbing waste of time, but that\u2019s what it is. With the premise and the ideas it had in place, it could\u2019ve been more than worthwhile watch with enough crossover potential to make this even a hit on Toonami. But with the lolicon/otaku pandering, the terrible writing, and the overall desire to restrict it\u2019s audience to the safest areas possible instead of being ambitious makes this show disappointing and unable to be taken seriously or get emotionally invested in it. It\u2019s a shame the story wasn\u2019t pitched to a better writer. It\u2019s sad to say that whoever wrote Black Bullet needs to start from scratch. But first, he would need to know how to write better before attempting something too ambitious again.",

            "content": "Black Bullet was one of those anime that was hyped to the extreme, most likely because of the success of SNK/AOT, whose setting is very similar to Black Bullet's. However, compared to the thrilling experience i had with SNK, Black Bullet kind of disappointed me.\r\nLet's start with the story: The premise for this anime is amazing by itself, a virus that turns humans into monsters, and the remnants of humanity being trapped within protected areas (recognize anything?). With the setting I have no problem. Then we get to the actual fights. Oh boy, here we go. A common pattern in Black Bullet is that aseemingly insurmountable threat or responsibility is placed in front of the protagonist to deal with, usually having a few episodes of build-up before the fight to show how much of a challenge the upcoming match will be. Then the confrontation with the great danger occurs, and the protagonist defeats the enemy in a few minutes, sometimes even a few seconds, with hardly any hassle at all; whether it was because there was something convenient lying around, or the protagonist had some hidden power that was unknown until now. See the problem? I think the main reason for this is because pace of the anime was extremely rushed, and BB could have used a full 25 or even 26 episode season instead of just a 12.\\n\r\nAlright, let's get to the characters. For the most part, the characters in Black Bullet are all lovable and each have their own quirks and gimmicks that make each of them memorable in their own special way. As for their designs, nothing particularly special, just what we would usually expect from any anime.\\n\r\nOverall, this is an okay anime; not very good, but then again, not very bad. For those who haven't seen this yet, I would suggest watching it just to watch it.",

            "content": "Black Bullet is an anime adaptation of a light novel with the same name. People often call this series as a rip-off of Attack on Titan, due to the similar premise. \r\nStory - 5/10\r\nThe story takes place in a post-apocalypse Tokyo. Where giant bugs-robot-thingies called Gastraea. So our Protagonists must protect Tokyo from the Gastraea threat with the help of LOLIS!!!!\r\nFirst off, for a \"Post-Apocalypse\" world, Tokyo doesn't feel post-apocalyptic enough. People are still happily living in a clean environment with a working economy. It could be better if it actually shows us the effect of the past Gastraea Wars.\r\nSecond off, the pacing. Overly rushed,is an understatement. It's poorly done. One minute we're having a fanservice moment, and the next minute a Genocide occurred. I know this is based on a Light Novel, but a fast pacing can be acceptable if done well.\\n\\n\r\nThird off, the mood. They basically threw it out of the window. Black bullet tries too hard to be dark. But the loli moments and gritty moments basically cancel each other out. It switches from a comedic to dark in less then a minute. Therefore, it's a complete mess.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, the story is mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is done well enough to keep you entertained. The Gastraea's 3D models are really well done. It fits to the scene nicely.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough some battle scenes are really rushed, the art is one of this series' best aspects.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great. The songs fit into the scene's mood perfectly. Whether the mood is comedic or dark. But as I said before, since the mood was a complete throw-off, the songs aren't really memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3/10\\n\r\nThis is where it starts going down hill. Like, really down. Most of the characters felt bland and empty. But when there's an interesting character, they either don't get much development and screen time, or just killed instantly.\\n\\n\r\nRentaro, the main protagonist, is just a usual \"I-want-to-protect-everybody\"-kind of guy. Which, by the way, can be found in most shonen materials. Whether it's anime or manga. Nothing is really different about him.\\n\\n\r\nBut the rest of the crew is just bland. Enju is too annoying, and Kisara is a typical Tsundere (Even though she changed at the very last episode, it didn't do much for her character.) Tina is the most interesting one, but even then, she didn't get the character development she deserved.\\n\\n\r\nBut what really killed this for me is that this series has a bad, BAD, set of antagonists. You have the Kisara's grandpa person, which was revealed to be evil AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE. Then you have the Osaka-president guy, who is just your plain \"Rule-the-world\" bad guy. We have Kisara's older brother, which just appeared and was revealed to be evil AT THE VERY LAST GODDAMN MINUTE.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the most annoying antagonist I've ever known, the Bodyguard guy. (Nobody remember his name anyway) His motivation to be evil and hate Rentaro is just... UGH!!!\\n\\n\r\nKagetane and his daughter, Kohina, is the only redeeming ones. But then again, as I said before, Didn't get enough development.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10\\n\r\nThis anime tried to mark itself as a Dark Action Seinen with a dash of Loliness. Which at the end failed to do. Miserably.\\n\r\nBut if you can get past the weak setting, and bland characters, you might just enjoy this anime for what it is. A mess of Gritty and Loli-y moments slapped together.",

It has the comedy part and also the serious part as well. The protagonist is not bad and you\u00b4ll find similarities to\"Attack on Titan\" both plot wise and Character story. In the comedy part u have some harem aspects to keep it interesting and funny but right after you relax a bit there\u00b4s always something serious right around the corner, incomes the serious part that I mentioned, tragedy, action to keep your heart pumpin and tears dropping.\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: This anime is not harem but you will notice some aspects that make\u00b4s you think that genre is present.

            "content": "*This review contains spoilers*\r\n*English isn't my first language*\r\nBlack Bullet is an anime that got a lot of people hyped up in Spring 2014. Many comparing it to Attack on Titan. It was known to be one of the best anime of Spring that year. However, many agree that the ending was disappointing. Making no real sense and contained awful writing. It's not just the ending. It's the entire show. \r\nStory: \r\nBlack Bullet is an anime where monsters known as Gastrea invade the earth and humanity is left for their own survival. Gastrea infected little \"children\" (I'll get to this later) turning them into monsters. Andnow it's up to our main hero Rentarou to put an end to these creatures along with his sidekick Enju. What's good: I like how the Gastrea infect little \"children.\" That's interesting to see what could happen to these kids. Everything else is done in the most awfully executed way. First off, let's talk about how these \"children\" are all little girls. Not a single boy is infected by this. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE LITTLE BOY IN THIS SHOW. ONLY GIRLS. Do you see where I'm going with this? It's loli bait. It's done to attract viewers in the most disgusting way. Also, the story is filled with inconsistencies. Like, how they're always like \"Oh the outside world is dangerous\" and yet they make these girls go to school because????????? These little girls who were infected by Gastrea and Rentarou forms a bond with them and then ALL OF A SUDDEN they die. What was the point of that? They were never brought up again. The pacing is horrendous. It takes them like 2 minutes to defeat this monster that they say will take a few hours, but nope the anime decided that showing the struggle was too much so time skip. And how our main villain decides to team up with Rentarou because??????????? The ending makes no sense and it leaves you wanting more but guess what? We don't get one. The story leaves many things left unexplained, is filled with plot holes and inconsistencies. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nIt's decent. Nothing spectacular, but decent. The characters designs are fine, the action scenes when they aren't rushed is well animated, the backgrounds are really nice to look at, the CGI is okay, but nothing is done amazingly. It's just fine. Nothing is amazing, it's just decent. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors do a fine job portraying their characters, they sound believable. I like how the female voice actors do an excellent job at portraying the little girls voices. It sounds believable. The soundtrack, however, is mediocre. Nothing stands out. The OP and ED are as basic as you can get. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis show comes with a decent amount of characters, but they are all written HORRIBLY. Our lead, Rentarou, is about an interesting as watching grass grow. He doesn't develop, he doesn't do anything that makes him stand out from the rest of the crowd, he's your basic lead. Enju is that fly that keeps swarming around your head that you want to smack but you never can. She's a useless, one dimensional character who has a tragic backstory only to hook you into her to find something interesting about her. Kisara is the bland \"Love interest?????\" who does nothing to the show. She is there for the sake of it. Our main villain and his daughter are the bad guys who are behind this whole thing but later decide to join up with Rentarou because. Then we have Rentarou's dad who is only there for one episode and is never brought up again. Then we have the girls who are only in there for an episode and are never brought up again. Then we mention Rentarou's dead mother only once and is never brought up again. Basically, every character is useless, unlikeable, selfish, bland, etc. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nTrash. Utter trash.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is nothing more than dog shit. Every character is either bland, stupid, useless, etc. The story is full of inconsistencies and plot holes, the ending is clustered mess, the pacing is awful, the anime is AWFUL. PLEASE DO NOT WATCH IT. It sucks. If you want a better anime, watch Attack on Titan even as mediocre as it is. Just do not watch this piece of shit.",

            "content": "I watched this show because I wanted to see little girls shooting guns and killing stuff, plain and simple. I actually enjoyed this a lot more than expected though.\r\nStory:6\r\nContrary to some other reviews I've seen around, I found the story was pretty well done if a little dumb. While it did leave a lot of things up to guesswork or otherwise a mystery, there was never really a time where it would have been appropriate to bring the questions back up, nor any reason to do so. For what the characters worked through of the plot elements, it all seemed mostly appropriate, though I wouldfault it a bit toward the second-half of the series where it felt a bit rushed.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:7\\n\r\nFor the art, the animations and details were excellent; clothing, hair, weapons, landscape, just everything was well done...except the gore. Any time something or someone was killed, all quality went out the widow in lieu of a gore explosion and almost no definable anatomy.\\n\r\nSound was decent across the board, nothing spectacular, nothing particularly memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:5\\n\r\nThe main character sucked. He was very typical to the 'I will do it for my friends, but I'll do it alone' anime standard, but he did vary a little bit in that he never learned from his stupidity. I'm not saying that love and the power of friendship should ever win the day, just that, if you get your ass kicked whilst alone enough times, you might consider backup. If it were just up to the two main characters, this category would be a 2.\\n\r\nHowever, we have a supporting cast that was amazing. Much out of standard from anime cliches, they really brought the world to life. The first bad guy could be en class with characters like the Joker for how well one could follow his motives. The main (non-loli) girl ended up actually surprising me; usually a character seeking revenge ends up a)feeling bad for the person they were after or b)giving them a slap on the wrist instead because their friend made them soften up. Those and several other characters pretty well displayed a diverse field of characters and views of people in crisis situations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6 (personal enjoyment: 8)\\n\r\nWhile I enjoyed this quite a bit, I was looking for something this ridiculous to fill my time, so it was perfect for what I was going for. I think the average person could get a fair amount of enjoyment out of it as well, however. In my opinion this is just as good to watch as any well known action series, possibly better than most. The biggest turn off for me was the unnecessary child death and the loli love crap. The former lost any value it had after the third-ish time and the latter is just dumb.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nThe show probably would have been better received if it had left off after the masked man. Instead, I guess, people felt slighted that they didn't get to know the greater world that was so alluded to but not explored in the anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI want to note specifically that they do fairly well address the little girls' origins, while some of it is guesswork based on life situations, it doesn't seem too out of place to me. Some spoilers after this point, but it also might make the story easier to understand because this seems to be a large issue with the community...\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nThe story starts 10 years after the attacks that put the world into a state of near ruin. Infected women who were pregnant at the time would give birth to girls only, due to mutation set by the creature's virus. However, they developed along side the infection and basically inherited it in a reduced effect, but with beneficial properties to further alterations. Given that the attacks at the time were (as best I could find) the first attacks, there would have been little data on the infection and the infection has various speeds that it can affect someone based on how it was contracted. While they found out later that it could be spread through bodily fluids, it could easily have been contracted by people just kissing one another or possibly sneezing while infected. The low infection catalyst would have allowed the mother to continue as normal for an unknown time and when they finally had to kill her, it's not that unusual to try to save the child even if the mother is dead. Emergency standard is to save women and children, so having a couple thousand pregnant women being saved is hardly a stretch. Since the newborns exhibited no signs of succumbing to the infection, there would be no reason not to raise them. However, once the realization was made that anyone infected would turn into a monster, it's likely that the protocol became to simply execute them before they turned, which would explain why the girls affected all seem to be around 10 years old; any would-be generations after this would have simply been killed along with the parents when found out and, unable to support the continue influx of infants, they would simply die along with the parents\\n\r\nThen once the girls were older, the government started keeping them around as weapons since they had new knowledge on them and they ended up being tools to combat a greater evil, but as few people wanted them they were basically just tribes of children left in isolation from the normal world.",

            "content": "If you want the abridged version of my review read the conclusion (at the bottom). This is a fairly detailed review in which I was VERY careful not to spoil ANYTHING. I admit, a good bit of it is me venting my frustration with the unjust flood of negative reviews for this anime.\r\nHaving finished Black Bullet a few years after most reviewers, I have had the luxury of being able to read the reviews and reflect upon much of what is said about Black Bullet. I rather liked Black Bullet and hoped for a second season...that said, I find much of the harsh criticism isunjustified. Having read through several reviews that seem like there was a massive bandwagon in which people expressed their dislike of Black Bullet in the most generic manner as possible...\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5 \\n\r\nI admit that this is the weakest link in the anime. While coherent, it tends to be fairly generic and occasionally has blatant displays of plot armor.  Near the end it felt rushed, but there was nothing a season 2 couldn\u2019t fix. While the plot was nothing special, it wasn\u2019t bad either. It had a more consistent plot than a slew of other anime (Sword Art Online, A Certain Magical Index, Hunter X Hunter, Attack on Titan...).  Was this the best plot? No, but it\u2019s nothing that ruins the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7???\\n\r\nNo expert in this. Wasn\u2019t anything mortifying. There weren\u2019t any instances of where Art work shined to support the plot (like Madoka Magica or Unlimited Blade Works).\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nI tend to be fairly picky about the music I listen to. That said, I rather enjoy the music from Black Bullet. It\u2019s opening and ending themes are pretty good and I seldom skipped them when watching Black Bullet. My favorite part is easily the theme music.  It has some amazing OST that shines during critical moments. While this was no Guilty Crown or SAO Ordinal Scale, this anime\u2019s sound track is easily a notch above your average anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7-8\\n\r\nThis is one of the places where Black Bullet gets unusual amounts of hate. There are slews of reviews hating upon the Cursed Children being young girls, but the plot (and basic biology) can explain this... The main character was nothing special, but there were definitely some solid supporting characters. Many of the Cursed Children the audience gets introduced to are decent characters. If we are simply going for character development, even the main character gets more character development than 99% of the characters from Hunter X Hunter....an anime that \u2018evidently\u2019 was deserving of a ~9... I do not understand how other reviewers claimed the characters were \u20182-dimensional\u2019 yet had deep and sad back stories. The biggest draw back to this anime in this category is that I wanted MORE character development. This is probably a frustration that other reviewers are having trouble voicing and thus blame the gender, age, or backstory of the characters... These characters are interesting enough to perk the viewers interest and like in Angel Beats, get enough character development for one to crave more, but goes no further, causing an uproar in the audience that other anime that don\u2019t put ANY effort in developing characters (like Raxephon, Hunter X Hunter, seven deadly sins) don\u2019t receive. This anime needed more episodes for this arc and more time devoted to plot and characters. (But nothing a season 2 couldn\u2019t fix).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9-10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed it and want a season 2. This is a solid start to an anime series with an interesting world with cool mechanics.  Most of the complaints about the anime can be explained using 9th grade science knowledge which annoys me. This like other anime gets redundant complaints that the plot ADDRESSED. If I could go into more detail, I would take the time to debunk ~90% of the complaints give (this is not difficult since most of these complaints are repeated and seemingly copy and pasted from one review to the next).\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nI feel this is a high 7 or a low 8. This anime gets more flak than it deserves, but it\u2019s not without short comings.  If you enjoy interesting characters, dark humor, and an interesting world, Black Bullet does a pretty good job at that. I found it ironically enjoyable watching it AFTER reading all the ironious negativity about Black Bullet and puzzling over the complaints (most of which I found to be immartial). The anime is consistent with the \u2018rules\u2019 (there are little to no contradictions with the mechanics of the world) it sets and is fairly consistent.\\n\r\nThis is NOT an anime for those who want something simple that requires no thinking and everything spoon fed to them.  I am frustrated with the anime because there is justification using real world science that it can use to defend itself, but having lasted only 13 episodes, Black Bullet never takes the time to do so...\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: If you enjoy tradgy, philosophy, Darker humor, and cool support characters than Black Bullet is pretty good. If you want mindless action or comedy or utopian worlds then this is not the anime to watch. \\n\\n\r\nP.s. Don\u2019t watch this anime (or any anime for that matter) with high expectations. No anime can live up to the hopes and dreams of the human mind.",

They are basically young children(girls) that had red eyes and have the ability to fight monsters that normal people can't. \r\nThe anime incorporated just the right amount of action, cheesy and fluffy-ness, and romance. I am almost sad to see it end. This is probably one of the anime i have watched that made me cried a little (don't laugh). \r\nSo wondering if this is for you, then read the list below and check:\r\n1. action\r\n2. male & femaleMC\\n\r\n2.5. No weak or pathetic girls that faint when they see omg freaking blood.\\n\r\n3. little romance but obvious enough\\n\r\n4. cheesy moments\\n\r\n5. cute and funny moments\\n\r\n6. No harem / reverse Harem\\n\r\n7. No Ecchi\\n\r\n8. Not a slice-of-life anime\\n\r\n9. Without high pitch squealing freaking annoying highschool girls\\n\r\n10.  Awesome art drawing\\n\r\n11. Excellent fighting scenes\\n\r\n12. Great character development( My opinion)\\n\\n\r\nAnd it somehow reminds me of Sword Art Online...Just saying...\\n\\n\r\nWell all in all, it is definitely worth your time if most of what I listed above is your type. I will highly recommend you to try this anime. :)",

However, there are some differences. For one, the story is set in the near future, and revolves around more modernized weaponry such as guns with bullets made out of a rare black metal (Hence the title, \"Black Bullet\"), private companies commonly referred to as CivSecs (Civilian Security Agencies) that more resemble if the Men in Black were all private mercenaries, and the fact that certain characters are essentially overpowered cyborgs.\r\nThat being said, the story is actually reallygood, despite the show's thirteen episode run. It was pretty decent. Not fantastic, but it was certainly better than a bland show such as The Irregular at Magic High School. The ending however, well...it was kind of weak in my opinion. I honestly preferred the ending of the fourth episode more than i did the thirteenth, but I guess that's why 13 is considered an unlucky number.\\n\r\nIn summary, Black Bullet was a halfway good show with great ideas right up until it's somewhat weak ending, in my opinion.",

            "content": "This anime was not that good. It seemed way too clich\u00e9d and was so insanely predictable as to what would happen next. If you've watched your share of anime, you would almost definitely grimace at the cheesy and predictable plot points that happen. \r\nFirst thing I want to say though, the setting of this anime and background plot had SOOOOO MUCH POTENTIAL. A really good anime could have been made with these two aspects, but unfortunately, it was wasted on such a basic and predictable plot.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story ran around too much, was too uninteresting, and too predictable - like I mentioned before. \r\nThe main characterdidn't really have a goal besides an impossible one. Usually, this is alright for an anime because it's what allows the character to keep going and try to go towards their goal. It's supposed to actually develop the plot. But in this case, all it did was provide the determination for him to face the scenarios. However, in almost all these scenarios his goal seemed like a side objective for him until the section. Throughout this story, the gastrea seemed to be treated like side-characters that were only there for show purposes. He doesn't seem to be trying to work to his goal.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the cliches. It was all too much for me. The plot was so damn predictable and cringe-worthy. There was only one part that surprised me and that was when \\n\\n\r\n***SPOILER ALERT START***\\n\r\nThe lolis in the classroom all died because of a terrorist bomb.\\n\r\n***SPOILER ALERT END***\\n\\n\r\nI especially didn't like the (its a somewhat spoiler so meh) bad guy becomes the good guy cliche. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the part I hate the most: it had so much potential AT THE END TOO DAMN IT. This series ended up wasting a huge amount of potential not just in the beginning but in the end as well! If the series was going to use it's potential the right way with a second season I would definitely have watched, but it isn't bothering to use it at all by not creating a second season at all!!!\\n\\n\r\n***SPOILER MEANT FOR PEOPLE WHO ALREADY WATCHED READ****\\n\r\nWhat happened to the diagnosis of Enju's corrosion rate!?!?! Wasn't she supposed to die!!!???\\n\r\n***END OF SPOIL***\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI didn't really like the lolis, except for the one with nekomimi, that one was alright... But really though, the characters were also predictable along with the story. Their attitudes were too bright which made me feel sick a bit, although in some cases it was acceptable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall:\\n\r\nIt's hard to enjoy it because you practically knew what was going to happen next. The plot and characters weren't well made, which wasted all the potential that this series had. I would not recommend this anime, especially to more experienced anime fans.",

            "content": "It seems that many reviews this season on countless shows; seem to show a lot of negativity towards them. Black bullet was an example of this were people bagged a show due to over-analysing. It even seems that at some point all that these reviewers seem to do is sit down and review a tv show based off memory rather than how they enjoyed the show.  There seems to be next to no positive points about shows nowadays. Too many people have tried to compare these to great shows or different genres, and neglect to look at the fact this show is one inits own. You also can't say they stole from other shows as those shows most likely stole from other shows. It's a never ending cycle.\\n\\n\r\nTo start off i'll analyse some negative points about the show and the positives\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it may not appeal to everyone, the opening and ending to this show was very good. It showed each of the characters like one usually does and puts some good music behind it (later on you would come to realise that this opening theme of this show would show  key points to this show). \\n\\n\r\nStory -7 \\n\r\nWhen we focus on the story and how it was portrayed, it was an okay plotline that focused on different aspects of the human conscience, including things such as racism, greed, despair and courage. Examples in the tv show are but not limited to: the young girls with powers, seitenshi sama's (leader of tokyo) bodyguards, the Gastrea's attacks and finally the final sacrifice. As any show though it has its failings. It tried to focus on too many aspects of the show rather than certain themes.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7 \\n\r\nThe art was quite good for this show and matched the themes quite nicely. Rentaro's varanium leg, arm and eye was well created and made him look \"cooler\". The rest of the show had some very neat art styling and during fight scenes it was easy to follow what was happening compared to other shows. It was made so you could clearly see each and every aspect of the fight without too much confusion. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nThe sound during the show was moderately good. The only saving grace for the music was the opening and ending themes. There were parts littered here and there that didn't suite the theme at all. At other times there was no music or next to no music at all. I'm not talking about parts were they are talking but some action scenes were missing a cool theme behind them. If they make a OST I wouldn't mind listening to it to make sure that this was completely fair.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\r\nFairly straighforward characters, I was feeling generous when writing this review. They were okay and had their parts to them, although things such as the final fight between Kisara and.....(you'll have to find out ;)) was not really explained well and how she snapped but other than that it is fine. Typical of this anime is the lover vs lover genre and we can pretty much tell what is going to happen later on in time. Nevertheless the characters has voices that matched them nicely, they didn't have over the top designs and they added to the story quite well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nThe tv show overall was quite enjoyable, with its many aspects coming together quite well. The other parts of the anime come together and fit quite nicely with each other. There were times that it was really slow but other than that if we focus on all these parts coming together then we can see that this show did quite well as an adaptation of the light novel's.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.5 \\n\r\nThis show was a good adaptation of the manga and provided the story well at times and the central idea behind it. If we envision what Shiden Kanzaki was trying to aim for when writing the light novels, then we can thoroughly enjoy this story. I will be eagerly awaiting a second season.",

The drawing style is really good the music suits what is happening in the anime so points for that all the characters have their own interesting relationship ^^ yet the initiators and  promoter fighting style was a great and interesting idea. But in my opinion they could have expanded the series to 24 episodes because it ended too quickly and somestuff just felt unfinished. All in all great anime worth watching.",

            "content": "Black Bullet is a lot like Akame ga Kill! in the sense that things can be very happy and cute and all of a sudden, everyone is dead. The premise is that giant bugs kill everybody in the world, but these bugs carry a disease that turns people into bugs but sometimes little girls get it and get super powers. Then some of these little girls team up with people to fight these giant bugs. The bugs hate this certain metal, so people make weapons out of it and eventually create giant metal obelisks to keep them out. It's a VERY weird premise, but ispresented well for the most part. Unfortunately, the main character is boring, and the little girl he carries around is boring. People show up, but don't really matter. When shocking and sad moments happened to characters, I didn't really care because they were usually just introduced minutes before. The fights that occur are usually pretty cool, but heavily rely on ugly CGI when the bugs are fighting. In summary, Black Bullet had a potentially unique premise, sadly it's wasted on cardboard cutouts for characters and shock violence. If you are looking for a weird and fun to watch anime that requires little effort on your part and you don't mind little girls being blown to smithereens, go ahead and watch it. If not, stay away.",

            "content": "Ever wonder what would happen if 10-12 year old girls were genetically different and were given almost supernatural powers? yeah....i didn't either, but apparently other people did. The end result is  black bullet.\r\n     Right out of the gate you should be hit by awesome. Just pure, musical awesome. The intro sequence was something i continuously looked forward to. The bass is deep and the song is so catchy (I've already downloaded the song). But one can expect a great musical experience outside of just the intro. The combat scenes are backed by a techno/electric beatthat matches the intensity and serious nature of Enju and Rentarou's fights. The subtlety of each piece matches the purpose of the scene so well throughout the 13 episodes. \\n\\n\r\n     The art is equally good. My biggest compliment i can give it is that it handles battles and fast paced sequences beautifully and is consistent all the way across the board. The world is given a great darkness about it. It really shows just how dire the situation is against the gastrea. The destruction of the city outskirts really shows the impact that the gastrea had physically. \\n\\n\r\n     The downside of Black Bullet comes most in its story. While it has potential on many fronts, it takes too many and quickly leaves them as an after thought. The strong points come from the representation of the relationship between Rentarou and Enju. It is a moving relationship that continues on a high note throughout the whole season. Rentarou's relationship with cursed children is also highlighted very well. His sympathy and caring nature toward them is pure and loving. He acts out his established morals and wants to unconditionally love these children. The weak point is in the lack of depth in most other sub plots. The relationship that begins to develop between Rentarou and Kisara gets very little screen time and just becomes a tease most of the time. I would have loved to have seen more about the previous tendo battles and the previous gastrea incidents as well as more actions involving the cursed children and the scientists behind the mechanized soldiers/officers. \\n\\n\r\n      The characters follow the same problems the story does unfortunately. Rentarou, Enju, and Tina quickly became stand outs for me. They had background, story, emotion, and purpose. The cursed children also became quick, emotional stand outs fueled through Enju and Rentarou. The other characters just aren't given enough screen time or background  to become attached to. If they die, it doesn't seem to impact the viewer or characters at all or it is delayed. If they live, you may gain glimpses into them. Kisara was one that had far too much potential to be a great character but was just never given the chance to be (she is still a BA with a sword though). \\n\\n\r\n     Overall, I'll be returning to Black bullet every so often. I really did like it. The potential of the show is just too much to not look forward to, but it has a few areas that need more depth. It also would benefit from an extended season. 13 episodes can be tough to have so much content. It could have very well done all it aspired to do with 20-25 episodes. If your up for some great sound, art, and action, give black bullet a try.",

            "content": "Black Bullet had a good run at its prime, but as it moved away from its light novel counterpart, it slowly declines to how the show ends.\r\nStory: 7\r\nIt's was hard to give this series an 8. The theme of, \"humanity is no longer the top of the chain\" became the next biggest thing, and Black Bullet was another one of them. The story about initiators (female pre-Gastrea) and promoters (humans) against Gastrea is great-- except I question why must all initiators be 10 year old girls. The pacing was okay until the end of the series, where something happened out of the blue, and leftthe watchers to think, \"wait, what just happened?\"\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 9\\n\r\nThe cover art when I first saw this is extremely well done. Contrast in colors while meshing with the dark atmosphere is always great. Animation is fluid and the fights were great to watch. I never got bored while watching these fights. Though, I wished there were more, I guess \"brighter\" colors. Most of the bright color schemes came from the initiators and day-time scenes, when the show is primarily going to be set during the night.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nFripSide made a great opening, pumping me up for an exciting episode that awaits. The OSTs brings in the suspense and gives off some sort of thriller aspect. The ED slowed the mood down a bit by making it calm, but immediately kicks you back into being pumped. The first few seconds would sometimes intertwine with the last scene of the series before sending it off to the ED credits. As a fan of FripSide, I really enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nOkay, this is where most of my complaints come from. If you're not a main character, you can be sure that you will die almost instantly, or just not be noted as much by the main cast.\\n\r\nRentarou, like a lot of main characters, does. not. die. No matter how bad of a situation he is, he will recover from that. With prosthetic limbs, he uses those to his advantage to fight Gastrea. The only problem I have with his character is when he breaks down, because a lot of the times he does, it feels out of place or odd.\\n\r\nEnju, the eccentric initiator for Rentarou, who tries to live a normal life, pretending to be a human when she is actually a Gastrea. She is the only character that I can kind of like, but with her personality is odd. She wants to marry her promoter, but she understands that at any point she can become a Gastrea and he will have to kill her. \\n\r\nKisara, a swords-woman that has an obvious crush on Rentarou. Her personality is extremely bossy, but kind and caring. It was obviously thrown out the window in the last episode, making a complete 180 in personality that just did not make any sense. I was confused as to what her motives were, and if it was even necessary.\\n\r\nThen you have Kagetane and Kohina, a mysterious duo that seems to be working like a double agent -- they work to fight Gastrea and pick off weak initiators/promoters (as presented in episode 1). They have no real back story, and they had a very long absence before reappearing once more with no explanation as to what happened.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 7\\n\r\nThe series in general had a lot of great moments, but it was awkward timing and bad pacing that crippled the series from being something better. There was an extensive amount of unnecessary cast members that could have [in my opinion] be excluded and the series would have been fine. While this series has ended, the Light Novel has not. Would I recommend you to watch the series? Sure, but the Light Novel will offer more for you. Watch and judge for yourself.",

            "content": "What happens when a show introduces a villain who is more enjoyable than the main character ? What happens when the villain's actions make more sense than those of the main character ? What happens when the villain is literally the only reason you watch the show ?\r\nYou start rooting for the villain. And then you get disappointed as the main character, who you really don't care about has it his way while the villain doesn't.\r\nBlack Bullet is a prime example of having a main character that is so bland in comparison to the main villain that you wish the villain was the main character.\r\nButfirst let's start with the story. You will probably have understood from the synopsis that this is a post-apocalyptic world where humanity has been reduced to a minimum due to the rise of giant insects, also known as Gastrea. Or rather, I say post-apocalyptic but everything seems fine as everybody is living their peaceful daily lives in town, protected by these black obelisks. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting is actually pretty confusing and raises multiple questions. It is also riddled with plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we are explained that humanity barely survived the war against Gastrea. Then we are showed people living in peace. So it'd be normal to assume that the humans have won the war thus have no reason to live in fear. But no ! Gastrea are still around and some of them are even inside the \"safe\" town, thus why our main character, Satomi Rentarou, exists. His work as a \"Promoter\" is to kill the Gastrea that infest the town... wait. So if it is openly accepted that Gastrea are still roaming around, how come people live their daily lives as usual ? How come the policemen don't have black bullets, the only bullets that can injure Gastrea, just like the Promoters ?\\n\\n\r\nBut whatever. Within minutes after the beginning of the first episodes, we are introduced straight away to the main antagonist - or at least I like to think of him as the main antagonist - of the series: Hiruko Kagetane. A tall, cunning man wearing a magician outfit along with a white mask.\\n\r\nOur main character has his little encounter with him and fight from which we learn that Hiruko doesn't even need to pay attention to Rentarou to fight him: he literally beats him while being on the phone. Keep that in mind for this is an important point.\\n\\n\r\nLater in the series there will be more encounters and fights between Rentarou and Hiruko. \\n\r\nOne thing that needs to be stated is that not a single time does Rentarou train or upgrades his skills or whatever. From the first to the last episode, he is literally never seen powering up.\\n\r\nSo this is where my other main issue with the fight scenes happens. \\n\\n\r\n*SPOILER AHEAD*\\n\\n\r\nDuring his \"last\" encounter with Hiruko, Rentarou manages to defeat him using his prosthetic limbs that he... was hiding during every other encounter ? This is another major plot hole, as we are told that he had them from the beginning so why did Rentarou get beaten up so often without ever using them ? It's not even like there's any drawback to use them, did he just forgot to pull out his trump card or something ?\\n\\n\r\n*END OF SPOILER*\\n\\n\r\nAnyway,  in terms of motives and personality, that the main character is very easily forgettable. He is a \"hero of justice\" you could say and he fights for every single loli he meets (this anime is full of them). He fights for a better world for them, or at least that's what he thinks. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point I feel like it's important to state that in the current society, the red-eyed little girls Rentarou fights for are discriminated against due to having Gastrea blood in their veins.\\n\\n\r\nThen we learn of Hiruko's motives. He wants to create a new war against Gastrea where the red-eyed lolis will be used to defeat them (because the red-eyed lolis have super strength on par with that of a Gastrea). This would accomplish two things: exterminate the Gastrea once and for all and allow society to see the red-eyed girls in a better light as they would be the heroes who defeated the Gastrea. From a logical point of view, it makes sense and this is where I started siding with Hiruko more than Rentarou.\\n\\n\r\nRentarou tries at all costs to stop Hiruko from starting a new war. He tries to protect the very same world that is unfair to the lolis he wants to protect... why ? That does not make any sense. Hiruko states that he and Rentarou are the same and he offers him to join him... but Rentarou has just about no real reason to refuse... yet he does.\\n\\n\r\nThe moment you understand that, Rentarou starts to look like a huge pushover who has no will of his own and just does things because that's what he is \"meant to do\". \\n\\n\r\nAs you have probably understood by now, the multiple plot-holes in the story (and there are a lot more, trust me) and the lack of identity of the main character are the two down sides of this show.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that adds to the fact that I rooted more for Hiruko than Rentarou is how Rikiya Koyama is voicing Kagetane. His voice is on point and it really makes the character feel slightly crazy while still gentleman-like.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say the same about the main character but I'm not blaming the voice actor. There isn't much you can do when your character literally has no personality of his own anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was very good, I'll have to give the anime that much. The soundtrack wasn't exactly amazing but I have to say I found it pretty memorable with fitting OSTs and a beautiful OP from FripSide.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the enjoyment... it was very varied. It's pretty much 50-50. You could  say I was enjoying myself a lot whenever Hiruko Kagetane was on screen and I was bored the rest of the time. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, this could have been a very unique and interesting anime if he was the main character of the show. But hey, at least loli lovers will be happy.",

My score for this anime is dedicated to the hearth warming and hearth breaking moments, the characters and their psychology and especially what you can learn from the anime (if you look deep into it). You learn that no matter what happens, it is always better to have a hearth of compassion, that's what makesa human hearth pure, and that you cannot get used to tragedies, nor can you save everybody. Yes, the anime had it's flaws, but I really liked the angle of the show and story, I always expected something to happen and it never did, so everything that happened in the show got me by surprise, which is what I enjoyed.

            "content": "At first I went in, not expecting much of it. Looking at the way it was presented along with its synopsis, I was prepared for some loli harem anime. First, you should know that I prefer watching light-hearted anime rather than dark ones so this review may be a little biased in some way.\r\nHowever a few moments in I was pleasantly surprised. \r\nWell, it was truly a mainstream shounen with action and sci-fi (although it's actually a seinen), and it certainly showed signs of being loli harem. But the main character's actions kinda discourage the loli harem aspect, with having another love interest being thesame age and all. At first the balance between actual fights and mental anguish was nice since things like these are good from time to time. However overtime I find it to be excessively overused so much so my evaluations of it changed from 8+ to like, 5 or so.\\n\r\nI mean, people kept dying throughout the story (I hope this is not considered to be a spoiler and also there is actually quite a lot of blood in this series so that's kind of expected) and every time the main characters would just break down before reviving back to normal then someone dies and then they break and then they revive. And I just kept wondering where their continuous character development disappeared to when they keep being strong then being weak then being strong then weak. In other words, it was repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover that was a most terrible way to end a series (for me). That anguish and shock (well, more like disappointment) I could feel from that sudden development at the end just totally threw me off. I mean, they just went pass the climax of the series and, normally, the tension should drop here. I mean, it's the end of a series dammit.\\n\r\nBut no. It went up.\\n\r\nThen it just left.\\n\r\nI mean, I understand that they could've been trying to build some hype for a second season, but damn it left such a terrible taste behind. I was waiting for some ends for that last arc to be tied up as well. And I got absolutely nothing. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I could feel the same vibe as Guilty Crown and Code Geass coming from this series. It's just how I feel, but it really feels like the MC's going to go broken sooner or later........ I mean, look at the last 15 minutes of the last episode. I'd say they're all already broken.",

A war against bugs isn't a new concept.  It resembles too much of \"Attack on Titan\". I can predict almost everything. Many suspend moments are forceful and unrealistic. *Spoiler* Characters/monsters are bound by a ranking system that isn\u2019t reinforced by anything. Winning or losing (fast or slow) is all depended on the mood. \r\nArt 8/10: Characters look great. Monsters however are not. They are mostly clumps of meat with eyes (lackingcreativity).\\n\r\nSound 8/10: Nothing sounds wrong, but also nothing sounds great either. Again, theme music is very similar to \u201cAttack on Titan\u201d. \\n\r\nCharacter 6/10: There is a big flaw; the power scale is all wrong. As a result, the main character doesn\u2019t really grow as the story progresses. I got frustrated because he got beaten by random weak opponents to create suspend moments. The main character is friend/family of many powerful figures somehow afraid of random bad people.  He is a \u201cpart-time\u201d badass ?!?\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: If I haven\u2019t watched other animes, I would have enjoyed it more. It just has too many \u201cdumb\u201d frustrated scenarios, which taken away the joys.\\n\r\nOverall 7/10: It\u2019s an ok anime. Not quite on par with other animes in this season.\\n",

Gastrea is an epidemic, parasitic virus, which form varies from an animal 'til somewhat like dinosaurs or alien. (weird shapes -_-)\r\nCivil servants accompanied by \"Cursed Children\", means the children who born with Gastrea virus within body and get superhuman abilities.\r\nWell, the story like this is so common, right? You human are in the line of death with no other choice left except to fight those Gastrea. It's easy to find the same storyline from other anime series and also the same genres.But the art here is impressed me, The art plus the movements of characters in battles lol.\\n\\n\r\n    Having touchy-feeling will get you drowned when the dramatic scenes appear. Sometimes the story gets a lil-bit like a drama like when the comrades dead, problematic feelings and hardship as friends. That's how I both like and dislike the series, sometimes the dramatic scenes show too contrived.\\n\\n\r\n    What boost the point of this anime from my point of view are the characters and music themes. The characters varies, so it's not boring to get new characters in. For me, the most pleased factors are lolis everywhere. They even fired a gun and so epic as soldiers-born to fight Gastrea. Not to mention the music themes, both OP and ED are damn awesome!

            "content": "Review in brief: Black Bullet features solid action, emotional scenes, and a great soundtrack to boot. However, it suffers from its blistering pace causing it to miss out on character development and fall flat with its attempts at humor. Your enjoyment hinges on how well you can tolerate its flaws, and while I'd argue that this anime has more good than bad it does straddle the line quite hard.\r\nReview in full: Let's start with the good. Black Bullet's most frequent quality is its steady (but not overbearing) action scenes. The show does a good job of making action intense and brings out some of itsbest animation and music for these scenes. The fights felt varied from each other as a wide variety of battlegrounds, circumstances, and opponents (both human and Gastrea, the antagonist monsters of the show) prevented even repeating rematches from feeling repetitive. There are a few fights that feel like they were cut short to prevent important characters from dying though. Still, solid overall. The other strong point of Black Bullet are its emotional scenes, which are pulled off beautifully thanks to how the show uses its setting.\\n\\n\r\nWhile others have criticized the setting because it doesn't convey a sense of imminent human extinction, I would argue that this was never meant to be the case. Humanity clearly suffered a heavy blow in years past, but the discovery and usage of the fictional metal \"Varanium\" is shown to have protected humanity and allowed it to get back on its feet. This is made bluntly clear by the fact that the \"wall\" protecting Tokyo is just an array of Varanium obelisks. Armed with the Gastreas' kryptonite, it's reasonable to believe that the remaining human enclaves (of which there are implied to be many in Japan alone) could exist as futuristic city states similar to Singapore in form and function (which in loose terms is what the setting is).\\n\\n\r\nThat said humanity is still fighting the Gastrea, and it turns out that people who are infected with the Gastrea virus before birth (and survive) develop Gastrea-like abilities during their brief lives. This is the point that Black Bullet focuses much of its serious moments on; in a world where the main group fighting humanity's enemy are a bunch of child soldiers imbued with the genetic code of that same enemy, what happens when these children are inevitably distrusted & despised for their similarity to the enemy? When they are no longer seen as children but as weapons of war? How does this affect them and their worldview? Is it right, or fair? Black Bullet is just as much about a war between humans and alien-like monsters as it is about main characters Rentaro and Enju as they struggle to find meaningful answers to such questions. This turns what would have been merely a jaded & serious (but otherwise generic) teenage action hero and an energetic young girl into surprisingly appreciable characters and solid main leads.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I say \"surprisingly\" is because plot-wise Black Bullet took a lot of shots and not all of them hit, with many of the misses being jokes and rushed plot elements. Black Bullet's touching moments are hits in this regard, and the serious scenes all hit hard. Expect many doses of emotion from this show. Everything is held together by the great soundtrack that feels right at home with the setting, plot, and whatever is currently happening on screen. It's even worth checking out on its own. The animation has both good and bad moments, but tends to be good on average. The CG is really hit or miss and is not infrequent.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the not-so good. Black Bullet's main flaw is that its pacing is simply too fast. While this partially lends to the steady flow of its action it also pushes much of its humor flat on its face, stunts character development, and affects believability by skipping explanations. That's really it, but I'll go in depth for those wondering exactly what this affects.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, most of the jokes are centered around the loli characters and how Rentaro does a great job of (unintentionally) making a lot of them develop crushes on him. Not all of these jokes are inherently bad but the quick pacing means that these jokes often come shortly after serious scenes. I had to stop at least once when a touching scene was bulldozed by a poorly placed joke just to be forgotten by all characters involved. On the other hand there isn't much fanservice outside of these jokes (and these jokes aren't frequent either) leaving things balanced to those who can get past them.\\n\\n\r\nIt does lead to another one of Black Bullet's flaws though; character development outside of the main duo is quite low and many backstories are explained in seconds. This isn't helped by how oblivious most of them are to the joke scenes. Instead of making you think \"oh, so that scene wasn't serious\" they'll often make you think \"wow, that character is an idiot\" thanks to this combination. Even worse is the fact that many of them are implied to have super-human abilities (a rather common thing in Black Bullet, even outside of the child soldiers) but many characters don't so much as have their abilities discussed (with even less having their abilities explained well). It does come off as the sort of thing that is usually left to the viewers to fill in the blanks, but given how often these super-powers are relied on it does tug at the story's believability when so little of it is explained.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the plot is rushed at points (especially during the last arc). Many plot elements are given little to no explanation and there's a few lampshades to be had. Sadly it all falls back to a lack of backstory for most of the characters, as most of these plot elements involve specific side characters that receive far less attention than their importance to the plot warrants. This affects the ending as well since it takes the time to set up for a continuation that seems quite unlikely at this point. At the very least the main plot points are resolved and the final scene is well done.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Black Bullet might have its problems, and many of them are glaring, but the things it does right are quite great. Its problems keep it from being easily recommendable though. It's the sort of show that you watch when you have nothing else planned at the moment, and only because you had a sudden urge to try it out. Then again pacing is really its biggest issue, so if you can get past that you shouldn't have much trouble finding some sort of enjoyment here.",

            "content": "Black Bullet in my opinion is very similar to Attack on Titan.  It takes place in a post apocalyptic future where earth has been overrun by mutated creatures called Gastrea.  Humanity survives by fortifying each major city with these massive Monoliths that repel the Gastrea and keep the population safe to an extent.  Occasionally Gastrea will break through the barrier in which Civil Agents\" are dispatched to defend the population.  There is a bit more to the story but that's the basic premise.\r\nSo if you liked AoT you may enjoy BB as well.  It has the same tone as AoT,lots of action mixed with a decent amount of drama and tragedy.  I say \"may enjoy\" because, being that its an adaptation of a light novel into a 13 episode anime, you may find the pacing a bit off as well as parts of the story a bit underdeveloped.   If you're not too critical though and just enjoy the roller coaster of \"feels\", you'll find BB enjoyable.\\n\r\nAll in all BB I would rate a 7/10 across the board. Sound, art, character design, story were all slightly above average.  Nothing ground breaking but done well enough that I didn't feel I wished they had done certain things better.  I can forgive the pacing/under development of story as this could have easily been remedied if it was given a longer run.   So overall, an enjoyable anime if like the serious action packed, drama tragedy type anime.",

The romance in this anime it felt quite forced i guess, yeah the girl's are cute but i just felt it was forced. Oh yeah at then end in my opinion it doesn't make anysense at all, i don't want to spoil it, but just watch it if you're curious.\\n\\n\r\nsometime some scene is quite predictable, i think. If i'm going to guess the LN is much more better than the anime isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nSome episode felt quite rushed, Rentarou who should be the mc has no character development, wait no ALL OF THEM! has no character development, many of the episode is cheesy and lame.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story and the character i'm going to give them a 7 and a 6\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is good i guess, even though there's a lot of cliche stuff and thing's the story is quite good, not the best but still enjoyable to watch. The OP quite like it, the ending maybe a little bit. but overall i'm going to give Black Bullet \\n\\n\r\n7/10",

The world that was created by Black Bullet's author seemed interesting but in the end i felt that the idea could've been much more exploited. The biggest disappointment in this anime for me was unstable and illogical narration of characters. In single moment one's personality was changed by 180 degrees so i couldn't find any real connection with any of main characters. Maybe that was purposeful effect to show how ppl will act in world after \"apocalipse\" but it didn't feel like it. \r\nOnly ending theme and Kisara motivated me to watchuntill the end, because she was one shiny star in world full of loli. Maybe i just don't like loli so that's propably what killed all fun for me and that's a shame, cause like i said world's foundation seemed promising.",

            "content": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\r\nFirst impressions:\r\nSo Black Bullet\u2026 we\u2019ve got monsters and we\u2019ve got people trapped in the walled off city. Does any of these things ring a bell? No? Ok.\r\nStory 4/10:\r\nSo Black Bullet. The premise of Black Bullet to me seems like they just copied and pasted elements from other shows- cough attack on titan cough blue gender. Basically, there is a virus that turns people into monsters and what\u2019s left of humanity is in a walled off city. \r\nSo one problem I had with this show right off the bat is the setting it takes place in. The world the story takesplace in paints this epic picture of where humanity is close to extinction and every day is a fight for survival. There is a virus that turns people into monsters that are \"apparently \u201c beyond human imagination because it seems that giant moths and spiders are apparently beyond human imagination, that kill other people.  Humanity\u2019s only hope is the brave warriors that fight these monsters every day.\\n\r\nNow probably judging from what I have said about the world this takes place in, you\u2019re probably thinking to yourself, \u201cwhy is this a problem for me?\u201d. Well if you have asked yourself that question then I will tell you. Because while watching this show I never saw any actual survival going on. Despite how the monsters are apparently this huge danger to humanity and have killed off most of the human population everything in this world seems to be like our world except for the virus that turns people into monster. What's left of the human race is now living in walled off city going about life like nothing ever changed. There are even schools and shops that are open that people go to. You are probably going to argue \u201cwell the schools are there to train those you will fight the monsters right?\u201d. Well if you thought that then I am sorry to tell you that you are wrong. They\u2019re just normal schools. Because that's what we need in our post-apocalyptic setting\u2026 schools. So basically it is just another light novel version of a post apocalypse.\\n\r\nAnother problem I had with this is show is that it couldn't seem to keep a consistent tone going. For example, the tone of this show seems to swing back and forth from dark and edgy, to school life to fan service with little girls- and yes you did read right. Fan service with little girls trying to get on the main character\u2019s D.\\n\r\nOne thing I did find funny  was this shows attempt to be mature and taken seriously with the whole concept of super loli discrimination. Despite the reason for the super loli discrimination being very forced and seems only to be used for shock factor. It also is used to make the protagonist look like a hero who treats his super lolis with love and respect while the rest of society tries to kill them every chance they get, even though the only reason they are still alive is because they\u2019re super lolis. \\n\r\nWait\u2026 so what you\u2019re telling me that these people are pretty much throwing away their only hope of survival? They must be very dumb to do that. I mean assume that these people were actually trying to survive, you would think that they would try and figure out exactly what would help them survive. It is like if an army person were to throw away his gun in the middle of a fire fight.\\n\r\nBut of course we can't have actual good writing; rather, we have to make sure that these little girls are victims and suffer.\\n\r\nNow If you\u2019re wondering about the actual storyline and what not, it\u2019s pretty generic and unoriginal. It basically boils down to shit happens and main character has to fix it. And there is some sort of government conspiracy that you don't give a fuck about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10:\\n\r\nThe main character is pretty much a passive bland character that has nothing interesting and the only thing that makes him different from the rest of the character is that he is nice to his lolis and tries to make the world a better place for his super loli harem. Even though he not really trying that hard to do that.\\n\r\nThe side characters are very bland and nothing interesting about. They are pretty much cardboard cutouts of light novel stereo types. Which aren't even that good any way.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10:\\n\r\nNow, for the most part, the animation was fine. But this show had some very bad CG animated scenes. The backgrounds look pretty cool but that was about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 4/10:\\n\r\nThe OST for this is very forgetable.  It's OP also rip-offs Attack on Titan\u2019s OP, for some reason. The OST was done by Shiro Sagisu who worked on Attack on Titan, Berserk Golden Age movies, and Bleach.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10:\\n\r\nThe only thing I enjoyed about it was the loli discrimination thing. This is like racism to lolis which I found quite funny at times. I am like \u201coh this is racism towards lolis, I never thought that could happen but it did\u201d. Despite the fact, that the reason for this was very forced and superficial.\\n\\n\r\nOverall  4/10:\\n\r\nSo overall, if you are a loli-con or some kind of pedo then this is the anime for you. However, if you looking for a good post-apocalyptic show then you won't find it here.",

Turns out there really wasn't much of one. The story started out strong, then felt like it got rushed at the end. I have no idea why this isn't labeled as a harem on this site because literally EVERY female character had some weird obsession for Satomi. Personally this took away so much potential from the anime seeing as how half of these admirers are like 10 year old girls. Towards the end there were irrelevantcharacters brought in, and Kisara had just a shitty change of heart that made no sense at all.\\n\\n\r\nFavorite Character: Tina Sprout\\n\r\nWhile I wasn't a fan of the whole underage girl liking this older guy thing, I did think that when Tina had action she was bad ass.",

            "content": "I'm a big fan of Attack on Titan and wanted a similar show with the same kind of characters and action that I found in Attack. In the recommendation page it suggested this one and so I decided to watch it since it was only 13 episodes and just might give me a quick fix.\r\nMUSIC:\r\nI really liked the opening and closing songs, they each went pretty well with the action and got me pumped up to watch the show. The song from the opening was just about the same song as the one from Attack on Titan (which may explain why I liked it). Overallthough, the opening and closing did fit with the action and and a few good songs throughout the episodes depending on the emotions of the characters so Music in my opinion was great.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nThe main character Rentaro was done by the same voice actor as Eren in Attack on Titan. Although I do really like Attack on Titan, I've had some friends tell me they thought he was a little to whiny and cried a lot so when he plays a similar character in another Sci-Fi anime and can't help but agree with him about this voice. Other then him he does manage to get a band of misfits together as the show progresses but you don't get to know to much about the characters in general. Character development is definitely lacking. However I do still like some of the characters that come up, some are pretty creepy, maybe they should have taken a bit more an impact in the story.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of anime's that do amazing things in 13 episodes, the story brings together the characters and makes you want to know what happens next. In this anime the suspense wasn't really built up and it was quite predictable. As I said before, the characters didn't develop and the story did not really affect that much at all. The premise to the show was interesting, it had a lot of potential but the story needed a bit of work in a few areas to make it go from a 7 to a 9. I did still finish the whole anime so I wouldn't exactly say it wasn't entertaining at all. I wanted action, I got it, the plot was simple but it made sense (for the most part). You won't get to invested in the story, if you had then there would be a second season.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nArt was one of the strong points in the show, I really like the colours. It was kind of dark and colourful. If there was a bit of other supporting characteristics about the anime to help out then I feel like the art would have been better. Overall the animation was great and I found it pleasing show to watch. \\n\\n",

Even if you find fan service to be a selling point for a show, this would still fail to provide anything of substance for you. \r\nThepacing is insufferable.

When I first say the preview I thought this post apocalyptic world was going to be  a great setting for an anime. The problem with the anime was it's pacing of the anime it was just awfully done. They throw so much info and story on you in just the couple episodes that you'll be thinking the show is only a 3 episode anime. Then comes the characters. The charactersI thought were awful. You got the generic tsundere anime loli that is in love with the MC. The MC is one of those doesn't look that strong but in reality he is one of the strongest soldiers in the world. Story wise the show had a interesting plot but the problem was everything felt rushed and pushed on the watcher. The ending of the anime made zero sense to me and I tried to pay attention to the show but I still felt the ending was such a waste. I will say I would of enjoyed it a little bit more if it wasn't for the terrible ending. All in all Black Bullet was just another watch once and never talk about it again anime that I will  probably won't watch again.",

All this series may have some similarities, like most of them taking place at high school, but at the end, they have their own stories. This decade we got more anime based in light novels than manga, and they are all the same. Not all, ok, but most of them are, the same generic fantasy setting, harem story. The formula worked with Sword Art Online, and like eveything it proves to work, it didn't take toolong to start to appear the rip-offs and knock-offs. Black bullet is one of them.\\n\r\n\u00bfMale protagonist supposed to be a loser, but end up being a Marty Stu, because he always saves the day? Check.\\n\r\n\u00bfEvery female character in the show want to be with him, even if some of them are little girls? Check, and yeah, many people find it gross, that's why this show has so bad the reviews. It get more popular for what somepeople called loli fanservice, than the plot. That's not a lolicon, and thak god it doesn't has fanservice scenes with every episode showing little girls' panties, but anyway...japanese people may find cute a little girl who says she loves someone older, western people, not.\\n\r\nJust forget about what everybody else talks, and focus and something important tahat nobody said: this show try to made a social criticism, using superpowered kids as a metaphor of oppresion. Try, but it works? In the first episodes only, then the harem and Marty Stu takes over and people, obviously, get bored. The interest aspects about the setting doesn't have the attention it should get in the story.\\n\r\nCharacters are other problem. Let's see:\\n\r\n-Rentaro, our protagonist, is the generic Marty Stu protagonist. It's supposed to be a loser, but he success in everything he does. All the girls in the show are there to be his love interest, even the ones who hasn't reach puberty. Even the villain admire him, and end up fighting by his side.\\n\r\n-The harem. Girls who want to be with him. Every girl in this show, even a class of girls Rentaro teach. Enough said. Just the scientist menage to not be there, and even her has her moments.\\n\r\n-Characters who are against Rentarou thinks is right that end up two ways: being pathetic villains and dying soon, or joining Rentarou's side, and admiting they were wrong and Rentarou is one of the best ones they've ever met. What a surprise.\\n\r\nAlso, there are moments so out of character that came from nowhere that you can't believe, specially one in the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nSo, this is what we got. If it has a 6 instead 5 or 4 is because the music, the art, some exciting fight scenes, and some funny or warning moment in the first half.",

            "content": "I often wonder why, where, and what the hell did I just see?  Sometimes using a portion of wasted neurons is useful when reviewing a series that absolutely has no idea what it\u2019s suppose to be.  Mind you a set protagonist that acts as much righteous as Rush Limbaugh role-playing as King Arthur with the one exception:  Hiruko, who the whole franchise could\u2019ve been about, but let\u2019s be thankful of where we are.  \r\nIf someone told me, \u201cHey do you like your Guilty Crown and other anime we totally aren\u2019t ripping off, than how about this one.  It\u2019s a storyabout a male protagonist who has to fight stuff and you just fell asleep.\u201d  Being generic isn\u2019t so much a bad thing if the writers boldly know how to both create an effective story and interesting characters behind such a ploy.  But let\u2019s go over it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story goes like this:  Humanity is going to war with a terrible threat meaning humanity is also on the brink of extinction mind you, a hitherto enemy known as Gastrea.  Two Wars with the Gastrea already happened off camera so where.  Also the story takes place in Neo-Tokyo where the residents have walled themselves off with a material called Varanium and constructed Monoliths that ward off the Gastrea.  \\n\\n\r\nMain character is Satomi Rentaro who is generic teen male fighter and righteous hero of the PEOPLE!  To be honest, most of the characters aren\u2019t really interesting for the most part.  They all take some token presence and bait for the audience to both feel secure and idyllic.  The only character I can ever approve of is Hiruko the foil to Rentaro, who seems to be the only one who\u2019s not brooding serious, or intense serious, or dumb-righteous seriousness (Rentaro what the f**k).  Hiruko could have been the main character of the story because he\u2019s cool without the tone of desperation to be such and such for shallow approval.  And to enlighten on that desperation, I\u2019m going to call it \u201cSimplistic Obligatory Writing\u201d.  It\u2019s when characters for no discernible reasoning become total cocks because they have to.  Now in some cases this makes but in most it just doesn\u2019t.  Sure there\u2019s build up but what to?  What has the character learned from it and why is it in the story?  It\u2019s for the delusion of \u201cCharacter growth\u201d but in the end it makes no sense and makes the characters unlikable.  \\n\\n\r\nNow the story is offset at the end when you realize that the show doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s suppose to be or it\u2019s inconsistent tone.  This is marred by multiple tones ranging from Slice of Life relaxation, to whimsical silliness, to brooding seriousness etc. etc.  \\n\\n\r\nThe anime isn\u2019t so bad that writing this review has taken a few bricks from my load, but that\u2019s like saying the \"Internship\" wasn\u2019t so bad that I got eat some popcorn with it.  You can almost feel the general conflict of the anime, trying to be both fun and dark-seriousness, which is like having it's cake and eating it too, leading to being baked in mother's 'boiling' love oven. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end I\u2019m very tired and feel very awful from this experience, but if you\u2019re the kind that enjoys some nice action, Black Bullet has some of that as well.  Especially me as I painfully cut its every smug, contemptuous limb with a hack saw.\\n",

            "content": "Whenever a show becomes hyped, I always feel a bit reluctant about watching it since hyped shows have a good deal of disappointment following them.  Today, I show that I had high hopes for, Black Bullet.  A show about lolis, infections, varanium, and confusion.  \r\nStory (5.02/10):  In a post apocalyptic universe, humanity is put on the brink of extinction.  A deadly virus known as the Gastrea virus has taken over the world, infecting the world's population, forcing what is left of humanity within these small areas surrounded by walls made of Varanium, a metal with the capability to repel anddestroy these creatures.  The only solution to save the world is through the use of cursed children, small female children that are born with the Gastrea virus inside of them.  It is in this world where our main protagonist Satomi Rentaro, a civil officer, must try and defeat the Gastrea before it's too late.\\n\\n\r\nNow...to me, the first thing I can think of when it comes to plot idea is Attack on Titan.  Humanity on its last legs, civilizations surrounded by walls that keep the threat out, only one real way to kill their enemy, and the last hope being a combination of human and something else.  Yeah, sounds like attack on titan to me.  When watching this show, I found it to be a strange combination of both Attack on Titan, and Sword art Online.  \\n\\n\r\nThe series in my opinion had a great opening episode.  In the first episode, it explained everything in a timely and orderly manner, essentially giving a proper exposition for everything which I felt was a very good opening to it, as it explained not only characters, but practically every concept that the show has in it.  The show also had a decent amount of comedy and fun moments to it, some of which are actually quite memorable.  However, this alone wasn't enough to save the show from its many defective properties.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many flaws that I find about this series.  For one thing, there seemed to be a lack of cohesion for the series.  The story for the series had a very arc heavy set up where you could clearly see going from episode to episode if you were in one arc or another.  It's not bad for any series to do an arc heavy story, but what made it feel awkward was the fact that the series sort of immediately switched to a new story with the next episode, leaving quite a few answers to be yet to be answered.  It felt like SAO in a way, with the first three episodes being quite a well made story, and the rest being somewhat below average in terms of quality.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that felt weird was the fact that the series sort of made a lot of loose ends.  A lot of loose ends.  Every few episodes, there was something that was left unexplained.  Be it an event that was unexplained, an object whose purpose was left untold, or the fate of a character, nothing really felt explained, and there were many gaping plot holes that persisted throughout the series.  \\n\\n\r\nBut above all, one thing was bothering me the most in the entire series.  And that is, where are the Gastrea?  The Gastrea, the antagonists of the series, and the main reason why people are forced to live in these restricted areas, the only reason why the cursed children and civil officers exist, and the reason for basically everything in the series, only really show up as a threat a total of two times in the series.  While the parts about the Gastrea I felt were well executed in terms of how well the story of that particular part was told, most of the series doesn't even concern them, and I even forgot about their existence while watching the show.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Black Bullet had a hard time of telling people what it was.  It had both elements of character driven, and plot driven story, which for the most part, just does not work.  Above all, with all of the massive plot holes, lack of a proper antagonist to act as the true enemy of the series, and focusing too much on areas of story that didn't feel like it should've gotten as much screen time as it should have, I felt as though black bullet was a complete mess regardless of how great I felt the opening episode was in terms of providing proper exposition.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Fantastic opening episode\\n\r\n-   Massive, massive plot holes\\n\r\n-   Lack of antagonist's existence\\n\r\n-   Lack of Story cohesion\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5.89/10): For characters, well, we have a mixed bag.  Some characters are quite good, while some are well...terrible.  \\n\\n\r\nSatomi Rentaro, our main protagonist.  Rentaro has a hatred against the Gastrea.  When he was a kid, his parents were killed in the great Gastrea war and ever since, he has sworn to kill all of the Gastrea.  To me, this sounds like Eren Jaegar.  (They even have the same voice actor)  Rentaro is more or less your average main protagonist in an action anime.  Not only is he obsessed with his goal, he also gets quite reckless and angry.  Aside from having a moral side towards the cursed children, there's not really much to him.  The series tries to make Rentaro more than what he is, and it works somewhat well, but for the most part, that's his character.  Although, he does use a handgun as a weapon, which fires varanium bullets, aka, Black Bullets.  \\n\\n\r\nAihara Enju, a cursed child and the main female protagonist in the series.  Enju is pretty much what you would expect for a 10 year child character.  She has a very endearing and adorable personality, being quite outgoing and happy most of the time.  All the while, having affections towards Rentaro, to the point of self appointing her to be his bride.  As a cursed child, she has immensely increased physical capacity, being a rabbit model initiator.  Basically, that means that she has the ability to kick ass through the use of kicking things in the face.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then, we have Tina Sprout, a cursed child that is an owl model initiator.  Essentially, it means that she has the ability to see far and extremely clear at night.  While she is considered to be a main character, she doesn't actually appear in the series until about halfway through the series, she doesn't really serve much plot importance, and more or less, is sort of just another character that impacts Rentaro in her own way.\\n\\n\r\nAnother character I want to mention is Tendo Kisara.  Kisara is more or less the Misaka of the series, though not as perfect and not as badass or willing to give her life to the main protagonist.  In the series, she has faced a situation similar to Rentaro, seeking revenge on the Gastrea that had killed her parents.  For the most part, she's a decent character, until the last episode.  In the last episode, she gained this...characteristic, which felt quite odd and sort of uneeded actually.  It was a real dent in her character I felt, and personally, I felt like she shouldn't have gotten that one trait at the end.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from the characters mentioned above, we have a ton of supporting characters, a great deal of them lacking of really any importance.  What I feel is the biggest flaw in terms of characters is the fact that there are side characters that just show up out of nowhere.  They sort of just insert them into the story and just assume that you're ok with it.  Personally, I found this to be quite distracting, as many of the side characters felt more like a distraction or a means to just add in more unnecessary people.  \\n\\n\r\nOut of the characters, I felt that the actual antagonists of the series were muddled and unclear.  Aside from the Gastrea, we have Kagetane, a character whom I thought was actually a good antagonist.  While he was a decent antagonist, he didn't get as much screen time as I thought he would receive, so, as a result, he didn't become as detailed as I had hoped.  Apart from these two, we have a bunch of \"antagonists\".  I say that because of the fact that most of them seem quite pointless to see as bad guys, since more or less, they only show up for only one episode, and their evil plot seemed less than extraordinary.  (One example is Yasuwaki Takuto, whom I felt was an absolutely useless character to even put in.)\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing the series did was wrong I felt, was character deaths.  In this series, several characters perish, all of them supposedly to have significance on our main character.  While I did feel sad about their disappearance from the series, for the most part, since all of them were of characters you barely even get to know or understand, I felt as though they had little to no significance in the overall plot. \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Decent main characters\\n\r\n-   Lack of proper antagonist\\n\r\n-   Too many pointless side characters\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.77/10 and 8.33/10):  While the story and characters were fairly disappointing, the art of the series was quite well made overall.  While it did rely on a moe artstyle, a style that not everyone likes, it did do rather well.  The backgrounds were fairly well detailed, and the characters were well designed.  \\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes were quite well animated and quite well done overall.  The animation was very fluid whenever the action scenes occurred and everything looked very good and helped with the overall show.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of music, this show has some very great music.  Black Bullet's Opening is addicting and fantastic.  It has a very rock and mysterious feel to it that fits with the show.  It is a very good opening and sounds incredibly well done.  For the show's ED, the track is good as well, although, a bit generic feeling.  Overall, the music for this show is fairly well done.  It's both memorable and well executed.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good character design\\n\r\n+  Memorable music\\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment (6.22/10):  I had high hopes for the show, as did many people.  It was an interesting enough plot that looked like it would create a good show.  At first, I was dazzled, surprised to see how deep the show was by creating an antagonist that played a sort of mind game that made me rethink the entire show's setting and ideas that were already put into place as the story began.  But, as time went on, I became more or less saddened by the lack of plot explanation.  \\n\\n\r\nBlack bullet has its problems.  It has a very large amount of plot problems as well as problems with adding in new characters.  Regardless of the problems though, I found Black Bullet to have its perks.  It has a good sense of freelance comedy that comes into play a good deal in the show as well as the fact that the show can be pretty good when it really wants to be.  In the end though, I can't really forgive this show for its massive plot holes and its overall flaws.  It wasn't a total mess, but Black Bullet did mess up on some things.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: (6.18/10)",

            "content": "Well I just finished Black Bullet, surprisingly it turned out better than I thought it would. The show had felt mediocre and I didn't think I would think too highly of it, though the last few episodes end up shining against the rest.\r\nFor most of the show things felt oddly pointless, characters seemed like they had their own personalities but they still felt a little flat. That is how the entire show felt, flat. Deaths felt like they had no meaning and were just sprinkles on your freezer burned ice cream. It was like the show saw how successful Attack on Titan was and decidedthat it was popular due to the deaths. So it introduced a character only to have them die within a few episodes. This formula was persistent through the entire show and it got bland. I did have to chuckle at the end when Rentaro is sobbing on Enju talking about starting to not be fazed by death as the entire show I wasn't too fazed. I just sat there going \"Why does it have to be the loli, why does it have to be the loli, why does it have to be the cool guy, why does it have to be the loli.\" Though I will say that a few deaths were executed well, but for the most part characters were introduced to be more cannon fodder for your emotions because \"oh my god they killed a kid\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of shows which have children dying, I mean Deadman Wonderland starts with a class being slaughtered (wow that totally didn't happen in Black Bullet off camera). Black Bullet feels like it see's the popularity of other shows and tries to mash it into their show. But this doesn't work if you can't execute it well. I will say that one thing they executed well was the characters that lost their sanity, they did a good job at portraying people that have seen the gates of Madness and have no care in the world.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere were also a few scenes which I genuinely got goosebumps at, mainly some of the scenes where amazing things or amazing shots happened. Like the scene towards the end about the festival that helps them in the battle. I also really enjoyed the scenes where kagetane appeared. He is the top hat guy with the bat shit crazy loli girl that is a mantis type.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHe is just a fun guy to watch that in a lot of ways I can relate to. He views the world as scummy and wants to rewrite parts of it. He wants to see a new world order and does it looking like a dapper gentleman. I don't want to rewrite things, but I am not content with society as it is and would like to change parts of it. Though I have come to accept that you cannot change things by yourself and will condone society temporarily because I am far to lazy to campaign for change. I realize I just slightly contradicted myself but it is simply how my brain works. I can make a change but I don't feel like it so I will condone something I see issues in simply because I am lazy. Though Kagetane isn't lazy, he acts and he is very good at playing mind games. Another feature I saw is his love to flaunt his power, that is something I enjoy doing when the situation permits it. For the most part I don't flaunt such things around because I have no desire for people to see how much I can do; that simply means more publicity and more hassle which I want to avoid for now.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHonestly the show doesn't have a ton to root for other than its somewhat heart of darkness esque look at things. Heart of Darkness is about thinking you are doing something good when really you are the evil. This was explored from a military point of view in Spec Ops the Line, really recommend the game. But certain characters feel like they come to this realization and other characters feel like they are teetering and don't know what is right.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI ussually introduce a bunch of characters but really with a show full of people dying why would I, they would just die suddenly because I said \"Hey I like this character\". I will say that other than Kagetane I have two characters I liked a fair amount.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTina Sprout\\n\\n\\n\r\nA cute loli character that during her \"arc\" she has some very funny scenes and she is someone that has seen death all around her and has come to reconcile with it. She is fine with it all so long as she could carry out her goals, but that changes and she learns to love. She is probably the most mature character on the show and she is like 10. Also she is really cute, has a nice dress, has cool arm things, leggings, a sniper, really good eyesight. I just really like her character, and how cute she is. I love my lolis and this is a girl that made it into my top 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSumire Muroto\\n\\n\\n\r\nShe is a scientist that has a funny sense of humor. She accuses Rentaro of being a lolicon and nearly convinces Tina that he is amassing a loli harem. It is quite funny to see, she seems to be the only character aware of the show she is in and nearly breaks the fourth wall all the time. Her voice is also nice, it is the voice of someone that has seen it all and is only mildly intrigued by things that others will be exceedingly energetic about yelling, screaming, etc. In most scenes she reminds me of The earl of pudding (Lloyd Asplund) from Code Geass. Though he was a little more energetic especially when his work was threatened. They both remain calm in the face of destruction and death; true Sociopaths. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show was above average when you factor in some good characters and some good scenes and really should be a show you save for a rainy day as there isn't much the show accomplishes that isn't done much better in other places. Well except if you want harems of loli's, then you should go watch Fate/Kalied (ha you thought I would say this show excels in some regard, fucking pleb tier bullshit). \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 6 (the show as a whole looked ok, but the Gastrea had really bad CGI for a lot of scenes)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7 (again the show had some good character but most had less character than the cardboard cutouts of race car drivers at gas stations)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 (surprisingly the show did good with the opening, ending and general background songs. Though many songs felt cliche because songs like it are always used to make scenes more badass)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 (i felt meh about the show for the most part, with cetain characters bringing a smile to may face, but I wasn't loving any characters; except for you Tina, you get a pass)\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 (watch this for your rainy days or loli pleasure if you exhausted other better shows, this will get you to to the next one piece episode most likely)",

So I watched this anime the same year it came out but for some reason had it on hold. Looking for a time killer, I watched it. \r\nSlight spoiler ahead fyi but it honestly wouldn't give out much because that's how unclimatic everything was.\r\nSo the premise of the story was great, cursed children born with monster powers, defeat monsters, lolis, cool. But then the story was all over the place. The characters had no depth to them even up until the end, and somany of them lacked the purpose of being there at all. Like towards the end of the anime, a bunch of characters was introduced to... not be developed at all? Like there was no purpose to them except that they were there to help fight. That was it. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then later bad guy turns good for no reason while good girl turns bad, questions of how the main loli girl is not turning into a monster remains, and why the bad guy who turned good is still alive, like none of these are answered. They just kinda throw things out there and be like, \"Oh yeah. About that, don't worry man, just watch the loli's\". Like bro, there is only so much loli's can cover. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the gaping plot holes in this series, I personally think the lack of character in the characters themselves played a big part in why this series was such a flop. They all had one purpose and one person only and existed for that one thing. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the unnecessary death of kinda a lot of people left you thinking \"but like why?\". For example, the death of a character at the end of a series kinda left you dumbfounded because you didn't really feel bad for the character since they didn't develop him at all into the story but at the same time you think, \"oh man that sucks\".\\n\\n\r\nIt's a great time killer if you want to see some action/shooting scenes + cute loli's but if you're looking for actual plot and characters, I recommend finding another anime.",

            "content": "Are you kidding me with this fucking series man? Like I could literally only get 4 episodes in cause it was that bad. It's nothing but a fucking magnet for people who are obsessed with lollis, that\u2019s literally this whole show. The story's shitty the characters are random as shit the fucking world these writers throw you into is not explained in the slightest. Let me get into a little detail, cause I actually only watched 4 episodes before I decided it was enough. Bright animation isn't enough to keep me watching. (If I state questions our shit that gets resolved in later episodes myapologies)\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nIt's some ass. It's so damn clich\u00e9 oh big monsters took over the world and the bad guy is trying to harvest or use them to take over or destroy the world or whatever and he wants the main guy to help for some unbeknown reason besides oh you interested me. Why the fuck did he interest you, how in gods name could this copy and paste main character from an early 2000's shonen jump anime interest you. The first and second episode are both absolutely pointless they're there to attempt to get you to care for these characters which no one does nor will you ever and to provide as little and as vague as a background for our two mc's so they can throw in what ever the hell they want to later. It's dick butt 2/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n Our main characters are like this, the guy's apparently a like super badass half robot or some shit which we don't find out till episode three or four after he's fought the bad guy two other times already. Like why'd it take you so long to start using your robo limbs man, homies fucking died like he had them in both the fights with this obviously really powerful guy this point just really pissed me off so I'm gonna leave it at that. But robo arm man..robo arm. Now what about the girl well this is a bad example since this show isn't very popular not is it exceptionally good either but if you've ever seen a dark rabbit has seven lives she's essentially haruka. All up on the guys dick, oh blah blah I'm gonna marry you blah blah I love you blah blah shoot me in the woods blah blah surprise kiss blah blah. She's cute don't get me wrong (but the girls in a dark rabbit has seven lifes are way fucking better himea for life dogs). Oh and the one bitch with like clean cut tipped hair or whatever is literally *Insert abusive childhood friend that actually likes MC here*. The bad guy has a mask and reminds me of Pegasus from yugiyo for no reason in particular. The white haired girls super cute. That\u2019s all. Fuck the rest. Actually even fuck these. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nThe fighting is actually pretty sweet. Well the 15 seconds of the fighting is pretty sweet. Cause all the fights are dumb short or not shown. Ending in a bullet or two and maybe even a kick or a punch. The art's kinda nice I guess its what you'd expect of a lot of recent animation bright but like glooming and dark at the same time it's strange if you're up to date with RE you understand what I mean. 6/10\\n\\n\r\n Overall\\n\r\nAll in all this show is straight dick n balls in a can. The fact it has a 7.5 makes me want to jump infront of a speeding train legs first so my legs break as I get flung into the water below where I'll drown slowly being unable to swim cause of my broken legs. I've tried rewatching it on multiple occasions and each and every time I try to revisit I always forgot why I stopped watching it, then I see the ferst episode and remember. 4 episodes is the farthest I've gotten and the farthest I ever will thank you very much. Eat a Dick. 3/10",

Imagine Attack on Titan where they actually explained shit. This review will contain minor spoilers but will not ruin the show for you.\r\nStory: Mankind it on its last leg fighting off literally giant ass bugs. However the only two things that can cause harm to them are (1) a rare metal and (2) female children infected with the virus. Hence why it is very much a harem for the MC. \r\nArt/Sound: The artwork for this anime is visually stunning.When my friends ask for a good harem, this is in my recommendation. The artwork and sound track is very good considering the type of anime it is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: In 12 episodes, there is only so much character development that can be done. But every character in this show has a role that they successfully fulfill. And you can see them slowly growing over the course of the show but sadly no second season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: I describe this show as if they explain what the hell happened in Attack on Titan but as a harem and less dramatic. It is a good show, underrated but good none the less. If you enjoyed this show, watch God Eater next.",

            "content": "The premise for this show was really good, but it failed to follow through and didn't end on a strong note.\r\n=== ART/SOUND ===\r\nThe art and animation were okay, nothing really popped for me, but there wasn't anything distractingly bad.\r\nSound was fine as well. The soundtrack does a decent job of setting a mood, but isn't especially memorable (except for the ending song, which is *amazing*). The opening is kinda generic as well.\r\n=== CHARACTERS ===\r\nThe characters are fairly flat and cliche, but the main focus of the show was on the plot and the world around them, so this didn't bother me too much. It wouldhave been nice to have better written characters, but didn't really defeat the purpose of the show.\\n\\n\r\n=== STORY ===\\n\r\nThe story starts out interesting. I'm a fan of post-apocalyptic sci-fi, so I liked it initially. The first half of the show is set up to be a thriller-mystery (when the viewer knows what the bad guy is doing but the characters don't). That basically covers the first plot arc.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, the show didn't amaze me, but I was enjoying it enough to keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nFor the second half of the show, a whole plethora of undeveloped characters are suddenly thrown together to help save the city from destruction. At this point, the plot started lacking any kind of suspense, with a climax that was underwhelming. The whole second half just felt like filler to an ending that suggested a 2nd season, that doesn't (and never will) exist.\\n\\n\r\n============\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show was a fairly generic, front-loaded action anime, that didn't deliver a solid ending. If there was a second season, I'd probably watch a few episodes out of curiosity, but a second season is unlikely and the first season really isn't enough to warrant a watch for itself.",

You know those \"Started awesome but the second half feels rushed, like REALLY FULL SPEED RUSH anime\" well this is sadly one of those, the first half (up to ep 7 or so) its a 9/10, it throws you little cliffhangers here and there, a lot of stuff that you can think about, its totally enjoyable... but then the second half starts... it absolutely feelslike the people in charge of the adaptation thought this was gonna be a 20+ep anime and where \"surprised\" half-way thru it....

            "content": "Black Bullet. An anime that shows a black bullet, like once. In the first or second episode. And never again. No more black bullets in Black Bullet.\r\n-Overall\r\nThe story of Black Bullet is average. It's straightforward, which isn't necessarily bad. However, something that degrades the score for story is that the main character, like in many action anime, develops this \"immune\" status. The main character, Rentaro, is so \"at the center of the show\" and is so good at fighting, that the audience starts to believe that Rentaro is \"immune\" to the deadly fighting in the show. So, this sort of belief will remove the audiencefrom the action, since we all know that Rentaro will win in the end. Moving on, the art seems above average. It's a lot shinier than other 2014 anime, and it, honestly, looks better than contemporary anime. Can't beat No Game No Life's art though. Don't know if anything can. Ok... getting back on track...\\n\r\nThe sound is average, but the characters are flat and boring. They all fit into different action-anime-character tropes/archetypes. Their back-stories are unique, but their behavior, as well as beliefs, have all been seen before multiple times. That said, I still enjoyed this anime a good deal, and I'll be keeping my eye out for a season 2. Crossing my fingers!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 6.6\\n\r\nIt's fair enough, nearly good. Although in my mind the show deserves a 7. Well, rounded, 6.6 is 7 so...\\n\r\nMore details down below:\\n\\n\r\n-Story\\n\r\nThe story is decent enough. The plot, for the most part, is pretty good and not completely predictable. The action is flashy and looks nice. The fighting is well choreographed, but never too immersive. This is because, over the course of the show, Rentaro develops this \"immortal status\" that, unfortunately, develops for most action-anime protagonists. The \"immortal status\" is when a character wins so many fights, is so good at winning, that we, as the audience, stop believing that this guy can lose. While at times, building the \"immortal status\" is great for plot twists, it doesn't really suit a straightforward plot like the one in Black Bullet. Because we know that Rentaro cannot die, the action does lose it's luster. But, it's not a bad story, and the action is good.\\n\\n\r\n-Art\\n\r\nThe visual quality seems somewhat better than contemporary works. It's shinier, and the effects look digitally added instead of hand drawn, (which most shows don't do anymore anyways) making things like blurred backgrounds look very refined.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound\\n\r\nThe sound is standard. The opening/ending and the soundtracks are pretty average, and the voices, while not bad, aren't amazing either. \\n\\n\r\n-Character\\n\r\nFor the most part, the characters are flat as a piece of paper. They have little dimension. However, it IS an action anime, so I guess it's not unexpected. The character's back-stories are interesting, but they all act like one archetype or another. Satomi Rentaro is the stereotypical hero. He's emotional, stronk, selfless, full of justice, nice, and cheesy as all hell. Enju is... just boring. She doesn't really follow an archetype, the closest one she gets to is \"annoying companion.\" 49% of the time she opens her mouth, it's to declare that she will marry Rentaro or something along those lines. Another 49% of the time she talks, it's to \"scare\" off \"competition\" like Kisara. 1% of the time she says something normal and the remaining 1% is when she says something actually serious. The comedy is bland, and funny things just go and ruin the mood of the dark premise. Kisara for most of the series is just \"childhood friend/crush\" and the other characters aren't much better. But, this is all normal for an action anime, which focuses more on action than deep characters/story. So I'll give character a 4 instead of 3.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment\\n\r\nDespite all the negative stuff I said in the character section, I still enjoyed this anime. While I laughed my head off because of all the cheesy lines the characters had, the action was entertaining and the show was alright. Although it wasn't even close to my two favorites this season, (Woot Isshuukan Friends and No Game No Life all day every day) it was still fun to watch, and hey, it could've been way worse.",

Let's get to it:\r\n*Story*\r\nIt's good. I like the idea of having these troubled children that evolved to allow them to better combat the threat of having to live outside the walls, and then having these children trained for combat alongside a partnet. It's a good concept and it makes for a good anime. I found the story quite satysfying, although it's nothing special.\r\n*Art*\r\nThe anime looks really good, and has some really nice action scenes. The girls arecute and the protag looks cool. Not much more to say.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*Character*\\n\\n\r\nThis is kind of where the anime dies for me. I REALLY hate the whole lolicon theme going on, and the whole little girl coming on to the protag thing is a big turn-off. Most of the characters are also really bland, especially the girls who are all generic moe lolis.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment*\\n\\n\r\nI think I would have enjoyed this anime a lot more had the fun not been constantly interrupted with borderline pedophillic garbage constantly ripping me out of the immersion. I couldn't get into a good spree because I'd constantly have to skip or painfully suffer through lolicon romance.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that though I enjoyed it very much.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nBlack Bullet is a good anime that suffers from annoying lolicon fanservice and poor character arcs. The action is good and the premise is really interesting, and if you can ignore the annoying loli harem garbage, I think you will enjoy this anime quite a lot actually.",

            "content": "this anime was meh.\r\neverything about it was meh.\r\nit starts off pretty good, but then along the way, it got, you guessed it, meh. So let's talk about why it's meh.\r\n1. The characters had so much potential. They really did. They were all good characters, take or give, I mean some of them were the typical anime cliche, but what can you do. The thing is that, despite being good characters, the development and animating (figuratively speaking) of these characters succkk. It was like watching a show with really bad actors. \r\nI don't know how to explain it.... Let's see. Okay I got it. So themain character Kentaro.. He does this thing where when he gets upset and emotional, he like pins women to the floor, the wall, railings, ceilings, you name it. But the way he does it, it looks super fake, like an actor portraying a lover's role, but hating the actress he's working with. And don't even get me started on the random emotional  outburst. I swear, i didn't think i'll ever say that an anime character had \"bad acting\" but kentaro really proved to me there was a first for everything.\\n\\n\r\n2. Okay, you know when you're going on vacation, and you're packing everything you need, but you got lazy with the folding and stuff, so you just throw everything into the suitcase and end up with a curling iron encased in a cocoon of panties? This is basically the show. They have all these elements they wanted to add. but they just loosely tied it together, making a good story a pretty crappy one.  Sometimes, I felt like something was suppose to happen in episode 3, but they forgot so they jammed it into episode 7. It's just really unorganized.\\n\\n\r\n3. The fights scenes were pretty cool, so that's good.\\n\\n\r\n4. I'll give them the fact that they made me sad, but if you watched a show on killing innocent ten year old girls, I'm pretty sure you'll feel, at the least, bothered. I mean (spoiler alert) they literally bombed 20 girls. legit.\\n\\n\r\n5. The ending was pretty cool. I just wish they gave us more time to connect with the characters before they killed them off. I was left feeling awkward, because the music was playing, and kentaro was screaming \"NOOOOO\" all dramatically, but I didn't really feel much cause i met him like two episodes ago. Also ONE character developed, and it wasn't a total flop. (sort of spoiler) she went all batshit crazy, and turned all evil, and i thought the animator did a pretty good job portraying that the audience. But then the super cool ending was ruined because kentaro got super emotional on a subway, and graced me his superb acting. (seriously, it was awful. you will understand it once you see it. like i know it was suppose to be touching, but ugh. really?)\\n\\n\r\n6. the older brother and little sister relationship was cute, and honestly the only reason why i finished this anime.\\n\\n\r\nidk man, the thing that disappointed me the most was that this show had so much potential to be a good show, but they went and fcked it up. the animation was good, the drawing, the idea, but they were unorganized about it, and the foundation was weak, resulting in a failed product.  \\n\\n\r\np.s. can we talk about how unorganized this review is. I literally have pro and cons all mashed up together, and look at me criticizing their organization LOL. well. I am not about to go back and change it because it's like 1 AM and i have classes tomorrow,. I have classes tomorrow and my dumb butt is up watching anime and writing reviews bashing them. don't be like me kids. but anyways i hope this review helped :-)",

            "content": "At first, I though Black Bullet would interesting....Then, I found that picking my nose was much more interesting.\r\nSTORY: The story sounds like this anime would be something epic. The world is in chaos and humanity is in quite the struggle, and their lives depend on the Cursed Children, little lolli girls who are capable of defeating the enemy. The story turns out good at times, but then falls short the next.\r\n6/10\r\nART: The artwork seemed interesting at first, but then I couldn't help but get thrown off by the fact that some of the characters had hair that looked like it had been chopped up paper.Some things stand out, but not to the point where it should get some honorable mention.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: You'd think that with this nice BGM and OST that the anime would be amazing, But you were wrong. Its as if the Soundtrack has more depth then the anime itself. But the music helps fit the mood, and the OP and ED are definitely some of the great this year in anime......SOME.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: The characters in this anime lack any depth. One minute you think you'll start to learn more about a character and why they are the way they are, and then the next it switches to the next scene immediately leaving you to frustrated to even care about the character. The only characters with depth are the Gastrea, the monsters that are hell bent on destroying humanity. Side note, you will meet the character Kisara, who is just boobs and Dreds....or dred like hair. Who seems to be promising, but then turns out to be.....boobs.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: The enjoyment I got from this anime was neutral. Its like having a bad experience in bed and regretting that you ever made that decision just because everyone else was talking about the person.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: I'll give it a 6 cause the action scenes are somewhat decent. And the BGM helps make the anime SEEM better than it really is.\\n\r\n6/10",

            "content": "Black Bullet. Interesting title with little to no intention in its name. It is sad to see an Anime with no real Story behind it, or lets say to have a proper storyline itself. \r\nImo, the flaws are not: Loli Harem, Bad Animation, Bad implementation.\r\nThe flaws are: Story Telling and specifically Characters. \r\nIm going to make it short because i want to sleep. \r\nFirst things of, the Story. It had no impact in itself and was not really are masterpiece in its telling. We had fragments put together to make it one story until you could get it into the end to make it awhole. Yet the fragments were either to big or it didnt fit in. Those were made to fit, which is sad. Some episodes of these, some episodes of that and the main focus in its telling is... it hasnt one. Predictability shouldnt be mentioned. People who read crime novels are practically reading the same, just with different patterns, so you cant use it as an argument for the story. The plot line was just weird, as you could follow it step by step but had full clue where it ended. There was nothing you wanted either to happen or to not happen. It was just there thrown in and you should be fine with it somehow. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound was nice and good to hear but a little bit standart in some scenes. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Art was not the worst. Sometimes it had some very nice elements of animation. Though it didnt really made you tear from your stool. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile getting in to find a good feeling for the characters, the anime was either too short, or as you can tell from above it didnt give out much for the watchers. Experiencing the pain of a child is always heavy to watch. Being lonely is one of the worst things that could happen to children but having someone watching over you feels heartwarming. The girls was standardly cute but also very dangerous. The side characters though didnt give me something to make me feel related nor should I be liking them somehow. Main Problem here is that you have too less time to give them a place in your heart. The side characters who fought with the MC were not really involving, in the way of his life because it was too fixated to MC's goals and MC's problem yet we have to kinda get used to them somehow. I wanted to know more about the professor for example, the children, MC's waifus etc. But they kinda were just there to begin with and MC worked for one of them.\\n\\n\r\nSpoilers ahead:\\n\\n\r\nIt also felt very forced to make Kisara Tendo being the villain after MC had to deal with the first villain and getting beaten up by Ayn Rand's little girl who then allies with MC who has been threaten by Ayn Rand to make us feels sorry somehow. They gave the \"feel-sorry-for-them\" factor waaay too much priority just because it was post-apocalyptic and people were way to paranoid. I still liked the MC and i shipped him with Kisara, even though it was not meant to be and MC was kinda edgy. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It wasnt a bad anime but with much more time in thinking about what should be let in or how much of something should be put in would be a very good idea to make future Anime like these great and enjoyable for all. It sometimes felt underwhelming to watch and i had to give it a shot after half a year. Good to make this experience though. 6/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut still as a side note; we can somehow learn from this Anime. Racism is a thing in it and MC tries (or atleast he tried somehow by beating up the bad guys) to give them a place in the world. The girls were different and they never stood a chance to get a life of a normal born Person. They were excluded from the main town, got killed etc. just because the bloodline differed the humane. In real life, we should never judge people just by their appeareance. Always judge them from their personality because the skin color still does not show the personality. (even though a lot of people still fishing for it. but then again, we still shouldnt put everyone from one race in a box just because there are negative examples from them. Look at Obama and Trump. Two different people with different intentions and guess what skincolor they have.)",

First thing to note is, this is definitely a loli-themed heavy harem heaven for anyone who enjoys such genre, unfortunately I am not one of them.\r\nThe story started out interestingly enough, with enough subplots to keep you coming back for more. However, the anime progression loses steam around episode 4 or 5, and some of those subplots are never fully explained in the end.\r\nFor all the lack of development on the other subplots, one might think that it is due to the short series of the anime,but in reality there was just too much distractions: there were two episodes where the anime did not progressed and trivial banter was included.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of a proper structure for the anime, combined with a lack of a cohesive story ultimately make this anime fall short of being what it could have been, a dystopian anime with elements of mystery, action, comedy and harem packed nicely into one.",

I want to see something NEW and exciting! Something original. Black Bullet was not original. The typical Post Apocalyptic setting and having your parents brutally killed. Etc. The story was rushed. One thing I hate are anime's with only 13 episodes yet they're not executed properly. If you know the story is too long for 13 episodes do not try to squeeze it inbecause it only ends up rushed in the ending. An example of this is Charlotte which I wouldn't recommend anyone going to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:5/10\\n\r\nSome may say I'm so evillllll. Why would you give Black Bullet's art 5/10?!!\\n\r\nWhy do you ask??\\n\\n\r\nBecause of Kisara's hair. \\n\\n\r\nThis girl looked like she had straw on her hair it was ugly, very ugly. In addition to this Rentaro's body?? Why is his waist smaller than mine?? For this I had to mark the art down. As shallow as my reasons may be but hey, this is my review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI feel the Ost was extremely repeated, I didn't enjoy the Opening.

I mean that I did love the anime at the first sight and try to think how big and impacted it will turn out.\r\nBut hey man, it kept hurting me and killing all my hope and love for it. I gave the story a 7, because the story's potential and it deserves to be developed much more and to be showed in a smarter way. I don't know if the author ruined it or the producer. If I have to say about BB's bad point it must take more than1000 words, so I just wan to say how potential it is:\\n\r\n- A lot of seemed interesting characters, esp The Blind Girl and Satomi. I can imagine a wonderful story which would be a tearjerker that The Blind can bring, but they did not do anything. If my English is better, I would write a fic about her.\\n\\n\r\n- All the technology, weapons and system. They sound so interesting. However, they're named, introduced but played no massive part at all.

From the fast-paced (in most cases too fast) action scenes, to the heartfelt, altruistic, complex the main character has, it was easy for me to get absorbed into this fantasy world created by Kinema Citrus, and Orange. \r\nHowever, the show really falls flat(er than Enju) on it's face, and really disappointingly so. \r\nStory: There's already a synopsis, but basically it's like this:\r\nA dude fed up with the corrupt society he was born into (not much of a spoiler, it's apparent right off the bat) attempts to restructure his city inside-out,by climbing the corporate ladder. And with the help and support of his loli-harem, and outrageously good fortune, like unbelievably god-like good luck, he will do whatever the hell he pleases to bop-bop-bop, to the top. Dattebayo. ...Oh, also, there are other people there and they do stuff. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem I have with this series, and I rated it a 6 instead of a 7 or an 8, is similar to the reason I couldn't truly appreciate Charlotte. To avoid rambling, I'll just make a simple comparison between the two: both felt aggressively rushed. If it wasn't the introduction of characters whose significance piqued without foreshadowing, and waned without cause. It was key fights ridden with contrived plot devices, to give an immediate resolution to fit within the 13 episode limit. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend watching? Yes, but with a warning. Prepare to be dragged along, and try to accept things are they are.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nPeople started turning into giant monsters. The world is in ruin, and the only thing stopping the monsters are gaint walls(which aren't connected) When the monster get through only a certain type of metal or little girls can kill them. This story is like Chromed Shelled Regios, while also being like Attack on Titan while for the most part just being cheesy and full of loli comedy.\r\nArt:\r\nDecent. Though nothing outstanding\r\nSound:\r\nThe english dub voice quality is terrible, God aweful at times decent in others. The is also a decent amount of swaring for an anime, aswell as crude 1 liners\r\n(such as I'll tear off your headand s@*t down your neck)\\n\r\nThe theme sound is a obvious a kind of clone of attack on titan's theme\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe MC creates a sort of Harem including 2 10 year old girls, 2 girls his age, and 1 milf doctor(along with a bunch of other little girls). The little girls are odd are in some ways they are kinda act like human pokemon. The characters (besides the little girls) are very generic. You got the big boobed girl who likes the MC. A crazy weird scientist, and Bad guys who either hate the world or want to control it. The first villian you see is easily the most interesting character in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWhile the story is obvious and simple, this anime is no Attack on Titan/Chromed Shelled Regios/Muv-Luv. (These are good end of humanity anime)Though the comedy in black bullet is decent. The first villian is a great interest and makes watching this anime worth it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nThis is one of those 1 timer animes it will be a decent watch but you'll never watch or really even think of it once its over. But hey if you want to see some blood, people getting eaten, and little girls fighting monsters, this anime is for you",
